1.1 SYNOPSIS  
 
Title: HearCARE: Hearing for Communication and Resident Engagement  
Contract Number: HL-2019C1-[ZIP_CODE]  
Study Description: An open cluster cohort stepped-wedge randomized design with a phased, 
randomized roll out will be employed to compare the Consult Model and the 
Engage Model of hearing and communication care for residents in Assisted 
Living Facilities. The Consult Model is present in every facility and baseline 
data (primary outcomes: Satisfaction with Social Participation and a Hearing-
Specific HRQoL measure) will be collected in each facility.  Every [ADDRESS_185331] the hypothesis of improving satisfaction with social participation 
and hearing -specific HRQoL.  
Objectives: 
 Amplification is a well-established, evidence-based front-line treatment for 
those with impaired communication secondary to Age Related Hearing Loss 
(ARHL) . The challenge in treating ARHL is identifying a care model that 
effectively promotes adherence to individualized-treatment recommendations 
allowing the end-user to self-manage hearing loss with appropriate support. 
This proposal compares the two most common models of care for ARHL 
(defined below) provided to adults in assisted living/personal care communities.  
Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of a Consult Model versus an Engage Model 
in improving satisfaction with participation in social activities for all residents.  
Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of a Consult Model versus an Engage Model 
of care in increasing hearing-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 
residents with measured hearing loss.  
Secondary Aims will explore the impact of interventions on staff satisfaction 
and family burden as well as other stakeholder prioritized outcomes.    
Endpoints: The end point for participants is the end of the study or if they are no longer 
residing in the facility.  
Study Population: 
Phase or Stage: Residents in Assisted Living/Personal Care Senior Living Facilities 
Phase 3 
Description of 
Sites/Facilities Enrolling 
Participants: Ten Assisted Living/Personal Care Facilities will be the sites involved in the 
study.    
Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation: The Consult Model (i.e., usual care) is an acute care strategy, relying on a 
monthly Audiologist visit to the facility.  
The Engage Model is a chronic care approach to supportive hearing loss self-
management of ARHL. Engage includes hearing screening for all residents, an 
individualized-communication plan for those with an identified hearing loss, 
provision of non-custom amplifiers, referral to audiology if needed, and 
ongoing support provided by [CONTACT_159544].  
The Consult Model is ongoing in the 10 facilities. Two facilities at a time 
(randomized) will cross over to The Engage Model.  
Study Duration: The study duration is 28 months from start of enrollment to end of data 
collection .

common models of care (defined below) for ARHL provided to adults in assisted living/personal care 
communities.  
The Consult Model (i.e., usual care) is an acute care strategy, relying on a monthly Audiologist visit to 
the facility.3–6 
The Engage Model is a chronic care approach to supportive hearing loss self-management of ARHL.7–13 
Engage includes (a) hearing screening for all residents, (b) an individualized communication plan for 
those with an identified hearing loss (e.g., one-to-one, group, telephone, television plans, hearing aid 
trouble shooting, communication strategies, etc.), (c) provision of simple, non-custom amplifiers, (d) 
referral to audiology if needed, and (e) ongoing support provided by [CONTACT_21724] (Communication 
Facilitator) under the supervision of the audiologist.  
Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of a Consult Model versus an Engage Model in improving satisfaction 
with participation in social activities for all residents.  
Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of a Consult Model versus an Engage Model in increasing hearing-

Secondary Aims will explore the impact of interventions on staff satisfaction and family burden as well 
as other stakeholder prioritized outcomes.    
 
 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
Untreated ARHL is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes including increased frailty,14,15 
falls,16,17 cognitive decline,18–20 depression,20 anxiety,21 and social isolation.22,23 The multiple health and 
social outcomes impacted by [CONTACT_159545] (QoL).24  
Importantly, treating hearing loss in older adults is associated with positive health and social outcomes 
including reduced risk of falling,25  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],26,27  incidence of depression,13,28,29 and anxiety30. 
Conversely, treatment also fosters increased social participation.31  Social participation is “a person’s 
involvement in activities that provide interaction with others in society or the community”32. Social 
participation is a critical determinant of healthy aging.33–36 
The  audiology consult (i.e., acute-care) model is the most common approach to hearing care in Senior 
Living Facilities.3–6  This Consult Model  increases physical accessibility by [CONTACT_159546] a monthly basis.  Yet, this approach does not address the chronic nature of ARHL or the need for

 9 ongoing support to manage technology and the communication environment. An alternative strategy 
(Engage Model ) that has shown promise in Senior Living Communities7–10,[ADDRESS_185333] but is supplemented by a trained Communication Facilitator (CF) who is available  
weekly to assist the residents and staff. Assistance provided by [CONTACT_159547], troubleshooting technology, dispensing non-custom amplifiers, fostering group 
communication, and addressing environmental manipulations ( RQ-5). The Baltimore HEARS study 
provided a prospective randomized-controlled trial (RCT) designed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, 
and preliminary efficacy of a hearing intervention including simple amplifiers and ongoing support by 
[CONTACT_159548] a community-based environment.  Although the study included a small number of participants, 
results indicated that the program was acceptable, 93% benefited, and 100% would recommend the 
program to others.[ADDRESS_185334] evaluating the Active Communication Education (ACE) program, a chronic 
care approach, for ARHL  found  improved hearing-specific HRQoL and increased social participation.[ADDRESS_185335] the resident, family, staff, and organization in decision making related 
to desired hearing care ( RQ-3).  
Ferguson et al’s Cochrane Database Systematic Review confirmed that amplification is the evidence-
based treatment for those seeking hearing help.1 The dilemma lies in which model of care will identify 
those individuals in need of help and provide the needed support to promote successful adherence to 
individualized-treatment recommendations allowing the end-user to participate in self-management of 
the chronic condition of   ARHL. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association’s Ad Hoc 
Committee on Audiology Service Delivery in Home Care and Institutional Settings provides guidance for 
hearing care supplemented by [CONTACT_159549].  The Assisted Living Guidelines in the State of Pennsylvania (consistent with other states) indicate 
that hearing status should be documented ( section 2800.252, 2800.224 ) as part of resident intake, that 
the need for communication support services should be identified ( section 2800.4, 2800.130 ), and that 
self-management of communication issues should be promoted ( section 2800.201 ). Currently, there are 
no data available to inform an individual managing an Assisted Living Facility as to what intervention 
would be effective and bring them into compliance with these guidelines. (Criterion 1. Potential for the 
Study to fill critical gaps in evidence)

Pure Tone Hearing Survey, a Hearing Specific Health Related Quality of Life Survey (Hearing Handicap 
Inventory for the Elderly, HHIE), and the Satisfaction with Participation in Discretionary Social Activities- 
Short Form 7a) for residents. Family members are completing the Zarit Burden Interview modified 4 
question v.1 via mail or weblink and Facility Staff are completing the Michigan Organizational Assessment 
Questionnaire (MOAQ).   
 
The research measures do not carry inherent risks. The researchers will be sensitive to the possibility of 
individuals being embarrassed by [CONTACT_159550]. We 
will attempt to minimize any sense of intrusion given that we are entering the residents’ home (facility) 
to conduct this research. We also will be sensitive to staff burden related to a research study being 
performed in their place of work. In addition, we will try to minimize burden on families who we will ask 
to respond to surveys as well.  
The Consult and Engage Interventions are standard of care at UPMC and are not included in the IRB 
research activities. These activities also provide minimal risk.  Any risk would be managed by [CONTACT_159551].  
There are several mechanisms to inform residents, families and staff about the research and related 
services which we hope will alleviate confusion and stress related to introducing the intervention under 
investigation. We will work with the managing staff at the [ADDRESS_185336] to minimize 
disruption.  
 
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
In 2019, older adults account for 17% of the US population and this is expected to grow to 24% by 
2060.[ADDRESS_185337] hearing loss46 and few use the treatment 
shown to mitigate ARHL.47 With over 800,000 older individuals residing in assisted living/personal care 
facilities and an estimated 8 million living in some type of long-term care facility,48 senior living 
communities are an important population in terms of hearing loss intervention. Increasingly, older 
adults are finding senior communities an appropriate living arrangement as they may need increased 
care and desire increased social participation.  However, the overwhelming presence of untreated 
hearing loss compromises social participation22,49–51 as well as contributing to poor health outcomes.31,52–
56  Healthy People 201057 and Healthy People 202057,58 included “increase the proportion of adults with 
disabilities who participate in social activities as a goal.” Increased social participation is a common goal 
in senior living facilities. Untreated hearing loss presents a barrier to achieving this goal for the 
individuals with hearing loss and the individuals with whom they interact. Health and social 
interventions should focus on prevention, delay, and reversal of risk factors associated with reduced 
social participation.[ADDRESS_185338] interventions targeted at improving hearing and 
communication to enhance QoL and increase residents’ satisfaction with social participation ( RQ-3). This 
is a group with a high incidence of hearing loss, a location where interventions can be controlled and are 
easily accessible, and an environment where social participation opportunities are consistently offered 
(PC-1).

improving their QoL as well (SCI-1). Changes in these groups potentially impact interactions with staff 
and family and improved family interactions may impact relationships with staff. It is not the goal of this 
project to tease out which components of this complex intervention produce the desired outcomes, but 
it is critical to understand and acknowledge the complexity of the intervention being delivered.  The 
underlying mechanism of change when hearing loss is managed in an aging individual is critical to 
understanding this complex intervention.  Emerging evidence suggests that the underlying mechanism 
related to positive outcomes subsequent to treating age-related hearing loss is the reduction in 
cognitive energy required to communicate and participate67–71 (SCI-2). Diminished hearing produces 
increased cognitive load required to decode the incomplete or distorted signal which the older adult 
may ill afford given their need for cognitive resources for other activities (e.g., navigating the 
environment, interpreting the conversation, etc.) ( SCI-5). The cascade hypothesis suggests that the 
untreated hearing loss increases need for cognitive resources that cannot be allocated for other, 
important activities whereas treating hearing loss releases these cognitive resources allowing for social 
engagement which in turn improves quality of life for the individual and communication partners72 (CI-
1).

 13 Comparators:   The typi[INVESTIGATOR_159504] a self-selected subset of individuals 
working with an audiologist to obtain hearing aids.47  We label this the Consult Model and it represents 
usual care provided in senior living facilities3–6.  Age-related hearing loss, however, is a chronic condition 
and may be better served with an ongoing self-management support model (Engage Model)8–10,74 
supported by a CF who is available to the resident, family, and staff on a weekly basis (two days per 
week) along with oversight and support from an audiologist who is available virtually to the CF and 
available to the facility monthly ( RQ-5).  
Expected Outcomes: We hypothesize that Engage Model participants will have significantly greater 
satisfaction with participation in social activities across residents regardless of hearing status and an 
increase in hearing-specific HRQoL in residents with hearing loss compared to those receiving the 
Consult Model.  Additionally, we expect to find higher staff satisfaction and lower perceived family 
burden after stakeholders have experienced the Engage Model as compared to the Consult Model.  
Study Deign:  We propose an open cohort stepped-wedge cluster randomized design (see Table below, 
CI-3) with a phased, randomized roll out ( RQ-2). The stepped wedge design is a useful design for the 
evaluation of complex health care interventions75 particularly when the intervention is believed to be 
beneficial with minimal risk.76 This design is increasingly being used to evaluate interventions involving 
health care delivery and has several advantages: (1) allowing the research team and clinical teams to roll 
out the intervention in a small number of facilities in a timely, systematic manner77; (2) possibly 
increasing participation and buy-in since all facilities will eventually implement the intervention during 
the study,75,78,79 (3) possible increase in statistical power compared to a cluster randomized trial due to 
increase in data collection and within cluster comparisons.75 Our intervention is applied at the facility 
level (cluster) but the primary outcomes are obtained at the resident level ( RC-1). In this open cohort 
design, all residents in a facility are identified to participate but some may leave the facility and others 
will move into the facility over the course of the study.80  (Criterion 3. Scientific merit)  
Five pairs of 10 facilities will be assigned the intervention (Engage Model, gray cells) randomly over the 
course of [ADDRESS_185341] 4 months used as a baseline period (total data collection period is 28 
months).[ADDRESS_185342]. This implies that 
crossover to the intervention is not only at the facility level but also the resident level.75 Once the 
intervention is available at a facility, residents will be exposed to the intervention continuously. The 
resident level outcomes of satisfaction with social participation and hearing-specific HRQoL will be 
measured every 5 months for the duration of the study.

The order of this cross over process will be randomized.  We will  randomize 2 facilities to switch from 
the control to intervention at each step using SAS version 9.4 ( RC-5). The statistician will communicate 
the sequence to the Study Team for intervention implementation preparation ( IR-2).  If the expected 
number of individuals across the 10 facilities are not recruited in a timely manner we will expand to 
other Assisted Living/Personal Care Facilities at UPMC.  Triggers for expanded recruitment will include 1) 
lower census in the building than targeted (10% lower than expected) and/or 2) inability to meet 
enrollment milestones over two check points as outlined on the Milestone chart.

 15 4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
 
We considered several other designs including individual randomized parallel arm, cluster randomized 
parallel arm, and cluster randomized cross-over. We believe the individual randomized design would not 
be feasible to implement in a facility due to the high likelihood of intervention contamination between 
residents randomized to the intervention arm and those randomized to control ( RC-2). The cluster 
randomized parallel arm trial did not fit with our assumption and observations that the intervention will 
benefit all residents. Therefore, randomizing facilities to control did not seem appropriate and would 
not bode well with our facility collaborators. The standard cluster randomized trial also had much lower 
power given the number of clusters available. Due to the type of intervention, a cluster randomized 
crossover trial would not be feasible since we would have to take away the facilitator from facilities that 
were randomized to have it first and there may be large carryover effects of having the facilitator in 
place previously.   
An open cohort stepped-wedge cluster randomized design with a phased, randomized roll out was used 
by [CONTACT_159553] (2013)82 successfully in a skilled nursing facility with interventions related to 
depression. Our design is consistent with that study.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION 
 
A systematic review of interventions to improve hearing aid use found that ongoing communication 
support improves participation and communication ( SR-1).7  Yet, the authors also concluded that data in 
this area are limited and that well-controlled studies directly comparing usual care (audiology visit) 
versus a model of care that includes ongoing communication support are needed ( RQ-1). Given the 
paucity of data to guide informed choices between the Consult and Engage Model, we conducted two 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_159505] & Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159506].39,[ADDRESS_185344] pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we created the support 
personnel training program, engaged stakeholders to identify outcomes of importance, and tested the 
feasibility of providing interventions and measuring these outcomes.41 Residents and family 
stakeholders identified increased social participation and perceived decrease in limitations due to 
hearing loss as critical outcomes ( PC-1). Participants were able to respond to questionnaires focused on 
these two areas (85% of residents completed the study). Significant change was measured on both 
primary outcomes within 4 months when an Engage Model was implemented as compared to a control 
group with the Consult Model ( CI-3). The second study revealed that 84% of residents in Assisted 
Living/Personal Care had significant hearing loss with less than 5% using personal amplification.  Only 
56% of individuals with significant hearing loss accurately self-identified that they had hearing loss and 
less than 50% of health care providers accurately identified significant hearing loss in individuals with 
hearing loss. Interestingly, 63% of residents with measured hearing loss whether they had self-identified 
hearing loss or not accepted a non-custom amplifier.

5 STUDY POPULATION 
 
All residents in the 10 Assisted Living Facilities will be eligible to participate in the study. Every resident 
will be approached to participate.  Residents who agree to be enrolled will participate in the Pure Tone 
Hearing Survey and the two questionnaires.  All residents, regardless of enrollment in the study will be 
exposed to the intervention (Engage Model) because this intervention happens at both the individual and 
facility level.

 17  
One Family member for each resident will be invited to participate in the study. They will receive a link to 
an electronic version of the survey or will be mailed a paper version of the study with a self-addressed 
stamped envelope for return depending on their preference.  
 
All Staff working in the facility will receive a paper version of the Job Satisfaction Survey so they can 
participate in the study.  
 
5.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA

5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS 
 
N/A 
 
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES 
 
Residents unable to communicate in English or unable to respond to the hearing survey or the 
questionnaires because of cognitive challenges will be considered ineligible.  All family members and staff 
are included.  
 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185349] similar demographics of residents (age range, education, family caregivers, 
etc.), similar staff positions, years of experience, and responsibilities, similar physical layout, and 
similar week-to-week programming. This allows us to achieve the number of participants we 
need to complete the proposed intervention study. This coordinated system at UPMC also 
ensures that if there are any changes implemented in Senior Living during the investigation, they 
will be implemented across all facilities. For the three non-UPMC facilities, we will monitor any 
changes that might occur in these locations. The facilities also are geographically close to the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159507] (resident survey completion) practical. 
 
b. Facility Retention 
Sites that start the study are anticipated to complete the entire study and continue to 
participate for the full duration of the study. Throughout the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Palmer will continue to 
maintain relationships with the Directors at each facility and be in communication with them 
regarding recruitment/research activities and to answer any questions/concerns the site may 
have. The Data Survey Coordinator, Jon Rivera, will be in monthly contact [CONTACT_159555].  
c. Resident, Family, and Staff Recruitment 
Flyers and advertising on the Facility televisions will be used to introduce the study to residents, 
staff, and families.  Residents will be individually introduced to Data Collectors by [CONTACT_159556]. This method was recommended by [CONTACT_159557].  In each 
facility, we will work with directors to provide surveys to staff through the mechanism deemed 
most appropriate (paper left in an area where staff receive notifications, direct interaction with 
Data Survey Coordinator, and/or email).  This approach was recommended by [CONTACT_159558].  We will work with the facility directors to contact [CONTACT_159559].  
In addition, the mechanisms for providing information described above as well as 
resident/family meetings will be used to introduce the Engage Model (intervention) into the 
facility. Families also will receive descriptions of the study and later the Engage Model by [CONTACT_159560]. The Engage Model is an intervention at the Facility and 
Individual Level so all residents, staff, and families are exposed whether they have enrolled in 
the study or not. This care is provided as part of UPMC Senior Living care and is extended to the 
three non-UPMC facilities. The Consult Model is already present at all facilities at the beginning 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;30 Dec 2021  
 
Based on NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 
 19 of the study.  This is an ongoing intervention that was started 5 years ago. At the time of 
introduction, the same techniques as listed above were used to inform residents, families, and 
staff about the program.  The Consult Model continues to be promoted through flyers and 
electronic media (TV screens) in facilities.  In addition, all new residents are provided about the 
access to an Audiologist that the Consult Model provides.  
 
d. Resident, Family, and Staff Retention 
We will work with the staff at each facility to recruit as many residents as possible into the 
study. Because this is being conducted in the facility where they live, it is easy to participate and 
the interventions will be woven into everyday life in addition to individual hearing solutions. Just 
prior to enrollment of each group, we will conduct informational sessions introducing the 
Engage Model for residents, families, and staff to ensure understanding of the program, how to 
access resources, and who to contact [CONTACT_38450]. Our preliminary data in three facilities 
indicate that approximately 85% of residents will participate in completing the outcome 
measures. The intervention includes support from the CF (two days per week) which will help 
keep residents engaged in this study. Adequate personnel are budgeted to ensure that residents 
who need assistance will have someone to help them complete surveys ( PC-2).  
Based on suggestions from our Stakeholder Advisory Panel (SAP), residents will be provided with 
a small gift (e.g., water bottle and other useful items) after each data collection session (every 5 
months). The item will be labeled with the study name [CONTACT_159598]’s friends to ask 
about the study and perhaps increase interest in participating.  The Data Collector will leave a 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159508] a log with the date of the visit along with a 
note about what they talked about (e.g., resident told the Data Collector about grandchildren, 
family, facility activities).  The date of the next visit will be recorded as well. This serves the 
purpose of reminding the resident of the study and the date the Data Collector will return. This 
also provides information for a family member who may be interested in their loved one’s 
interactions.  In the 5-month period between data collection visits, the Data Collector will send 3 
notes to say “hello” to the resident and remind them of the study. The SAP thought that this 
was important given the 5-month period between visits.  
 
e. Total target sample size for primary analysis 
Target sample size is 304 residents for the primary analysis. This has changed from the original 
proposal due to decrease in census and higher decline rate than predicted from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
This represents 60% of the total census (approximately 30 individual per site is the minimum 
goal).  
Target sample size for families is 178.  This has changed from the original proposal because 
census and resident enrollment targets have changed. The percent of families enrolled in 
relation to residents enrolled has not changed; this remains at 58%.

g. Estimated yield/consent 
 
Residents: 
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_159509] 85% of residents will agree to or be available 
to participate in the study measures (Pure Tone Hearing Survey, Hearing Specific Health Related 
Quality of Life Questionnaire and Satisfaction with Participation Questionnaire).  After starting 
baseline data collection, it became evident that both the Census and the rate of decline has 
changed from when we completed the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. We adjusted the study to accommodate 
these changes by [CONTACT_159561] a data collection time point. Census across 
the [ADDRESS_185351] planned the study around 
collecting data from 304.  
 
Families: 
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_159510] 58% of family members (compared to enrolled 
residents) to participate in the survey that will be sent to them.  
 
Staff:  
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_159510] 90% of the staff in each facility to participate in the 
survey that will be sent to them.  
 
h. Estimated lost to follow-up/attrition 
 
Residents: 
The updated 60% yield accounts for individuals who decline to participate and individuals who 
may move or otherwise no longer be in one of the facilities. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], no residents 
dropped out of the study unless they were no longer in the facility. Individuals will move into 
the facilities over the three years and the study design accounts for including these individuals 
regardless of the timing of their entry into the study.  
 
Family Members: In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 58% of families participated and 0 dropped out (this was 
58% of the resident enrollment).  With this study extending over [ADDRESS_185352] a family member in a facility who will stop participating.  New families will 
be included as new residents move into the facilities.  
 
Staff Members:  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 2% of staff dropped out over time because they changed 
positions and moved to different facilities. We will collect surveys on any new staff who join the 
facility over the time period of the study.

oversight and support from an audiologist who is available virtually to the CF and available to the facility 
monthly ( RQ-5).  
The Consult Model (i.e., usual care) is an acute care strategy, relying on a monthly Audiologist visit to 
the facility.3–6 
The Engage Model is a chronic care approach to supportive hearing loss self-management of ARHL.7–13 
Engage includes (a) hearing screening for all residents, (b) an individualized communication plan for 
those with an identified hearing loss (e.g., one-to-one, group, telephone, television plans, hearing aid 
trouble shooting, communication strategies, etc.), (c) provision of simple, non-custom amplifiers, (d) 
referral to audiology if needed, and (e) ongoing support provided by [CONTACT_21724] (Communication 
Facilitator) under the supervision of the audiologist.  
The Communication Facilitators are provided with standardized training at UPMC to provide consistent 
hearing care to residents in Senior Living Facilities. The training manual is uploaded as a separate 
document.  
 
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING 
 
The Consult Model of care consists of an Audiologist visiting the facility once per month.  This is considered 
usual care and is in place in all of UPMC Senior Living Communities.  
 
The Engage Model is the intervention under study. The following description provides support for the 
dose of two visits per week per facility when in the Engage Model.  
The Communication Facilitator was present 5 days per week in the original pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (1 year).  During 
that time, Hearing Specific Health Related Quality of Life as measured by [CONTACT_159562]- short version (HHIE-S) was assessed pre- and post-treatment (after [ADDRESS_185354] in each of two facilities).  There were two arms in the study, one facility with the Engage Model 
and one facility with the Consult Model. Data were analyzed for those residents completing the HHIE 
with a resulting baseline score of >[ADDRESS_185355].  In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], identifying information was not collected so individual participant changes cannot be assessed; 
only mean data can be evaluated (the same individuals completed the pre- and post-test).  Planned t-
tests were used to test significant differences between groups and between time points within groups.  
A Bonferroni correction was applied given the multiple comparisons (p<0.05/4 = 0.0125 was considered 
significant). The first two rows of data in Figure [ADDRESS_185356]-treatment (4 months) for the group in the Engage Model (p 
<0.0125) whereas there was no difference for the group in the Consult Model (p > 0.0125). In addition, 
the Engage group had significantly lower self-perceived hearing handicap 4 months into treatment than 
the Consult group (p< 0.0125). The 95% confidence interval for the HHIE-S is 10%1 meaning an individual 
would experience clinically significant benefit in the psychosocial domain of function given this change. 
The group experiencing the Engage Model experienced >10% change in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_159511]  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185357] row in the Figure below 
reveals that the reduction in 
handicap (increase in Hearing 
Specific HR QoL) was 
maintained six months after 
the reduction in CF support (no 
significant difference between 
the 4-month treatment data 
with CF 5x per week versus 6 
months of treatment with the 
CF 2x per week, p>0.0125). 
This allowed us to continue the 
Engage Model with the CF 
present 2X per week which is 
what we are proposing in the 
current study.

two visits per week.  Higher scores indicate greater perceived hearing handicap. Significant differences 
are indicated by *.  
 
Satisfaction with participation in discretionary social activities as measured by [CONTACT_159563]7a also 
was assessed pre- and post-treatment (after [ADDRESS_185359] in each of two facilities).  
Data were assessed for all willing participants in these two facilities. The same group of individuals were 
assessed at baseline and at 4 months but identifying data were not collected so individual changes 
cannot be assessed; only group differences can be analyzed and discussed. The first two rows of data in 
Figure [ADDRESS_185360] deviations for each group across time points. Planned t-tests 
were completed to compare the groups at each time point and to compare time points within each 
group. There was a statistically significant difference after initiation of treatment for the Engage Model 
(p< 0.0125) but no difference for the Consult Model at the 4-month time point (p>0.0125).  In addition, 
the Engage Group was more satisfied after 4 months than the Consult Group (higher scores indicate

 25 greater satisfaction, p<0.0125). The PROMIS scales provide data on “minimally important differences” 
(MID) which are interpreted as “the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest which patients 
perceive as beneficial and which would mandate a change in the patient’s management”.2,3 A change of 
4.5 is considered a minimally important difference on this measure and although we cannot provide 
individual changes because identifying information was not collected, as a group the individuals 
experiencing the Engage Model did achieve this difference in Satisfaction in Participation (higher scores 
indicating greater satisfaction).  
 
After moving to the 2x per week CF dose, we resurveyed Satisfaction in Participation at the 6-month 
time point (same timing as the HHIE-S data collection) and found that the increase in Satisfaction with 
Participation was maintained. The last row in the Figure below reveals that the increase in satisfaction 
was maintained six 
months after the 
reduction in CF 
support (no significant 
difference between 
the 4-month 
treatment data with 
CF 5x per week versus 
6 months of treatment 
with the CF 2x per 
week, p>0.0125). This 
provided further 
evidence to support 
continuation of the 
Engage Model with the 
CF present 2X per 
week.

6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING 
The study is randomized at the facility level with pairs of facilities randomized to cross over to the 
intervention. Pairing is not random, rather pairing will be conducted to have comparable N across pairs.  
The Data Entry System (REDCap) and Database will be constructed in a manner that will not allow the 
DCs to determine what intervention is currently present in the building (Consult Model or Engage 
Model). The DCs will be blinded in this manner but may be unintentionally unblinded by [CONTACT_159566]. The research team does not anticipate needing to unblind data 
collectors at any point however if necessary, to unblind will be the decision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_159512]. The research team is not blinded due to the need to work with the Data 
Coordinating Center to implement the Engage Model across the study. 
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159513] 
(DCC) under the direction of [CONTACT_159599] ( IR-7). We will use an electronic data capture (EDC) system 
which will be built around standardized case report forms. The system will have additional applications

 28 including participant tracking, file uploads, and reporting. The electronic data management system will 
allow the trial to be paperless, as all data will be input directly by [CONTACT_159567] a secure web-
based system. Data will be collected on facilities, staff, residents and family members with linkage 
through unique, study specific identifiers. For residents, the data collected are minimal: demographics, 
hearing test results, use of hearing devices, satisfaction with social participation, hearing- specific 
HRQoL, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and change in status such as moving or death. The data core analysts will be 
blinded to condition ( IR-6).

7 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DISCONTINUATION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 
 
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION 
The Engage Intervention is both at the Facility and Individual level.  It is care that is provided through 
UPMC Assisted Living and therefore the resident will be exposed whether enrolled in the study (research 
measures) or not. The most common reason for a resident to discontinue any level of intervention will be 
that the resident no longer lives in the building. This also would be the reason for a family member to stop 
participating. The most common reason for staff to stop participating in the intervention would be 
relocation of his/her job. All data collected to this point will be used in the analysis.  
 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY 
Residents 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the 
DCDemographicsBaseline1 (Time1, Time 2, Time 3, Time 4, Time 5) Case Report Form (CRF). All new 
residents entering the facility during the study will be invited to enroll.  
 
Reasons for discontinuation or withdrawal:

HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185364] TO FOLLOW-UP 
 
Missing data prevention and analysis plan: To minimize missing data, we will create a tracking system 
with reminders in the electronic data capture system that will prompt research staff as to which 
residents are due for follow-up ( MD-1). If the resident is temporarily unavailable, e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
visiting family, the research staff member will document the reason for the missing survey and make 
multiple attempts to follow up with the individual ( IR-7). We will continue to attempt to collect data 
throughout the 7-[ADDRESS_185365] 85% of the participating residents, based on 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]. We will compare baseline characteristics (e.g., age, hearing loss, original responses to 
surveys of hearing and satisfaction in participation, sex, race, ethnicity, date entered facility) between 
residents with any missing follow-up to those without to assess potential biases. We will try to obtain 
reasons for missed assessments so that we can assess the missing data mechanism ( MD-3). Missed 
assessments are captured in the REDCap survey when a staff member or resident can tell us why data 
was not collected (e.g., the resident is out of the facility due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159515], 
resident does not want to participate on this day, etc.). The linear mixed models proposed for the 
analyses assume missing data at random ( MD-2) and perform as well as multiple imputation given the 
same assumption of the missing data mechanism. We will conduct sensitivity analyses ( MD-4) assuming 
non-ignorable missingness with differential imputation of poor scores and pattern mixture models ( MD-
2). We will compare the results from the sensitivity analyses to our primary analyses to assess the 
robustness of findings. 
  
As a way to explore the issue of attrition and inclusion of residents after baseline, we propose a 
sensitivity analysis as was done in a similarly designed open cohort stepped wedge trial for depression 
management in nursing homes (82). We will use two dummy variables for newcomers and non-
completers (lost to follow up, died, relocated) and interactions between these variables and the 
intervention to see if the intervention effect is different for these subgroups of residents. 
 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
 
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON-SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 
The set of research measures will be conducted at Baseline 1, , Time 1, Time 2, Time 3, Time 4, and Time 
5 (see the Schedule of Activities in section 3.1) for residents, families, and staff.  The MOP has all of the 
CRFs in the appendices.   
 
Residents:  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_159568]. Training will include: 
 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185366] 
sanitation guidelines related to clinical interactions. These same guidelines will be followed in 
resident interactions to ensure safety. Training of the DC’s will include:  
 Virtual audiometer simulation to ensure accuracy in completing Pure Tone Hearing 
Surveys.  Adequate accuracy is defined as establishing thresholds within +/- 5 dB from 
the target air conduction threshold across four frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) 
in [ADDRESS_185367] a variety of patient response types to 
mimic what the DC’s will experience on site.  
 Pure tone hearing surveys on 5 classmates will allow for practice with equipment 
placement and testing in a real environment (rather than simulated). 
 The DSC will train the DC’s in the use of the iPad interface with the REDCap data 
collection system. The DC’s will collect practice data on two individuals using the 
interface.  Data includes consent, demographics, and two surveys (Hearing Specific 
Health Related Quality of Life and Satisfaction with Social Participation).  
 Practice interviewing will be completed through role playing with [CONTACT_159600] to ensure 
that DC’s are ready to handle a variety of situations that may present themselves while 
interacting with older adults in Assisted Living environments. Interviewers will be 
instructed on methods for determining if a participant becomes distressed during an 
interview.  If this situation occurs, the interviewer will be trained to temporarily 
discontinue the interview and ask the participant if they wish to terminate the interview 
and/or to resume at a later time. 
 The DSC will coordinate all site-specific training for the DC’s.  
Measures include:

Zarit Burden Interview -modified 4 question v. 1.0 
CRFs for this form is found in the Appendix of the MOP.  
 
Staff:  
The DSC will provide paper surveys to the Staff based on the lack of use of email accounts at these 
locations. 
Measure includes: 
Michigan Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (MOAQ) 
CRFs for these forms are found in the Appendix of the MOP.  
 
No results from the Pure Tone Hearing Survey or the questionnaires for any group will be shared 
with participants. If a resident is concerned about their hearing, they will be encouraged to see the 
Audiologist who comes to the facility once per month.  This service is always available to them.  
Intervention Data 
The CF and Audiologist routinely track data for QA and QI as part of their work at UPMC. These data 
will be used to track the intervention at the individual and facility level. The activities of the CF 
(described in detail in the MOP) will be recorded in the REDCap database which will allow the Data 
Survey Coordinator (DSC) to view reports of missing data for each visit. The DSC will follow up with 
Elizabeth Dervin (UPMC Communication Facilitator on the Stakeholder Advisory Panel) if there are 
missing data on a consistent basis so she can provide re-training to the CF. The Audiologist sees 
scheduled patients during the monthly audiology visits. We will collect number of visits per facility 
to track consistency and again, will follow up with the audiologist if there are discrepancies between 
facilities.  
CRFs for the Engage and Consult Model are found in the Appendix of the MOP.  
Data related to the complex intervention core functions and forms will be collected and are outlined 
in the table below.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185370] AE definitions are used:  
Adverse event: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure, regardless 
of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. 
Serious Adverse Event: Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 • Death 
 • Life-threatening 
 • Event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
There is no expectation of serious adverse events related to the research study. The research measures 
include a Pure Tone Hearing Survey and questionnaires.  There is no expectation of a serious adverse 
event related to the intervention which includes typi[INVESTIGATOR_159516].  
 
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
[IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT 
 
AEs will be collected and entered into the electronic data capture system.  
AEs are graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) according to the 
following scale: 
Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated. An experience that is transient and requires no special treatment or 
intervention. The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities. This 
includes transient laboratory test alterations.  
Moderate : Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate 
instrumental ADL. An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. The 
experience impacts usual daily activities. Includes laboratory test alterations indicating injury, 
but without long-term risk.  
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;30 Dec 2021  
 
Based on NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 
 38 Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self-care Activities of Daily 
Living (ADL). An experience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts 
usual daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for 
treatment it becomes a SAE.  
Life-threatening: Urgent intervention indicated 
Fatal/Death: Death related to AE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION 
 
The study uses the following AE attribution scale:  
Unrelated : The AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the 
event is most plausible, and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with 
the onset of the event).   
Unlikely: The AE is likely not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the event 
is plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of 
the event) but causality cannot be clearly ruled out.   
Reasonable Possibility : An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the 
initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of 
other factors.   
Definite: The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.   
AEs are identified through the Data Collectors who will be interacting with residents in the 
facilities.  For Staff and Families, there is no direct interaction because they will be responding to 
surveys through mail or web link.  
All SAEs and AEs will be recorded in the electronic data capture system immediately upon 
notification of the occurrence of the SAE or AE. If the event is deemed reportable (serious, 
unanticipated, and related), the AE will be reported per the IRB AE reporting.  
SAEs and AEs related to study measures (considered very unlikely) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_159571]. SAEs and AEs related to the intervention (considered 
very unlikely) will be reviewed by a licensed audiologist and UPMC risk manager for resolution.

HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185371] with appropriate expertise in hearing care will be responsible for determining whether an 
adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected related to the intervention. An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previously described for the study procedures. This is a minimal risk study with no expected risks to 
participants.  
 
8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP 
 
All SAEs and AEs will be recorded in the electronic data capture system immediately upon notification of 
the occurrence of the SAE or AE. DCs will be responsible for recording this information. In addition, the 
DC will alert the DSC who will notify the PI. If the event is deemed reportable (serious, unanticipated, and 
related), the AE will be reported per the IRB AE reporting.  
 
8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
The study team does not anticipate any AEs due to the nature of the research activities. All AEs will be 
recorded in the electronic data capture system immediately upon notification of the occurrence of the 
SAE or AE. If the event is deemed reportable (serious, unanticipated, and related), the AE will be reported 
per the IRB AE reporting guidelines.  
The Consult and Engage Interventions are care provided by [CONTACT_159572]. If there are Adverse Events related to these models of care, this would be reported in 
UPMC Risk Master and handled through UPMC protocols for adverse events related to clinical care.  
Management of any AEs will be managed on a case-by-case basis and will be coordinated with the care 
team at the resident’s facility if needed.  AEs will be reported to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159517] [ADDRESS_185372] learns of 
the event.

participation in social activities across residents regardless of hearing status compared to those 
receiving the Consult Model. 
Ho 
There will be no difference in satisfaction with participation between participants in the Engage and 
Consult Model.

We hypothesize that Engage Model staff will have higher job satisfaction compared to staff in the 
Consult Model.  
Ho 
There will be no difference in job satisfaction between staff in the Engage and Consult Model.  
H1 
We hypothesize that Engage Model family members will have reduced burden compared to staff in 
the Consult Model.  
Ho 
There will be no difference in family burden between staff in the Engage and Consult Model.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION 
 
We used a method to estimate sample size that takes into account the cluster  
randomization, the stepped wedge design, and the longitudinal data on residents84 (RC-3). Our study 
design originally included 8 clusters (facilities) with 5 time periods (including the baseline), 4 steps, 2 
facilities switching from control to intervention at each step, and an average of 65 residents per facility 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;30 Dec 2021  
 
Based on NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 
 42 being continuously followed ( CI-2). We expect some residents to leave the facility for different reasons 
and our design will allow new residents to contribute data from the time of moving into the facility until 
the end of the study period. We conducted sample size analyses accounting for intracluster correlation 
(=0.20) (RC-3), individual autocorrelation ( =0.5), and cluster autocorrelation ( =0.9)84. The intracluster 
correlation  is a measure of correlation among residents measured at the same facility within the same 
time frame. Cluster randomized trials typi[INVESTIGATOR_159521] 0.01-0.10 with higher values 
indicating more similarity in outcomes within clusters such as schools, primary care clinics, or providers. 
We assumed a higher correlation given that residents are living within the same quarters and sharing 
the same residential experience. The individual autocorrelation  is the correlation between any two 
measures within the same resident over time. We conservatively assumed this to be 0.5 as a lower 
bound because repeated measures within person are often highly correlated. The cluster 
autocorrelation  is the correlation between two population means from the same cluster at different 
times. We assumed this would be very high (0.9) given the stability of the population in the facilities 
over time. This design achieves 80% power to detect the hypothesized effect size of 0.3 for either 
primary outcome (satisfaction with participation or hearing-specific health-related quality of life) 
between control and intervention periods (two-sided, =0.025 for each outcome). An effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_185376] exists because of previous literature using these measures in clinical populations and from our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299].62,64   
 
The original sample size analysis for the study used a closed solution formula for a closed cohort design, 
fixed sample size per cluster, and an underlying model with assumptions valid for a large number of 
clusters. The study is an open cohort design allowing participants to drop out of the study (move out of 
the facility) and new residents to come into the study as they move into the facilities. In addition, the 
number of clusters is small (only 8) and the number of residents per facility is variable. We conducted 
simulations to assess the power and Type I error rate of our study given the open cohort design, 
variability in sample size across facilities, and statistical analysis model that accounts for the small 
number of clusters. We found the estimated power to be 77-79% with α=0.025 and 85-87% with α=0.05 
with minimal to no inflation in the Type I error rates (observed 0.025 to 0.033 for α=0.025 and 0.045 to 
0.058 for α=0.05) assuming a drop out (churn rate) of 7.5% per period. These simulations were sent to 
the DSMB and approved prior to study start. Once the study began, the targeted sample size per facility 
(~65) was deemed not to be achievable due to lower than expected census and higher than expected 
resident decline to participate.  Additional simulations showed that with 10 facilities, 5 steps (2 facilities 
per step), and 30 residents per facility, we achieved 85% power for the same hypothesized effect size 
and correlation parameters.

distributed data and medians with interquartile ranges for skewed data. Categorical data will be 
summarized with frequencies and percentages. All tests will be two-sided and conducted at α=0.05 and 
all confidence intervals calculated at 95% unless otherwise stated. All variables for the primary analyses 
are stated below. Although we will assess normality assumptions for the primary and secondary 
outcomes, we do not plan to use transformations for these scale outcomes due to lack of interpretability 
and the large sample size of the trial providing robustness to normality deviations in estimating and testing 
intervention effects.  A full Statistical Analysis Plan is available as a separate document (HearCARE 
Statistical Analysis Plan, October 6, 2021).  
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) 
 
We will use linear mixed models to test the hypothesis of improving satisfaction with participation and 
hearing-specific HRQoL specifying the fixed effects of intervention and time and random effects for facility, 
facility*time, and resident ( RC-4). These random effects are based on the statistical model referenced in 
Hooper (2016)81 that account for the correlation among individuals in the same cluster at the same time 
point, correlation between observations for the same individual at two time points, and the correlation 
between two means of the same cluster at two time points. Time will be treated as a categorical variable. 
We will estimate the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval for the intervention 
effect (IR-1) and test that the difference between intervention and control conditions is significant. A two-
sided test =0.[ADDRESS_185378] Roger correction for small sample 
bias and Satterthwaite degrees of freedom will be employed. Primary analysis will be unadjusted for 
covariates.  
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 
 
We will use linear mixed models to explore the impact of the intervention on staff satisfaction and 
family burden. The models will be specified with fixed effects for the intervention and time and 
random effects for facility, facility*time, and participant ( RC-4). For staff satisfaction, the participant is 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185379] one 
measurement per time-period. For family burden, the participant is the family member/caregiver. We 
will measure family burden at baseline and at least one measurement per time-period the resident is 
enrolled in the study. These random effects account for correlation among individuals in the same 
cluster at the same time point, correlation between observations for the same individual at two time 
points, and the correlation between two means of the same cluster at two time points. We will 
estimate the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval for the intervention effect.

9.4.[ADDRESS_185380] time period on several characteristics including: number 
of residents with measured hearing loss, gender composition, age range, race and ethnicity of residents, 
total occupancy, and annual staff turnover.  We will also compare them on the following measures from 
the previous 5 months: number of unexpected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], number of falls, number of residents 
moving to a higher level of care, and number of deceased residents. 
 
9.4.6 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
 
N/A 
9.4.7 SUB-GROUP ANALYSES 
 
In an effort to ascertain whether the intervention is more or less effective for certain resident 
subgroups ( RQ-4, HT-1), we will explore the following groups ( HT-2):  
(a) those who have different degrees of hearing loss at baseline (~84% expected to have some level of 
hearing loss) and those who do not;  
H1The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159573].  
H0 The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159574] a different impact on residents with hearing loss at baseline as compared to 
residents with no measured hearing loss.

Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;30 Dec 2021  
 
Based on NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 
 45 (b) those who have different degrees of hearing loss and use a device (~18-32% of 84%; note these are 
estimates and the actual percent of device use will be used) compared to those who do not use a 
device but have different degrees of hearing loss;  
H1The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159575] a hearing device at 
baseline as compared to residents with hearing loss who do use a hearing device.  
H0 The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159574] a different impact on residents with hearing loss who do not use a hearing 
device at baseline compared to residents with hearing loss who do use a hearing device.  
 
(c) those with high social participation at baseline (~50%) and those with lower social participation;  
H1The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159576].  
H0 The intervention provided by [CONTACT_159577] a 
different impact for residents with low social participation at baseline compared to residents with 
normal or high social participation.  
 
(d) those with high hearing-specific HRQoL (~50%) and those with lower hearing-specific HRQoL. 
Scores of 0-8 on the HHIE are “low” and 10-40 are “high” with 10% indicating a significant change.[ADDRESS_185381] for residents with high hearing-specific HRQoL at baseline as compared to residents with 
hearing-specific HRQoL within normal limits.  
 
The individual hearing threshold data will allow us to stratify according to hearing levels. We will use 
the ASHA classification of degrees of hearing loss (normal -10 to 15; slight 16 to 25; mild 26 to 40; 
moderate 41 to 55; moderately severe 56 to 70; severe 71 to 90; profound >91 dB).84 The number of 
individuals in the HHIE subgroups and hearing level subgroups cannot be adequately estimated and 
will be known when data collection are complete. We will explore the heterogeneity using interaction 
terms (HT-3) between the factor of interest and the intervention fixed effect. Regardless of the 
significance, we will estimate the treatment effect for each subgroup with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals ( HT-2).

9.4.[ADDRESS_185382] to the effectiveness of the intervention, we believe there is a threshold of improvement 
with exposure to the intervention. In other words, there will be a change (i.e., improved hearing specific 
HR QoL and satisfaction with participation) and then that change will be maintained, it will not 
increase.  However, with the data we will obtain, we will be able to explore if the change over 20 
months relative to baseline is the same as the change at 5 months relative to baseline (dose effect 
within facilities), and the same incrementally for 15 or 10 months of exposure (pooling across facilities). 
These comparisons are exploratory as they are either completely or partially confounded with 
time.   We also can conduct an analysis used in the depression trial82 to explore linear and quadratic 
terms for the number of periods in the intervention condition both at the facility and resident levels and 
the number of periods the resident was in the study.  
 
 
10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 
10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS 
 
10.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS 
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159522].  All participants will be informed 
that they are being asked to participate in a research study and the research measures and timing will be 
explained. In addition, every potential participant will be informed that their participation is voluntary and 
they can stop participating at any time without impacting their relationship with their Senior Living 
Community, the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], or UPMC.  For residents, this description will be read to them 
and they can take as much time as they like to ask questions.  The DC will record either Yes or No related 
to their willingness to participate. For Staff and Families, they will receive this description either in writing 
or electronically and will have contact [CONTACT_45465].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION 
 
As described in section [IP_ADDRESS], this is an Exempt protocol and consent will be administered verbally for 
residents and in writing (paper or electronic) for Families and Staff. All participants will be competent in 
communicating in English based on self-report.

Based on NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research 
 47 10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE 
 
Given the current status of the Global Pandemic, this study could be suspended if the Assisted Living 
Facilities limit non-essential personnel (DCs) from entering the building due to safety concerns for 
residents. If this happens, the Study Team will notify the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159523].  This 
disruption (implementing study questionnaires) will not have an adverse effect on residents, staff, and 
family.  The Intervention (Consult and/or Engage) may not be disrupted depending on the Senior Living 
Community decision about continuing what may be viewed as essential care, but it could be limited in this 
same situation.  The providers of the hearing care would work directly with the facility and the residents 
virtually in this case which would be independent of the research project. 
 
The study would resume once concerns about safety of residents due to possible virus exposure were 
addressed.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_185383] by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, 
the safety and oversight monitor(s), and the sponsor(s) and funding agency. This confidentiality is 
extended to the data being collected as part of this study. Data that could be used to identify a specific 
study participant will be held in strict confidence within the research team. No personally-identifiable 
information from the study will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval 
of the sponsor/funding agency.  
Participants’ identify will be protected by [CONTACT_159578] a code consisting of first and last initial, 
a unique 4 digit identifier and a two letter facility identifier.  The key to this code will be kept in secure file 
that is only accessed by [CONTACT_159579]. An identifier is needed to link data over time and to 
link resident data to family member data and staff to specific facilities.  
 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible. 
 
There is no plan to share data while the study is active. This study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov and 
results submitted in accordance with PCORI requirements for public release of research findings ( IR-5). 
Prior to submission of the Draft Final Research Report, we will enter into an agreement with a PCORI 
designated data repository ( IR-7). Prior to the acceptance of the Final Research Report, we will provide a 
full data package to the PCORI designated repository including an analyzable data set, the full protocol 
for the study, metadata, a data dictionary, full statistical analysis plan, and analytic code for the Final 
Research Report. We will maintain the full data package for at least seven years.

 49 These reports will be reviewed internally by [CONTACT_82863] (monthly). Similar reports will also 
be presented to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the representative of the 
Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (see below).  
The study statistician is [CONTACT_159601] who will be responsible for overseeing report 
generation.  
 
Interim reports will be generated by [CONTACT_159582] 
a scheduled meeting. The contents of the report will be determined by [CONTACT_4318]. Additions and 
other modifications to these reports may be directed by [CONTACT_73179] a one-time or continuing basis.  
Interim data reports generally consist of two parts. 
(Open Session Report) provides information on study aspects such as participant accrual and 
demographics, retention, withdrawals, data completeness, adverse events, other study 
performance measures, any new information on the intervention or disease/disorder that may 
affect the outcome of the trial, and a list of publications or presentations.  
(Closed Session Report) will divide study participants per coded treatment assignment (e.g., 
Treatments A vs. B), comparing subject demographics and baseline characteristics, rates of and 
reasons for treatment discontinuation and loss to follow-up, and rates of serious adverse events 
(SAEs). The Closed Session Report is considered confidential.  
[CONTACT_159599] will work with PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Palmer to prepare an Executive Summary and response addressing 
prior concerns regarding the conduct of the study. This will be distributed to DSMB members along with 
the Open Session report. DSMB meeting data reports will generally include the following types of 
information, although only the Closed Session data reports will include comparisons by [CONTACT_159583]: 
• Monthly and cumulative accrual, compared with targets 
• Baseline characteristics overall 
• Completeness and quality of data collection forms

10.1.8 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
 
The consent process will be monitored with every participant required to provide consent that is tracked 
in the REDCap data system. Electronic data capture will be monitored by [CONTACT_9928] (described in more detail 
below). We maintain all source documents to ensure that the electronic data capture mirrors the planned 
data capture. Data Collection and Intervention Fidelity are monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_9928]. 
Protocol deviations will be monitored on a regular basis and dealt with immediately with re-training.   
 
Data Collectors will be trained prior to starting the protocol (see Section 8.1). The DSC will observe each 
DC in each facility at each data collection time point (Baseline 1, Baseline 2, Time 1, Time 2, Time 3, Time 
4). The CRFs related to residents and staff will be captured electronically and directly entered into the 
REDCap data base built for this study. The Family data will either be electronic (REDCap) survey or 
returned via paper questionnaire to the DSC who will enter the data. The data from the Audiologist will 
be provided to the DSC for electronic entry.  All routine tracking provided by [CONTACT_159587].  These processes reduce the change of inaccuracies due to manual data 
entry from paper records. In addition, this methodology protects participant privacy by [CONTACT_159588]. The CFs have standard training through the UPMC Audiology Division. The CF Training 
Handbook is uploaded as a separate document.

 51 For quality monitoring, the DCC will produce reports for the study team to review that will provide 
information on 1) consent process, 2) completion of data elements, 3) compliance with intervention, 
fidelity measures (see section 6.2.1) and 4) protocol deviations.  
 
In addition to reporting, the real-time validation and regular data quality monitoring by [CONTACT_159589]. Real time validation will 
be implemented by [CONTACT_159590]. The Data Manager will develop data quality checks, monitor 
incoming data, and generate queries with specific focus on screening, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
randomization, intervention data, outcomes, and adverse events. We will monitor for missing items, 
missing forms, and range of values entered. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_185387] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159513] 
(DCC) under the direction of [CONTACT_159599] ( IR-7). We will use an electronic data capture (EDC) system 
which will be built around standardized case report forms. The system will have additional applications 
including participant tracking, file uploads, and reporting. The electronic data management system will 
allow the trial to be paperless, as all data will be input directly by [CONTACT_159591] a secure web-based 
system. Data will be collected on facilities, staff, residents and family members with linkage through 
unique, study specific identifiers. For residents, the data collected are minimal: demographics, hearing 
test results, use of hearing devices, satisfaction with social participation, hearing- specific HRQoL, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and change in status such as moving or death. The data core analysts will be blinded to 
condition ( IR-6). 
REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed with the flexibility to support data capture for a 
variety of research projects. REDCap provide management of user-access to the data, a mechanism for 
validated data uploads from external sources, an intuitive user interface for validated data capture 
through the execution of real-time validation rules, an audit trail for tracking transactions within the 
system, such as study system setup and modifications, data imports, data entry and edits, and data 
exports, and a mechanism for seamless data downloads to common data formats (SAS datasets will be 
the format of choice for this study). 
The web-based data submission software is REDCap version 10.3.7 and all data will be stored on the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]’s servers which are housed at the Network Operations Center (NOC) and 
managed by [CONTACT_2374]’s Computing Services and Systems Development (CSSD).  The NOC is a 
state-of-the-art technical facility that houses servers and network equipment to ensure stable and 
reliable service for University enterprise systems. It is a centralized management center that is capable 
of identifying, notifying, and repairing problems when they occur and projecting when and where they 
might occur. Data are encrypted and protected behind enterprise network firewalls.  CSSD conducts 
web vulnerability scans to analyze web applications from development through production for 
security. 
HearCARE  V.4  
Protocol   23 May 2021; updated 06 October 2021;[ADDRESS_185388] will be tested in three phases before actual study data is collected. 
Phase I entails testing each form for accuracy on elements, fields, and options. Phase II entails testing 
skip patterns and functionality across forms. Phase III entails DC staff and study personnel entering 
mock data including screen failures, randomized cases, and data for cases fully enrolled and followed.  
He/she will enter the mock data in the CRFs into each field of each data collection instrument and 
document the success or failure of a) the user interface for data entry, b) the on-line univariate and 
range data validation checks, and c) custom functions.   
  
All DCC statisticians use SAS version 9.4 for report and statistical analyses. SAS runs off individual 
computers. The SAS data files will only contain de-identified data. Data files and programs used for 
monitoring, reporting, and analysis will be stored on the Office 365 University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159528]. Data will be stored indefinitely.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Study documents will be retained for a minimum of 7 years after publication of study results but can be 
maintained indefinitely by [CONTACT_159592]. No records will be destroyed without the 
written consent of the sponsor and funding agency.  
 
10.1.10 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
A protocol deviation occurs when, without significant consequences, the activities on a study diverge 
from the IRB-approved protocol (e.g., staff not completing training within timeframe).  
Deviations from protocol will be monitored and documented throughout the study. The protocol 
deviations will be reported to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159529] (RNI). A 
list will be kept and sent to PCORI with quarterly reports if issues do not meet immediate reporting 
requirements by [CONTACT_159593].   
10.1.11 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
 
All dissemination of information will follow PCORI guidelines: 
https://www.pcori.org/sites/default/files/PCORI-Peer-Review-and-Release-of-Findings-Process.pdf  
All proposed publications must be reviewed by [CONTACT_159594]. The 
lead author will be required to draft a manuscript proposal, which will detail the authors of the paper (in 
proposed order), target journal, objective of the manuscript, data needs, and resource needs. The lead 
author is responsible for collaborating with and including advisory committee members in dissemination 
efforts to ensure that stakeholder perspectives are represented.

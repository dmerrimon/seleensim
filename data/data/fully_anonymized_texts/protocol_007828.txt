Sample Size 
Justification  A total of approximately 120 patients with C F being treated for an 
exacerbation of CF-associate d lung disease will be enrolled in the 
study: [ADDRESS_801352] approximately 
80% power to detect a 1.[ADDRESS_801353] at the 5% level  of 
significance . This estimated standard deviation is  that reported for  a 2-
week study of CF patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa  who were 
treated during exacerbations with 2 weeks of intravenous  tobramycin 
(Al-Aloul  et al, 201 4).

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801354] to efficacy and microbiology 
will be performed to help inform the selection of the final dose for 
further development, safety and tolerability will also be paramount in 
the selection of the optimal dose.  
The primary efficacy endpoint  for the study is: 
• Change from baseline (Day  0) in log-transformed sputum bacterial 
load of  gram negative CFU per ml and per mg following a CF 
exacerbation  
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the study are : 
• Change from baseline (Day 0) in patient health -related 
questionnaires /PROMs  (CFRSD -CRISS, Jarad and Sequei ros 
Symptom Score Questionnaire , and CFQ -R)  
• Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation questionnaire  
• Change from baseline (Day 0) in sputum IL8 and neutrophil 
elastase level s following a CF exacerbation  
• Change from baseline (Day 0) in the following:  
o FEV1  
o Weight and BMI  
o CRP  
o Blood leukocyte count  
• Assessment of blood and sputum cysteamine levels at Day [ADDRESS_801355]  at Day 14 will be conducted 
using  a linear mixed model for repeated measures , analysis of 
variance (ANOVA), and chi -square tests as appropriate . Change from 
baseline (Day 0) to Day 7 and Day 21 will also be assessed whe re 
applicable. All analyses will be conducted using two -sided tests at the 
alpha=0.05 level of significance. There will be no adjustments for 
multiple comparisons in the efficacy analyses for this study.  
The data for change from baseline (Day 0) measures will be  
summarized with descriptive statistics  and confidence intervals  and 
will be analyzed via contrast statements from the mixed model for all 
pairwise and pooled total daily dose (TDD) group comparisons , each 
at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_801356] deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum values.  Catego rical variables will 
be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_605232].

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801357] 2017    
   
    Safety analyses will involve the examination of the descriptive 
statistics and individual patient listings for any effects of study 
treatment on clinical safety.  Summaries will be prepared by [CONTACT_605233] . 
Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) summaries will include 
the overall incidence (by [CONTACT_6657]), 
events by [CONTACT_11196], events by [CONTACT_605234], events leading to discontinuation of study drug, and SAEs.  
Vital signs and laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry , and 
urinalysis) will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148].  Actual and 
change from baseline (Day 0) data will be calculated and summarized.  
Each potentially efficacious dose will also be assessed from a safety 
and tolerability perspective based on assessment of AEs, laboratory 
values, and vital signs.  Potential doses for future development will 
consist of one or more doses tha t are both potentially efficacious and 
have demonstrated an adequate safety profile.

    1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Cystic Fibrosis (CF)  
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal inherited disease in Caucasian populations of 
European origin.  In the U nited Kingdom ([LOCATION_006]),  the carrier rate for this autosomal recessive 
condition is 1 in 25 and disease prevalence is approximately 1 in 2 ,500.  CF affects over 9,000 
people in the [LOCATION_006] and about 70,000 people globally ([LOCATION_006] CF Registry, 201 4).  CF is associated 
with reduced life expectancy , with the current median age of death at 26 to 29 years in the 
[LOCATION_006].  CF results f rom >1 ,000 mutations in the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene that 
codes for a chloride ion channel located in the api[INVESTIGATOR_605209] ; the CFTR 
has also been identified in non -epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] .  Although CF affects the pancreas, 
hepatobiliary tree, and the intestinal and reproductive tracts, by [CONTACT_605235][INVESTIGATOR_696], with 90% of the morbidity and mortality associated with CF 
resulting from  chronic suppurative  lung disease and ultimately respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (Goss and 
Quittner, 2007 ).  CFTR mutations result in airway surface liquid dehydration, consequent 
impairment of mucociliary clearance, bacterial colonization of the airways,  and chronic 
suppurative lung disease.  The chronic infection and inflammation of CF lung disease results 
in daily symptoms such as dyspnea, cough , and sputum production.  A characteristic feature 
of CF is intermittent epi[INVESTIGATOR_605210], commonly known as 
exacerbations .  Exacerbations are  characteri zed by [CONTACT_605236], increased sputum 
production, increased dyspnea, loss of appetite, weight  loss, and lung function decline (Goss 
and Burns, 2007 ).  Such exacerbations have an adverse impact on patients’ quality of life 
(Hegarty et al, 2009 ), incur significant healthcare costs (Britto et al, 2002 ), and are associated 
with a more rapid loss of lung fu nctio n (Sanders et al, 2010 ; Sanders et al, 2011 ).  
Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is the most common pathogen in CF ([LOCATION_006] CF Registry, 201 4), and 
infection with this organism is characteri zed by [CONTACT_605237], repeated 
exacerbations , and an accelerated rate of decline in lung function.  Other Gram-negative 
bacteria can also infect or coloni ze the lung, probably the most clinically  significant of which 
is the Burkholderia cepacia  complex.  The Gram-negative bacteria that infect patients with 
CF are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics , and the prevalence of bacteria with newly 
acquired resistance has increased with improved l ife expectancy.  Resistance rates in P. 
aeruginosa  in the [LOCATION_006] have increased dramatically with approximately 40% of patients 
resistant to two or more antibiotics in one study (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_118045], 2003 ).  The development of 
antibiotic resista nce in CF is most likely  due to the intensive selective pressure provided by 
[CONTACT_605238] P. aeruginosa  found in CF lung infection  (Oliver et al, 2000 ; Giwercman et 
al, 1990 ).  In CF, P. aeruginosa  and the B. cepacia  complex grow in biofilms and , as such , are 
much more resistant to antibiotics compared with planktonic -growing cells of the same 
isolate: minimum inhibitory  concentration ( MIC ) and minimum bacterial concentration 
(MBC ) can be 100 - to 1,000- fold greater in biofilms (Stewart and Costerton, 2007 ).  The 
issue  of bacterial antibiotic resistance in CF is compounded by [CONTACT_605239]  (ARs)  to antibiotics that has been reported in 9.5% of CF children and up to 
25% in CF adults (Wills et al, 1998 ; Pleasants and Samuelson, 1994 ).  The incidence of ARs 
increases with the number of courses of antibiotic s administered ( Koch et al, 1991 ).

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801370] 2017    
   
    The aggressive use of antibiotics to suppress chronic infection and to treat acute exacerbations 
is one of the mainstays of treatment in CF that has contributed to the increased survival of CF 
patients.  However, the problems of multiple drug resistance and ARs are major clinical 
issues.  This has led to calls for research into new antibiotics and new antibiotic strategies to 
target the biofilm and to increase the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics ( Bals et 
al, 2011 ; Hoiby, 2002 ).  Preclinical work indicates  that cysteamine, a drug already licensed 
for another indication , has potentially beneficial actions on biofilms and micro -organisms , and  
is the basis for the current study.  
1.1.2 Cysteamine  
Cysteamine is an amino thiol (HSCH2CH2NH2) that is found endogenously in v ery low 
plasma levels as a consequence of coenzyme A metabolism ( Besouw et al, 2013 ).  Since 
1976 , cysteamine has been used to treat the lysosomal storage disorder , cystinosis.  An 
immediate release formulation (Cystagon) was licensed for the treatment of cystinosis in the 
[LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]) in 1994 and in the European Union (EU) in 1997.   Adequate 
treatment of cystinosis with cysteamine reduces the rate of progression  to end -stage renal 
failure, reduces extra renal manifestations , and improves growth.  
1.1.3 Rationale for Using Cysteamine in CF  
The mucolytic and antimicrobial properties of cysteamine  were identified by [CONTACT_157248] ( NovaBiotics Ltd ).  Data obtained in t he laboratory and from a clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , in 
which the impact of cysteamine  on the in vitro  rheology and microbial burden of sputum from 
CF patients was assessed , highlights the therapeutic potential in CF.  Cysteamine is a potent 
mucolytic that is able to break down the sputum produced within the airways of CF patients  
(Charrier et al, 20 14; Devereux et al, 2015 ).  This has the potential to aid sputum 
expectoration, improve lung function , and r educe the microbial burden in the airways .  This 
mucolytic action may also provide better access for antimicrobial agents to the bacteria within 
the airways of CF patients.  Cysteamine also possesses three key antimicrobial (non -
antibiotic) attributes that  potentiate the effects of existing antibiotic regimens for CF patients  
(Charrier et al, 20 14; Devereux et al, 2015 ):  
1. Cysteamine kills bacteria commonly associated with CF -associated lung disease . 
2. Cysteamine synergi zes with other antibiotic agents, broadens their spectrum of activity, 
delivers a post -antimicrobial effect , and reverses antibiotic resistance (even in multi -
drug resistant strains).  
3. Cysteamine disrupts the biofilms that bacteria coloni ze in the airways of CF.  
1.1.4 Clinical Experience with C ysteamine in Patients with CF  
In a Phase 2 study , oral cysteamine was a dministered to patients with CF -associated lung 
disease when not exacerbating to determine whether oral cysteamine is absorbed in adult CF 
patients and enters the bronchial secretions. Tolerability and clinical outcomes were explored.  
Ten patients with stable CF associated lung disease were enrolled: median ( interquartile ratio 
[IQR]) age 21.5 (19.8 -31.8)  years;  median (IQR) forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_104763] 
(FEV1 ) percent predicted  32% (26 -49) predicted ; 80% of patients were F508del/F508del  and 
80% of patients were infected with a Gram-negative organism. Oral cysteamine was 
commenced at 450 mg once daily , then increased w eekly to 450  mg four times daily.  T he 
NBTCS02  Confidential  
Cysteamine in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis  Page 20 of 66 
 
 
Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801371] 450  mg dose , the mean  
(SD) maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) was 2.86 (1.96) mg/L, the time to maximum 
concentration ( Tmax ) was  1.2 (0.7) h ours, the half -life ( T½) was 3.7 (1.7), oral clearance 
(CL/F ) was  89.9 (30.5) L/h our and volume of distribution (Vd/F ) was  427 L (129).   
Cysteamine appeared to accumulate in sputum with a median (IQR) sputum:plasma 
cysteamine ratio of 4.2 (0.98 -8.84).  Cysteamine treatment reduced sputum microbial load 
(0.9 log reduction [95% CI -0.05 to 1.9, p=0.060 ]) and viscosity with the maximal reduction 
observed with cysteamine 450  mg three times daily .  There was evidence of reduced 
adherence with the four times daily  dosing regimen.  Cysteamine therapy was associated with 
clinically si gnificant reductions in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised ( CFQ -R) quality 
of life domains of ‘ Vitality’ (16 points, p=0.012), ‘ Physical Functioning’ (10 points, 
p=0.058), ‘Eating Disturbance’ (11 points) and ‘Weight ’ (10 points).  
This study confir med that oral cysteamine is absorbed and enters the bronchial secretions in 
patients  with CF.  The effects of cysteamine on sputum microbial load and sputum viscosity 
were in line with the preclinical ex vivo data (Charrier et al, 20 14; Devereux et al, 2015 ).  The 
adverse effects on quality of life are potentially clinically important and reinforce the notion 
that oral cysteamine is likely  more suited for use as an adjunct to treatment of e xacerbation s 
of CF -associated lung disease where the duration of treatment is relatively short, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_801372] on 
sputum microbial load.  Oral formulations of cysteamine are available for licensed use in 
cystinosis , and there are more than 20 yea rs of clinical experience with cysteamine for this 
indication .   
Any future phase 3 trial of cysteamine in acute exacerbations of CF -associated  lung disease 
will require a health -related questionnaire/ PROM, and such an outcome  measure  is currently 
not avai lable for acute exacerbations  in CF.  The following four potential health -related 
questionnaires/ PROM s have been identified :  
 
a) The Cystic Fibrosis Respi[INVESTIGATOR_282897]  (CFRSD )–Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_428813] ( CRISS ) is a patient -completed questionnaire designed to 
evaluate the effect of treatment on the severity of symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_605211] a chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416].  
 
b) The Jarad and Sequeiros  Symptom Questionnaire ( Jarad and Sequieros 2011 ) is a 
simple patient -completed questionnaire that as sesses and evaluates change in patient 
symptoms related  to different aspects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_605212] a CF 
exacerbation.  
 
c) The CFQ -R is a patient -completed questionnaire to assess the impact of CF and 
treatment on everyday life , however this may not be ideally suited to the dynamic 
nature of an acute exacerbation because the CFQ -R enquires abo ut symptoms over 
previous 2 weeks.

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801373] 2017    
   
    d) The Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation is a patient -completed questionnaire 
that assesses the current CF exacerbation in comparison to the previous exacerbation.   
 
Another major aim of this study is to identify health -related questionnaires/ PROM s most 
suited for use in any future study of cysteamine in acu te exacerbations of CF -associated lung 
disease.

In order to maintain the study blind, placebo capsules will be taken so that each patient takes 
3 capsules 3 times per day (i.e., morning, mid -day, and evening doses).  
The randomization schedule will be generated using a computer program and verified for 
accuracy using strict qual ity control procedures.  Randomization will be central ized. 
The investigational site will maintain an inventory of study drug supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  
Eligible patients will receive a  blinded treatment assignment  with a unique randomization 
code based on the randomization list .  The  assigned  randomization code will be captured in 
the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). 
5.2 Emergency Unblinding  
The Study Handbook details the procedures for emergency unblinding.   In the  event a 
patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, this treatment assignment will be kept 
confidential and shared only as required for patient safety  and/or regulatory reporting . 
Unblinding should only be performed if knowledge of the treatment assignme nt is considered

Compliance will be assessed by a review of the inventory returned from  patient s treated on an 
outpatient basis  at each visit , and on a daily basis for patients t reated on an inpatient basis .  
Patient s will be questioned regarding any discrepancies from  expected dosing.  
9 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY  PROCEDURES  
Specific study procedures are described below.  Assessment time points are provided in the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Section 4.3).  Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_605244], 
sputum IL8 and neutrophil elastase level s, FEV1, weight, CRP, blood leukocyte count , 
assessment of blood and sputum cysteamine levels , and the following health -related 
questionnaires/ PROMs :  CFRSD -CRISS, Jarad and Sequeiros  Symptom Score Questionnaire, 
CFQ -R, and Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation .  Safety will be assessed by  
[CONTACT_605245], physical examination s, vital signs, and laboratory parameters 
(chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis).  
9.[ADDRESS_801401] clinical microbiology will be performed on each sputum sample  by 
[CONTACT_6626] .  Results will indicate (a) total CFU count per ml and per mg and (b) organisms 
as Gram -positive/negative  per ml and per mg . 
Quantitative IL8 neutrophil  and elastase assay s will be performed on each sputum sample by 
[CONTACT_456] . 
Sites may collect separate samples for each required sputum assessment or may collect one 
sputum sample and split it into either 2 or 3 parts (depending on sample requirements for the 
visit).  The sample will either be split into 2 parts for Day 0, Day 7 a nd Day 21, and 3 parts 
for Day 14  or 2 samples will be collected for Day 0, Day 7 and Day 21, or 3 samples will be 
collected for Day 14 . Each part  or sample  will be placed into a separate container for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_605216] , details .  Details on sample col lection, preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_605217] .

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801402] value of the three maneuvers will be reported.  Each maneuver will be performed in 
accordance with American Thoracic Society ( ATS )/European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_3764] ( ERS) 
standards ( Miller et al, 2005 ).  For consistency, patients should be tested using the same 
equipment at each visit.  Additiona lly, whenever possible, the same staff member should 
perform all testing for a given patient  at each required visit .  Patients must have  a documented 
history of FEV1>30% of predicted  within the [ADDRESS_801403] ionnaires/ Patient -Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)  
Patients will complete the health -related questionnaires/ PROM s.  The q uestionnaires may be 
updated/translated in accordance with  local requirements.   In the event the patient is unable to 
complete the que stionnaire s without assistance, the questionnaires may be verbally answered 
and the patient’s responses recorded  by [CONTACT_605246] a chaperone . 
9.3.1 Cystic Fibrosis Respi[INVESTIGATOR_282897]  (CFRSD) –Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_605218] (CRISS)  
The CFRSD is a [ADDRESS_801404] of treatment on the severity of CF 
symptoms (ie, CFRSD -CRISS) and to assess the emotional and activity impacts of these 
symptoms. The CFRSD -CRISS is a validated unidimensional scale based on a subset of [ADDRESS_801405] of treatment on the 
severity of symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_605219] a chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]. The 8 CFRSD -CRISS items are scored using a 5 -point Likert s cale ranging from 0 
(no symptom) to 4 (the highest magnitude of severity). A copy of the CFRSD  is provided in 
Section 22.1. 
9.3.2 Jarad and Sequeiros  Symp tom Score Questionnaire  
The Jarad and Sequeiros  Symptom Questionnaire ( Jarad and Sequieros 2011 ) is a simple 
patient -completed questionnaire that as sesses and evaluates change in patient symptoms 
related  to different aspects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_605212] a CF exacerbation. The 
questionnaire consists of 4 questions, each answered on a 4 -point scale ranging from 1 (best) 
to 4 (worst).  Individual symptom scores are summed with a total score ranging from 4 to 16 . 
A copy of the Jarad and Sequeiros  Symptom Score Questionnaire is provided in Section 22.2. 
9.3.3 Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire – Revised ( CFQ -R) 
The CFQ -R is a patient -completed questionnaire to assess the impact of CF and treatment on 
everyday life.  The questionnaire consists of the following four sections:  Demographics, 
Quality of Life, School, Work or Daily Activities, and Symptom Difficulties.  A copy of the 
CFQ -R is provided in Section 22.3.

    9.3.4 Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation  
The Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation is a patient -completed que stionnaire that 
assesses the current CF exacerbation in comparison to the previous exacerbation.  The 
questionnaire consists of 6 questions, each answered on a 6-point scale, as well as 2 questions 
regarding the time to recovery .  A copy of the Patient Global Assessment of Exacerbation is 
provided in Section 22.4. 
9.4 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination will b e performed and will include an assessment of the 
following body systems:  general appearance; mental status; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; 
dermatologic; cardiovascular; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; gastrointestinal; and neurological.  Additional body 
systems may be  examined at the Investigator’s discretion.   After the Baseline (Day 0) physical 
examination, any physical examination finding, with the exception of CF progression , that is 
assessed by [CONTACT_605247] a clinically significant change (worsening) com pared to the 
Baseline (Day 0) assessment , will be considered an AE and reported as described in Section 
11. 
9.5 Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
Vital si gns include temperature and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_605220] [ADDRESS_801407] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] . Weight  will be measured 
using a calibrated scale with the patient lightly clothed and shoes off.  Height may be obtained 
from the patient’s medical history, or measured using a calibrated wall mounted stadiometer.  
Any vital sign or weight measurement that is assessed by [CONTACT_5256] a clinically 
significant change (worsening) compared to the  Baseline (Day 0) assessment will be 
considered an AE and reported as described in Section  11.

    existing medications.  The following will be collected for all concomitant medications:  
medication name, start/stop dates, total daily dose,  route of administration,  and indication for 
use. 
In addition, any non -medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_605221] 30 days  prior to the 
Screening visit and throughout the study will be documented.  Documentation will include 
new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and changes to existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The following will be 
collected for all non -medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]:  therapy name, start/stop dates, frequency of use,

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporal ly 
associated with the use of the investigational product, whether or not related to the 
investigational product.  
An AE includes:  
• Any symptom not previously reported in the patient’s medical history;  
• A worsening of a pre -existing condition ; 
• A significant increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing condition ; and  
• A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration, even though 
the condition may have been present before the start of the trial.  
An AE does not include:  
• Symptoms o f the underlying disease ( CF) that  might be reasonably anticipated to 
come and go, or progress, given the nature and severity of the condition.  However, if 
the progression of the disease results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605222]02  Confidential

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801413] 2017    
   
    exacerbation under the current study , is life -threatening, or is fatal, then progression of 
the disea se should be reported as an SAE  (see Section 12.1); 
• Expecte d variations in severity of disease signs and symptoms that have previously 
been reported in the patient’s medical history;  
• Pre-planned m edical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion) [Note: The condition that leads to the procedure may be an AE];  
• Overdose of study drug  without any clinical signs or symptoms; or  
• Clinically significant laboratory values.  If abnormal laboratory values are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_605249], the signs or symptoms are considered 
an AE a nd should be recorded as such.  Abnormal laboratory values associated with 
the current CF exacerbation are not an AE.  Abnormal laboratory values will be 
recorded  in the study database.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that  occur after the first dose of 
study drug is administered,  regardless of whether or not they are considered to be related to 
the study drug.  
11.2 Documenting Adverse Events  
AEs will be elicited by [CONTACT_229298] a general, non-directed  question such as “H ow 
have you been feeling since the last visit?”  Directed questioning and examination will then be 
done, as appropriate.  All reported AEs will be documented.  
Whenever feasible, AEs should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest possible level 
of integ ration).  When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of the signs 
and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_183633].  
Information documented will include the description of the AE, the date of onset and 
resolution (if applicable), severity, seriousness, relationship to study procedures, action taken, 
and the outcome.  The Investigator must follow AEs until the Day 21/ End of Study visit, the 
event resolves, or until the condition stabilizes and the Investigator feels no further medical 
follow -up is warranted.  
11.3 Assessment of Severity  
The Investigator will categorize the severity  of each AE according to the definitions listed 
below:  
Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102] , causing minimal 
discomfort, and  not interfering with everyday activities . 
Moderate : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with  normal 
everyday activities . 
Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities . 
NBTCS02  Confidential  
Cysteamine in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis  Page 39 of 66 
 
 
Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801414] 2017    
   
    Note: the term ‘severe’, used to describe the intensity, should not be confused with ‘serious’ 
which is a regulatory definition based on patient /event outcome or action  criteria.  For example, 
a headache may be severe but not serious, while a minor stroke is serious but may not be severe.  
11.4 Assessment of Causality  
After careful medical consideration, the Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to 
the study drug  according to the following categories:  
Unrelated : The event is not considered to be related to the study drug . 
Possibly Related:  Although a relationship to the study drug cannot be completely 
ruled out, the nature of the event, the underlying disease, 
concomitant medication or temporal relationship make other 
explanations possible . 
Probably Related:  The temporal relationship and absence of a more likely 
explanation suggest the event could be related to the study drug .  
Definitely Related:  The known effect s of the study drug or its therapeutic class, or 
based on challenge testing, suggest that study drug is the most 
likely cause . 
All AEs/SAEs judged as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship (e.g. possibly, 
probably, definitely) to the study drug will be considered as ARs/ serious adverse reactions 
(SARs ).   
Alternative causes such as natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy, 
other risk factors , and the temporal relationship of the event to the treatment should be 
considered.  
11.5 Adverse Event Outcome  
The Investigator will categorize the outcome of each AE according to the following 
definitions:  
Resolved : The patient recovered from the AE.  Record the AE stop 
date.  
Resolved with Sequelae  The patient recovered from the AE with seque lae.  Record 
the AE stop date as the date the patient recovered with 
sequelae.  
Ongoing : At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, 
with an undetermined outcome.  Note: ongoing AEs are not 
considered resolved as a result of death.  No AE stop  date 
should be recorded when an AE is ongoing.  
Chronic/Stable : At the time of last assessment, the event is ongoing and 
stabilized, with no change to the event outcome 
anticipated.  Record the AE stop date.  
NBTCS02  Confidential  
Cysteamine in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis  Page 40 of 66 
 
 
Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801415] 2017    
   
    Death : The AE directly caused death.  Record the  date of death as 
the AE stop date.  
Unknown : There is an inability to access the patient or the patient’s 
records to determine the outcome (e.g., patient withdraws 
consent or is lost to follow up).  No AE stop date should be 
recorded.  
The Investigator must  follow AEs until the Day 21/End of Study visit, the event resolves, or 
until the condition stabilizes and the Investigator feels no further medical follow -up is 
warranted.  
11.5.1  Withdrawal Due to Adverse Event  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_605250], the 
patient will be monitored at the discretion of the Investigator (e.g., until the event has  resolved 
or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or  until a 
determinati on of a cause unrelated to the study drug is determined ). 
12 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T 
12.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Death ; 
• Life-threatening ; 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ; Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605223] a pre -existing condition that 
has not worsened during participation in the study will not be considered an SAE;  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient ; and/or  
• Other:  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, th ey may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such events are:  
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm ; 
o Blood dysc rasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; and/or  
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse .

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801416] 2017    
   
    An AE that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a  
non-serious AE.  
Definition of Terms  
Life threatening:  An AE is life threatening if the patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more 
serious form might have caused death.  For example, drug induce d hepatitis that resolved 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening, even though 
drug induced hepatitis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605224] (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or 
SAEs.  If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be 
reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the defined criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329887] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605225]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting.  
As noted in Section 11.1, if progression of the symptoms of the underlying disease (CF) result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_605226], if it is 
life-threatening, or is fatal, then progression of the disease will be reported as an SAE.   If the 
event does not meet these criteria, then the h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_605227].  
Disability/incapacitating:  An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patient's ability to carry out normal life 
functions.  
12.2 SAE Expectedness  
An SAE that is not included in the Investigator’s Brochures  by [CONTACT_16972], severity, 
outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected AE.   If a serious  unexpected AE is 
believed to be related to the study drug or study procedures, the Sponsor will take appropriate 
steps to notify all Investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of cysteamine , as 
well as the appropriate regulatory authorities .

Amendment 3: [ADDRESS_801418]/Ethics 
Committee ( IRB/EC ) and/or regulatory authorities will be informed of SAEs in accordance 
with local regulation timeframes and reporting requirements (as specified in the Study 
Handbook) . 
No protocol -defined AEs for expedited reporting are identified for this study.  
12.3.1  Overdose  
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed and irrespective of whether or not the study 
drug was involved ) must be communicated to the Sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
outlined in the Study Handbook . 
12.3.2  Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE; however, the Investigator must collect pregnancy 
information for female patients or female partners of male patients who become pregnant 
while participating in a study.  The Investigator should report the pregnancy to the Sponsor in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in the Study Handbook . 
Any pregnancy that occurs in a patient or patient’s partner during a study should be followed 
to outcome.  In some ci rcumstances, it may be necessary to monitor the development of the 
newborn for an appropriate period post -delivery.   
Should the patient  or patient’s partner not wish for the pregnancy to be followed to outcome 
or beyond, this should be documented . 
Female patients  who become pregnant will be advised to discontinue  study drug immediately, 
and will not be administered  further study drug. 
13 STATISTICS  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study and finalized 
prior to locking the database.  The SAP will provide additional details about the specific

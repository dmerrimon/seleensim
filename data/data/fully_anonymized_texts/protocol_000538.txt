1 INTRODUCTION 
The objective of these open-label studies is to confirm the com parability of the efficacy and safety of 
a commercially viable 0.7% to 1 .0% cantharidin formulation for the treatment of pediatric molluscum 
contagiosum (MC) to the 0.7% cantharidin formulation used in th e initial study that investigated 
safety and efficacy of a compoun ded cantharidin formulation.  An additional objective is to 
investigate potential systemic  exposure under maximal use condi tions.  MC is a dermatologic 
disorder caused by a pox virus -  molluscum contagiosum virus (M CV).  The contagion manifests on 
any part of the body as small, pear ly, dome-shaped papules with  a dimpled center.  While MC may 
be self-limiting, lasting anywhere from months to years, it can  be unsightly and embarrassing.  
Patients and their pare nts often seek trea tment for both cosmet ic removal and to prevent the spread 
of MCV to close contacts.  MCV is  transmitted through close phy sical contact, such as bathing with 
siblings or the sharing of towels  and even the use of public po ols.  
 
While treatment options do exis t for MC, there is no standard of care.  Dermatologists strive for 
treatment options in children, which in addition to being safe and effective are painless and non-
traumatic.  One such option is can tharidin, which is familiar to practicing dermatologists but does not 
have a U.S. Food and Drug Adminis tration (FDA)-approved indicat ion for MC.  In our  study, we will 
evaluate the efficacy of canthar idin 0.7% to 1.0% in the treatm ent of MC in a prospective, open-label 
study.  The purpose of this study is to test the safety and eff icacy of a commercially viable 
cantharidin 0.7% to 1.0% formulat ion.  A 0.7% cantharidin conce ntration matches the dose we used 
in our previous study and is the most commonly used concentrati on for the treatment of molluscum.  
However, it has come to our attention that most practioners reu se the same vial of cantharidin 
multiple times.  Every time a vi al is opened, solvent evaporate s increasing the concentration of 
cantharidin.  In reality, the co ncentration of cantharidin many  patients receive is likely closer to 1.0%. 
Therefore, in order to more closely match historical concentrat ions, we would like to evaluate up to a 
1.0% cantharidin concentration. 
  While most dermatologists who use cantharidin for the treatmen t of molluscum ask that patients 
wash off study material after 4- [ADDRESS_1019478], and the lack of 
reported systemic exposure following dermal application, this s tudy will enroll approximately 16 
completed patients. 
 Specimens will be collected and stored at Montefiore Clinical R esearch Center at -80 degrees until 
ready to ship.  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_745325], at minimum, monthly to:

Results will be analyzed throug hout the study but results will not be shared with the study staff or 
patients unless a safety concern arises.  
 
The new formulation has a numbe r of safety improvements over fo rmulations previously used 
including: 1) the inclusion of an oral deterrent (denatonium benzoate); 2) inclusion of a colorant 
(gentian violet); 3) the removal of diethyl ether, a highly volatile and potentially explosive solvent; 4) 
use of a highly purified version of the active ingredient canth aridin (purity is now over 99.5%) that 
has been manufactured and released using Good Manufacturing Pra ctice (GMP) protocols. 5) 
packaging in single use vials to ensure a consistent cantharidi n concentration.  
1.1 Investigational agent 
 
   
 
Cantharidin is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_745326].  Its chemical name [CONTACT_832] 2,6-Di methyl-4,10-dioxatricyclo- 
[[IP_ADDRESS],6] decane-3,5-dione, and it is a  type of terpenoid.  The CAS registry number is [56-25-7].  Its 
molecular mass is 196.20 g/mol. 
 Cantharidin is the sole active ingredient in the investigationa l product.  
 Cantharidin 0.7% to 1.0% is prepared for topi[INVESTIGATOR_745327].  Treatment is 
applied in-office, by a trained dermatologist, using the non-co tton end of a wooden applicator stick or 
single use applicator.  Systemic absorption through topi[INVESTIGATOR_745328]; therefore, all lesions may be treated concurrently in an outpatient office setting.  There have been no reports of cantharidin toxicity caused by [CONTACT_745369] a physician.  One trial in MC 
treated a maximum of 20 lesions with no reports of systemic tox icity [Dosal. NCT#00667225].  Another 
trial treated a maximum of 10 lesions with no reports of system ic toxicity [Hanna, 2004].  In our most 
recent study at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein Colle ge of Medicine, we treated up to 50 
lesions in 100 subjects with a very similar formulation to the one that will be used in this protocol and 
noted that the treatment was well-tolerated with no reports of systemic toxicity and no Severe Adverse Events (SAEs).   
 
In the primary study, up to 40 patients will be enrolled in tot al.  These 40 patients will be treated with VP-
102  without occlusion.    In the optional exposure study cohor t , up to 24 additional patients will be 
enrolled  with a goal of  16 pati ents completing all scheduled blood draws. 
 
Study visits are scheduled for ev ery 21 Days to a maximum of 4 treatments (5 office visits total)..  
Subjects enrolled will be treat ed at Visit 1 (Week 0),Visit 2 ( Day 21), Visit 3 (Day 42) and Visit 4 Day 63) 
with a follow-up evaluation at Visit 5 (Day 84, Week 12). Using the wooden end of a Q-tip, (or other application system that will deliver comparable volumes), appli cation volume per lesion is estimated to be 
0.005-0.01 ml.  Application of 500ul of VP-102 0.7% (concentrat ion of 7 mg/ml) would result in the topi[INVESTIGATOR_536057] 3.5 mg.  Patients are instructed to wash trea tment off all lesions with soap and warm 
water the following  morning ( up to 24 hours after application)  or earlier if unmanageable pain or 
significant blistering has occu rred.   Patients are to be cautioned not to use washcloths, abrasive material 
or vigorous rubbing to remove the medication as it might cause temporary pain and damage to the 
external layer of the skin and sl ow the healing process. There will be no occlusion arm in this study as our 
previous study suggest ed this did not improve outcomes.  This i s a twelve-week trial , with all patients set 
to receive up to four doses of t he commercially viable formulat ion.  
 
Any patients who have not complet ely resolved by [CONTACT_4838] 5 (Day 8 4,Week 12) will be assessed and treated 
with what is in the best interest of the patient as determined by [CONTACT_458].  All ongoing 
treatment and follow up at Visit 5 and thereafter will be at th e physician’s discreti on. Patients who may

1.[ADDRESS_1019480] urers to submit efficacy data for 
products.  When manufacturers di d not submit efficacy data, cantharidin was removed from the US 
market.  Following decades of ca lls from dermatologists for rec onsideration of classifi cation, cantharidin 
was reclassified under the FDA’s “Bulk Substances List,” which permits the compounding of bulk 
substances by a physician or pha rmacist on a customized basis f or individual patients.   
 Literature on the efficacy of c antharidin is lacking.  Experien ce is cited primarily in anecdotal reports, 
retrospective reviews, or lette rs to the editor.  Prospective s tudies are lacking.  D ermatologists do, 
however, recognize the efficacy  of this treatment.  The American Association of Dermatology cited 
cantharidin as a ‘Topic of Inte rest’ for the 2012 Clinical Symposia, with a call for experience to 
Association members.    
 
When ingested by [CONTACT_1978], the oral Lethal Dose low  (LDlow) is re ported as 0.428 mg/kg (NLM Toxinet 
ChemID plus, 2016), with a lethal  dose reported as low as 10 mg (Till et al, 1981).  However, there have 
been cases of patients surviving doses up to 175 mg (Oaks et al  1960). 
 
We recently completed a study of 0 .7% cantharidin in molluscum pateints under the same open IND.  The 
full results of the study are in  the process of being submitted  for published.  Howev er, an abstract of the 
draft manuscipt shown below demonstates the safety of this investigational agent. 
 
Abstract  
Importance: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a c ommon viral infection of the s kin primarily affecting 
children. It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_745329], disfiguring, and contagious. Since, there are no FDA-approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the need for a safe and effective remedy is essential.  
Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_521967] 0.7% compared to placebo in the 
treatment of pediatric MC. 
Design Double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial followed by [CONTACT_745370]. Data was analyzed with 
an intention-to-treat and last-obs ervation-carried-forward model. 
Setting  Participants were recruited fr om general and pediatric dermatology clinics at an academic 
medical center in Bronx, [LOCATION_001]. Participants  Ninety-four participants aged [ADDRESS_1019481] 2012 through November 2015. Follow- up was completed by [CONTACT_36466] 2016. 
Interventions Participants were randomized blindly to four treatment groups: cantharidin 0.7% topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
cantharidin 0.7% topi[INVESTIGATOR_564214] o cclusion, placebo, and placebo w ith occlusion. Treatments were applied 
every three weeks.  After week 6, participants were treated with open-label, cantharidin 0.7% without 
occlusion until all MC resolved.  
Main Outcome and Measures The primary endpoint was total clearance. Secondary endpoints i ncluded 
lesion count, time to total clear ance, adverse events and patie nt-reported side effects.  
Results The 94 participants enrolled had  a mean of 22.2 (SD 12.9) lesio ns at baseline. After 6 weeks, 
total clearance was significantly  higher in the cantharidin (30 .4%) and cantharidin with occlusion (41.7%) 
groups compared to those in the placebo (13.6%) and placebo wit h occlusion groups (8.0%) (χ
2(3, N=94) 
= 9.58, p < 0.05). Furthermore, lesion counts were significantly lower in the groups receiving cantharidin 
compared to placebo (F(1.513, 136.1) = 12.06, p <0.0005). In the open-label phase, the median time to 
clearance was 9 weeks and 85. 9% of the participants had complet e resolution. While parents reported 
varying degrees of inflammation immediately following treatment , there were no adverse reactions 
otherwise documented in the b linded or open label extension phases of this study.

1.3 Overview of preclinical data 
 Preclinical data of cantharidin focuses primarily on cantharidi n’s effect on epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], endothelial cells, 
various carcinoma cells, and myocardial cells.  Data most germa ne to the current study are those 
examining the effect of cantharidin on epi[INVESTIGATOR_73915].  Cantha ridin is absorbed through the lipid layer of 
the skin, inducing acantholysis a nd desmosome disruption of the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_745331].  The result is a 
small blister, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_745332] 2-3 days without scarri ng.

[ADDRESS_1019482], and the lack of reported syste mic exposure following dermal application, 
this study will enroll approximately 16 completed patients.  
2.2 Proposed clinical research protocol 
 
The proposed study  will examine the efficacy and safety of a commercially-viable cantharidin formulation 
produced under GMP for the treat ment of MC. The primary efficac y outcome measure will compare the 
percent of patients totally cl eared following four treatments o f either cantharidin .  Secondary efficacy 
outcome measures will include: patient-reported outcomes, time from treatment to resolution, durability of 
cantharidin treatment response, partial clearance by [CONTACT_745371] a comparison to data generated in 
our previous study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
 
An additional, optional cohort of patients will be added to thi s study where the primary objective is to 
evaluate the possible systemic exposure to cantharidin from a s ingle dermal application of VP-[ADDRESS_1019483] application of VP-
102 (Day 1) and at 2 (± 30 minut es), 6 (± 1 hour ) and 24 (±3 h ours) hours post-applic ation. Blood will not 
be collected on subsequent applic ations of the study drug (Days  21, 42, and 63). Patients will be asked to 
return to the clinic within appr oximately24 hou rs of treatment for assessment and to obtain an additional 
blood sample. A 24-hour phone number  is provided for patients t o call where they w ill receive guidance 
on how to manage any adverse experiences that may arise.

Primary Study Design 
 
Up to [ADDRESS_1019484] treatment. Patients will be treated at Visit 1 (We ek 0), Visit 2 (Day 
21,Week 3), Visit 3 (Day 42, W eek 6), and Visit 4 (Day 64, Week  9) if needed with a final, follow-up 
evaluation at Visit 5 (Day 84 , Week 12).  Usi ng the wooden end of a Q-tip (or other application system 
that will deliver comparable volu mes), application volume per l esion is estimated to be 0.005-0.01 ml.  
Application of cantharidin 0.7% to 1.0% (concentration of 7 mg/ ml) to 50 lesions would result in topi[INVESTIGATOR_536057] 3.5 mg - 5.0 mg.  Patients are instructed to wash treatment off all lesions with soap and 
warm water the morning following application (up to 24 hours af ter application) or earlier if pain becomes 
unmanageable or significant blistering has occurred. Please see  safety monitoring plan with detailed 
patient safety issues.   
 
All patients who have not had fu ll clearing of lesions will be treated as the Principal Investigator/Sub-
Investigator deems appropriate  following their completion of the last study visit Visit 5/Day 84. This 
additional treatment will not be a part of our primary endpoint  data and a compounded formulation will be 
used for treatment rather than VP-102.  Full enrollment is anti cipated to take 7-9 months based upon the 
frequency of MC seen in the pedi atric clinic population.

Exposure Cohort Design 
 Up to 24 patients will be enrolled in total with a goal of 16 w hom complete all scheduled blood draws in 
the study.  Due to scheduling co nsiderations, the screening per iod for this cohort per mits screening up to 
14 days prior to Day 1 (baseline  treatment). Patient’s eligibil ity will be reassessed p rior to treatment. In the 
event the patient no longer wishe s to participate in this cohor t or they no longer qualify due to lesion 
count, they may be continued in the main study.  For this study , up to 2 mL of blood for plasma will be 
collected on Visit Day 1, before application of VP-102 (baseline) and at 2(± 30 minutes)  and 6 hours (± 1 hour) post-application.  In additi on, patients will be asked to  return within 24 hours (±3 hours) the next day 
for an assessment and blood draw . Subjects will remain in the clinic for up to 8 hours in order to complete 
all study-related activities; age appropriate entertainment is available as needed.  Blood will not be 
collected following subsequent applications with the study drug  (Day 21, 42, and 63) or on the End of 
Study visit, Day 84.  In order to  evaluate exposure under maxim al use conditions we would like to 
understand what the possible exposure is in younger patients an d will therefore aim to collect plasma 
from at least [ADDRESS_1019485] visit, patients will be asked to remove the stud y drug before the 24-hour clinic visit.  
Subsequent treatment v isits will be managed as in the primary s tudy design as described above. 
 
Primary Endpoint of Primary Study  
The primary endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve total clearance, as defined as 100% 
reduction in baseline MC count b y week six (Day 42) and twelve (Day 84) of the study.  In order to 
appropriately track the outcome  of the treated molluscum lesions, all will be documented as follows at 
each visit: 1) photographs of the most severely affected area(s ); 2) plotting of those most notable on a 
body map; and 3) recording the number of lesion(s) in each anat omic location: head/neck, trunk, upper 
extremity (left, right), lower extremity (left, right) (attache d Case Report Form). Additionally, a 
questionnaire will be utilized to record safety and efficacy me asures for each vis it.  Secondary endpoints 
include the percentage of subjects who achieve a clearance of a t least 90% of their molluscum lesions, 
the change in the Children’s Derm atology Life Quality Index (CD LQI) (attached) given Visit [ADDRESS_1019486] treatment and on Visit 5 (or  the last visit) and a compar ison to the efficacy data obtained in our 
previous study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) after 2 treatments (a comparison will be made to both the VP-[ADDRESS_1019487] igational drug. The primary endpoint is the 
percentage of patients who achi eve total clearance, as defined as 100% reduction in  baseline MC count.   
 
The unit of analysis is clearance.  Data will be summarized usi ng descriptive characteristics for subject 
and lesion variables.  A bivariate comparison between the indep endent variable (lesion clearance) and 
the independent variables (age, gender, race and/or ethnicity, lesion location, will be performed using 
Chi-square analysis.  All statis tical analyses will be performe d with the SAS statistical software package 
(Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).  
The unit of analysis is procedure.  A bivariate comparison betw een our dependent variable and our 
independent variables (age, gender, race, location of lesion, a nd region of country) will be performed 
using chi-square analysis.  A Mantel-Haenszel analysis will 
 be used to address possible confounding and 
effect modification.  All statistical analyses will be performed with the SAS statistical software package (Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Similar analyses will be done to investigate the secondary endpoints. 
 
Subject data will be maintained on a protected database with re stricted access to only those indicated in 
the informed consent documentation.   
 
Method of Analysis of Exposure Arm: 
Plasma will be evaluated by a GLP -compliant third party vendor for the presence of cantharidin using a 
validated GC/MS analytical method (MET012 .v1).  The unit of analysis is ng/ml with a limit of detection of 
1ng/ml of plasma.

effects for patient  and family members to take notice of are p ain and blistering (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]).   
Unexpected, but rarely report ed side effects are as follows:  T here has been one case report of toxic 
shock syndrome following compounded cantharidin treatment for M C when a treated area came in 
contact [CONTACT_745372], resulting in a large blister that bec ame secondarily infected with a toxin-
producing bacteria.  T here have been two case reports of lympha ngitis and one case of subsequent 
lymphedema after using cantharidin in the treatment of plantar warts (Stazzone et al, 1998, Dilaimy et al, 
1975).  However, since th ese cases of lymphangitis occurred whe n cantharidin was used for a different 
indication (plantar warts) and in a different protocol, these c ases of lymphangitis were not disclosed in the 
consent forms in order to a void patient confusion.   
 
Safety monitoring  
At each follow-up visit, the pat ient will be interviewed and as ked to fill out a safety-monitoring 
questionnaire before treatm ent.  Questions will include: 
1. Have you noticed any changes  in your condition (including le sion resolution/development) since 
your last VP-102 cantharidin treatment? 
2. Have there been any changes i n your overall health (includin g illnesses or injuries) since your last 
visit? 
3. Did you experience any side effects while on the VP-102 cant haridin? 
4. Are you taking any new medications? 
5. Do you have any other comments/concerns about this treatment (VP-102, cantharidin)?  
 
An active assessment of systemi c drug safety will be assessed a t every visit, including past medical 
history, vital signs and a thor ough review of systems (attached  Case Report Form Worksheets for Study 
Visits).  Subjects will be monitored closely for both common an d rare side effects.  The most commonly 
reported side effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_745338], dermal bullae, and post-inflammatory

It is expected that pat ients enrolled in the Primary cohort will not need more than [ADDRESS_1019496] be notifi ed prior to using vials from o ther kits or bulk supp ly. A specific plan will 
be outlined for each patient on a case-by-case basis. 
 
Patients enrolled in the Exposure cohort will be treated with a n additional bulk supply shipment of 
applicators numbered 001-120.  Exposur e cohort patients will be numbere d in sequential order as E001-
E024. This will allow for the intended goal of 16 patients to be treated. Vial numbe rs are used for 
accountability purposes only and are recorded on the accountabi lity log as they are used. Vials do not 
need to be used in sequential order.

There is no available information on pollution hazards for cant haridin, but it is unlikely to cause 
environmental damage.  A laboratory study evaluated the effect of cantharidin in blister beetles on the 
health of livestock.  Results showed that blister beetles crush ed in the fields and subsequently ingested 
by [CONTACT_745374] a greater heal th risk than cantharidin-contam inated hay free of blister beetles (Blodgett 
et al, 1992).  The investigators request categorical exclusion from any environmental analysis 
requirements.

4 PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY 
 
Cantharidin 0.7% to 1.0% Exposure Limits (route, species) LD50: 1mg/kg (IPR, mouse) 
LD50: 1710 Ug/kg (IPR, mammal) 
LDLo: 0.428 mg/kg (oral, human) 
 
Toxicology Data: Inhalation:  Exposure to vapors ma y cause irritation or dizzine ss 
Skin/eye contact (localized irri tation):  Highly irritating to skin and eyes.  Following contact [CONTACT_37381], it 
may cause blisters, pricklin g, and a burning sensation. 
Ingestion (systemic):  Poison; potentially fatal if ingested. 
 Extremely hazardous in the case o f skin contact (irritant), of eye contact (irritant), of ingestion, of 
inhalation.  Very hazardous in t he case of skin contact (permea tor).  Hazardous in the case of skin 
contact (corrosive).  Severe over-exposure can result in death.   Inflammation of the eye is characterized 
by [CONTACT_12070], watering, and itching .  Skin inflammation is charac terized by [CONTACT_192993], scaling, reddening, or, 
occasionally, blistering. 
(PCCA Cantharidin Material Dat a Safety Sheet, Revised June 2011 .  PCCA, Inc.) 
 
Given the topi[INVESTIGATOR_745343] o f reports of adverse 
events with topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407] , the investigators have conclud ed that it is reasonabl y safe to conduct the 
proposed clinical investigation.  A trained medical professiona l will apply cantharidin in a controlled 
manner.  There has only been one reported ca se of a serious sid e effect after topi[INVESTIGATOR_745344], which was due to a bacterial superinfection causin g toxic shock syndrome.  All other reported 
side effects are local irritati on.  Serious skin side effects a re usually due to improper application onto 
normal skin or from using mo re than the recommended dose.   
 Toxicology Data on Excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
 Acetone:  Acetone is a naturally occurring chemical found both at low le vels in the human body and in 
many FDA approved prescription and OTC drug products. Products with labels claiming 100% acetone 
are available for topi[INVESTIGATOR_745345]-polish r emover. Acetone has been used in FDA 
approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_745346] 12.69%, according to the FDA IID (2016).  A dose 
of 0.2 mL (which is approximat ely equal to 157mg/20g or 7,850mg /KG) is recorded as a No Observed 
Adverse Event Level (NOAEL) val ue in in murine chronic exposure  studies. In this study, we estimate the 
maximum possible exposure at ~412mg (or 34.3mg/kg when scaled t o the average 12kg 2 -year old girl), 
or more than [ADDRESS_1019497] patients who can enroll in 
the study.  Ethanol:  Ethanol has been previously approved for use in topi[INVESTIGATOR_261113] p roducts in amounts up to 91.07% 
according to the FDA Inactive I ngredient Database (IID) (2016).    
 Castor Oil:  Castor Oil has been previously approved for use in topi[INVESTIGATOR_745347] g products in amounts up to 
14.9%, according to the FDA IID (2016).  Nitrocellulose:  When combined with an appropriate  solvent, nitrocellulose is a film-forming mixture that 
is found in many FDA approved OT C drug products .  Corn, callus,  and wart removing drug products are 
often found in collodion-like vehi cles comprised of solvents, n itrocellulose, and plasticizers and are 
generally recognized as safe and e ffective by [CONTACT_745375][INVESTIGATOR_2855] a pplication as over-the counter (OTC) 
products (21 CFR 358.503).  
 
Hydroxypropyl Cellulose:  Hydroxypropyl Cellulose has been previously approved for use i n topi[INVESTIGATOR_745348] 4%, a ccording to the FDA IID (2016). 
 Camphor:  Historically, camphor has been used as an active ingredient fo r its analgesic effect and has 
been found by [CONTACT_745376][INVESTIGATOR_745349] – 16-10-195  page 16 
Montefiore Medical Center/Alber t Einstein College of Medicine 
Division of Dermatology, PI - Steven R. Cohen, MD, MPH 
concentrations up to 11% (44 FR [ZIP_CODE]; December 4, 1979). In th is formulation, camphor is being used 
as a plasticizer in order to inc rease the flexibility and resil iency of the nitrocellulose  film.  This is a historic 
use of camphor, where it makes up one component of what is know n as flexible collodion, frequently 
utilized in over-the-counter products and currently used formul ations of cantharidin.  
 
Denatonium Benzoate: Denatonium benzoate has been used in FDA approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_745350] 0.0003% a ccording to the FDA IID (2016).  However, a 0.0003% solution of 
denatonium benzoate in the VP-[ADDRESS_1019498]-

4.1 Pharmacodynamics 
4.1.1 Primary pharmacodynamics 
Cantharidin, a known protein pho sphatase inhibitor, is absorbed by [CONTACT_745377][INVESTIGATOR_745352] s that cause degeneration of the 
desmosomal plaque, leading to detachment of tonofilaments from desmosomes.  This process 
results in acantholysis and the  formation of an intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_745353].  Since the lesions are intra-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915], they heal without scarring (Moed et al, 2001). 
 Cantharidin does not have a dire ct effect on the MCV, but it is  thought to induce an inflammatory 
response that speeds recovery.  
 
4.2 Safety pharmacology 
 
For this protocol, VP-102, (investigationa l product) will be ap plied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897].  No amount of investigational 
product will be given to the subjects (i.e. no subject will hav e possession of the investigational product as 
it will be applied in the office by [CONTACT_128490]).   
Effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086]:  
– Reported effects of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] c antharidn application include mi ld irritation and inflammation to burns, 
blistering, and ulceration.  Temporary post-inflammatory hyperp igmentation may occur with topi[INVESTIGATOR_745354] (Silverbe rg et al, 2000).  Cantharidin is absorbed through the lipid layer of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_745355], and i t is possible that with extensive cutaneous exposure (likley greater than 
1ml), it may cause systemic toxici ty with diaphoresis, tachycardia, hematuria, and o liguria.  (MEDITEXT® 
Medical Managements.  Cantharidin .  Accessed 11 De c 2011)  When  used in the treatment of warts, 
annular warts occasionally devel op at the site of cantharidin a dministration (Fund et al, 1979). 
– Allergic reactions to certain c antharidin formulations have o ccurred, consisting of inflammation, 
tenderness, edema, and ulceration with secondary lymphatic resp onses, such as lymphangitis and 
lymphedema (MEDITEXT® Medical Managements.  Cantharidin.  Acces sed 11 Dec 2011) 
  
Effects of oral administration: 
IRB Application – 16-10-195  page 17 
Montefiore Medical Center/Alber t Einstein College of Medicine 
Division of Dermatology, PI - Steven R. Cohen, MD, MPH 
– Neurological effects – generalized seizures, ataxia, and incre ased deep tendon reflexes have 
been reported in cantharidin poisoning, although this appears t o be unusual (Karras et al, 1996). 
 
– Cardiovascular effects – the mo st common cardiac effect noted in cantharidin poisoning by 
[CONTACT_745378] .  Hypotension has been reported with the ingestion of large amounts 
of cantharidin.  Autopsy studies  have revealed pericardial and subendocardial hemorrhages, 
particularly in the intraventri cular septum.  Controlled human studies have found dose-related 
myofibril degeneration and mitoc hondrial swelling.  ECG abnorma lities related to cantharidin 
ingestion have been reported and include ST segment elevation i n inferior limb leads and anterior 
precordial leads, as well as transient T wave inversions.  Ventricular ectopy, asystole, ventricular 
tachycardia and fibrillation have also been reported (Karras et  al, 1996). 
 
– Pulmonary effects – lung injury is an infrequent cause of morb idity in cantharidin poisoning and 
is usually not permanent.  Ther e have been reports of gross pul monary edema, bronchial 
hemorrhage, and subpleural hemorrh ages in cases of fatal cantha ridin poisoning.  H yperventilation 
has also been noted (Karras et al, 1996). 
 
– Renal effects – cantharidin is excreted by [CONTACT_745379], and its life-threatening effects are 
secondary to its renal toxicity.  Symptoms include lumbar pain,  polyuria, dysuria, urinary frequency, 
and hematuria, which may persis t for up to 15 days.  Acute tubu lar necrosis may occur, causing 
death.  Gross pathology of cantharidi n poisoning show renal eng orgement with hemorrhage into the 
renal pelvis.  Microscopy shows edema of Bowman’s capsule and b asement membrane with 
sloughed epi[INVESTIGATOR_745356].  The lowe r genitourinary tract shows multiple 
petechial hemorrhages.  Hemorr hagic bullae have been found in t he bladder (Karras et al, 1996). 
 
– Gastrointestinal (GI) effects – when ingested, cantharidin has  a vesicant effect on the upper GI 
tract.  It induces burni ng and blistering of the mouth, tongue,  oropharynx, dysphagia, abdominal 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], vomiting, and hemate mesis.  If cantharid in passes into the lower GI tract, it can induce 
diarrhea, hematochezia, and t enesmus.  It may also induce fatal  GI hemorrhage.  The presence of 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_745357].  Fatty changes  and parenchymatous degeneration 
of the liver may be seen in severe cases (Karras et al, 1996). 
 
– Abuse liability – when not appli ed in the office, it may be im properly used, causing large blisters 
or burns.  Cantharidin  has been known for its aphrodisiac potential when ingested, and cases of 
severe poisoning have been report ed when used for this purpose.  However there is no data on 
abuse or dependence potential 
 
– Other effects  – Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_745358] m en and vascular engorgement in w omen have been noted in 
cantharidin poisoning (Moed , 2001).  There is one report of low -grade disseminated intravascular 
coagulation associated with cant haridin poisoning (Karras et al, 1996).   
 
 
4.3 Pharmacokinetics 
4.3.1 Absorption – Cantharidin is absorbed throu gh the lipid layer of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_281179] l cell 
membrane.  Ingestion results in s ystemic absorption through the  GI tract.  Onset may be as 
soon as 10 minutes with large doses or take several hours.  Ora l absorption is enhanced by 
[CONTACT_745380], oils, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
 
4.3.2 Distribution – When ingested, circulating cantharidin binds to albumin.  
 
4.3.3 Metabolism – Unknown.  
 
4.3.4 Excretion – When ingested, cantharidin is eliminated slowly by [CONTACT_8212].

4.4 Pharmacology summary 
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_745359] n results in intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] b lister formation due to acantholysis and 
disruption of the desmosome co mplex in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Cantharidin is known to be a protein 
phosphatase inhibitor but its mechanism of action in MC is unkn own.   
 
4.5 Pharmacology conclusions 
 Cantharidin is postulated to speed the recovery in MC through l ocal irritation and induction of the body’s 
inflammatory immune response.

4.7 Genetic toxicology 
 There is currently no publica lly available data on the mutagenic or genotoxic potential of cantharidin.  
However, the sponsor has conducted a GLP mutagenesis study and cantharidin was found to be non-
mutagenic.  Cantharidin was not e valuable for clastogenic poten tial according to ICH guidelines in an in 
vitro micronucleus assay. 
  
4.8 Carcinogenicity 
 IARC Carcinogen Rating 3.  Canthar idin is not yet classifiable regarding carcinogenicity to humans.  
There are no studies on the potential carcinogenicity in humans .  Cantharidin acted as a weak but 
complete carcinogen in mice following topi[INVESTIGATOR_59407]; howe ver, carcinomas did not appear before 16 
months of observation ( Laerum et al, 1972).

There were no studies found on po ssible reproductive effects of  cantharidin in humans or experimental 
animals.  However, various cantharidin-containing preparations have been used orally to induce abortion 
(Cheng et al, 1990, Moed et al , 2001).  There is no data availa ble about cantharidin’s effect on 
breastfeeding.  It is Pregnancy Class C (no reproductive data f ound).

by [CONTACT_745382] a trained professio nal.  The use of cantharidin by [CONTACT_745383]-dates the Food, Drug, and Co smetic Act of 1938, and met the  safety requirements there in.  The FDA 
amended the Act in [ADDRESS_1019503] ug Efficacy Study Implementa tion, which required manufacturers to 
submit efficacy data for produc ts.  When manufacturers did not submit efficacy data, cantharidin was 
removed from the US market.  Follo wing decades of calls from de rmatologists for reconsideration of 
classification, cantharidin was reclassified under the FDA’s “B ulk Substances List,” which permits the 
compounding of bulk substances b y a physician or pharmacist on a customized basis for individual 
patients.  
 
Cantharidin is available in Can ada under the trade name [CONTACT_745386].  Canthacur is indicated for  the

Our group recently completed a double-blind placebo controlled study in 94 patients under IND 114032.  
The Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier is NCT026 [ZIP_CODE].The interim results were presented in a 
poster at the 41st Society of Pediatric Dermatology meeting.  A  full manuscript is in the process of being 
submitted for publication, but the abstract of the draft manusc ript is below: 
Abstract  
Importance: Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a c ommon viral infection of the s kin primarily affecting 
children. It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_745329], disfiguring, and contagious. Since, there are no FDA-approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the need for a safe and effective remedy is essential.  
Objective To determine the efficacy and safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_521967] 0.7% compared to placebo in the 
treatment of pediatric MC. 
Design Double-blind, placebo-controlled  trial followed by [CONTACT_745370]. Data was analyzed with 
an intention-to-treat and last-obs ervation-carried-forward model. 
Setting  Participants were recruited fr om general and pediatric dermatology clinics at an academic 
medical center in Bronx, [LOCATION_001]. 
Participants  Ninety-four participants aged [ADDRESS_1019507] 2012 through November 2015. Follow- up was completed by [CONTACT_36466] 2016. 
Interventions Participants were randomized blindly to four treatment groups: cantharidin 0.7% topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 
cantharidin 0.7% topi[INVESTIGATOR_564214] o cclusion, placebo, and placebo w ith occlusion. Treatments were applied 
every three weeks.  After week 6, participants were treated with open-label, cantharidin 0.7% without 
occlusion until all MC resolved.  
Main Outcome and Measures The primary endpoint was total clearance. Secondary endpoints i ncluded 
lesion count, time to total clear ance, adverse events and patie nt-reported side effects.  
Results The 94 participants enrolled had  a mean of 22.2 (SD 12.9) lesio ns at baseline. After 6 weeks, 
total clearance was significantly  higher in the cantharidin (30 .4%) and cantharidin with occlusion (41.7%) 
groups compared to those in the placebo (13.6%) and placebo wit h occlusion groups (8.0%) (χ2(3, N=94) 
= 9.58, p < 0.05). Furthermore, lesion counts were significantly lower in the groups receiving cantharidin 
compared to placebo (F(1.513, 136.1) = 12.06, p <0.0005). In the open-label phase, the median time to 
clearance was 9 weeks and 85. 9% of the participants had complet e resolution. While parents reported 
varying degrees of inflammation immediately following treatment , there were no adverse reactions 
otherwise documented in the b linded or open label extension phases of this study. 
Conclusions and Relevance For treatment of molluscum contagiosum, topi[INVESTIGATOR_745330] t adverse events. These findings 
demonstrate that cantharidin is  an effective and safe treatment  for MC when applied in-office by a health 
care professional.

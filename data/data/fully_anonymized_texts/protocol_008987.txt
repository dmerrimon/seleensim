Amendment number  5 
Rationale/background for changes:  
This protocol amendment  5 outlines measures that may be applicable during special 
circumstances (e.g., during COVID -19 pandemic). The purpose of the amendment is to 
introduce measures that may allow protection of subject’s welfare and safety, as well as 
maintaining the integrity of the study.  
This amendment is considered substantial  based on the criteria defined in Article  10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union  because it significantly impacts the safety of subjects or/nor the scientific value 
of the study.   
As much as possible all study specified visits and procedures  should be completed 
according to the protocol, taking into account clinical judgment and local public health 
guidance to protect the safety of staff and subjects.  
Section 6. 6 outlines the measures which include allowing flexibility in schedule and 
procedu res to optimize site staff safety, patient safety  and to preserve study integrity . 
Other change s include , 
• The classification of HZ cases by [CONTACT_723705] 
“not able to decide” to be classified as “not HZ” to Section 4.5.2 .4.2 for 
confirmation of suspected HZ by [CONTACT_723706] . 
• The timelines concerning data entry into the eCRF  for [LOCATION_009] in  Section 13.[ADDRESS_988100] of all the  changes.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020 9 SYNOPSIS  
Detailed Title  A phase IIIb, open -label, multi -country, multi -centre, long -term 
follow -up study (ZOE -LTFU) of studies 110390 and 113077 
(ZOSTER -006/022) to assess the prophylactic efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity persistence of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Herpes 
Zoster subunit (HZ/su) vaccine and assessment of 1 or 2 
additional doses on a 0 or 0, 2 -month schedule in two subgroups 
of older adults.  
Indication  Prevention of Herpes Zoster (HZ ) and related complications in 
adults aged 50 years and older and in immunocompromised (IC) 
adults aged 18 years and older.  
Rationale for the 
study and study 
design  •Rationale for the study
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ study  vaccine for the 
prevention of HZ, is a recombinant subunit (su) vaccine 
consisting of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) glycoprotein E (gE) 
as antigen and an adjuvant system (AS01), has been and is being 
evaluated in several studies in older adults and 
immunocompromised ad ults. In these studies, it was shown to 
elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses. 
Furthermore, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the study  
vaccine was clinically acceptable. Based on phase II data from 
the antigen dose -ranging study, ZOSTER -003, and the adjuvant 
dose comparison study, ZOSTER -010, a gE antigen dose of 50 
g and the adjuvant system AS01 B were selected for the final 
vaccine formulation. Henceforth, th e final vaccine formulation 
will be referred to as HZ/su. The results of the previous studies in 
older adults demonstrated strong vaccine -induced immune 
responses following HZ/su administration at 0 and 2 months, 
supporting the selection of a 2 -dose vaccin e schedule.  
Two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_723617] -50 and ZOE -70 that 
enrolled subjects  50 and  70 years of age (YOA) respectively,  
evaluat ed the vaccine efficacy (VE) , immunogenicity and safety 
of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HZ/su vaccine. These trials , hereafter  
referred to as ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022, respectively and 
collectively referred to as the ZOSTER -006/022 studies , enrolled 
more than 30,000 subjects who either received the HZ/su vaccine 
or placebo on a 0, 2 -month schedule.  
The final HZ/su VE results from the ZOSTER -006 phase III trial  
demonstrated the HZ/su vaccine to be highly efficacious in the 
prevention of HZ overall and in all age strata  and available safety 
data until the data lock point raised no safety concerns in this 
population of subjects  50 YOA. The results for the ZOSTER -201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0
CONFIDENTIAL  
201190 (ZOSTER -049 EXT:006 -022) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020 10 022 study  demonstrated that the HZ/su vaccine reduced the risks 
of HZ and PHN among adults  70 YOA . 
Since the mean follow -up period for VE at the time of the final 
analysis in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies was abou t four years, 
further follow -up for long term efficacy assessment is needed, in 
order to establish that the HZ/su vaccine provides not only strong, 
but also persistent protection.  
This study will also assess the immunogenicity responses of 1 or 
2 additiona l doses in two subgroups of older adults who 
previously received two doses of the HZ/su vaccine in the 
ZOSTER -006/022 studies. If over time, VE of HZ/su wanes, 
additional vaccination with HZ/su could be needed to prevent HZ 
and its complications. Knowing i f 1 or 2 additional doses of 
HZ/su vaccine can stimulate the immune response again, could 
support the concept of providing additional doses with the 
expectation that this may translate into preserving VE.  
•Rationale for the study design
The primary objectiv e of this study is to assess the efficacy of the 
HZ/su vaccine in the prevention of HZ. The data from this study 
will also be analysed combined with ZOSTER -006/022 data 
(analysis over the full duration of the follow -up in the primary 
ZOSTER -006/022 studies  and the ZOSTER -049 study). 
Persistence of immunogenicity and long -term safety of the HZ/su 
vaccine administered in ZOSTER -006/022 will also be evaluated. 
Safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity one month after 1 or 
2 additional doses of the HZ/su vacci ne in subjects who 
previously received 2 doses of the vaccine in the primary 
ZOSTER -006/022 studies will also be assessed to further support 
evaluation of additional vaccination if it is determined VE wanes 
over time.  
Due to the high VE observed in the ZOS TER -006/022 studies, it 
was considered that subjects having received placebo during both 
studies should be offered cross -vaccination with HZ/su vaccine as 
soon as possible. Since they will be enrolled in a separate cross -
vaccination study, no placebo recip ients will be available for this 
study and historic controls will be used for assessment of VE.  
All subjects that were previously vaccinated with at least one 
dose of the HZ/su vaccine in the ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988104] completed all study -related 
activities in the ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022 studies and when 
their treatment assignment can be released without compro mising 
the integrity of the ZOSTER -006/022 data. Since the interval 201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  11 between the end of the ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988105] and is dependent on 
receipt of approval or implementing the study in the different 
participating countries/centres, the study will analyze the annual 
LTFU data from Year 5 up to Year 10 and annually beyond Year 
10 after the primary vaccination in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies 
(in case samples from these timepoints are collected).  
The study will be comprised of four study groups as follows:  
LTFU Group:  Subjects from this group [N  ≤ 14,000] will be 
followed for VE and safety. In addition, immunogenicity will be 
followed in subjects that were part of the immunogenicity subset 
(HI) in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies and Cell-Mediated 
Immunity (CMI) subset from the ZOSTER -006 study;  
1-Additional Dose Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 60] 
will receive 1 additional dose of the HZ/su vaccine, at the time of 
enrolment, to assess the immunogenicity, reac togenicity and 
safety of 1 additional dose;  
Revaccination Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 60] will be 
revaccinated with 2 additional doses of the HZ/su vaccine, on a 0, 
2-month schedule from the time of enrolment, to assess the 
immunogenicity, reacto genicity and safety of 2 additional doses;  
Control Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 120] will not be 
vaccinated but will serve as a control to assess immunogenicity 
and safety compared to the two vaccinated groups 1 -Additional 
Dose and Revaccination. This Control group will also be used to 
evaluate the VE, s afety and immunogenicity.  
Subjects (N, to be determined) who developed HZ during the 
ZOSTER -006/022 studies (confirmed HZ) and/or during the 
interval between the end of the ZOSTER -006/022 studies and 
beginning of the ZOSTER -049 study, and/or during the 
ZOS TER -049 study (suspected HZ) will be part of the HZ 
subset . 
Subjects from the 1 -Additional Dose and Revaccination groups 
who will develop HZ cases during the ZOSTER -049 study will 
follow the sampling schedule as per their original group and will 
not be par t of the HZ subset.  
Note: Subjects from the immunogenicity subset of studies 
ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988106] subjects who received 2 doses of the 
HZ/su vaccine and were part of the ATP cohort for analysis of 
efficacy in the previous studies ZOSTER -006/022. In order not to 
confound immune responses, subjects who developed HZ prior to 
enrolment in the ZOSTER -049 study (confirmed HZ during the 201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  16  • Sampling schedule:  
All subjects  (N ≤ 14,448) entering the study will have a HI 
blood sample (approximately 5  mL) at Visit Month  0. 
For subjects in the LTFU group, who do not belong to any 
subset, these samples will be stored and tested for HI only if 
the subject develops HZ during the ZOSTER -049 study or if 
there are other reasons requiring the HI testing of these 
samples.  
LTFU Group (HI subset):  Subjects (N  ≤ 1,729) who were in 
the immunogenicity subset during studi es ZOSTER -006/022 
and continue participation in this study. Blood samples 
(approximately 5  mL) will be collected and tested from Visit 
Month  0 to Visit Year  6, on a yearly basis, to assess HI 
responses.  
LTFU Group (CMI subset):  Subjects (N  ≤ 234) who were in 
the CMI subset during study ZOSTER -006 and continue 
participation in this study. Blood samples (approximately 
20 mL) will be collected and tested from Visit Month  0 to 
Visit Year  6 on a yearly basis to assess CMI responses.  
HZ subset:  Subjects (N to be determined) who developed 
confirmed HZ during ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022, or who 
develop HZ during the interval between the end of the 
ZOSTER -006/022 and the beginning of ZOSTER -049, or 
who develop suspected HZ during ZOSTER -049 will be part 
of the HZ subset . Blood sampling for subjects in the HZ 
subset is described below.  
Subjects who develop HZ at any time after enrolment in 
ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022 and who are already part of 
the HI subset in ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022 will provide 
blood samples to assess HI  responses (approximately 5  mL) 
from Visit Month 0 to Visit Year 6 irrespective of when the 
HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_254788]. If these subjects are part of the ZOSTER -
006 CMI subset, then they will also continue to provide blood 
to assess CMI responses (approximately 20  mL).  
Subjects who develop HZ at any time after enrolment in 
ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022 and who were NOT part of 
the HI or CMI subsets in these studies, will provide blood 
samples to assess HI responses (approximately 5  mL) 
beginning at the annual visit in th e ZOSTER -049 study 
subsequent to the occurrence of the HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The blood 
sample taken upon enrolment at Visit Month 0 will be tested 
and included in the analyses for these subjects.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

administered HZ/su vaccine on a 1 -dose schedule at Visit 
Month  0. Blood samples (approximately 5 and 20  mL) will be 
collected at Visit Month  0, Visit Month  1, and from Visit 
Year  1 to Visit Year  6 on a yearly basis to assess HI and  CMI 
responses.  
Revaccination Group:  Subjects (N  = 60) to be administered 
HZ/su vaccine on a 2 -dose schedule at Visit Month  0 and 
Visit Month  2. Blood samples (approximately 5 and 20  mL) 
will be collected at Visit Month  0, Visit Month  1, Visit Month 
3 and from Visit Year  1 to Visit Year  6 on a yearly basis to 
assess HI and CMI responses.  
Control Group:  Subjects (N  = 120) in the non -vaccinated 
control group. Blood samples (approximately 5 and 20  mL) 
will be collected at Visit Month  0, Visit Month  1, Visit 
Month 3 and from Visit Year  1 to Visit Year  6 on a yearly 
basis to assess HI and CMI responses.  
Specimens of HZ lesions  will be collected from subjects 
clinically diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ.  
Refer to Section 6.6 for study procedures to be con sidered during 
special circumstances (Amended 11 May 2020) . 
• Type of study: extension of other protocol(s) , i.e., 110390 
(ZOSTER -006) and 113077 (ZOSTER -022).  
• Data collection: Electronic Case Report Form  (eCRF ). 
Case definition  • Suspected HZ  
A suspected case of HZ is defined as new unilateral rash 
accompanied by [CONTACT_77368] (broadly defined to include allodynia, 
pruritus or other sensations) and no alternative diagnosis.  
Subjects clinically diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ by 
[CONTACT_221753] r eferred to as a case of ‘suspected HZ’, and 
followed up. If a case is not clinically diagnosed as suspected HZ, 
the investigator should not progress further with evaluation of the 
case.  
The HZ onset date is the earlier of the following two events: 1) the 
HZ rash start date; or 2) the date on which pain at the site of a 
subsequent HZ rash is first noted.  
• Confirmed HZ  
A suspected case of HZ can be confirmed in two ways:  
− By [CONTACT_53412] ( PCR);  
− By [CONTACT_723711] (HZAC).  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

201190 (ZOSTER -049 EXT:006 -022) 
Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  18  • Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)  
PHN is defined by [CONTACT_723712] -associated severe ‘worst’ 
pain persisting or appearing more than 90 days after onset of the 
HZ rash.  Severe ‘worst’ pain is defined as HZ -associated pain 
rated as 3 or greater on the “worst pain” question on the Zoster 
Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire.  
• HZ complications  
Any HZ complications will be recorded by [CONTACT_723713] -
specific  eCRF screens, and on the AE/SAE reporting screens as 
appropriate. The reporting period for HZ complications will be 
from Month 0 to study end. If a recorded complication is 
associated with a case of suspected HZ, and that case is finally not 
considered to be a confirmed case, the associated complication 
will not be considered as a complication of H Z. 
Number of 
subjects  Expected number of subjects for enrolment will be up to 14,448 
potentially eligible subjects.

11-MAY -2020  34 GLOSSARY OF TERMS  
Adequate contraception:  Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per year when 
used consistently and correctly and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:  
• abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when 
this is their preferred and usual lifestyle,  
• oral contraceptives, either combined or progestogen 
alone,  
• injec table progestogen,  
• implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel,  
• estrogenic vaginal ring,  
• percutaneous contraceptive patches,  
• intrauterine device or intrauterine system,  
• male partner sterilisation prior to the female 
subject’s entry into the study, and this male is the 
sole partner for that subject,  
The information on the male sterility can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records; or interview with the subject on her 
medical history.  
• male condom combined with a vaginal spermicid e 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository),  
• male condom combined with a female diaphragm, 
either with or without a vaginal spermicide (foam, 
gel, film, cream, or suppository).  
Adequate contraception does not apply to subjects of 
child bearing potential with  same sex partners, when this 
is their preferred and usual lifestyle.  
Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new 
or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, 
this also includes failure to produce expected benefits 
(i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  35 Blinding:  A procedure in which one or more parties to the trial are 
kept unaware of the treatment assignment in order to 
reduce  the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
trial, and only when the data are cleaned to an 
acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be 
unblinded or when required in case of a serious adverse 
event (SAE). In an open -label study, no blind is used. 
Both the investigator and the subject know the identity 
of the treatment assigned.  
Caregiver  Someone who lives in the close surroundings of a 
subject having a continuous caring role or may be 
someone having substantial periods of contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
subject and is engaged in his/her daily health care (e.g. , 
a relative of the subject, a nurse who helps with daily 
activities in case of residence in a nursing home). In a 
context of a clinical study, a caregiver could include an 
individual appointed to oversee and support the subject's 
compliance with protocol specified procedures.  
Eligible:  Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Epoch:  An ep och is a self -contained set of consecutive 
timepoints or a single timepoint from a single protocol. 
Self-contained means that data collected for all subjects 
at all timepoints within that epoch allows to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted 
label of the product. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_723621], boosters, yearly immunogenicity 
follow -ups, and surveillance periods for efficacy or 
safety.  
eTrack:  [COMPANY_004]’s tracking tool for clinical trials.  
Evaluable:  Meeting all eligi bility criteria, complying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, 
included in the according -to-protocol (ATP) analysis.  
Intercurrent Medical 
Condition:  It is defined as a condition with onset during the study 
period that has the capability of confounding the 
immune response to the study vaccine or its 
interpretation. Examples of other IMCs include a 
confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or 
immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., 
HIV infection, malignancy). Occur rence of HZ during 
this study will be considered an intercurrent medical 
condition (IMC).  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  36 Immunological correlate 
of protection:  The defined immune response above which there is a 
high likelihood of protection in the absence of any host 
factors that might  increase susceptibility to the 
infectious agent.  
Investigational 
vaccine/product:  
(Synonym of 
Investigational Medicinal 
Product)  A pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or 
placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical 
trial, including a  product with a marketing authorisation 
when used in a way different from the approved form, or 
when used for an unapproved indication, or when used 
to gain further information about an approved use.  
Menarche:  Menarche is the onset of menses for the first  time in a 
young female and is preceded by [CONTACT_723716]. Menarche usually occurs within 
1-[ADDRESS_988132] development (palpable 
glandular breast tissue).  
Menopause:  Menopause is the age associated with complete 
cessation of menstrual cycles, menses, and implies the 
loss of reproductive potential by [CONTACT_43029]. A 
practical definition accepts menopause after 1 year 
without menses with an appropriate clinical profile a t the 
appropriate age e.g., >  45 years.  
Potential Immune -
Mediated Disease:  Potential immune -mediated diseases (pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]) are a 
subset of AEs that include autoimmune diseases and 
other inflammatory and/or neurologic disorders of 
interest which may or may not have an autoimmune 
aetiology.  
Primary completion date:  The date that the final subject was examined or received 
an intervention for the purpose of final collection of data 
for the primary outcome, whether the clinical trial 
concluded according to the pre -specified protocol or was 
terminated.  
Protocol amendment:  The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
defines a protocol amendment as: ‘A written description 
of a change(s) to or formal clarification of a protocol.’ 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals further details  this to include a change 
to an approved protocol that affects the safety of 
subjects, scope of the investigation, study design, or

11-MAY -2020  39 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background  
Varicella -zoster Virus (VZV) causes two distinct diseases. Varicella (chickenpox) occurs 
shortly after primary VZV infection and is characterised by [CONTACT_348600]  a widely 
disseminated rash. Herpes zoster (HZ), commonly called shingles, occurs when VZV 
reactivates from latency and typi[INVESTIGATOR_96684] a localised, dermatomal rash.  
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_710860] [ADDRESS_988133] common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN is defined 
as pain that persists after the resolution of the HZ rash. Affected patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_723622], throbbing, intermittent sharp or electric sho ck-like pain, or allodynia. 
Older age is a clear risk factor for PHN. Other risk factors may include a severe HZ rash 
and a painful HZ prodrome. PHN tends to improve over a period of months. About 70 -
80% of cases resolve within 1 year, however, in some per sons PHN persists for many 
years [ Dworkin , 2007].  
Other complications of HZ include ophthalmologic, neurological, cutaneous and visceral 
disease, which can result in sever e disability. The most common ocular complications of 
HZ are keratitis and uveitis; other ophthalmologic complications include ptosis, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_227]/scleritis, retinitis, secondary glaucoma and cataract [ Schmader , 2008; Carter , 
2008]. Neurologic complications associated with HZ include myelitis, motor neuropathy, 
ischaemic infarction of the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], aneurysm, and subarachnoid and 
cerebral haemorrhage [ Gilden , 2009; Schmader , 2008].  
Age is the most common risk factor for developi[INVESTIGATOR_384156]. The incidence of HZ is relatively 
constant at 2 -3 cases per 1000 persons per year until age 40, and then increases 
progressively with age: At 50 -59 years of age (YOA) the incidence is  about 5 cases per 
1000 persons per year, and it increases to 10 cases per 1000 persons per year in people 
≥ 60 YOA [ CDC , 2008; Oxman , 2005]. While most HZ incidence data come from the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) and Europe, available data indicate similar incidences of HZ in other 
parts of the world including Japan, Korea, Australia and Latin America [ Araújo , 2007; 
Garcia , 2008; Kang , 2008; Toyama , 2009].  
Half of all HZ cases occur in patients over the age of 60, and individuals who reach [ADDRESS_988134] a 50% chance of having HZ during their lifetime [ Oxman , 2005]. T he risk 
for PHN is also highest in older people with HZ, occurring in 18 -50% of those aged 70 
years and older [ Oxman , 2005; Scott , 2006]. Patients with impaired cell -mediated 
immunity (CMI) due to disease, drug treatment, medical interventions or advanced age 
are at increased risk for the development of HZ [ Cohen , 2007]. Since the loss of VZV -
specific T cell responses as a result of aging or immunosuppression leads to heightened 
susceptibility to HZ, vaccination is considered as a means to reduce the risk  of HZ in 
older adults and immunocompromised persons [ Oxman , 2005 ; Sperber , 1992].  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0
CONFIDENTIAL  
201190 (ZOSTER -049 EXT:006 -022) 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_988135] HZ was evaluated in a large efficacy study 
in which Zostavax  (a live attenuated HZ vaccine that is a high titre preparation of the 
varicella vaccine, Varivax  [both manufactured by [CONTACT_44873] & Co., Inc.]) partially protected 
immunocompetent older adults against HZ [ Oxman , 2005]. In the overall population 
(≥ 60 YOA), Zostavax  reduced the incidence of HZ by 51.3% (p -value < 0.00 1), although 
its eff icacy  decreased with the age of the vaccinee. In particular, vaccine efficacy (VE) 
diminished to 37.6% among persons in older age groups (≥  70 YOA ) [Oxman , 2005]. 
Based on the data from this study, Zostavax  was licensed in the US and other countries. 
In the US, Zostavax  is indicated for prevention of HZ in individuals ≥  50 YOA and older 
[Zostavax  Prescribing information, 2011]. In Australia, Zostavax  is indicated for the 
prevention of HZ, PHN and for reduction of acute and chronic HZ -associated pain in 
individuals ≥  60 YOA, and for the prevention of HZ in individuals 50 -59 YOA [ TGA , 
2015]. In Europe, Zostavax  is indicated for prevention of HZ and PHN in individuals 
≥ 50 YOA [EMEA , 2011]. Zostavax  is contraindicated in persons with 
immunodeficiency due to malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or 
immunosuppressive medical therapy . 
In a short term persistence sub -study of the large efficacy trial (Shingles Prevention 
Study) it was reported that Zostavax  continued to reduce the incidence of HZ and PHN in 
subjects evaluated from 3.3 to 7.8 years after vaccination  [Schmader , 2012 ]. However, 
the recent long-term persistence study of Zostavax  show ed that the VE for three 
outcomes (1. HZ burden of illness [a severity -by-duration measure of HZ pain and 
discomfort]; 2. incidence of PHN; and 3. incidence of HZ) declined from year [ADDRESS_988136] vaccination [Morri son, 2015 ]. 
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals’ study vaccine (Shingrix ) for the prevention of HZ, 
is a recombinant subunit (su) vaccine consisting of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) 
glycoprotein E (gE) as antigen and an adjuvant system (AS01), has been and is being 
evaluated in several studies in older ad ults and immunocompromised adults. In these 
studies it was shown to elicit strong cellular and humoral immune responses. 
Furthermore, the safety and reactogenicity profile of the study vaccine was clinically 
acceptable.  Based on phase II data from the ant igen dose -ranging study, ZOSTER -003, 
and the adjuvant dose comparison study, ZOSTER -010, a gE antigen dose of 50 g and 
the adjuvant system AS01 B were selected for the final vaccine formulation. Henceforth, 
the final vaccine formulation will be referred to  as HZ/su. The results of the previous 
studies in older adults demonstrated strong vaccine -induced immune responses following 
HZ/su administration at 0 and 2 months, supporting the selection of a 2 -dose vaccine 
schedule.  
Two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_723617] -50 and ZOE -70 that enrolled subjects  50 and 
 70 years of age (YOA) respectively, evaluated the vaccine efficacy (VE), 
immunogenicity and safety of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HZ/su vaccine. These trials, hereafter 
referred to as ZOSTER -006 and ZOSTER -022, resp ectively and collectively referred to 
as the ZOSTER -006/022 studies, enrolled more than 30,000 subjects who either received 
the HZ/su vaccine or placebo on a 0, 2 -month schedule.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  41 The final HZ/su VE results from the ZOSTER -006 phase III trial  demonstrated t he HZ/su 
vaccine to be highly efficacious in the prevention of HZ overall and in all age strata  and 
available safety data until the data lock point raised no safety concerns in this population 
of subjects  50 YOA  [Lal, 2015] . The r esults for the ZOSTER -022 study demonstrated 
that the HZ/su vaccine reduced the risks of HZ and PHN among adults  70 YOA 
[Cunningham , 2016] . 
An indication in adults ≥  50 YOA was filed for registration. HZ/su (trade name [CONTACT_384210]) 
was first approved in Canada and the [LOCATION_002] in October 2017.  
Please refer to the curre nt Investigator Brochure (IB) for information regarding the pre -
clinical and clinical studies of HZ/su vaccine.  
1.2. Rationale for the study and study design  
1.2.1.  Rationale for the study  
Since the mean follow -up period for VE at the time of the final analysis in the  ZOSTER -
006/022 studies was about four years, further follow -up for long term efficacy assessment 
is needed in order to establish that the HZ/su vaccine provides not only strong, but also 
persistent protection.  
This study will also assess the immunogenicit y responses of 1 or 2 additional doses in 
two subgroups of older adults who previously received two doses of the HZ/su vaccine in 
the ZOSTER -006/022 studies. If over time, VE of HZ/su wanes, additional vaccination 
with HZ/su could be needed to prevent HZ and its complications. Knowing if 1 or 2 
additional doses of HZ/su vaccine can stimulate the immune response again, could 
support the concept of providing additional doses with the expectation that this may 
translate into preserving VE.  
1.2.2.  Rationale for the s tudy design  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the HZ/su vaccine in the 
prevention of HZ. The data from this study will also be analysed combined with 
ZOSTER -006/022 data (analysis over the full duration of the follow -up in th e primary 
ZOSTER -006/022 studies and the ZOSTER -049 study). Persistence of immunogenicity 
and long -term safety of the HZ/su vaccine administered in ZOSTER -006/022 will also be 
evaluated. Safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity one month after 1 or 2 add itional 
doses of the HZ/su vaccine in subjects who previously received 2 doses of the vaccine in 
the primary ZOSTER -006/022 studies will also be assessed to further support evaluation 
of additional vaccination if it is determined VE wanes over time.  
Due to  the high VE observed in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies, it was considered that 
subjects having received placebo during both of the studies should be offered cross -
vaccination with HZ/su vaccine as soon as possible. Since they will be enrolled in a 
separate cr oss-vaccination study, no placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_723623].  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

studies and when their treatment as signment can be released without compromising the 
integrity of the ZOSTER -006/022 data. Since the interval between the end of the 
ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988139] ementing the study in the different participating 
countries/centres, the study will analyze the annual LTFU data from Year 5 up to Year 10 
and annually beyond Year 10 after the primary vaccination in the ZOSTER -006/022 
studies (in case samples from these t imepoints are collected).  
The study will be comprised of four study groups as follows:  
LTFU Group:  Subjects from this group [N  ≤ 14,000] will be followed for VE and 
safety. In addition, immunogenicity will be followed in subjects that were part of the 
immu nogenicity subset (HI) in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies and Cell-Mediated 
Immunity (CMI) subset from the ZOSTER -006 study;  
1-Additional Dose Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 60] will receive 1 additional 
dose of the HZ/su vaccine, at the time of enrolment , to assess the immunogenicity, 
reactogenicity and safety of 1 additional dose;  
Revaccination Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 60] will be revaccinated with 2 
additional doses of the HZ/su vaccine, on a 0, 2 -month schedule from the time of 
enrolment, t o assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of 2 additional doses;  
Control Group:  Subjects from this group [N  = 120] will not be vaccinated but will serve 
as a control to assess immunogenicity and safety compared to the two vaccinated groups 
1-Additional Dose and Revaccination. This Control group will also be used to evaluate 
the long -term VE, safety and immunogenicity.  
Subjects (N, to be determined) who developed HZ during the ZOSTER -006/022 studies 
(confirmed HZ) and/or during the interval between the end of the ZOSTER -006/022 
studies and beginning of the ZOSTER -049 study, and/or duri ng the ZOSTER -049 study 
(suspected HZ) will be part of the HZ subset.  
Subjects from the 1 -Additional Dose and Revaccination groups who will develop HZ 
cases during the ZOSTER -049 study will follow the sampling schedule as per their 
original group and will not be part of the HZ subset.  
Note: Subjects from the immunogenicity subset of studies ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988140] subjects who receive d 2 doses of the HZ/su

11-MAY -2020  43 1.3. Benefit : Risk Assessment  
Please refer to  the current IB for the summary of potential risks and benefits of HZ/su 
vaccine.  
The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this study 
protocol:  
1.3.1.  Risk Assessment  
Important Potential/Identified 
Risk  Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Investigational HZ/su vaccine  
Theoretical risk of acquiring a 
vaccine induced autoimmune 
disease after vaccination  
(1-Additional Dose and 
Revaccination groups only).  No confirmed signals related to 
this potential risk have been 
identified during the clinical 
program. Available clinical data 
do not highlight any concern.  Close monitoring of pI[INVESTIGATOR_723624].  
The potential risk of events of possible 
autoimmune aetiology to occur is 
mentioned in the ICF. In addition, the 
ICF advises subjects to contact [CONTACT_723719], should they get any 
symptoms that they feel maybe serious.  
Hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis)  No confirmed signals related to 
this potential risk have been 
identified during the clinical 
program. Available clinical data 
do not highlight any concern.  Administration of the study vaccination 
is to be preceded by a review of the 
subjects’ medical history (especially 
with regard to previous vaccination and 
possible occurrence of undesirable 
events) and a clinical examination.  
As with all injectable vaccines, 
appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be readily 
available in case of an anaphylactic 
event following the administration of the 
vaccine.  
Study Procedures  
Risk from blood sampling.  Blood sampling associated risk 
of discomfort, syncope, 
dizziness, infection at the site 
after or during venipuncture.  Blood samples will be obtained by a 
trained professional and medical 
assistance will be available . 
The potential risk of feeling faint, or 
experiencing mild local pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness at the site where 
blood was taken, is mentioned in the 
ICF. The amount of blood to be taken 
for sampling will not be harmful to the 
subject’s h ealth.  
Risk from lesion sampling.  Swab/ needle sampling of 
lesions/crusts associated risk of 
secondary infection, and 
discomfort related to the 
procedure.  Lesion samples will be obtained by a 
trained professional and anti -bacterial 
ointment may be applied  to minimise 
the potential for secondary infection.  
The potential risk of some temporary 
discomfort during the sampling 
procedure and the precautionary use of 
an anti -bacterial ointment to reduce the 
risk of infection are mentioned in the 
ICF. 201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  44 1.3.2.  Benefit Ass essment  
Benefits include:  
• Potential benefit of receiving the study vaccine that may provide a clinical benefit in 
case the VE of HZ/su vaccine wanes over time (for the vaccinated groups 1 -
Additional Dose and Revaccination).  
• Medical evaluations/assessments associated with study procedures [e.g., physical 
examination].  
1.3.3.  Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion  
Taking into account the measures to minimise risk to subjects participating in this study, 
the potential or recognised risks identified in association with the investigational HZ/su 
vaccine and study procedures are offset by [CONTACT_658] (prolonged prevention of 
HZ and related complications in case of waning VE for subjects in the 1 -Additional Dose 
and Revaccination groups, and additional medical follow -up and assessments) that may 
be afforded to the subject(s).

11-MAY -2020  52 4. CASE DEFINITION  
4.1. Suspected HZ  
A suspected case of HZ is defined as new unilateral rash accompanied by [CONTACT_77368] (broadly 
defined to incl ude allodynia, pruritus or other sensations) and no alternative diagnosis.  
Subjects clinically diagnosed as having a suspected case of HZ by [CONTACT_723723] a case of ‘suspected HZ’, and followed up. If a case is not clinically 
diagnosed as suspected HZ, the investigator should not progress further with evaluation 
of the case . Also refer to Section  4.5. 
The HZ onset date is the earlier of the following two events: 1) the HZ rash start date; or 
2) the date on which pain at the site of a subsequent HZ rash is first noted.  
The end date of a HZ  epi[INVESTIGATOR_723627] a subject had no rash 
(papules, vesicles, ulcers or crusts) present. This end date will be recorded in the eCRF.  
The occurrence of HZ will be recorded in HZ -specific eCRF screens.  The reporting 
period for case s of HZ will be from Month 0 to study end.  Refer to Section 4.5 for more 
details on the evaluation and confirmation of suspected HZ cases.  
Subjects who developed c onfirmed HZ during ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022, or who 
develop HZ during the interval between the end of the ZOSTER -006/022 and the 
beginning of ZOSTER -049, or who develop suspected HZ during ZOSTER -049 will be 
part of the HZ subset  (Table  4 and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
4.2. Confirmed HZ  
A suspected case of HZ can be confirmed in two w ays: 
• By [CONTACT_53412] ( PCR):  
Rash lesion samples will be collected from subjects clinically diagnosed as having a 
suspected case of HZ. The samples will be transferred to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals or a 
validated laboratory designated by [CONTACT_723724] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). 
• By [CONTACT_723711] (HZAC):  
All suspected HZ cases will be referred to the HZAC. The HZAC will classify all 
referred cases as either “HZ” or “not HZ”  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
4.3. Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)  
PHN is defined by [CONTACT_723712] -associated severe ‘worst’ pain persisting or 
appearing more than 90 days after onset of the HZ rash.  Severe ‘worst’ pain is defined as 
HZ-associated pain rated as 3 or greater on the “worst  pain” question on the Zoster Brief 
Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire  (see Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] ). 201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  53 Cessation of pain to assess duration of HZ -associated pain: A 28 -day pain -free period is 
used to confirm cessation of HZ -associated pain.   
Acute pain is defined as pain measured during the 4 -week period following the onset of 
confirmed HZ.  
4.4. HZ complications  
Any HZ complications listed below will be recorded by [CONTACT_723713] -specific 
eCRF screens, and on the AE/SAE reporting screens. The reporting period for HZ 
complications will be from Month 0 to study end. Any HZ complications, according to 
the definitions below, will be recorded by [CONTACT_093]. If a recorded complication is 
associated with a case of suspected HZ, and that case is finally not considered to be a 
confirmed ca se, the associated complication will not be considered as a complication of 
HZ.

4.5.1.  Definitions  
Refer to Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 for definitions of suspected HZ, confirmed HZ 
PHN and HZ complications, respectively.  
For all subjects in case of a suspected or confirmed case of HZ:  
HZ-specific diary card: To be completed by [CONTACT_1766] (or subject’s caregiver) who 
develop symptoms suggestive of HZ beginning immediately upon development of these 
symptoms and prior to visiting the study site for evaluation of the suspected HZ.  
Zoster Brie f Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire : To be completed by [CONTACT_723728] (or subject’s caregiver) on Day HZ -0 (Visit HZ -1) and daily from Day HZ -
1 (day after the Visit HZ -1) up to Day HZ -28, and weekly from Day HZ -[ADDRESS_988153] visit/contact (LSLV/C) , ZBPI [INVESTIGATOR_723630] a [ADDRESS_988154] Day HZ -91 (Refer to 
Section 4.5.2  for more details) .  
Please refer to Table  5, Table  6 and Table  7 for information on when diary cards and 
questionnaires  are dispensed to t he subjects.  
4.5.2.  Evaluation of suspected case of HZ  
All HZ cases that occur during the study period up to the LSLV/C will be followed and 
evaluated  as was done for the previous ZOSTER -006/022 studies . Any symptom/sign 
suggestive of HZ must be evaluated. At Visit Month 0, all subjects (and subject’s 
caregiver if applicable) will be re -educated with regard to the signs and symptoms of HZ. 
The subjects are also given a HZ -specific diary card that they woul d complete with the 
date that rash and/or pain began. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_723729], and start completing the HZ -specific diary card (with the help of the subject 
caregiver if applicable ) if he/she develops any symptom s suggestive of HZ. The subjects 
will be asked to visit the study site (within 48 hours if possible) for evaluation of the 
“suspected case of HZ”. The subject will be asked to bring the completed HZ -specific 
diary card when he/she visits the study site for  evaluation of the suspected HZ. The 
investigator will perform a clinical examination when the subject visits the study site for 
the first evaluation of the suspected case of HZ [Visit HZ -1 at Day HZ -0]. If not 
considered a suspected HZ diagnosis, the inve stigator should not progress further with 
evaluation of this event as a HZ case for the purpose of this study. However, if meeting 
the definition of an AE/SAE (Section 9.1), the case should be handled as applicable 
(Section 9.3). 
The schedule of visits/contacts that will take place for follow -up of suspected HZ cases is

from the diary card will be transcribed into the eCRF. The investigator or his 
delegate will record relevant information regarding the HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_49673] 
(such as date of onset of pain and rash, date of clinical diagnosis of HZ, location and 
nature of HZ lesions, HZ -related complications if any);  
• The study staff/investigator will ask the subject (with the help of subject’s caregiver 
if necessary) to complete a ZBPI [INVESTIGATOR_723631] -[ADDRESS_988155] will be asked to 
complete a second  ZBPI [INVESTIGATOR_723632] 24 
hours before Visit HZ -1; 
• The rash will be documented by [CONTACT_115956]. Please refer to the SPM for 
specific instructions;  
• The study staff/investigator will record concomitant medication/vacc ination, 
including concomitant medication for HZ treatment or any HZ -related complications 
(Section  7.6), and record intercurrent medical condition s (Section  7.7). If antiviral 
therapy is needed, it is recommended to use valacyclovir, acyclovir or famciclovir. 
Concomitant medication the subject has already rec eived and/or will receive for HZ 
treatment will be recorded in the eCRF. The study staff/investigator will check if the 
subject received any medical attention [hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit, or a 
visit to or from medical personnel (medical doctor)]  for HZ or any HZ -related 
complication.  
• Rash lesion samples (three replicate samples on the same day) will be collected from

associated pain and complications will continue irrespective of whether the rash has 
ended in some cases. When a case initially clinically diagnosed as suspected HZ is 
subsequently no longer  considered by [CONTACT_723731], this will be 
noted in the eCRF. However , study procedures to be performed during the follow -up 
period for a suspected HZ case (see  Table  7) should be continued.  
If HZ -associated pain ceases (defined as a 28 -day [or 4 -week] pain free period) , the study 
staff/investigator will inform the subject/ subject’s caregiver to stop completing the ZBPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_723640].  
If a 4 -week pain -free period is achieved and the HZ rash resolves, subsequent follow -up 
visits or contacts related to this case of HZ will be cancelled  meaning that collection of 
subsequent HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] -related information will be stopped and no further information on 
that particular  suspected HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_723641]. However, 
if pain reappears in the same area after a 4 -week pa in-free period and is not accompanied 
by a new HZ rash, it will be assigned to the previous HZ -epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Visits/contacts will 
restart with Day HZ -[ADDRESS_988158] visit of the assigned epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], prior to the pain 
free period.  
Follow -up of HZ -associated  pain persisting beyond Visit HZ -7 (Day HZ -91) or other 
complications will be done at monthly contacts between the subject and the investigator 
and/or investigator’s delegate.   
HZ related complications if considered as SAE will be followed as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  The following will take place at each visit or contact [CONTACT_723732][INVESTIGATOR_1865]:  
• The study staff/investigator will: 1) record relevant information regarding the 
suspected HZ case (such as the location and nature of HZ lesions, the end date of the 
rash, HZ-related complications, if any); 2) record concomitant 
medications/vaccinations, including concomitant medication the subject has already 
received and/or will receive for HZ treatment or treatment of any HZ -related 
complications (Section 7.6); 3) record intercurrent medical conditions (Section  7.7);

Information on HZ -associated pain is derived from the ZBPI [CONTACT_53007]: “Please rate your 
pain by [CONTACT_564906] 24 
hours” (item  3), so called “worst pain” in this protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Confirmation of a suspected case of HZ  
A suspected case of HZ can be confirmed in two ways:  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Confirmation of suspected HZ by [CONTACT_723735] a 
suspected case of HZ. The samples will be transferred to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals or a validated 
laboratory designated by [CONTACT_723736] s 
for laboratory diagnosis of HZ by [CONTACT_954]. Refer to  APPENDIX A for details of PCR assay  
to be performed on HZ lesion samples  and for  details of the PCR testing algorithm to 
classify suspected cases of HZ.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Confirmation of suspected HZ by [CONTACT_723737]. The HZAC will classify all 
referred cases as either “HZ” or “not HZ”  or “not able to decide” . However, the HZAC 
classification will serve as the final case definition only when the case cannot be 
confirmed or excluded by [CONTACT_954] , e.g., when all samples from a given subject are 
inadequate (as when both VZV and β -actin PCR results are negative), or when no 
samples are available for a given subject. Therefore, definitive PCR results, when 
available, will determine the final HZ case assignment. In such cases, the HZAC 
classification will not contribute to HZ case determination decision  (Amended 11 May

participating as investigator in this study, will not evaluate cases from their own study 
site. HZAC members will be blinded to group assignments. For every case, each 
reviewing HZAC member will be asked to make a clinical determination of whether the 
case is HZ based on review of the available clinical information (e.g., summary of the 
rash and pain evaluations, digital photographs of the subject's rash, and clinical progr ess 
notes). A suspected case of HZ will be considered as “HZ” if the HZAC members concur 
unanimously; otherwise, it will be classified as “not HZ”. A case of “not able to decide” 
will be classified as “not HZ”. As described above, the HZAC case assignment will only 
be considered as the final case assignment if definitive PCR results are not available. 
Further details will be provided in the HZAC charter  (Amended 11 May 2020) . 
4.5.3.  Follow up of suspected HZ cases and HZ -associated pain  
Data will be collected on a ll suspected HZ cases that occur from Visit Month 0 until the 
study conclusion Visit. For each suspected case of HZ that the investigator concludes is 
clinically consistent with HZ, data on HZ -associated pain (using ZBPI [INVESTIGATOR_723648]) will be collected daily  until Day - HZ-28, and weekly  from Day

For all subjects with ongoing HZ -associated pain at the time of LSLV/C, ZBPI [INVESTIGATOR_723649] a 4-week pain -free period is documented OR until Day HZ -91. If pain 
reappears in the same area after a 4 -week pain -free period and is not accompanied by a 
new HZ rash,  it will be assigned to the previous HZ -epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The completion of the ZBPI 
[CONTACT_63496] w ill resume based upon the weekly schedule established at the start of the 
assigned epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Visits/ contacts will also restart according to the schedule in Table  [ADDRESS_988161]  HZ evaluation visit ( Visit HZ -1 at Day HZ -0 – the visit at which the 
suspected case of HZ is first evaluated by [CONTACT_093]), rash lesion samples will be 
collected from the subject if the investigator considers the symptoms/signs to be 
consistent wit h HZ. Three replicate rash lesion samples (see Table  15) should be 
collected on the same day. If during clinical evaluation at Visit HZ -1, the investig ator 
determines that adequate rash lesion samples cannot be collected (i.e., less than three 
lesions present, or if only papules are present), t he investigator has the option of 
collecting three additional samples preferably within 7 days,  or at the Visit HZ-2 if there 
is rash progression (i.e., appearance of new/additional lesions if originally less than three 
lesions present, or appearance of vesicles if originally only papules present). When the 
subject returns for repeat sample collection, if possible, three samples from separate 
lesions should be collected. Refer to  the SPM for further details on sample collection.  
At Visit HZ -1, the rash will be documented by [CONTACT_115956]. Additional 
photographs of HZ lesions may be taken after Visit HZ -1 to hel p note the progression of

[IP_ADDRESS].  Randomisation of supplies  
For the 1 -Additional Dose, Revaccination and Control groups:  
The randomisation within blocks will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using MATerial 
EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for  use in Statistical Analysis System 
(SAS®) (Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) by [CONTACT_43055]. Entire blocks of supplies will be shipped 
to the study centres /warehouse(s).  
For countries/centres that will enrol subjects in the 1 -Additional Dose, Revaccination and 
Control groups an over -randomisation of supplies will be prepared in order to take 
advantage of greater rates of recruitment in one or more centres and thus reduce the 
overall recruitment period in these groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Randomisation of treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Treatment allocation to the subject for the 1 -Additional Dose, 
Revaccination and Control groups  
The target will be to enrol approximately 240 eligible subjects who will be randomly 
assigned to the 3 study groups in a (1:1:2) ratio (approximately 60 subjects in each group 
1-Additi onal Dose and Revaccination and 120 subjects in group Control). Allocation of a 
subject to a study group at the investigator site will be performed using SBIR.  
The treatment numbers will be allocated by [CONTACT_2715]. The randomisation algorithm will use a 
minimisa tion procedure accounting for age at primary vaccination (50 -59, 60 -69 and 
≥ 70 YOA) at the time of first vaccination in the ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988175] dose. Note that the treatment number issued

6.3.1.  Data collection  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Monthly contacts  
After Visit Month 0, monthly contacts between the subjects / subject’s caregiver  and the 
investigator and/or his delegate will take place to collect information on any event of 
interest that may have occurred [see  Section 6.5.7  for det ails]. The contacts will not take 
place at months that coincide with the subject’s scheduled study visits. Also, subjects 
with suspected HZ will be contact[CONTACT_723741]  7. The contacts will 
take place using the most convenient method suited for the sites ( e.g., telephone calls by 
[CONTACT_723742], or Short Message Service (SMS) text messages through a call 
centre, or visit by  [CONTACT_723743]'s home). A guidance document outlining 
the information that needs to be collected at each contact [CONTACT_723744], and will serve as a guidance to develop the local script (Refer to the SPM). The 
logistic de tails on the set -up of the contacts will be documented by [CONTACT_25733]/country. At 
each contact, the subject / subject’s caregiver  will respond to a standard set of questions in 
a language that is understandable to them. The investigator and/or his delegate will 
transcribe the relevant information on any event of interest in the appropriate of the 
subject’s eCRF, in English . In case of ongoing HZ, subjects / subjects ’ caregiver  will also 
be reminded to complete Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI)  questionnaires  as described 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Diary cards and questionnaires  
The diary cards and/or questionnaires to be completed by [CONTACT_423]/ subject’s caregiver 
will be distributed and explained by [CONTACT_15009]/her delegate. Any supplied 
diary cards or questionnaires should be prefera bly completed by [CONTACT_166240]. 
In case of difficulty in self -completion of the diary cards or questionnaires, an aide (such 
as a family member or caregiver who is not involved in the study) may provide assistance 
with reading the questions (verba tim) and/or transcribing the subject’s responses on the 
questionnaires and/or diary cards.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

30-day diary cards will be dispensed on the day of vaccination  to be completed by [CONTACT_12912]/ subjects’ caregiver . The 7 -day diary cards will be completed for solicited AEs 
(from Day 0 to Day 6 after each vaccination) and the 30-day diary cards will be 
completed by [CONTACT_723745] (from Day 0 to Day 29 after eac h vaccination) and any 
concomitant medication and vaccination taken from Day 0 to Day 29 after each 
vaccination  (see Table  6 and Table  26). 
When the completed diary cards and/or questionnaires are returned to the study staff, the 
study staff will ask the subject (at the time of return or at subsequent contact) if he/she 
received an y assistance in completing diary cards or questionnaires. If the subject had 
assistance completing the diary card and/or questionnaires (e.g., by a caregiver), it should 
be noted in the eCRF. In case questionnaires are completed at the study site, study st aff 
can assist in reading the questions (verbatim).

[IP_ADDRESS].  Blood sampling for immune response asses sments  
As specified in (Table  4, Table  5, Table  15 and Table  19), blood samples will be taken 
during study visits  from sub sets of subjects as follows:  
• All subjects  (N ≤ 14,448) entering the study will have a HI blood sample 
(approximately 5  mL) at Visit Month  0. 
For subjects in the LTFU group, who do not belong to any subset, these samples will 
be stored and tested for HI only if the subject develops HZ during the ZOSTER -049 
study or if there are other reasons requiring the HI testing of these samples.  
• LTFU Group (HI subset):  Subjects (N  ≤ 1,729) who were in the immunogenicity 
subset during studies ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988206] es (approximately 5  mL) will be collected and tested from Visit Month  0 
to Visit Year  6, on a yearly basis, to assess HI responses.  
• LTFU Group (CMI subset):  Subjects (N  ≤ 234) who were in the CMI subset 
during study ZOSTER -006 and continue participation in  this study. Blood samples 
(approximately 20  mL) will be collected and tested from Visit Month  0 to Visit 
Year  6 on a yearly basis to assess CMI responses.  
• HZ subset:  Subjects (N to be determined) who developed confirmed HZ during 
ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022, or who develop HZ during the interval between the 
end of the ZOSTER -006/022 and the beginning of ZOSTER -049, or who develop 
suspected HZ during ZOSTER -049 will be part of the HZ subset. Blood sampling for 
subjects in the HZ subset is described below.  
Subjects who develop HZ at any time after enrolment in ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -
022 and who are already part of the HI subset in ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -022 will 
provide blood samples to assess HI responses (approximately 5  mL) from Visit 
Month 0 to Visit Year 6 irre spective of when the HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_254788]. If these subjects

11-MAY -2020  79 Subjects who develop HZ at any time after enrolment in ZOSTER -006 or ZOSTER -
022 and who were NOT part of the HI or CMI subsets in these studies, will provide 
blood samples to assess HI responses (approximately 5  mL) beginning at the annual 
visit in the ZOSTER -049 study subsequent to the occurrence of the HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The 
blood sample taken upon enrolment at Visit Month 0 will be tested and included in 
the analyses for these subjects.  
• 1-Additional Dose Group:  Subjects (N  = 60) to be administered HZ/su vaccine on a 
1-dose schedule at Visit Month  0. Blood samples (approximate ly 5 and 20  mL) will 
be collected at Visit Month  0, Visit Month  1, and from Visit Year  1 to Visit Year  6 
on a yearly basis to assess HI and CMI responses.  
• Revaccination Group:  Subjects (N  = 60) to be administered HZ/su vaccine on a 2 -
dose schedule at Visit  Month  0 and Visit Month  2. Blood samples (approximately 5 
and 20  mL) will be collected at Visit Month  0, Visit Month  1, Visit Month  3 and 
from Visit Year  1 to Visit Year  6 on a yearly basis to assess HI and CMI responses.  
• Control Group:  Subjects (N  = 120) in the non -vaccinated control group. Blood 
samples (approximately 5 and 20  mL) will be collected at Visit Month  0, Visit 
Month  1, Visit Month  3 and from Visit Year  1 to Visit Year  6 on a yearly basis to 
assess HI and CMI responses.  
After centrifugation, s erum samples for HI assessment should be kept at –20°C/ –4°F or  
–70/80°C until shipment.  
The blood samples for CMI assessment should be stored at the investigator’s site at room 
temperature and they must not be centrifuged. Samples will be shipped at room  
temperature (20 to 25°C/68 to 77°F) to the designated laboratory for cell separation to be 
performed within 24 hours.  
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM for general handling of 
blood samples.

6.7. Biological sample handling and analysis  
Please refer to the SPM for details on biospecimen management (handling, storage and 
shipment).  
Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).  
• Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests 
described in this protocol. This may in clude the management of the quality of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably.  
• It is also possible that fut ure findings may make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects in countries where this is allowed, will be asked to give a specific 
consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contrac ted partner to use the samples for future research. 
Future research will be subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries 
and will only be performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Review Board 
has approved this research.  
Informat ion on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals.  
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject.  
Refer also to the  a Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays except those described in th e protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requireme nts need to be communicated formally to and discussed 
and agreed with [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

When materials are provided by [CONTACT_43055], it is MANDATORY  that all clinical 
samples (including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those 
materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclusion of the subject from the ATP analysis (See Section 11.5 for the definition of 
cohorts  to be analysed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel and the 
laboratory(ies) under his/her supervision comply with this requir ement. However, when 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical samples, 
appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the Module on

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_988217]. The storage temperature should be 
continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring 
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for 
more details on storage of the study vaccine.  
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.  
Any temperature excursion outside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 °C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition)  impacting investigational medicinal products (IMP s) must
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ([e]TDF).
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label
temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor .
In case of temperature excursion below +2.0°C down to 0.0°C  impacting IMP(s) there is 
no need to report in (e)TDF, but adequate actions must be taken to restore the +2 to 
+8°C/+36 to +46°F  label storage temperature conditions.  The impacted IMP(s) may still
be administered, but the site should avoid re -occurrence of such temperature excursion.
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for more details on actions to
take.
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and  instructions on 
the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and 
accountability of the study vaccine.  
7.3. Dosage and administration of study vaccine  
After removal of the vaccine components from the temperature monitored refrigerat or, 
the vaccine should be reconstituted and administered within 6 hours, and should be kept 
at room temperature (between 2°C/36°F and 30°C/86°F).

7.6. Concomitant medications/products and concomitant 
vaccinations  
At each study visit/ contact, the investigator shou ld question the subject/ subject’s 
caregiver about any medications/products taken and vaccinations received by [CONTACT_423].  
7.6.1.  Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccinations  
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccin e(s) must be recorded in 
the eCRF.  
• All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary supplements, 
administered during the period starting 30 days  (Days 0 -29) following each dose/the 
dose of study vaccine. This also applies to concomitant me dication administered 
prophylactically in anticipation of reaction to the vaccination and any medication 
intended to treat an AE  (For the 1 -Additional Dose and Revaccination groups 
ONLY) . 
E.g., an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophylactic when it is gi ven in the absence 
of fever and any other symptom, to prevent fever from occurring [fever is defined as

11-MAY -2020 91 7.6.2.  Concomitant medications/products/vaccines that may lead to the 
elimination of a subject from ATP analyses  
The use of the following concomitant medications/products/vaccines will not require 
withdrawal of the subject from the study but may determine a subject’s evaluability in the 
ATP analysis. See Section 11.5 for cohorts to be analysed.  
•Use of any investigational or non -registered product (pharmaceutical product or
device) during the study period;
•Administration of long -acting immune -modifying drugs (e.g., infliximab, rituximab)
at any time during the study period;
•Chronic administration (defined as >  14 consecutive days in total) of
immunosuppressants or other immune -modifying drugs at any time during the study
period. For cort icosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥  20 mg/day or equivalent. A
prednisone dose of <  20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topi[INVESTIGATOR_330482] -articular
corticosteroids are allowed;
•Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the study
period;
•Administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy at any time during the study period
•Prolonged use (>  14 consecutive days) of oral and/or parenteral antiviral agents that
are active against VZV (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, etc.) during the study
period for an indication other than to treat suspected or confirmed HZ or an HZ -
related complication (topi[INVESTIGATOR_723670]);
•Receipt of a vaccine against VZV or HZ (including an investigational or non - 
registered vaccine  other tha n the HZ/su vaccine  administered in this study to groups
1-Additional Dose and Revaccination) during the entire study period;
•Administration of a vaccine not foreseen by [CONTACT_723771] 30 days prior
to dose 2 of vaccine and/or within 30 days aft er any dose. However, licensed
nonreplicating vaccines (i.e., inactivated and subunit vaccines, including inactivated
and subunit influenza vaccines, with or without adjuvant for seasonal or pandemic
flu) may be administered up to 8 days prior to dose 2 an d/or at least 14 days after any
dose of study vaccine ( for the 1 -Additional Dose and Revaccination groups, only );
In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a
pandemic) is organised by [CONTACT_43068],  outside the routine
immunisation program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary
for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to its Summary of Product
Characteristics  (SmPC) or Prescribing Information and according to the local
governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of the S ponsor is
obtained.201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020 92 7.7. Intercurrent medical conditions (IM Cs) that may lead to 
elimination of a subject from ATP analyses  
At each study visit subsequent to study enrolment until th e study end, it must be verified 
if the subject has experienced or is  experiencing any IMC . If it is the case, the 
condition(s) must be recorded in the eCRF  (see Table  25). 
An IMC is defined as a condition that has the capability of confounding the immune 
response to the study vaccine or its interpretation. Subjects may be eliminated from 
certain ATP cohorts f or immunogenicity if, during the study, they incur an IMC.  
Examples of IMCs include cases of HZ or a confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive 
or immunodeficient condition resulting from disease (e.g., malignancy, HIV infection).

9. SAFETY
The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse event (SAE) as provided in this protocol.  
Each subject/ subject’s caregiver will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_334021]/the subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as 
serious.  
9.1. Safety definitions  
9.1.1.  Definition of an adverse event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse.  
Examples of an AE include : 
•Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
•New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine administration
even though they may have been  present prior to the start of the study.201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  93 • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with vaccine(s)/product(s) administration.  
• Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures 
(i.e., invasive procedures, modification of subject’ s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing clinically relevant conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a 
subject prior to the study entry. These events will be recorded in the medical history 
section of the eCRF.  
9.1.2.  Definition of a serious adverse event  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have ca used death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574],  
Note: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_723671]/or treatment tha t would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_301877]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222663], the event w ill also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]’ occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31782] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent s ignature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  94 d. Results in disability/incapacity, OR  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to in clude experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not c onstitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.  
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical ev ents that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53062]. These should also be  considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].

The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory fi nding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
9.1.5.  Medically attended visits  
The subject s in the 1 -Additional Dose, Revaccination and Control groups only  will be 
asked if the y received medical attention defined as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], an emergency room 
visit or a visit to or from medical personnel (medical doctor) for any reason, other than

9.3.3.  Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events  
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject should be asked a non -leading 
question such as:  
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine or since the previous 
visit? ’ 
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator/ delegate will then record all relevant information regarding 
an AE/SAE in the eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopie s of the 
subject’s medical records to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals instead of appropriately completing the 
eCRF. However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_723678]. In this instance, all subject identifiers  will be blinded 
on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_42985].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the dia gnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  104 The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling will be scored at [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals as follows using [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ standard grading scale based on the U S 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials [ FDA , 
2007]:  
0 : < 20 mm diameter  
1 :  20 mm to  50 mm diameter  
2 : > 50 mm to  100 mm diameter  
3 : > 100 mm diameter  
The preferred route for recording temperature in this study is oral.  
Grade 3 fever will be defined as temperature >  39.0C for oral, axillary or tympanic route 
and > 39.5C for rectal route.  
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based  on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensity should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate ) = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities.  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 9.1.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational vaccine 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to 
determine the relationship. Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the 
underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal 
relationship of the event to the investigational vaccine will be considered and 
investig ated. The investigator will also consult the IB to determine his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very 
important  that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The 201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  105 investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingly. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
In case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, it may not be 
possible to determine the causa l relationship of general AEs to the individual 
vaccine/product administered. The investigator should, therefore, assess whether the AE 
could be causally related to vaccination rather than to the individual vaccines.  
All solicited local (injection site) re actions will be considered causally related to 
vaccination. Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by [CONTACT_159290]:  
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_723776]?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine contributed to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study vaccine. There are other, more likely causes 
and administration of the study vaccine is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 9.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by [CONTACT_479735].  
Possible contributing factors include:  
• Medical hist ory. 
• Other medication.  
• Protocol required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by [CONTACT_760].  
• Other cause (specify).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Not recovered/not resolved.  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs).  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

After the initial AE/SAE  report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to  Table  28). 
All SAEs and pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170] (serious or non -serious) documented at a previous visit/ contact [CONTACT_43084]/not resolved or recovering/re solving will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts until the end of the study.  
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_159292]/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until [ADDRESS_988246] vaccination.  
Cases of new onset of autoimmune diseases and other immune -mediated inflammatory 
disorders documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_159292]/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subse quent visits/contacts until study 
conclusion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up after the subject is discharged from the study  
The investigator will follow subjects:  
• with SAEs, pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170] (serious or non -serious), or subjects withdrawn from the study as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or 
until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
• with other non -serious AEs, cases of new onset of autoimmune diseases, until study 
conclusion or they are lost to follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previously reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals using a paper/ electronic 
Expedited Adverse Events Report and/or pregnancy report as applicable.  
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of 
additional clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obliged to assis t. If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, 
[COMPANY_004] Biologicals will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Pregnant subjects will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the end 
of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals using the electronic pregnancy report and 
the Expedited Adverse E vents Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period 
doesn’t need to be longer than six to eight weeks after the estimated date of delivery.  
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it should alw ays be reported as SAE.

be recorded in the subject’s  eCRF (refer to Section 7.6.1 ). 
9.7. Subject card  
Study subjects/ subject’s caregiver must be provided with the address and telephone 
number of the main  contact [CONTACT_43089].  
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each subject/ 
subject’s caregiver. In an emergency situation this card serves to inform the responsible 
attending physician that t he subject is in a clinical study and that relevant information 
may be obtained by [CONTACT_21947].

of the event  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
10.2.2.  Subject withdrawal from investigational vaccine  
A ‘withdrawal’ from the investigational vaccine refers to any subject who does not 
receive the complete treatment, i.e., when no further planned dose is administered from 
the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the investigational vaccine may not 
necessarily be withdrawn from the study as furth er study procedures or follow -up may be 
performed (safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study protocol.  
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact [CONTACT_334030].  
Information relative to premature disc ontinuation of the investigational vaccine will be 
documented on the Vaccine Administration screen of the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccination was made by [CONTACT_723780]/herself or by [CONTACT_17062], as well as which of the following possible 
reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

we could expect that 6075 subjects from the vaccinated group will be eligible to be 
included in the LTFU efficacy analysis. Considering that 55% of the subjects may not 
come back for the ZOSTER -[ADDRESS_988255] that 2734 subjects will be

Thus in total, 6406 evaluable subjects can be expected in this LTFU efficacy analysis.  
11.4.1.  VE assessment  
Considering that 240 subjects will be randomised within the groups 1 -Additional Dose, 
Revaccination and Control, approximately 6000 subjects would be expected to be 
evaluable for the efficacy assessment in the mTVc.  
The sample size will allow us to get a Lower Limit (LL) of 95% CI (95%LL) of the VE 
above 30%  overall over the study with a pr obability of at least 99%.  
Because no placebo group is enrolled in this study, an approximate power computation 
has been derived considering the incidence rate in the vaccine group as compared to the 
incidence rate of the historical control from the ZOSTER -006/022 studies.

independently, and the pattern of the missing value(s) being either Missing Com pletely 
At Random (MCAR) or Missing At Random (MAR) only.  
For the analysis of solicited symptoms, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not 
be replaced. Therefore, the analysis of the solicited symptoms based on the TVc will 
include only subjects/dose s with documented safety data (i.e., symptom screen/sheet 
completed).  
For the analysis of unsolicited symptoms/SAEs/pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170]/concomitant medication, all 
vaccinated subjects will be considered and subjects who did not report an event will be 
considered as subj ects without an event.  
For the analysis of immunogenicity, missing or non -evaluable measurements will not be

11.6.2.  Humoral immune response  
A serone gative subject is a subject whose Ab concentration is below the cut -off value.  
A seropositive subject is a subject whose Ab concentration is greater than or equal to the 
cut-off value.  
The seropositivity rate is defined as the percentage of seropositive su bjects.  
The Vaccine Response Rate (VRR) for anti -gE is defined as the percentage of subjects 
who have at least:  
• a 4-fold increase in the post -dose 2 anti -gE Ab concentration as compared to the 
prevaccination anti -gE Ab concentration, for subjects who are seropositive at 
baseline, or,  
• a 4-fold increase in the post -dose 2 anti -gE Ab concentration as compared to the 
anti-gE Ab cut -off value for seropositivity, for subjects who are seronegative at 
baseline.  
The GMC calculations are performed by [CONTACT_43101] -log of the mean of the log 
concentration transformations. Ab concentrations below the cut -off of the assay will be 
given an arbitrary value equal to half the cut -off for the purpose of GMC calculation.  
The Mean Geometric Increase (MGI) is defined as the g eometric mean of the within 
subject ratios of two different timepoints.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

• For the descriptive analyses, the frequency of CD4[2+] T -cells upon in vitro 
stimulation with the gE -antigen (induction condition) is calculated by [CONTACT_723781]4[2+] T -cells (numerator) over the total number of CD4 T -
cells involved (denominator). The same calculation will be performed for the 
frequency computation for any kinds of cells and for each individual activation 
marker as appropriate.  
 
• The f requency of gE -specific CD4 T -cells for each individual subject is calculated as 
the difference between the frequency of CD4[2+] T -cells, upon in vitro stimulation 
with the gE antigen (induction condition) minus the frequency of CD4[2+] T -cells 
upon in vit ro stimulation in medium only (background condition). The differences 
less or equal to one are imputed to one gE -specific CD4[2+] T -cell per 106 CD4+ T -
cells. The same calculation will be performed for the frequency computation for any 
kind of cells and fo r each individual activation marker as appropriate.  
 
• The GM frequency calculations are performed by [CONTACT_43101] -log of the mean of 
the log frequency transformations.  
• The CMI vaccine response to gE will be based on the gE -specific data. The VRR is 
defined as the percentage of subjects who have at least:  
− a 2-fold increase as compared to the threshold 320 polypositive CD4+ 
T cells/106 CD4+ T  cells, for subjects with pre -vaccination T -cell frequencies 
below the threshold 320 polypositive CD4+ T  cells/1 06  CD4+ T  cells;  
− a 2-fold increase as compared to pre -vaccination T -cell frequencies, for subjects 
with pre -vaccination above the threshold 320 polypositive CD4+ T  cells/106

subjects, as a whole, and by [CONTACT_551] (50-59, 60 -69 and  70 YOA) will be calculated . 
The distribution of subjects enrolled among the study sites will be tabulated.  
Frequency tables will be generated for categorical variables such as gender.  
Mean, median and standard error will be provided for continuous data such as age.  
11.7.2.  Analysis of efficacy (LTFU and Control groups)  
The primary analysis of efficacy will be performed on the mTVc, the analysis will be also 
performed on the TVc and the ATP for efficacy to complement the mTVc analysis.  
The analysis on mTVc and ATP cohort for efficacy will be performed over the follow -up 
time from one month post Dose [ADDRESS_988265] for subjects without a

11-MAY -2020  121 The primary analysis wi ll be to assess the VE during this study and will use the historical 
control estimates adjusted for age at randomisation during the ZOSTER -006/022 studies. 
The method using the historical control estimates will be further explained in the 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP). Vaccine effects will be estimated by [CONTACT_723783] 95% CIs based on the variance of the observed population in this study 
and treating the historical control as constant.  
The secondary analysis will be to assess the VE o ver each year of follow -up. Results 
from the ZOSTER -006/022 studies will be pooled for each year after vaccination with 
methods used in these studies. For overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_723683] -006/022 studies 
and this study, all the data will be pooled. For the  non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_723684] -049 study will be used.  
The assessment of the VE over the overall period including period from vaccination 
during the ZOSTER -006/022 studies up to the end of this long -term study will be done 
with a met hod that will be described in the SAP.  
Any available information for the diagnosis of HZ epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (clinical diagnosis, PCR, 
laboratory methods, etc.) during the interval between the end of the ZOSTER -006/[ADDRESS_988266] of these cases on the VE will be performed (this will be 
described in the SAP).  
The purpose of these analyses will be descriptive and therefore the CIs will not be 
adjusted for mul tiple testing.  
The analyses will be performed for confirmed HZ case s, for PHN and for complications 
(other than PHN) .  
Any exploratory or sensitivity analysis may be performed in addition to the analyses 
described above on an ad -hoc basis. However, the significance level of those analyses 
may not be fully controlled.  
11.7.3.  Analysis of immunogenicity  
The primary analysis will be based on the ATP cohort. If, in any vaccine group the 
percentage of vaccinated subjects with serological results excluded from the ATP  cohort 
for analysis of immunogenicity is 5% or more, a second analysis based on the TVc will 
be performed to complement the ATP analysis.  
All analyses will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_125916]. The main age strata for reporting 
purposes are 50 -59, 60 -69 and  70 YOA. Additional analysis will be presented in

11-MAY -2020  137 Deviations from and Changes of Protocol  
Deviations from Protocol  
The investigator (or sub -investigator) may implement a deviation from, or a change of, 
the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects without agreemen t by [CONTACT_723818]. As soon as possible, the implemented deviation or change 
and the reasons for it should be submitted to the head of the medical institution and the 
IRB for approval, and via the head of the medical institution to the sponsor for 
agreement.  
The investigator (or subinvestigator) should document all deviations from the approved 
protocol. The investigator should document the reason only for the deviation from, or the 
change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects, and submit it to 
the sponsor and the head of the medical institution, and retain its copy.  
Changes of Protocol  
1. If it becomes necessary to make any changes significantly affecting the conduct of 
the study, and/or increasing the risk t o subjects, the sponsor should promptly 
document the changes and reasons for them and amend the protocol after discussion 
with the (coordinating [investigator, committee members] and) investigators, and 
notify the heads of the medical institutions and inve stigators of the changes of the 
protocol (sample ICF and other written information, if necessary). The investigator 
should not implement any significant changes without approval from the IRB.  
2. For changes other than the above 1), the sponsor should document  the changes and 
reasons for them and inform the heads of the medical institutions and investigators of 
the changes of the protocol. Such changes require prior approval from the IRB, 
except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s), or when the c hange(s) 
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study. The investigator 
should promptly report the changes implemented without prior approval to the IRB 
for approval.  
Study Period  
The exact study period has not been confirmed at the time  of this protocol. When needed 
and available, the study period can be communicated at local level, outside of this 
protocol.

Specific Ab (anti -gE) measurements:  
Anti -gE ELISA:  Anti-gE Ab concentrations will be measured using an anti-gE ELISA. 
Diluted blood serum samples of study subjects will be added to microtitre wells pre -
coated with gE antigen. Secondary peroxidase -conjugated anti -human Abs will be added, 
which bind to the primary human anti -gE Abs. After incubation of the microtitre wells 
with a chromogen substrate solution, the enzymatic reaction will be stopped. Optical 
densities will be recorded and an ti-gE Ab concentrations are calculated from a standard 
curve. The assay cut -off is 97 mIU/mL.  
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS):  
CMI responses will be performed by [CONTACT_43055] (or designated laboratory) on 
thawed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) by [CONTACT_270052]. The assay will be 
performed on samples collected during the course of the study. This assay provides 
information on the frequency of CD4 T cells responding to culture medium or antigens 
(gE peptide pool) by [CONTACT_723819] -, IL-2, 
TNF -, and CD40L  (here considered as activation markers) . 
Briefly, PBMC collected from the subjects are stimulated for two hours using culture 
medium (for evaluation of the non -specific response), a pool of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_723688] s 
covering the entire sequence of the vaccine antigen gE. Then, an intracellular block 
(brefeldin A) is added to inhibit cytokine secretion for a subsequent overnight incubation. 
Cells are then harvested, stained for surface markers (CD3, CD4 and CD8) and fixed. 
The fixed cells are then permeabilised and stained with Abs  specific to the activation 
markers assessed,  washed and analyzed by [CONTACT_723820].   
The results of ICS assays are expressed as the frequency of specific CD4 T cells per 
million total CD4 T cells.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  141 PCR assay for confirmation of suspected case of HZ:  
HZ cases will be confirmed by a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based algorithm that 
assesses the presence of VZV Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) in samples, and the 
adequacy of the samples (by [CONTACT_723821] β -actin DNA).  
VZV and β -actin DNA in HZ clinical specimens will be assessed using real -time PCR 
detection by [CONTACT_941] 5’ nuclease assay based on the Taqman probe technology. If the VZV 
PCR is negative, β -actin PCR will be performed to assess adequacy of the sample and if a 
speci men is found to be VZV –PCR negative and β -actin –PCR negative, it is considered 
to be inadequate.  
In the Taqman -based PCR experiments, the formation of a PCR product is monitored in 
real-time during amplification by [CONTACT_723822]. The reporter fluorophore is at the 5’ end of the Taqman probe and 
the quencher is at the 3’ end. As long as the probe is intact, no fluorescence is produced 
by [CONTACT_723823]. During the PCR polymerization step, the Taq  DNA polymerase 
displaces the Taqman probe by 3 -4 nucleotides, and the 5’ nuclease activity of the DNA 
polymerase separates the fluorophore from the quencher, and a measurable fluorescent 
signal proportional to the DNA copy number is produced.  
As mentioned  above, the 5' nuclease -based PCR assay allows the determination of the 
DNA copy number within samples, but in the present study the VZV and β -actin DNA 
PCR data on samples from suspected HZ lesions (swabs of vesicles, papules and crusts, 
and crusts themse lves) will be used qualitatively only according to the above mentioned 
approach.  
• Ascertainment of HZ cases including the PCR testing algorithm to classify HZ 
suspected cases  
A suspected case of HZ will be documented by [CONTACT_723824] (if r ash is 
present) and by [CONTACT_723825].  
To classify the suspected case of HZ, the samples from the rash lesions (if available) will 
be collected for laboratory testing by [CONTACT_954] ([ADDRESS_988291]). If during clinical evaluation at Visit HZ -1, the investigator determines that 
adequate rash lesion samples cannot be collected (i.e., less than three lesions present, or if 
only papules are present), the investigator has the o ption of collecting three additional 
samples preferably within 7 days, or at the Visit HZ -2 if there is rash progression (i.e., 
appearance of new/additional lesions if originally less than three lesions present, or 
appearance of vesicles if originally only  papules present). When the subject returns for 
repeat sample collection, if possible, three samples from separate lesions should be 
collected. Refer to the SPM for further details on sample collection.  
Each rash lesion will be tested using standardised an d validated molecular assays 
according to the PCR testing algorithm described below.  
A hierarchical case definition algorithm, similar to the algorithm used by [CONTACT_723826] ( Zostavax  efficacy study) [ Oxman , 2005] will be used to 
classify each suspected case of HZ as a confirmed HZ case or not.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 5 Final  
11-MAY -2020  142 • If at least [ADDRESS_988292] is “VZV positive” by [CONTACT_954] (as 
defined below), the PCR algorithm will classify the “suspected HZ case” as a 
“confirmed case of HZ”.  
• If all the samples coming from a given subject are “VZV negative” (as defined 
below), then β -actin PCR will be performed. If one or more “VZV negative” samples 
are “β-actin positive”, this means that the sampling procedure is valid and that the 
“suspected HZ case” will be classified as “not a case of HZ”.  
• If PCR results for a particular subject do not confirm or exclude a “suspected HZ 
case” (i.e., samples coming from a given subject are considered as “inadequate” as 
both VZV and β -actin PCR results are negative, or no samples are available for the 
subject), only then will the classification by [CONTACT_723827]. The HZAC will consist of physicians with HZ expertise. For 
every suspected HZ case, each HZAC member will be asked to make a clinical 
determination of whether the case is HZ based on review of the available clinical 
information. A “suspected HZ case” will be consid ered as “HZ” if all HZAC 
members concur (unanimous decision); otherwise, it will be classified as “not HZ”.  
This algorithm includes the following steps (see Figure  3): 
1. DNA extraction from the rash lesion.  
2. VZV real -time PCR assay (PCR) targeting the orf62 gene is performed to detect 
VZV in the rash lesion:  
a. If the VZV PCR signal is ≥ the cut -off level, i.e., the technical limit of detection 
(LOD) of the as say (10 VZV DNA copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]), the sample will be considered as 
“VZV positive”.  
b. If the VZV PCR signal is above 0 copy/PCR but below the cut -off level of the 
assay, it will be considered as “VZV borderline” and will be re -tested twice in 
order to obtain 3 results  per sample. The sample will be considered as “VZV 
positive” if at least 2 results out of the three obtained are ≥ the cut -off level of 
the assay and it will be considered “VZV negative” if fewer than 2 samples are ≥ 
the cut -off level of the assay.  
c. If the VZV PCR signal is equal to 0 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/PCR, the sample will be considered 
as “VZV negative”. If every sample is VZV negative, then extracted DNA from 
the samples will be assessed for the presence of β -actin DNA to confirm the 
validity of the rash lesion sampl ing procedure (see step 3).  
3. As described above, if all the samples are VZV negative for a given subject, then β -
actin PCR will be performed on “VZV negative” samples to confirm the validity of 
the sampling procedure.  
a. If the β -actin PCR signal is below the cut-off level of the assay (β -actin 
Negative), the sample will be considered as “inadequate” as no β -actin DNA 
from human cells is detected within the rash lesion sample. If all samples are β -
actin Negative, then the classification by [CONTACT_723828].  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  143 b. If the β -actin PCR signal is ≥ the cut -off level of the assay (β -actin Positive), the 
sample will be considered as “valid” but without any VZV DNA. If at least one 
sample is β -actin Positive, then the HZAC classification  of a suspected HZ case, 
will not be part of the decision -making process for HZ case confirmation.  
Note: The cut -off level of the VZV PCR and β -actin PCR assays is defined as the 
technical limit of detection of these assays (LOD; i.e., lowest concentration  that can be 
detected by [CONTACT_723829] 95% of the tests).

Amendment number:  Amendment 2  
Amendment date:  19 January 2017  
Co-ordinating author:  , Scientific Writer  
Rationale/background for changes:  
• This protocol is being amended after study start, because this being a long-term 
follow -up study and considering the age of the study population and the study 
duration (6 years), the current safety data collection requirement of the protocol 
will lead to collection of safety data that is not relevant for assessing the safety 
profile of the vaccine. This amendment was done to qualify that for the recording 
of AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal which are not related to:  
− investigational vaccine,  
− study participation,  
− [COMPANY_004] concomitant medication/vaccine,  
− HZ complications.  
Only the name (diagnosis/description) of the event will be recorded in the eCRF. 
No other details about these types of AEs/SAEs will be recorded during the entire 
study (for the LTFU group), after 12 months from Visit Month 0 (for the Control 
and 1 -Additional Dose group s) and after [ADDRESS_988307] HZ/su vaccination 
(for the Revaccination group) as indicated in Sections 9.3.1 and Tables 22 and 23.  
• The footnote was added to Synopsis Table  [ADDRESS_988308] a humoral immunogenicity (HI) blood 
sample at Visit Month [ADDRESS_988309] 
develops HZ during the ZOSTER -049 study or if there are othe r reasons requiring 
the HI testing of these samples.  
• Although no confirmed signals related to hypersensitivity reactions (including 
anaphylaxis) have been identified during the HZ/su clinical program, a mitigation 
strategy for the potential risk has been added to the Risk Assessment Section 1.3.1.  
• The CMI Vaccine Response Rate (VRR) for gE was defined to align with the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) in Section 11.5.3.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

11-MAY -2020  151 • In addition to the Vaccine Efficacy (VE), it is now specified that assessments of 
immuno genicity will be performed when the last subjects have completed their 
year 2 and year 4 visit/contact, in the sequence of analyses Section 11.8.1.  
• The statement was added “If during the conduct of the study the HZ/su vaccine 
([COMPANY_004] 1437173A) is approved in Japan, the study will then be locally amended to 
be conducted as a post -marketing study.” in Section 13.3.

Synopsis  
Rationale for the 
study and study 
design  Two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_723617] -50 and ZOE -70 that 
enrolled subjects  50 and  70 years of age (YOA ) 
respectively,  are evaluat eding the vaccine efficacy (VE), 
immunogenicity and safety of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HZ/su 
vaccine.  
The results for the ZOSTER -022 study are not yet available  
demonstrated that the HZ/su vaccine reduced the risks of 
HZ and PHN among adults  70 YOA . 
Since the mean follow -up period for VE at the time of the 
final analysis in the ZOSTER -006/022 studies will only be 
around was about  four years, further follow -up for long term 
efficacy assessment is needed , in order to establish that the 
HZ/su vaccine provides not only strong, but also persistent 
protection.  
Due to the high VE observed in the ZOSTER -006/022 
studyies, it was considered that subjects having received 
placebo during both of  the ZOSTER -006/022  studies should 
be offered cross -vaccination with HZ/su vaccine as soon as 
possible.  
Objectives  Secondary  
•To assess the VE in the prevention of HZ over each year
of follow -up from one month post dose 2 in the
ZOSTER -006/022 studies  as measured by [CONTACT_723831]  50 YOA and within each of the
specified age ranges* at the time of first vaccination in

Section 1.[ADDRESS_988312] HZ was evaluated in a large efficacy study 
in which Zostavax  (a live attenuated HZ vaccine that is a high titre preparation of the 
varicella vaccine, Varivax  [both manufactured by [CONTACT_44873] & Co ., Inc. ]) partially protected 
immunocompetent older adults against HZ [Oxman, 2005].  
Two large pi[INVESTIGATOR_723617] -50 and ZOE -70 that enrolled subjects  50 and 
 70 years of age (YOA ) respectively,  are evaluat eding the vaccine efficacy (VE), 
immunogenicity and safety of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ HZ/su vaccine.  
The results for the ZOSTER -022 study  are not yet available  demonstrated that the HZ/su 
vaccine reduced the risks of HZ and PHN among adults  70 YOA [Cunningham, 
2016] . 
Section 1.2.1  Rationale for the study  
Since the mean follow -up period for VE at the time of the final analysis in t he ZOSTER -
006/022 studies will only be around was about  four years, further follow -up for long term 
efficacy assessment is needed , in order to establish that the HZ/su vaccine provides not

Section 1.3.1  Risk Assessment  
Important P otential/Identified Risk  Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Investigational HZ/su vaccine  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
(including anaphylaxis)  No confirmed signals related 
to this potential risk have 
been identified during the 
clinical program. Available 
clinical data do not highlight 
any concern.  Administration of the study 
vaccination is to be preceded by a 
review of the subjects’ medical 
history (especially with regard to 
previous vaccination and possible 
occurrence of undesirable events) 
and a clinical examination.  
As with all injectable vaccines, 
appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be 
readily available in case of an 
anaphylactic event following the 
administration of the vaccine.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Blood samples collected at Visit Month 0 will be tested to assess VZV serological status 
of subjects born in 1980 or later or before 1980 in a tropi[INVESTIGATOR_645338], and with no 
serological evidence of prior VZV infection available at the time of Visit Month 0, in the 
following cases:  
•The subject presents with suspected HZ according to criterion (1) with rash
disseminated from onset and PCR confirmation of the presence of VZV DNA (see
Figure  3): If the subject is found to have been sero negative at Visit  Month 0
(baseline), the case will not be considered a confirmed HZ case for the efficacy
analysis.
•The subject presents with suspected HZ with rash disseminated from onset and PCR
results are inconclusive (see Figure  3): If the subject is  found to have been
seronegative at Visit  Month 0 (baseline), the case will not be considered a confirmed
HZ case for the efficacy analysis.

APPENDIX A  LABORATORY ASS AYS  
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS):  
CMI responses will be performed by [CONTACT_43055] (or designated laboratory) on 
thawed Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) by [CONTACT_270052]. The assay will be 
performed on samples collected during the course of the study. This assay provides 
information on the frequency of CD4 T cells responding to culture medium or antigens 
(gE peptide pool) by [CONTACT_723841] -, IL-2, TNF -, and CD40L  (here considered as activation markers) . 
Briefly, PBMC collected from the subjects are stimulated for two hours using culture 
medium (for evaluation of the non -specific response), a pool of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_723696]. Then, an intracellular block 
(brefeldin A) is added to inhibit cytokine secretion for a subsequent overnight incubation. 
Cells are then harvested, stained for surface markers (CD3, CD4 and CD8) and fixed. 
The fixed cells are then permeabilised and stained with anti-cytokine  Abs specific to the 
activation markers assessed,  washed and analyzed by [CONTACT_723820].  
The results of ICS assays are expressed as the frequency of specific CD4 T cells per 
million total CD4 T cells.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Rationale/background for changes:  
(from page 4)  
• This amendment relates to the time frame of completing the Zoster Brief Pain 
Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire. This change  will ensure thorough reporting of 
postherpetic neuralgia cases. Subjects with suspected herpes zoster (HZ) are 
required to complete the questionnaire until a 4 -week pain -free period is 
documented and beyond Day HZ -91, if applicable. This amendment removes the 
stipulation “or until Day HZ -91” and therefore, if pain develops after Day HZ -91 
to capture of cases of postherpetic neuralgia according to the protocol definition.  
• Reporting of cytotoxic chemotherapy as a concomitant medication was clarified.  
•  Other minor changes include correcting and updating text regarding country 
approvals of Shingrix, and correcting minor typographical errors.  201190 | Protocol Amendment 5 14 May 2020 | TMF-1772898 | 1.0

Rationale/background for changes: 
This protocol amendment  5 outlines measures that may be applicable during special 
circumstances (e.g., during COVID -19 pandemic). The purpose of the amendment is to 
introduce measures that may allow protection of subject’s welfare and safety, as well 
as maintaining the integrity of the study.  
This amendment is considered substantial  based on the criteria defined in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union  because it significantly impacts the safety of subjects or/nor the scientific value 
of the study.   
As much a s possible all study specified visits and procedures should be completed 
according to the protocol, taking into account clinical judgment and local public health 
guidance to protect the safety of staff and subjects.  
Section 6. 6 outlines the measures which include allowing flexibility in schedule and 
procedures  to optimize site staff safety, patient safety  and to preserve study integrity . 
Other changes include,  
•The classification of HZ cases by [CONTACT_723843]
“not able to decide” to be classified as “not HZ” to Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 for
confirmation of suspected HZ by [CONTACT_723706].
•The timelines concerning data entry into the eCRF  for [LOCATION_009] in Section 13.[ADDRESS_988357]

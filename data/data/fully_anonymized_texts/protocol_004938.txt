 1.0 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:   A Prospective, Multi -Center, Non -Randomized Study to Evaluate 
the Quality of Life Impact After Treatme nt for  Nasal Airway 
Obstruction Using the Aerin Vivaer Stylus  
Investigational Device:  Aerin Medical Vivaer Stylus  
Subject Population:  Male and female  subjects who previously completed participation  
in the Aerin Medical Nasal Obstruction study   
Study Procedure:  Subjects who have completed the  Aerin Medical TP 258 study, “ A 
Prospective, Multi -Center, Non -Randomized Study to Evaluate 
Treatment of Nasal Airway Obstruction Using the Aerin Medical 
Device.”  will complete  the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation 
(NOSE) and  a brief Aerin Medical Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Number of Sites:    Up to 8 study  sites  
Timepoints:    From procedure: 12, [ADDRESS_451267] obstruction.  
 
Chronic nasal obstruction can elicit  many  symptoms, including congestion, stuffiness, 
headache, fatigue, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], snoring  and a decline in health -
related quality of life (QOL)  (Rhee, Book et al. 2003) .  In recent years, there has been growing 
awareness that nasal obstruction may impair various daily and social activities  (Udaka, 
Suzuki et al. 20 06) and result in a degradation of the patient’s overall quality of life  (Rhee, 
Weaver et al. 2010) .  
 
2.[ADDRESS_451268] of nasal obstruction, it is important to measure not only the 
physical symptoms (congestion, obstruction and a bility to breathe) but also the impact of 
those symptoms on the patient’s ability to sleep and the related consequences on rest, 
productivity, concentration and ability to participate in the normal daily activities of work and 
life. 
 
In addition to the physical benefits of increased nasa l patency, there are significant quality of 
life benefits that are associated with better breathing.  After correcting nasal obstruction 
patients report significantly better sleep function ( e.g. better night’s sleep; lessened waking 
up during the night and  difficulty falling asleep ) as well as better psychological function (e.g. 
concentration, productivity and frustration).  (Brown, Hopkins, et. al) .  We believe that these 
benefits may well be durable beyond the initial six months of the study in terms of s ustained 
quality of life impact .

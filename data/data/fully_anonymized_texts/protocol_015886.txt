TITLE:  Understanding and Improving Health Insurance Coverage among Long -Term 
Follow -Up Study Cohort Participants  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_232314] R. Park, PhD, MPH

VERSION DATE :  5/20/[ADDRESS_280336] historically faced denials of coverage, steep premiums, or 
“job lock” that keeps them from changing jobs for fear of losing coverage.2,[ADDRESS_280337]. Park’s 
2011 -2012 CCSS (Childhood Cancer Survivor Study) health insurance survey we found 
that childhood survivors lacked awareness about the ACA16 and had concerns that the 
ACA would increase thei r costs and threaten their quality and continuity of coverage.5, 
16,17  While the ACA requires coverage with no out -of-pocket costs for preventive 
services with “A” or “B” U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) ratings, these 
guidelines are not based  on survivor -specific preventive guidelines and, as such, may 
not cover personalized screening recommendations.[ADDRESS_280338] limi ted health 
insurance literacy (i.e. perceived knowledge, ability, and confidence to make informed 
decisions about choosing and using health insurance ).[ADDRESS_280339] cancer death among Black women in 
Harlem.28 Patient navigation aims to reduce cancer disparities and negative health 
outcomes among vulnerable patient populations. Patient navigators were envisioned as 
proactive patient advocates who provided logistic and emotional support to promote 
patients’ acce ss to timely care.  
 
Existing navigator programs offer limited assistance with understanding and 
managing health insurance benefits and costs. The US healthcare system is 
complex. Even with reform under the ACA, understanding insurance options remains 
comp licated and a source of frustration for consumers.[ADDRESS_280340] employer -sponsored coverage (79.4% vs. 86.0%; p=0.04) and more likely to be 
covered by [CONTACT_5556]/State (12.3% v s. 4.4%; p=0.002). 15.4% of survivors vs. 1.6% of 
siblings had recently been denied insurance (p<0.001). Survivors were more likely to 
borrow money to pay medical expenses (17.3% vs. 9.0% siblings; p=0.002) and not fill a 
prescription due to cost (15.7% vs . 9.0% siblings; p=0.02). Only  27.3% of survivors and 
26.2% of siblings reported familiarity with the ACA.  Concerns about the ACA included 
costs, decreased access to quality coverage, and employment. The majority of 
survivors, across different types of in surances, indicated strong interest in an insurance 
education program.  
 
Recent study team reports of childhood survivors’ underinsurance and its effects 
on financial burden and health care utilization . [CONTACT_232369] led analyses describing 
patterns of health insurance coverage and care accessibility and affordability in an NHIS 
sample of adult childhood cancer survivors compared to adults without cancer during 
2010 -2014. Significantly more childhood survivors reported  being uninsured, delaying 
medical care (24.7% vs 13.0%), needing but not getting medical care (20.0% vs 10.0%), 
and having trouble paying medical bills (40.3% vs 19.7%), compared to controls 
(ps<0.0001).[ADDRESS_280341]. Park and the study team published fi ndings in JAMA Internal 
Medicine and JCO documenting that, compared to siblings, childhood survivors were 
significantly more likely to endorse indications  of being underinsured, including being 
84% more likely to borrow money because of medical expenses, 8 0%more likely to 
worry about being unable to pay for a needed treatment, and 74% more likely to worry 
they wouldn’t be able to afford to fill a prescription. In addition, childhood survivors were 
more likely to report spending a higher percentage of their income on out -of-pocket 
medical costs. Survivors reported spending almost more than $1000 annual out -of-
pocket costs compared to siblings. A higher percentage of income spent on out -of-
pocket medical costs was significantly associated with survivors’ probl ems paying 
medical bills (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 4.4 to 18.0); deferring care for a medical problem (OR, 
3.0; 95% CI, 1.6 to 5.9); skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a test, treatment, or follow -up (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1 to 
4.0); and thoughts of filing for bankruptcy (OR, 6.6; 95% CI, 3.0  to 14.3).29,[ADDRESS_280342]. Galbraith’s work has demonstrated that children and families with 
chronic conditions are vulnerable to health insurance designs with high levels of cost -
sharing and may reduce use of needed care due to cost.57-[ADDRESS_280343] studies of health insurance exchange plans, which documented problems for 
exchange  enrollees with financial burden and unexpected costs;[ADDRESS_280344]. Park directed a smoking 
cessation trial, in collaboration with the Long -Term Follow -Up (LTFU) study at St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , in which she trained childhood cancer survivors to be 
smoking cessation peer counselors and deliver a phone -based intervention.[ADDRESS_280345]. 
Donelan has conducted extensive survey research examining patie nt barriers to cancer 
screening and follow -up and physician referral communication with patients.74-77 She 
examined the effectiveness of a patient navigation program in improving minority 
patients’ follow -up of an abnormal mammogram.  
 
 
c. Rationale of Propose d Research  
 
[ADDRESS_280346] (ACA) offers 
considerable opportunities for childhood cancer survivors to obtain coverage and 
improve access to needed care.  However, in the general population, many peopl e have 
low understanding of available insurance benefits and resources, and have limited 
health insurance literacy (i.e. perceived knowledge, ability, and confidence to make 
informed decisions about choosing and using health insurance). Misperceptions abou t 
which services require  out-of-pocket costs may lead some enrollees to avoid services 
that are in fact exempt from cost sharing. Even with coverage protections from the ACA, 
barriers to obtaining quality coverage (e.g., in states without  Medicaid expansion ) and 
accessing needed care may remain for childhood survivors. Understanding and 
navigating insurance benefits is crucial for cancer survivors to obtain the health care 
they need. In this new post -reform landscape, the degree to  which c overage and costs 
have changed for childhood cancer survivors is stil l largely unknown.  
 
d. Study Site Roles  
 
The sites in this study, MGH, St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the University 
of Utah will each have different, complementary roles. The Partners IRB will be the IRB 
of record for this study, and the collaborating IRBs of St. Jude and the Univers ity of 
Utah will CEDE review to the Partners IRB. Site and IRB roles are described below.  
 
MGH Site Roles  
As the IRB of record and lead site for this study, MGH will be responsible for the 
development and regulation of all study -related materials, docume nts, assessments, 
and interventions. For Phase [ADDRESS_280347] and participant focus group interviews, and the qualitative 
analysis this data. Utilizing the data garnered from thes e interviews, MGH will further 
develop and tailor the intervention content (though MGH will work with collaborators on 
this aspect of the study, MGH will lead in the development and final submission of this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]).  
 
For Phase 2 of the study, MGH will be responsible for the delivery of the intervention 
content. Through the platform of MGH telehealth  (Zoom) , approximately 40 intervention 
arm participants (recruitment processes are described below) will receive brief health 
insurance educational sessions by a health insurance navigator. MGH will be 
responsible for the training and supervision of the navigator.  
 
For Phase 3 of the study, MGH will be responsible for the facilitation and analysis of exit 
interviews conducted with the Phase 2 intervention arm pa rticipants (MGH will not be 
conducting the exit interviews. See University of Utah Phase 3 roles for more 
information).  
 
St. Jude Site Roles  
As one of the collaborating sites for this study, St. Jude will be responsible for all 
recruitment activities. St . Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232315] -Term 
Follow -up Study (LTFU), and study participants will be exclusively recruited from the 
[ADDRESS_280348]. Jude will distribute baseline and follow up surveys to participants and will lead 
all quantitative an alyses of these assessments. Lastly, the University of Utah will 
schedule and facilitate exit interviews with all open pi[INVESTIGATOR_232316]. The University of Utah will also be 
responsible for remun eration of subjects during all phases of the study.  
 
For Phase 2 of the study, the University of Utah study roles mirror those of Phase 1, 
with the distribution of baseline and follow -up surveys to participants, and the collection 
and analysis of said dat a.  
 
For Phase 3 of the study, the University of Utah and MGH will coordinate to schedule 
exit interviews with the Phase 2 intervention arm participants.  
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1:  To develop a psychoeducational health insurance navigation program 
(HINP).  
A1a: To qualitatively assess LTFU participants’  report s of 1) barriers to accessing 
and using quality health insurance 2) resources to support health insurance access and 
use,  3) navigation program content , 4) intervention structure and dose,  5) program 
delivery, 6) program acceptability, 7) aspects of coverage that are not well understood  
A1b: Aim 1b: To qualitatively assess approximately   [ADDRESS_280349] s’ and 
approximately 10 individual  experts’ feedback 1) barriers, 2) resources, 3) content, 4) 
intervention structure and dose , 5) delivery and 6) selection criteria  A1c: To pi[INVESTIGATOR_232317]  (approximate n=10).  
 
Aim 2: To conduct a videoconferencing -based  pi[INVESTIGATOR_232318]  
(n= approximately 80) . 
A2a: To assess the feasibility  (number of eligibles enrolled and sessions 
completed) and acceptability (satisfaction, perceived support) of participant s undergoing 
the HINP.  
A2b: At 3-month post -program follow -up, to assess the efficacy of the HINP to 
assist participant s with accessing and utilizing coverage and managing costs.  Primary 
7 
 outcomes are 1) health insurance literacy and 2) financial distress related to medical 
costs  
A2b Hypothesis : The HINP, compared to enhanced usual care, will improve 
participants’  health insurance literacy and decrease financial distress.  
 
Aim 3: To refine the HINP program for future use.  
A3a: To explore HINP intervention arm participants’ 1) satisfaction with the 
intervention, 2) recommendations for modifications on delivery modality, and 3) 
recommendations for intervention topi[INVESTIGATOR_232319].   
 
Study Design  Overview : The proposed study will take place in 3 phases and will 
involve a total of approximately 122 participants  recruited from the Long -Term  Follow -
Up (LTFU)  study  cohort (See Section III below) -  
 
• In Phase 1 we will develop a psychoeducational health insurance navigation 
program (HINP) through participant  input and a series of advisory board 
meetings  and individual interviews . We will also refine the program by [CONTACT_30224] 
a small group of LTFU study cohort members for an open pi[INVESTIGATOR_232320].  
• In Phase 2 we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_232321], acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of 
the videoconferencing -based HINP  with LTFU study cohort members .  
• In Phase 3 we will further refine the program  through study participant  feedback . 
 
Below we describe the  activities for the  three study phases . Detail on participant 
enrollment and consent procedures for all three phases is included in Section IV.  
 
Phase 1  
Participant  Focus Groups  
Four focus group interviews ( approximately n=8 per grou p) will be conducted with 
randomly selected LTFU study  participant s (see Participant Focus Group Interview 
Guide ); selection will be stratified according to Medicaid expansion status (Y/N) , which 
we will determine based on participant demographic information  from the LTFU data 
records . LFTU  participant s from the original and expansion cohort will be eligible and 
conse nted (Please refer to Sections III and IV for information on subject selection and 
consent procedures) ; we will assure inclusion of men and women.  Groups will last 
about 60 minutes,  and may be conducted through Zoom , a HIPAA compliant  
videoconferencing platform (see Maintaining Confidentiality in Section VII) or in-person . 
Participants will be provided $50 remuneration  by [CONTACT_232355] . Groups will be 
co-facilitated by [CONTACT_3252]-investigators via a semi -structured interview guide  (See  Participant 
Focus Group Guide) . The interviews will be recorded.  
 
Advisory Board Input on HINP  
Three  advisory board meetings  will be conducted, specifically, with n ational oncology 
clinicians and researchers  and [LOCATION_011] -based experts . These groups will be co -
facilitated by [CONTACT_232356] a semi -structured interview guide  that contain s the 
following domains : 1) barriers , 2) resources , 3) content , 4) intervention structure and 
8 
 dose, 5) delivery and 6) selection criteria  (See Advisory  Interview  Board Guide ). 
Advisory board meetings  will also be conducted through Zoom Videoconferencing , via 
phone , or in person. The advisory board focus groups will be recorded  and used for 
quality improvement purposes of the HINP.  
 
Expert Individual Interviews  
We will conduct approximately [ADDRESS_280350] and Expert interviews,  we will assent experts for participation  
in the interviews (See Advisory Board Interview Guide)   
 
Qualitative Analyses to Inform HINP Development  
For qualitative analyses of focus group , advisory board meetings , and individual 
interviews , all data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_232357]. Content analyses will be conducted including a  structural thematic 
framewor k, categories, and coding plan. For focus group data, a coding framework will 
be developed for themes and codes according to participant s’ feedback  on 1) barriers to 
accessing and using health insurance  2) resources to support health insurance access 
and use ,  3) navigation program conten t, 4) intervention structure and dose,  5) program 
delivery, 6) program acceptability, 7) aspects of coverage that are not well understood 
(See Participant Interview Guide)  For advisory board and individual interview feedback, 
a coding framework will be develope d for themes and codes according to the  domains 
of: 1) barriers , 2) resources , 3) content , 4) intervention structure and dose, 5) delivery 
and 6) selection criteria . To ensure coding reliability, coding discrepancies for 
participant focus groups will be resolved through discussion and comparison of raw 
data. Coding will continue until a high level of reliability (Kappa= >0.80) is established. 
Co-investigators will provide an expert review of the results. For expert and advisory 
board interviews, a Rapid Analysis method will be used.   
 
Open Pi[INVESTIGATOR_232322] s  
With feedback from the focus groups , advisory boards , and individual interviews , results 
will be interpreted, summarized, and finalized; the investigators will refine the HINP . 
Then, approximately 5-10 participants will be randomly selected to participate as pi[INVESTIGATOR_161104]  (Please see Sections III and IV for information on subject selection and 
consen ting procedures).  Aspects of the study that will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_232323] e the surveys , 
intervention , and  exit interview.  Participants will be remunerated  $20 for  the completion 
of a baseline survey ,a follow -up survey  and the exit interview by  [CONTACT_232355] . 
Final intervention and survey modific ations will be made.  
 
Phase 2  
9 
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_232324] 80 LTFU participants  to a health insurance 
navigation intervention or to enhanced usual care  (Please see Sections III and IV for 
information on subject selection and consenting procedures ). We have selected this 
sample size of approximately [ADDRESS_280351] program completion follow -up via 
REDCap  or mail . All participants will be asked to complete a follow -up survey 
approximately  3-month s after  the HINP intervention period (in other words  
approximately  5-months post pi[INVESTIGATOR_232325]). ). After completion of the follow -up 
survey, HINP participants will be contact[CONTACT_232358]  (see Phase 3 below) . 
Participants will be remunerated  $[ADDRESS_280352] of a mailed or online copy of a health insurance 
resource guide.  
 
Navigation Intervention  
The intervention will be delivered via synchronous videoconferencing  (real-time delivery 
and communication between the navigator and the participant)  by a trained patient  
navigator  (See Intervention Fidelity in Section VI)  and will consist of 4 , 30-minute 
sessions  delivered every week,  over the span of one month  (for intervention 
development purposes, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232326], over the course of one 
month) . The navigation intervention  group will also  receive  a mailed copy of the  
brochure .  
 
Proposed Navigation Intervention Structure and Content   
The program will be delivered via videoconferencing by a  navigator  over a 1-month  
period. Accordingly, patient navigation is delivered until the desired endpoint is 
achieved; we propose that this will be accomplished with 4 navigation sessions  (See 
Table 1: Proposed HINP Intervention) . The proposed program content was informed by: 
1) aforementioned research identifying childhood survivors’ difficulties with accessing 
and utilizing one’s coverage and managing costs, 2) CCSS health insurance survey, 
and 3) ACA provisions that are relevant to survivor s (e.g., prevention services exempted 
from cost sharing, sources of available coverage and eligibility, benefits policies that 
have cost -related implications like OOP costs, and essential health benefits such as 
prescription medications. Based on advisory board and individual interview feedback , 
the content and tailoring of information will be modified.

Phase [ADDRESS_280353]  
in-depth interviews (see Participant Exit Interview Guide) via videoconferencing with the 
40 intervention participants to assess survivors’ 1) satisfaction with the intervention, 2)  
recommendations for modifications on overall session topi[INVESTIGATOR_232327] 
(e.g., physician communica tion, cost management strategies).   and 3)  
recommendations for modifications on delivery modality (e.g., number and length of 
sessions, videoconferencing delivery) . These will last about 20 minutes and  participants 
will be remunerated $[ADDRESS_280354] SELECTION  
Participants : Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
LTFU study staff at St. Judy Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232328], which allows for participants to be approached for 
additional research studies. For Phases 1 and 2,  the LTFU study staff will recruit a total  
of approximately 122 participants  from the Long -Term Follow -Up Study  cohort .  
Phase 1 will involve recruitment of 32 participant s for four focus groups and 
approximately 5 -10 participant s for the open pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Phase 1 participants will not be 
eligible for P hase 2 participation.  For the focus group activities of this  Phase, 
participants will be randomly selected stratified according to whether they reside in a 
state with or without Medicaid expansion , which LFTU staff will determine based on 
participant addresses available from the LTFU data records.  
Phase 2 will involve recruitment of 80 randomly -selected participant s for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232329]. Participants will be randomly selected stratified according to whether 
they reside in a state with or without Medicaid expansion , which LFTU staff will 
determine based on participant addresses available from the LTFU data records.  
Phase 3 participants will be recruited from the Intervention Arm of Phase 2 
(approximately n=40).  
For both Phases, w e will exclude participants who : (1)  do not have health insurance, 
(2) are under the age of 18, ( 3) are unable to give informed consent due to psychiatric 
or cognitive impairment as determined in consultation with study PI, patient navigator, or 
oncology social worker, and (4)  do not have access to an smartphone , computer or 
tablet with internet access. Importantly, we will closely document and monitor the 
11 
 numbers of individuals who are unable to participate given th is final  criterion, as it will 
further inform the feasibility of this intervention  modality . 
 
Sources of Subjects and Recruitment Methods  
The Long -Term Follow -Up Study  (LTFU)  is an NIH -funded multi -institutional study of 
individuals who were diagnosed before 21 years of age with leukemia, CNS 
malignancies, Hodgkin's disease, non -Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilm’s tumor, 
neurob lastoma, soft tissue sarcom a, bone cancer or serious illness who  survived at 
least five years  after diagnosis . Eligible participants for the LTFU were identified through 
medical records and clinic lists at participating centers in the U.S., yielding a 
retrospectively ascertained coh ort of adult childhood survivors with ongoing, longitudinal 
follow -up. The LTFU  includes individuals  diagnosed with cancer or serious illness 
between [ADDRESS_280355]. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (Supporting Facility for the LTFU)  by 
[CONTACT_232359]. Prospective p articipants will receive an invitation to the study  through email 
and mail  (See LTFU Focus Group,  Open Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] , and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_232330] ). CCSS participants have consented to be contact[CONTACT_232360]. St. Jude 
employs a system called Emma to administer and deliver email campaigns. Emma 
(myemma.com ) is a secure email marketing platform that allows for multi -level 
campaigns with all or segments  of our participants.   It allows for contact [CONTACT_141314], 
simple HTML template design with pi[INVESTIGATOR_232331], tracking of email 
campaign receipts, errors, and opt -outs, and drilling down to review participant level 
activity   If eligible and int erested, prospective participants will read over an enclosed 
Research Consent Form, which they will have the option to either fill out via an online 
DatStat  survey link  (the system that St. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232332], see Data Management in V. Study Procedures ) or to fill 
out the hard copy of the form and mail it back to LTFU staff at St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Additionally, participants may also be recruited through telephone , 
with outreach being done by [CONTACT_232361] , and a  mailed version of the 
recruitment letter might be  sent out,  with instructions be ing provided for how to access 
the online consent portal. Potential participan ts will also be able to get more information 
about the study via a St. Jude website (which will also have a link to the online consent 
form).  Following consent,  the assignment of  a unique study identification number to 
each participant,  and randomization i nto intervention vs. control arms  for Phase [ADDRESS_280356]. Kirchhoff’s team will lead the focus group

Informed Consent  
For the pa rticipant  focus groups , open pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], informed consent will be 
facilitated by [CONTACT_232362][INVESTIGATOR_232333]  (See Focus Group, Open Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_232334] . The 
consent form will describe the study in detail, including the purpose of the research, 
clinical procedures, risks and discomforts, benefits, reimbursements , and alternatives to 
participation. Confidentiality, the right of each subject to request further information, and 
the right of each subject to withdraw from the study  at any time , is fully detailed in each 
consent form. Patients will be informed via the consent form that they can freely choose 
not to participate.  We will exclude participants who, as determined by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_232335], are unable to give consent due to psychiatric or cognitive impairment. There 
will be two separate consenting procedur es for Phase 1 of the study. One consenting 
procedure will be for the focus group participants (n=32), and one consenting procedure 
will be for the open pi[INVESTIGATOR_798] (n=10). For Phase 2 of the study, there will be a 
single consent form for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232336] (n=80). The intervention 
arm participants of Phase 2 (n=40) constitute the Phase [ADDRESS_280358] 80 participants 
among the LTFU  cohort (original and expanded together). To do this, CCSS will use 
stratified random sampling, where we will divide the sample of LTFU participants into 
two groups: residing in a Medicaid expansion state or not. Random samples will then be 
selected from e ach of the two strata until 80 participants are consented and enrolled. 
The 80 selected participants will be randomized to either enhanced usual care (n=40), 
or the health insurance navigation intervention (n=40).  After obtaining informed consent, 
particip ant information will be sent securely to [CONTACT_232370] via SharePoint, an 
encrypted system used to transfer data. [CONTACT_232371]’s team will lead the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232337] .

for use in this study.  The Phase [ADDRESS_280363] via Zoom, audio recordings 
will be stored on Shared File Areas in the Partners Network. Audio recordings will be 
direc tly uploaded into NVIVO and sent securely to study staff at the University of Utah 
for analysis.  
 
 
 
Intervention Arm Components  
Of the approximately 80 participants  recruited for Phase 2 of the study, 40 will be 
randomized to enhanced usual care, and 40 will be randomized to the health insurance 
navigation intervention. As described above, the interventi on arm will involve 4 sessions 
delivered by a navigator.   
 
Intervention Fidelity  
15 
 The patient navigator (PN) will undergo training by [CONTACT_24478] -investigators and pi[INVESTIGATOR_232342] . The NCI, with support from the ACS, established the Patient Navigation 
Research Program (PNRP) to implement and evaluate patient navigator programs. The 
PNRP developed a navigation performance checklist with 3 quality indicators of 
care:79,80 1) participant interaction (e.g., established rapport), 2) care management 
(assessed  subjects ’ understanding), and 3) intervention delivery (e.g., relevant 
information provided on insur ance options, cost savings). Study investigators  will review 
15% of patient navigation encounters using these quality indicator criteria.  
 
Assessments  
 
Phase [ADDRESS_280364] -program follow up survey. Participants will be remunerated  $[ADDRESS_280365] In-depth exit 
interviews with the 40 intervention arm participants to assess participant s’ 1) satisfaction 
with the intervention, 2) recommendations for modifications on overall session topi[INVESTIGATOR_232343] (e.g., physician communication, cost management 
strategies) and 3)  recommendations for modifications on delivery modality (e.g. , number 
and length of sessions, videoconferencing delivery)  . Participants will be remunerated 
$[ADDRESS_280366] and indiv idual expert interviews, audio files will be uploaded into NVIVO software 
and analyzed using a Rapid Analysis method.  Content analyses for the participant focus 
groups an exit interviews will be conducted including a structural thematic framework, 
categori es, and coding plan. For focus group data, a coding framework will be 
developed . To ensure coding reliability, coding discrepancies will be resolved through 
16 
 discussion and comparison of raw data. Coding will continue until a high level of 
reliability (Kapp a= >0.80) is established. Co -investigators will provide an expert review 
of the results.   
 
Focus Group Data : A coding framework will be developed for themes and codes 
according to participant s’ feedback 1) barriers to accessing and using health insurance  
2) resources to support health insurance access and use, 3) navigation program 
content 4) intervention structure and dose, 5) program delivery, 6) program acceptability, 
7) aspects of coverage that are not well understood  
Advisory Board and Individual Interview Data:  A coding framework will be developed for 
themes and codes according to the  advisory board feedback on  1) barriers , 2) 
resources , 3) content , 4) intervention structure and dose, 5) delivery and 6) selection 
criteria  
 
Exit Inte rview Data: A coding framework will be developed  for themes and codes 
according to participants’ feedback on 1) satisfaction with the intervention, 2)  
recommendations for modifications on overall session topi[INVESTIGATOR_232327] 
(e.g., physician com munication, cost management strategies).  and 3)  recommendations 
for modifications on delivery modality (e.g., number and length of sessions, 
videoconferencing delivery)   
 
Quantitative Data  
For quantitative data, [CONTACT_232370]’s team at HCI will conduct the analyses with input 
from [CONTACT_77108] and her study team, and the LTFU  study team. As discussed in 
Participants, we will sample by [CONTACT_232365]. non -expansion states. All 
analyses will be weighted using inv erse sampling probabilities so that results are 
representative of the overall LTFU  study  cohort.   
 
At baseline, all pi[INVESTIGATOR_232344] a baseline. The HINP navigator will use 
each participant’s baseline survey responses to personalize and individualize sessions.  
At the [ADDRESS_280367] -program follow -up, participants will complete the P hase 1  survey 
Outcome questions,  which will be asked within the 5-month time frame period after trial 
enrollment. Participants will also be asked questions below about feasibility and 
acceptability.  
 
We will use descriptive statistics to report on the following endpoints: intervention 
feasibility (percent of participant s enrolled), acceptability (satisfaction, perceived 
support) and efficacy (e.g., ACA familiarity, health insurance literacy, intention to adhere 
to recommended survivorship care, provider communica tion, and coverage status). 
Descriptive statistics will examine group differences at baseline; any imbalances will be 
adjusted. We will use chi square and independent t -tests to compare end -of-intervention 
changes in preliminary efficacy outcomes between the two groups. Although a [ADDRESS_280368] exploratory comparisons 
with other study outcomes to see if trends change in the expected direction. We wi ll 
compare pre/end -of-treatment, within groups, with paired t -tests. In addition, we will use 
bivariate statistics to examine sociodemographic and cancer -related factors (type of 
17 
 diagnosis, age at diagnosis, years since diagnosis, cancer treatment, chronic  
conditions81, cancer treatment (e.g., cranial radiation yes/no, anthracycline  exposure 
yes/no) associated with feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy outcomes.  
 
Outcomes  
Primary Outcomes: Feasibility and Acceptability.   
1. Feasibility : Number of eligible enrolle es and number of sessions completed. 2. 
Acceptabilit y: 4-point scales of satisfaction with navigation services (To what extent has 
this program met your needs? Did you get the kind of health insurance assistance that 
you wanted? H ow helpful has this program been for you?) and perceived support 
(emotional/informational scale of the Medical Outcomes Study social support survey, an 
8-item scale widely used with cancer patients).82-86 
 
Secondary Outcomes:  Efficacy.  
 The ACS’s National Patient Navigator Leadership Summit recommend patient -
navigation outcome measures, which included: perceived knowledge, perceived 
confidence in overcoming barriers to care, and satisfaction with patient navigation 
services. Accordingly, we will measure: 1) health insurance literacy,  2) financial distress 
related to medical costs . 
3) familiarity with healthcare reform policies, 4) insurance status  (among those insured 
at study enrollment) , and 5) discussion with providers about health care costs63 and 
preventive services among those having a visit during this interval (2 -item y/n 
questions).  
Measures  
To evaluate the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will use a mixed methods data collection approach, using both 
quantitative survey items and open -ended questions .[ADDRESS_280369] udy measures will come 
from survey questions repeated from the 2011 -2012 CCSS health insurance survey 
(see Appendix); some new questions will be added and are indicated as such. Survey 
development included a qualitative study conducted with a sample of LTFU 
participants ,[ADDRESS_280370]. 
Kirchhoff’s team via SharePoint , an encrypted system used to transfer data . Data from 
the LTFU  surveys will provide information on sociodemographic and medical history 
since ca ncer treatment, and presence of a medical late effects and chronic health 
conditions including second cancers. The measures will include the following:   
 
Participant  Characteristic  Measures  (see study surveys)  
Characteristics:  Age, Gender, Education, Race/Ethnicity, Partnership/Marital Statu s 
Enabling Characteristics : State  of Residence , Familiarity with ACA Policies  
18 
 Health Insurance Literacy : Confidence in Understanding of Terms (e.g. Coinsurance), 
Confidence in Choosing, Comparing, and Using Insurance, Household and Personal 
Income  
Need: Cancer Diagnosis, Age at Diagnosis, Years Since Diagnosis, Treatment Type , 
Recurrence of Primary Cancer,  Second Malignancy, Other Chronic Conditions .  
Outcome Measures  
Insurance Coverage:  Insurance Status, Difficulty or Denial in Obtaining Coverage due to 
Health History (within past 2 years), Difficulty Finding and Choosing a Plan   
Underinsurance:  Not Takin g a New Job in Order to Keep Health Insurance, Difficulty 
Finding a Provider who Accepts Insurance/ Not Able to Obtain an Appointment as 
Needed, Unmet Healthcare Need Due to Cost, Provider Visits in Past Year, or Out of 
Pocket Healthcare Costs, Out of Pock et Healthcare Costs/Premium Costs, Problems 
Due to Medical Expenses, Worry Related to Medical Costs  
Coverage -Related Variables : Current Coverage and Coverage History  
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Psychological Risks 
Individuals may find it stressful to answer questions about their experiences with health 
insurance coverage and care. The risks associated with these discussions are minimal, 
and do not rise above the level of harm encountered during daily activities.  
The potential risks to subject include: 1) Discussing health insurance coverage and care 
and participating in a program to discuss these issues  with the navigator  and the patient 
navigator has the potential for increasing  psychological vulnerability.  
These r isks will be described by [CONTACT_232366]. Pa rticipants  will be encouraged to discuss any concerns with the patient 
navigator. In the event of a psychiatric emergency, confidentiality may be suspended. If 
the patient navigator notes  severe distress, [CONTACT_77108] will contact [CONTACT_232367], [CONTACT_232373], and the LTFU  Project Director, [CONTACT_232374] McDonald , at St. Jude Children’s 
Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Participants will be informed of the limits of confidentiality at the 
beginning of the study.   
Procedures for Minimizing Risk 
Every effort will be made to minimize the study burden. The time commitment will be 
explained to all participants prior to the focus groups and pi[INVESTIGATOR_232345]. Every 
effort will be made to minimize the length and maximize the convenience or the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232346].  
 
Maintaining Confidentiality  
[ADDRESS_280371]. Personal 
identifiers will be removed from all survey  booklets following completion of initial editing 
and scanning. Similarly, names will be removed from all LTFU abstracted information . 
Study participants are informed of the potential risks and benefits regarding the security 
of their personal information.  MGH TeleHealth enables connection through virtual 
HIPAA -compliant videoconferencing technology including: phone, video, text, email, 
mobile applications and remote monitoring. These virtual visits are conducted via a 
Zoom videoconference platform . Zoom ha s been approved for use in this study by [CONTACT_232368].  
 
VII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The consent form for the overall LTFU  study enrollment clearly states that there may be 
no direct benefit to the participants from study participation. For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232347] e of 
the proposed study, participants in both groups will be given information that could 
improve their ability to access affordable coverage. Participants in the intervention 
group will also receive navigation support, for up to [ADDRESS_280372] (COI) Disclosure forms to their respective 
institutions.  
 
Data Monitoring Plan  
Survey d ata will be collected via [CONTACT_232370]’s team at the Huntsman Cancer Institute . 
Data will be collected via mailed /phone -based  survey and through a secure web -based 
portal  (REDCap ). Data transmissions will be conducted between the CCSS coordinating 
[ADDRESS_280373]. Kirchhoff to generate the participant sample and to 
facilitate data access from the LTFU  basel ine and follow up surveys. While the majority 
of surveys will be done via web using REDCap , we will allow participants to complete 
the baseline and follow -up surveys through mail or phone to improve participation. To 
ensure security, p articipant data colle cted using paper and pencil reco rds will be stored 
in a locked filing cabinet in a  locked room  at the Huntsman Cancer Institute  at the 
University of Utah ; electronic participant tracking databases will be stored on a secure 
server accessible only by [CONTACT_1744] -approved members of [CONTACT_232370]’s study staff. Data 
collected on paper and pencil forms or through phone -based surveys will be thoroughly 
cleaned and entered into the electronic REDCap  database with a 10% check; 
discrepancies will be resolved by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kirc hhoff. [CONTACT_232370] will lead the pi[INVESTIGATOR_232348], and transmit analytic data to MGH using the Hartwell 
Center's FTA protocol (located at http://fta.stjude.org), which is a web -based interface 
with a secure [ADDRESS_280374] access to the 
study data on Shared File Areas. Data quality (including sessions participated in for the 
intervention group, data missingness, and recruitment rates) will be monitored monthly. 
Interim data analysis will b e conducted throughout the trial and results wi ll be reported 
in the annual  ACS progress report.  
 
Adverse Events Reporting  
Serious adverse events will be reported to Drs. Park and McDonald  (LTFU  PI) 
immediately. [CONTACT_77108] will be  responsible for the reporting of any adverse events to the 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77696]. The MGH IRB requires that 
serious adverse events are to be reported to the IRB as soon as possible, but  no later 
than [ADDRESS_280375].

Participated in ADMIRE II StudyIND No.: [ADDRESS_1209720] No.:
2019 -000333 -39
Study Number: Darvadstrocel -3003 Phase: 3
Study Design:
This long -term extension (LTE) study is a follow -up of a phase 3 study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy 
of darvadstrocel (Cx601) in the treatment of complex perianal fistula in Crohn’s disease (CD). To be eligible for the 
LTE study, subjects w ill have completed the final Week 52 assessment in the Cx601 -0303 ADMIRE -CD II study 
(hereafter referred to as ADMIRE -CD II). Informed consent will be obtained at the Week [ADDRESS_1209721] more than a 4 -week gap between the Week 52 visit of the ADMIRE -CD II study and 
signing of the informed consent form (ICF) for the LTE study, a re -baseline visit will be scheduled; the re -baseline 
visit will include the same procedures included at the baseline visit with the addition of interval inflammatory bowel 
disease history and medical interventions since the Week 52 visit. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment 
will not be included at the re -baseline visit. The re -baseline v isit cannot be performed any later than [ADDRESS_1209722] 
completed their participation at Week 52 of the ADMIRE -CD II study. After unblinding of the ADMIRE -CD II 
study, the LTE study will be conducted as an open -label study. Subjects will remain in the treatment group assigned 
in the ADMIRE -CD II study.
Enro llment into the LTE study will not prevent subjects with ongoing fistulizing disease or luminal CD from 
receiving any additional treatment (including any medical or surgical treatment) prescribed by [CONTACT_5657]/her physician for 
the treatment of CD and/or perianal disease. Subjects who receive surgical and/or biologic treatment for the perianal 
fistulizing disease will be considered treatment failures, but should continue in the study. Those subjects who are 
prescribed darvadstrocel will be withdrawn from the LTE s tudy and complete an early termination visit because the 
study will assess the long -term follow -up of investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration in the 
ADMIRE -CD II study.
ADMIRE -CD II is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, international, 
multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of darvadstrocel, adult allogeneic expanded adipose -derived stem 
cells, for the treatment of complex perianal fistula(s) in subjects with CD over a period of 52 w eeks. The primary 
efficacy analysis is to be conducted at Week 24. Thereafter, the double -blind design will be maintained up to Week 
52to allow for evaluation of longer term (Week 52) efficacy and safety . The study  follows an add -on design, with 
subjects receiving any  ongoing concomitant medical treatment for CD at stable doses at the time of screening and 
allowed to continue with it throughout the study. Study subjects are allocated to treatment, in a 1:[ADDRESS_1209723] shown an inadequate response, a loss of response,

efficacy  and safety  of darvadstrocel for the treatm ent of com plex peri anal fistula(s) in subjects 
with Crohn’s disease (CD). The study  showed that a significant ly greater proportion of subjects 
in the darvadstrocel group achieved the primary endpoint of combined remission at Week 24 
compared with placebo. The safet y data showed that Cx601 was well tolerated in the study  
popul ation (Panes et al. 2016) .
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
This study  is an extensio n of the ongoing phase 3 rando mized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
controlled, global, mult icenter study  to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of darvadstrocel  in 
subjects wi th CD and co mplex perianal fistula(s) over a period of 52 weeks ( Cx601 -0303 
ADMIRE -CD II) . This long -term extensio n (LTE) study  is being undertaken as a 
postauthorizat ion measure for the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) to evaluate the long-term 
safet y and efficacy o f darvadstrocel.
There are limited lo ng-term follow
-up data currently  available fo llowing darvadstrocel inject ion. 
The l ongest foll ow-up conducted to date was up to [ADDRESS_1209728] ion 
in the Cx60 1-0302 study . The resul ts of this follow -up study  showed consistency wit h the 
adverse events (AEs) previously reported up to the Week [ADDRESS_1209729] any  safet y 
concerns; however, since these data were limited to a small sample of subjects, a larger sample 
size is required to evaluate long -term efficacy up to 156 weeks after treatment with 
darvadstrocel.

The l ong-term safet y of a single dose of darvadstrocel will be assessed in subjects wi th CD wi th 
complex perianal fistula, including assessment of SAEs, and AESIs 
(immunogenicit y/allo immune react ions, tumorgenicit y, and ectopi c tissue form ation).
9.1.7 Efficacy Measurements
[IP_ADDRESS] Fistula Clinical Assessment
Fistul a clinical  assessment will  consist of a physical  examinat ion of the fistula by [CONTACT_867112] n through the 
external openings treated. The treated tracts and external openings must be clearly ident ified in 
the eCRF to ensure the same treated tracts are assessed during the study  period.
For the purpose of this study , drainage of the treated fistula and abscesses, will not be captured 
as AEs unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relat ionship bet ween the IMP or meet the 
seriousness cri teria. SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_867113] (ICH) guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS] Fistula MRI Assessment
A central  reading MRI will be performed at Week [ADDRESS_1209740] ion in 3 dimensio ns, if any, with fistula location. Analysis will 
include assessment of co llections >2 cm , in 3 axes and directly related to the fistula tracts treated, 
and any  new tracts that might appear.
Before the MRI procedure, it would be necessary  to confirm  that there are no contraindicat ions 
for performing it (eg, hy persensi tivity to gadoliniu m, pacemarker, hip replacement, serum 
creatinine levels >1.5 times upper limit of normal or pregnancy).
[IP_ADDRESS] PDAI
The PDAI is a scoring system to evaluate the severit y of perianal CD (Best et al. 1976 ; Losco et 
al. 2009 ). From the 5- item instrum ent, di scharge and pain will be used. Each category  is graded 
on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging fro m no symptoms (score of 0) to seve re symptom s (score of 
4); a higher score indicates more severe disease.

CONFIDENTIALDiagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  values or el ectrocardi ogram  [ECG] f indings) or symptoms 
shoul d NOT be recorded as addit ional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) 
shoul d be recorded appropriately as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be AEs if they are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG retest an d/or conti nued m onitoring of an abnorm al value or finding are not 
considered an intervention. In addit ion, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings are the result of pathology  for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time of signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. However, if the subject 
experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a concurrent medical condit ion, the 
worsening o r com plicat ion shoul d be recorded appropriately as an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a p re-exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_39747] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) 
any occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_717830], seri ous or severe in nature. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term 
recorde d captures the change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as an AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the PTE (eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening

Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of 
inform ed consent a re not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early  (eg, as an em ergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the worsening 
of the condi tion shoul d be recorded as an AE. Complicat ions result ing from any planned 
surger y shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions resul ting fro m an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):

An AESI (serious or nonserious) is one of scient ific and medical concern specific to the 
compound or program , for whi ch ongoing mo nitoring and rapid communicat ion by [CONTACT_470435]. Such events m ay requi re further investi gation to 
characterize and understand them and would be described in protocols and instructions provided 
for invest igators as to how and when they should be reported to Taked a.
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a list of known AESIs. 
10.1.6 Intensity of AEs
The different categories o f intensit y (severit y) are characteri zed as follows:
Mild: The event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activi ties.
10.1.7 Causality of AEs and SAEs
The rel ationship of each AE/SAE to study  procedures will  be assessed using the following 
categori es:
Related: An AE for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other 
than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, concomitant medications and 
concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, 
complications, concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all AEs/SAEs.
The rel ationship should be assessed as related if the invest igator considers that there is 
reasonable possibil ity that an event i s due to a study  procedure, including treatment 
administration. Otherwise, the relat ionship should be assessed as not related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/SAE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/SAE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but 
with sequelae or the subject died.

Recovered/reso lved: Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/ SAE.
Recovering/resolving: The intensit y is lowered by 1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/SAE with the condit ion remaining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved: There is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/ symptom s or l aboratory  value on the l ast day  ofthe 
observed study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital 
anomaly; the subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/SAE state remaining 
“Not recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae: The subject recovered from an acute AE/SAE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal : The AE/SAEs that are considered as the cause of death.

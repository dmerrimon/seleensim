Study Title: Treatment of Proteinuria Due to T reatment Resistant or Treatment I ntolerant Idiopathic 
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis: A Prospective Study of Acthar (PODOCYTE)  
Protocol Number:  MNK14224049  Type: Phase 4 (US)/Phase 2 (all other countries)  
Condition/Disease: Idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)  
Approximate Number of Subjects:  [ADDRESS_1250850] Participation:  Up to 65 weeks  
Approximate Number of Study 
Centers:  100 globally  Approximate Duration of Study:  5 years  
Design: 
This is a multicenter, multiple dose study to examine the effect of Acthar (repository corticotropin injection, 
hereafter referred to as Acthar) in adult subjects with idiopathic f ocal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) who 
have failed to achieve remission with, or who are intolerant of, 1 or more previous immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
All enrolled subjects will be treated in an unblinded fashion with Acthar 1 mL (80 U) subcutaneous ly (SC) 
3 times per week (3x/week) for 50 weeks to assess the safety and tolerability of Acthar. Taper to 1 mL SC  twice a 
week (2x/week) for tolerability reasons will be allowed. All subjects will have an End of Study/Early 
Termination Visit [ADDRESS_1250851] ( IMP).

3. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
3.1. Overview  
Focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a pattern of histologic renal injury marked by 
[CONTACT_893158] (idiopathic) or 
secondar y. The renal injury results from insults directed at or within the podocyte that eventually 
lead to a rearrangement of the actin cytos keleton and effacement of foot processes in the 
glomerular basement membrane.  The histologic lesions differ in their location relative to the 
glomerular vascular and tubular poles and in the morpho logic features of hyalinosis, capi[INVESTIGATOR_893138], and hype rcellularity (D’Agati et al, 2011 ).  
Primary, or idiopathic,  FSGS is defined by [CONTACT_893159]. 
The glomerulosc lerosis of secondary FSGS usually results from an adap tive respon se to scarring 
from  a previous injury or direct toxic injury to the podocytes. Second ary FSGS may be associated 
with viral infections, be drug induced, or result from cond itions marked by [CONTACT_893160][INVESTIGATOR_893139]. It is important to distinguish primary from 
seconda ry FSGS as the latter is treated only with renin angiotensin system blockade and not 
immunosupp ressive therapy. In addition to clinical history and laboratory findings such as 
hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], histological findings may help differentiate primary from 
secondary  FSGS, with the former exhibiting more widespread  foot process effacement under 
electron microscopy (D’Agati et al, 2011 ). 
Eighty percent  of cases of FSGS are primary and t he incidence of primary FSGS has dramatically 
increased over the past 20 to 30 years (D’Agati et al, 2011 ). Primary FSGS is usually a progressive 
disorder with a low likelihood of spontaneous remission.  Approximately 50% of patients will reach 
end stage renal disease (ESR D) over a period of 5 to 8 years from the time of biopsy if either 
unresponsive to treatment or not treated (Korbet, 1999 ). Five to [ADDRESS_1250859] FSGS as their primary cause  of renal failure 
(Malaga -Diequez et al, 2015 ). The prognosis of patients with primary FSGS is best predicted by 
[CONTACT_893161]. Patients who undergo a complete remission 
(CR)  or partial remission (PR)  have a much better chance of renal survival, 80% or greater  over a 
10-year period, than those who are  unresponsive (Troyanov et al, 2005 ). 
The goal of therapy is to induce  CR of proteinuria that in turn leads to the preservation of renal 
function. The achievement of PR or even substantial reductions in proteinuria translates into less 
rapid loss of renal function. Adult patients with primary FSGS who have nephrotic range 
proteinuria are usually treated with renin angiotensin system blockade and immunosuppres sive 

Mallinckrodt ARC LLC  
MNK1422  
Protocol MNK14224049 Amendment [ADDRESS_1250860] nephrotic range  proteinuria 
(Kitiyakara et al, 2003 ). The initial Kidney  Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
recommended  immunosuppres sive therapy for most adults with primary FSGS is oral prednisone,  
with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) reserved for those at high risk for glucoc orticoid-induc ed 
toxicity. There is no universal agreement on the dose and duration of prednisone therapy, though 
the current KDIGO Clinical Practice Guid elines for glomeruloneph ritis recommends treatment 
with high doses  of prednisone,  1 mg/kg/day or 2 mg/kg every other  day, for between [ADDRESS_1250861] 12 months.  A combinat ion of 
mycophenol ate mofetil (MMF)  and high dose dexamethasone is the KDIGO recommended 
alternative for patients who do not tolerate or respond to the CNI, although MMF is also not FDA -
approved for this indication  (KDIGO Work Group, 2012 ). 
About 50%  of patients with primary FSGS will be resistant to therapy with corticosteroids 
(Bose  and Cattran, 2014 ). The prolonged duration of high doses of prednisone is frequently 
associated with significant side effects  including  the development or worsening of diabetes, 
weight gain, fluid retention, osteoporosis, behavioral changes, and infection. Between 30% and 
40% of patients resistant to steroids will also be resistant to CNIs, and in those who respond, 
relapse is common (Cattran et al, 2007 ). CNIs are also associated with significant side effects, 
such as hypertension and glucose  intolerance, and the long-term neph rotoxicity associated with 
their use may poten tially abrogate the benefit from the reduction in proteinuria. These side effects 
make a number of patients with FSGS intolerant to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Thus a significant unmet need 
for efficacious therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893140].  
As described in the Package Insert, H.P. Acthar® Gel (repository corticotropin injection, 
hereafter referred to as Acthar)  is a highly purified porcine ad renocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) 
analogue ( Mallinckrodt ARD  LLC, 2015 ). Acthar is a purified sterile preparation of the ACTH 
formulated in 16%  gelatin to provide a prolonged release after intramuscular or subcutaneous 
injection. ACTH is a member of the family of structurally related peptides known as melanoco rtin 
peptides. Melanocortin peptides, which in addition to ACTH include the α-, β-, and γ-melanoc yte 
stimulating hormones,  are derived from the natural protein pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_893141]. They bind to 
cell surface G-prote in coupled receptors known as melanoco rtin receptors (MCR s). Five subtypes 
of MCRs have been  identified to date (MC1 R-MC5 R), each with different tissue distributions, 
binding affinity characteristics, and physiological roles (Getting, 2006 ). ACTH is a known agonist 
for all 5 subtypes of MCR (Schioth et al, 1995 ) and recent experiments demonstrate that Acthar 
also has agonist activity for all 5 MCRs (Wright, 2018 ). 
The kidney is a major target of the melanocortin hormone system. MCRs have been expressed 
throughout the kidney, including on glomerular  podoc ytes, and receptor activations initiate 
downstream signaling cascades that ultimately lead to amelioration of renal injury (Gong and 
Dworkin, 2010 ). Agonists of the MC1R  receptor were shown to reduce oxidative stress and 
improve glomerular morpholo gy in nephr otic rats with passive Heymann nephr itis (Lindskog et 
al, 2010 ). Acthar has been shown to diminish podocyte injury and apopt osis and reduce foot 
process effacement in a rodent subtotal nephrectomy model,  an animal model of FSGS (Gong  and 
Dworkin, 2010 ). In addition to improved podoc yte structure and function, glomerulosclerosis,

of ACTH (including Acthar) on  proteinuria. In an observational study, 1 patient with FSGS and 
nephrotic range proteinuria who was resistant  to steroid and cytotoxic therapy was treated with 
synthe tic ACTH and attained PR (Berg and Arnadottir, 2004 ). A published case report 
documented the development of PR in a young woman with FSGS and massive proteinuria 
(greater than  10 grams) who was treated with Acthar  (80 units [ U] subcutaneously [SC] twice 
weekly for 6 months)  after having failed to respond to corticosteroids, mycophenol ate and a CNI 
(Bomback et al, 2011 ). In a prosp ective open  label study, [ADDRESS_1250863] 
2 previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893142] 80 U  SC twice a week  for 6 months and 1 patient 
attained CR ( Bomback et al, 2012 ).  
The largest experience of treating primary FSGS with Acthar is in [ADDRESS_1250864] one course of 
corticosteroids. Patients had received a mean of 2.2 ± 1.[ADDRESS_1250865] to follow up after 5 weeks  of Acthar . 
Seven of the 24 patients had remission of proteinuria, 5 with PR and 2 with CR and 5 of  the 7 
patients had sustained remission with a median follow up time of 90 weeks (Hogan et al, 2013 ).  
3.2. Product Description  
Acthar is currently approved in the US for inducing a diuresis or remission of proteinuria in the 
nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or that due to lupus erythematosus 
(Mallinckrodt ARD  LLC, 2015 ). Acthar is a proprietary ACTH mixture isolated from porcine 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_893143].  
3.3. Dosage and Administration  
Investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be used to denote active drug (Acthar) and/or 
matching placebo.  
In this study all subjects will receive open lab el treatment with Acthar 1 mL (80 U)  SC 3 times 
per week (3x/week) for 50 weeks. Taper to 1 mL SC  twice a week (2x/week) for safety and/or 
tolerability reasons will be allowed. If the dose is tapered to 1 mL SC 2x/week it must remain at 
this level for the remainder of the study. Subjects unable to tolerate 1 mL SC 2x/week will be 
discontinued.  
3.4. Rationale  
The doses for this study were chosen based on safety and feasibility data. The prescribing 
information for Acthar recommends the use of 40 to 80 U administe red intramuscularly or SC 
every 24 to 72 hours in adults and children over 2 years of age; the specific dose is 
individualized according to the medical condition ( Mallinckrodt ARD  LLC , 2015 ). The maximal 
dose is 80 to 120 U SC daily, which has been used safely for the treatment of acute multiple

 sclerosis exacerbations over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Recently published data suggests that 
based on serum cortisol -equivalent exposure (assuming linearity), 80 U of Acthar equates to  
30 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone ( Lal et al, 2015 ).  
Higher doses of Acthar and longer periods of exposure are well tolerated and associated with 
improved outcomes in patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. In the largest published 
experience of Acthar in FSGS, patients received treatment for [ADDRESS_1250866] 
profile was considered acceptable ( Hogan et al, 2013 ). A case report of 10 patients with 
treatment resistant FSGS documented  that prolonged therapy with synthetic ACTH for a median 
of 18 months was well tolerated ( Berg et al, 2012 ). In a study of patients with membranous 
nephropathy, another cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, higher exposure to  Acthar was 
well tolerated and associated with higher rates of remission of proteinuria ( Hladunewich et al, 
2014 ). 
3.5. Risk/Benefit  
Known potential risks of Acthar include potential Cushing’s Syndrome, hypertension, 
gastrointesti nal perforation and bleeding, behavioral and mood disturbances, hyperglycemia, 
enhanced risk for infection, decrease in bone density and/or worsening of peripheral edema 
(Mallinckrodt ARD  LLC , 2015 ). 
Primary FSGS is a progressi ve disorder associated with a low likelihood of spontaneous 
remission and high risk of reaching ESRD if not treated or unresponsive to treatment. The 
incidence of primary FSGS is increasing, as is the number of patients reaching ESRD because of 
the disorde r. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893144] a large number of patients and are associated 
with significant side effects that limit their use and potentially abrogate their benefit. Evidence 
suggests that Acthar will be beneficial in reducing proteinuria and the subsequent deterioration in 
renal function in patients who are resistant or intolerant to currently recommended treatments.  
4. OBJECTIVES

[CONTACT_630023]), might put the patient at risk due to 
participation in the stu dy, or may influence the results of the study or the subject’s ability 
to complete the study.  
6.3. Screen Failure  
Subjects will be allowed to repeat any screening procedure once, as long as the results of the 
repeated procedure will be available within the scre ening visit window. This will not be 
considered a screen failure. The period from the start of the screening visit to the baseline visit 
must not exceed [ADDRESS_1250877] who is a screen failure at the Screening Visit /Visit 1 or at the Baseline Visit/Visit [ADDRESS_1250878] 30 days will be recorded.

methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, MMF, 
rituximab (or o ther B -cell inhibitors), and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (eg, 
Enbrel®, Humira®, Remicade®); intraocular immunosuppressive medications are 
allowed . 
 Any investigational drug, device, or procedure administered as part of a research 
study.  
If any prohibited medication is taken during the study, all pertinent information will be recorded 
in source documents and the electronic case report form (eCRF). The designated study MM must 
be informed immediately so the sponsor may determine whether to continu e the subject in the 
study.  
7.2. Permitted During Study  
If any medication is taken during the study, all pertinent information will be recorded in source 
documents and the eCRF.  
Subjects should remain on stable doses of ACEi and/or ARB  during the study . An adj ustment in 
the dose of these medications would represent a protocol deviation, but would not necessarily 
mandate study termination. Adjustments in dose of a concomitant medication should be 
documented in the subject’s source documents and eCRF.

and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg) that cannot be managed with adjustment 
of concomitant medications such as antihypertensive medications.  
 Development of an edema score of 4 at any visit that cannot be managed with 
adjustment of con comitant medications such as diuretics (see  Section 24.2). 
 Development of congestive heart failure that cannot be managed with adjustment of 
concomitant medications such as diuretics and antihypertensive medications.  
 Development of diabetic signs/s ymptoms (ie, HbA1c  8%, or fasting plasma glucose 
 126 mg/dL, or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia w ith random plasma glucose 
 200 mg/dL).  
 Development of any other AE of at least moderate intensity that cannot be managed 
with adjustment of concomitant m edications.  
Any s ubject whose dose is tapered for any of the reasons described above will have a Taper 
Safety Visit scheduled 2 weeks after the start of the taper.

9.4. Description of IMP  
Acthar is a highly purified sterile preparation of prolonged -release porcine ACTH analogue  in 
16% gelatin for intramuscular or SC injection. Acthar contains 0.5% phenol, not more than 0.1% 
cysteine (added), sodium hydroxide and/or acetic acid to adjust pH, and water for injection. 
Acthar is obtained from processing porcine pi[INVESTIGATOR_410472] a FDA app roved process.  
Acthar is supplied as [ADDRESS_1250889] is assigned. IMP will be stored under refrigeration between 
2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for complete information regarding 
storage and accountability of IMP.  
9.6. Drug Accountability  
In accordance with ICH requirements, the investigator will, at all times, be able to account for all 
IMP furnished to the study site. A drug accountability record will be maintained for this purpose. 
The investigator must mainta in accurate records indicating dates and quantity of IMP received, 
to whom it was dispensed (subject -by-subject accounting) and accounts of any IMP accidentally 
or deliberately destroyed. All unused IMP not involved in immediate subject dosing will be 
main tained under locked, temperature -controlled storage at the study site.  
9.7. Compliance Monitoring  
Prior to beginning the administration of IMP, subjects and/or their caregiver will be trained on 
dosing administration and must exhibit proper technique. Subjects  and/or their caregiver will be 
trained on the completion of the study diary and will complete a study diary entries to record all 
IMP administration and will bring it, along with all IMP kits including used vials to each visit. 
Each time IMP is dispensed compliance will be encouraged. Subject diary training is an ongoing 
process as the diary will be reviewed with the subject at each visit to monitor compliance with 
IMP administration.

13.2. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in a subject who is administered an 
IMP, which does not necessarily have to have a ca usal relationship with this treatment. Examples 
of AEs include but are not limited to:  
 Clinically significant laboratory findings.  
 Clinically significant changes in physical examination findings.  
 An AE occurring due to IMP overdose whether accidental or in tentional.  
 An AE occurring from IMP abuse.  
 An AE associated with IMP withdrawal.  
 Unexpected AE. 
An unexpected AE is defined as an AE, the nature and severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information in the most recent version of t he Investigator’s Brochure.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death.  
 A life -threatening AE.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350].  
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above. Exampl es of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abus e. 
Death

life-threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can b e fatal. Similarly, an allergic 
reaction resulting in angioedema of the face would not be life -threatening, even though 
angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155555] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155556] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155557] a criterion for an AE to be serious; however, it is not in itself 
considered an SAE. In absence of an AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893146] d not be reported by [CONTACT_477573]. Such situations include, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_760].  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_893147] a routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_16018] (eg, stent removal after surgery). This should be recorded in 
the study file.  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not worsened.  
Note that a visit to the emergency depar tment or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477552] 24 hours 
that does not result in admission (unless considered "important medical event" or life -threatening 
event)  is not considered an SAE in Mallinckrodt clinical studies . 
13.3. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Classifications  
IMP Relatedness  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs or SAEs to 
study treatment (Table 7 ). 
Table 7: Adverse Event Relatio nships 
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related  No relationship between the experience and the administration of study treatment; related 
to other etiologies such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Unlikely Related  The current state of knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely.  
Possibly Related  A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study treatment. The 

Mallinckrodt ARC LLC  
MNK1422  
Protocol MNK14224049 Amendment [ADDRESS_1250899]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject.  
Related A reaction that follows a plausible temporal sequence from administration of the study 
treatment and follows a known response pattern to th e suspected study treatment and can 
be confirmed with a positive re -challenge test or supporting laboratory data.  
 
Severity Assessment  
For purposes of consistency, if required the investigator may use the intensity grades presented 
in Table 8 . 
Table 8: Adverse Event Severity Grades  
Grade Definition  
Mild Does not interfere with subject's usual function and activities  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function and activities  
Severe Interferes significantly with subject's usual function and activities  
 
If an AE increases in severity (eg, from moderate to seve re); decreases in severity (eg,  changes 
from moderate to mild); or there is a change in seriousness, a new A E will be opened and the 
original AE will be closed. If an AE is still ongoing at the time of a subject’s completion of the 
follow -up visit, the resolution/stop date and time is left blank.  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial i nfarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical importance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is 
based on the subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.  
13.4. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording and Reporting  
AEs and SAEs will be collected  from signing of the ICF thr ough completion of the end of 
study/early termination  visit. All AEs and SAEs should be recorded in source documents; all 
AEs and SAEs that occur following the first dose of IMP should also be recorded in the eCRF. 
The investigator is required to record th e AE or SAE regardless of the severity of the event or its 
relationship to study treatment. Prior to the first dose at the Baseline Visit/Visit 2, only AEs and 
SAEs related to study procedures will be recorded  on the eCRF . The investigator must follow up 
on all AEs and SAEs reported to have occurred [ADDRESS_1250900]’s 
source document.  
During the period specified above, the investigator will:  
 Record all AEs and SAEs from the signing of the ICF through the completion of the 
End of Study/Early Termination visit  
 Report all SAEs on an SAE Report Form t o Global Pharmacovigilance.  
 Report all pregnancies to Global Pharmacovigilance on the Pregnancy Surveillance 
Form.  
 Submit any Expedited Safety Report or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction from Global Pharmacovigilance to the IRB/IEC.  
The reporti ng requirements for AEs are summarized in  Table 9 . 
Table 9: Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
Seriousness  Reporting Time  Type of Report  
All Serious  Within [ADDRESS_1250901] knowledge

eCRF, and source document  
Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -
up information  Follow up report on the SAE Form, 
appropriate eCRF, and source document  
Nonserious  Per case report form submission 
procedure  Appropriate eCRF and source document  
 
Adverse Events  
AEs can be reported spontaneously or elicited during open -ended questioning (ie, "How have 
you been feeling since your last visit?"), examination, or evaluation of a subject. Signs and 
symptoms must be recorded using standard medical terminology. For subjects  incapable of 
giving consent, the legally acceptable representative may provide information regarding the 
subject’s status.  
All fields on the AE CRF page should be completed for each event with a full description of the 
event and date of onset/start and re solution/stop. A medical diagnosis if known, should be 
recorded in lieu of each individual sign and symptom associated with the diagnosis and 
experienced by [CONTACT_423]. If no medical diagnosis is known, the term used by [CONTACT_893173] o r signs noted by [CONTACT_893174].  
Serious Adverse Events  
Initial Reporting  
SAEs (based on FDA/ICH definition of an SAE) require immediate reporting to Global 
Pharmacovigilance.

(see Section 8.16) to assess their continued well -being.  
The reason for discontinuation will be recorded. A subject may be discontinued from the study 
for the following medical or administrative reasons:  
Withdrawal by [CONTACT_893180]. Subjects who have received at 
least [ADDRESS_1250907] develops a condition that meets any of the exclusion criteria ( Section 6.2) or fails to 
meet an inclusion criteria ( Section 6.1) during the study that is not considered to be an AE or is 
noncompliant (eg, has a positi ve pregnancy or drug screening test), the subject will be 
discontinued from further participation in the study. Discontinuation is also mandated for safety 
and/or tolerability issues as outlined in Section 9.3.2 ). 
Other 
If the above reasons are not applicable, please use the “Other” option and provide the appropriate 
reason for subject withdrawal.  
For subjects who discontinue or are withdrawn from the study for any reason, the investigator 
will notify the sponsor and when possible, the subject will be required to have the early 
termination safety assessments ( Section 8.16) to assess their continued well -being.  
15. STUDY SUSPENSION, TE RMINATION, AND COMPL ETION
The sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason . 
If the investigator suspends or terminates the study, the investigator will promptly inform the 
sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide them with a detailed written explanation. Upon study 
completion, the investigator will provide the sponsor, IRB/IEC, and r egulatory agency with final 
reports and summaries as required by [CONTACT_19124]. Study termination and follow -up will be 
performed in compliance with Mallinckrodt standard operating procedures.  
16. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS
Any change in the study plan requires a prot ocol amendment. An investigator must not make any 
changes to the study without IRB/IEC and sponsor approval except when necessary to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent 
immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, but the change must then be 
documented in an amendment, reported to the IRB/IEC within [ADDRESS_1250908] source documents.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
 17.1. Study and Study Site Discontinuation Criteria  
The sponsor, investigator, or local and national regulatory authorities may discover conditions 
during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated.  This action may 
be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and investigator. Conditions that 
may warrant termination of the study/study site include, but are not limited to:  
 The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to  the subjects enrolled 
in the study.  
 The decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation 
or development of the IMP.  
 Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate.  
 Failure of the invest igator to comply with pertinent regulations.  
 Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to the sponsor, study 
monitor, or local and national regulatory authorities.  
 Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
 Study/study site termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with 
Mallinckrodt standard operating procedures.  
18. DIRECT ACCESS, DATA HANDLING, AND RECORD -KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
18.1. Investigator  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regu latory 
inspections by [CONTACT_155608].  
All subject information will be recorded on source documents. The eCRFs must be fully 
completed and include all required data for all subjects enrolled. All eCRF data must  be 
submitted to the sponsor throughout and at the end of the study.  
If an investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting the study, the 
investigator must notify the sponsor to agree upon an acceptable storage solution. Regulatory 
agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation.  
Any significant changes in study personnel will require an updated Statement of Investigator (ie, 
FDA form 1572) to be filed with the sponsor.  
The investigator must notify their IRB/IEC of proto col deviations in accordance with local 
regulatory and IRB/IEC requirements.  
18.2. Sponsor 
The eCRF data are stored in a database and processed electronically. The sponsor’s medical 
monitor  reviews the data for safety information. The data are reviewed for compl eteness, and 
logical consistency. Automated validation programs will identify missing data, out -of-range data, 
Mallinckrodt ARC LLC  
MNK1422  
Protocol MNK14224049 Amendment [ADDRESS_1250909]’s medical insurance, a government program, or other responsible third party. If laws 
or regulations of the locality in which the study is taking place require addi tional payment of 
expenses, the sponsor shall comply with such laws or regulations. Where applicable, the sponsor 
has taken specific national insurance.  
20. RECORDS RETENTION  
The investigator shall retain and preserve [ADDRESS_1250910]. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_155610]. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. Prior to 
destruction of any study essential documents, the investigator must first obtain written approval 
from the sponsor.  
21. BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES  
Blood and tissue samples will be used only for scientific research. Each sample will be labeled 
with a code so that the lab oratory personnel testing the samples will not know the subject’s 
identity. After the study ends, the clinical laboratory samples will be destroyed, with the 
exception of urine and serum samples for   
 The subject 
may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; however, any 
data already collected from that sample will still be used  for this research.  
22. PUBLICATION POLICY  
22.1. Sponsor’s Publication Policy  
The sponsor’s policy is to publish or otherwise communicate the results of its hypothesis -testing 
clinical studies, regardless of outcome, for marketed products, compound(s) or product(s) being 
investigated that are later approved for marketing. Hypothesis -testing clinical studies are those

 studies intended to provide meaningful results by [CONTACT_893181], thereby [CONTACT_893182]/or efficacy to support product claims.  
Exploratory studies, in contrast, serve to set direction for possible future studies. They have 
significant statistical limitations, provide only preliminary information about a dis ease, 
condition, or product, and are not designed to provide final conclusions on product claims. The 
sponsor does not commit to publish or otherwise communicate the results of every exploratory 
study, because this information is of an exploratory nature a nd often highly proprietary. 
However, if information from an exploratory study is of significant medical importance, the 
sponsor will publish or otherwise communicate the results.  
The sponsor’s decision to publish or otherwise publicly communicate the resu lts of this study 
will be made in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and sponsor policies regarding 
publication and communication of clinical study results.

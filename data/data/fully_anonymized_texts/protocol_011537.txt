Study Design:  
This is a randomized, controlled, open -label, global Phase 3 study comparing overall survival 
following treatment with the anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody tislelizumab to ICC given as a 
secon d line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable/metastatic ESCC that has 
progressed during or after first line therapy.  
Before initiating this Phase 3 study in Japan, a substudy investigating the safety, tolerability, 
PK and preliminary efficacy in  Japanese patients is planned (see Appendix  13 for details).  
After providing written informed consent, completing all screening assessments, and bei ng 
confirmed as eligible for study participation, approximately 500 patients will  be randomized 
1:1 to receive either tislelizumab monotherapy or investigator chosen chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel/docetaxel/irinotecan). The choice of chemotherapy must be determi ned prior to 
randomization.  
At randomization, patient enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_716] 3 factors:  
 Region (Asia [excluding Japan] vs Japan vs [LOCATION_002] [US]/European Union [EU])  
 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1) 
 ICC option (paclitaxel vs docetaxel vs irinotecan)  
After randomization, patients will then begin open -label treatment with one of the following 
regimens.  
 Arm A :  Tislelizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1, given every 21 days  
 Arm B :  One of the f ollowing three single -agent chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_508930]  
o paclitaxel 135 -175 mg/m² IV on Day 1, given every 21 days  
 NOTE: paclitaxel may also be given in doses of 80 -100 mg/m2 IV on a 
weekly schedule, according to local and/or country sp ecific guidelines 
for standard of care  
 Japan: 100 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36, followed by [CONTACT_508997]  
o OR docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, given every 21 days  
 Japan: 70 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, given every 21 days  
o OR irinotecan 125 mg/m2 IV on Days [ADDRESS_657980] v1.1 defined progression is permitted if the patient has evidence 
of “pseudo -progression” ( Section  7.17. 1).

will be required.  
b. At the discretion of the investigator, patients randomized to receive tislelizumab may be treated beyond progression under 
protocol defined conditions. See Section  7.17.1 . 
Study Assessments:  
PFS and tumor response will be assessed by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1 criteria 
(Eisenhauer EA, 2009 ). Tumor imaging (CT with or without contrast or MRI) must be 
perfo rmed within 28 days prior to randomization. On -study tumor assessments will occur 
approximately every 6 weeks ( ± 7 days) for 6 months, then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) until 

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_657982].  
Patient reported outcomes will be collected using the EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC 
QLQ -OES18 and the EQ -5D-5L at baseline, Cycles 1 -6 Day 1 or at the End -of-Treatment 
Visit (whichever occurs first), and at the Safety Follow -up Visit.  
Patients will be evaluate d for any AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring up to 
[ADDRESS_657983] dose of study drug (all severity grades, per NCI -CTCAE v.4.03) or 
initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and immune -related AEs (irAEs) 
occurrin g up to [ADDRESS_657984]. All study drug related SAEs will be followed until they resolve to baseline or 
≤ Grade [ADDRESS_657985].  
Safety and efficacy monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_269395] (IDMC). The IDMC may recommend modifications to the study, including 
termination due to safety and/or efficacy concerns. The functions and membership of the 
IDMC w ill be described in an IDMC Charter.  
Key Eligibility Criteria:  
The population under study is adult patients ( >18 years of age or acceptable age according to 
local regulations, whichever is older at the time of voluntarily signing of informed consent) 
with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ESCC with tumor progression during or after

Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Sets:  
 The Intention -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized patients. It will be the 
primary analysis set for the efficacy analysis  
 Safety analysis set includes all patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study treatment. It 
will be the primary analysis s et for safety analysis  
 Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set includes patients who have received ≥ [ADDRESS_657987] efficacy evaluation. 
Major protocol deviations will be determined and documented before  the database lock 
for the primary analysis  
 The PD -L1 positive analysis set includes patients whose tumor and immune cell score 
(TIC score) met the pre -defined cutoff (specified in the statistical analysis plan) using 
VENTANA PD‑L1 (SP263) Cdx Assay. TIC score is the total percentage of the tumor 
area covered by [CONTACT_397765] -L1 membrane staining and tumor‑associated 
immune cells with PD -L1 staining at any intensity.  
 The PK analysis set includes all patients who received ≥ [ADDRESS_657988] -dose PK data are available  
 The ADA analysis set includes all patients who have a baseline and ≥ [ADDRESS_657989]-baseline 
ADA result  
Statistical and Analytical Methods:  
The primary endpoint (OS) will be tested at a one -sided alpha of 0.025. If the null hypothesis 
for overall survival in the ITT analysis set is rejected, the key secondary endpoint will be 
tested sequentially for OS in the PD -L1 positive analysis set. The inferential test for OS in the 
PD-L1 positive analysis set will be  stopped at the non -significant endpoint of OS in the ITT 
analysis set. The familywise type I error will be strongly controlled at one -sided level 0.025.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival (OS) in the ITT analysis set as defined in the 
primary endpoint section. In the absence of death, patients will be censored either at the date 
that the patient was last known to be alive or the date of data cut-off, whichever comes earlier.  
OS will be compared between the tislelizumab and ICC arms in a stratified log -rank test using 
a significance level of one -sided 0.025.  
The null hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0:  OS in tislelizumab = OS in ICC 
against the alternative:  
H1:  OS in tislelizumab  ≠ OS in ICC 
This will be the p rimary analysis once the targeted event number of approximately [ADDRESS_657990] will be calculated, stratified by [CONTACT_508999] (0 vs 1) and ICC option (paclitaxel vs 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 docetaxel vs irinotecan).  
The median OS and the cumulative probability of OS at every 3 months if estimable, will be 
calculated for each treatment arm and presented with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Kaplan -Meier survival probabilities over time for  each arm will be plotted.  
The treatment effect will be estimated by [CONTACT_6486] a Cox regression  model with treatment arm as 
a factor and with ICC and ECOG performance status as strata . From this model, the hazard 
ratio (HR) of OS  will be estimated and presen ted with a 2 -sided 95% CI.  
These analyses will be performed in the ITT analysis set as the primary analysis. Outcomes in 
the Per Protocol analysis set will be evaluated as a se nsitivity  analysis.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The key secondary endpoint is OS  in the PD -L1 positive analysis set.  
The OS in the PD -L1 positive analysis set  will be analyzed similarly as described in the 
primary analysis for OS in the ITT analysis set.  
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for selected stratification factors (ECOG and 
ICC option) in the ITT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis set will be provided for 
ORR per RECIST v1.1. The 2-sided 95% CIs for the odds ratio in ORR will be calcu lated, as 
well as Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs of ORR for each treatment arm.  
PFS based on assessment by [CONTACT_440277] v1.1 will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) method in the ITT analysis set and the PD-L1 positive analysis set . PFS 
censoring  rule will follow [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 
for Industry, Clinical Trial Endpoints for Approval of Cancer drugs and Biologics ( 2007 ). 
Data for patients without disease progression or de ath at the time of analysis will be censored 
at the time of the last tumor assessment. Data for patients who are lost to follow -up prior to 
documented disease progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment date when the 
patient is known to be pr ogression -free. Data for patients who start to receive new anti -cancer 
therapy prior to disease progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to 
the introduction of new therapy.  
A log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_509000] (ECOG and ICC option) will be used 
to test the PFS differences between two treatment arms. The stratified Cox regression will be 
used to estimate the hazard ratios of PFS. A 95% confidence interval (CI) of HR in PFS will 
be constructed. Median PFS and PFS at every  3 months for each treatment arm, if estimable, 
will be presented.  
Duration of response based on assessment by [CONTACT_509001].  
EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -OES18 will be summarized using func tional 
scale/symptom scale/single item. Observed values and changes from baseline for functional 
scale/symptom scale/single item will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Time to 
clinically meaningful worsening in HRQoL domains will be estimated usi ng Kaplan -Meier 
method. Log -rank test will be employed for testing treatment difference.  
EQ-5D-5L will be compared between tislelizumab and ICC arms. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to show the changes from baseline in each arm. These HRQoL assessment s will be 
analyzed in both the ITT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis set.  
Exploratory Efficacy  Analysis  
Best overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_657991]-baseline response assessment (for any reason) will be considered non -responders for 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 11 BOR. The proportion and its corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for each of the response 
categories (CR, PR, SD and PD) will be pres ented by [CONTACT_2939].  
DCR will be analyzed similarly to ORR in the ITT analysis set and the PD-L1 positive 
analysis set . 
PD-L1 expression , gene expression profiling , tumor mutation burden, MSI, and tumor 
infiltrated immune cells  may be examined in the ITT analysis set. Efficacy analyses, including 
but not limited to OS, PFS, and ORR, may be explored according to biomarker status. Other 
potential predictive markers may also be assessed.  
Safety Analysis  
Extent of exposure to each s tudy drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of 
cycles received (number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative 
total dose received per patient (mg), dose intensity, and relative dose intensity.  
Verbatim description  of AEs will be mapped to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA®) terms and graded per NCI -CTCAE v.4.03 . All treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized. A TEAE is defined as an AE that had an onset date or a 
worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of study drug up to 
[ADDRESS_657992] 
laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_479]. Changes in vital sig ns will also be summarized 
by [CONTACT_765].  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
PK samples will be collected in this study as outlined in the schedule of assessments 
(Appendix  1).  
Tislelizumab serum concentration data, including but not limited to C trough, will be tabulated 
and summarized for each cycle at which pharmacokinetics are to be measured. Descriptive 
statistics will include means, medians, ranges, and standard  deviations, as appropriate.  
Additional PK analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if supported by 
[CONTACT_33653].  
Immunogenicity Analysis  
Immunogenicity samples will be collected in thi s study as outlined in schedule of assessments.  
The immunogenicity results will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_397810]. The incidence of positive ADA and 
neutralizing ADA will be repo rted for evaluable patients. The effect of immunogenicity on 
PK, efficacy and safety may be evaluated if data allow.  
Sample Size  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy analysis of OS comparison 
between tislelizumab and ICC arms in the  ITT analysis set. Assuming an OS -HR (Arm 
Tislelizumab/Arm ICC) of 0.75 and a dropout rate of 5% per year, approximately 500 patients 
will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_657993] patient is enrolled when median OS in the 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 tislelizumab and ICC arms are 8  months and 6  months, respectively. Assuming OS -HR is 0.75, 
based on recently published resul ts of anti -PD-1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_508931] 
(Kojima et al 2019 ; Kato et al 2019 ; Huang et al 2019 ), the study will have a power of 82% 
with a one -sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_657994]  ................................ ................................ ................................ ............ 33

Q2W  Once every [ADDRESS_658001] common 
cause of death from cancer (GLOBOCAN, 2012 ). The incidence, prevalence, and histologic type 
of esophageal cancer varies b etween geographic regions, particularly between Western countries 
(US and Europe) and an area commonly referred to as the “esophageal cancer belt”, which is a 
geographic area stretching across Central -Eastern Asia from the Caspi[INVESTIGATOR_508932] (Arnold M, 2015 ). To illustrate, an estimated 16,940 people in the US will be diagnosed 
with esophageal cancer and 15,690 people will eventually die of their disease in 2017  
(Siegel RK, 201 7). The predominant histologic type of these new diagnoses in the US will be 
adenocarcinoma. The 5 -year survival rates are 18.4% in the [LOCATION_002] (Siegel RK, 2017 ) and 
12 % in Europe (De Angelis R, 2014 ). In contrast, in China, an estimated 477,900 people will be 
diagnosed with esophageal cancer, 90% of which will be of the squamous cell carcinoma 
histology, and 375,000 people will die of this disease (Chen  W, 2016 ; Arnold  M, 2015 ). The 
age-standardized five -year relative survival rate for patients in China diagnosed in 2003 –2005 is 
20.9% ( Li M, 2017 ). 
Recognized risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_397669], low intake of fruits and vegetables, drinking alcohol, 
smoking tobacco, chewing betel quid, and drinking liquids, such as mate, at high temperatures, 
obesity, and c hronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esophageal cancer of either 
histology is much more prevalent in men and more common in an older patient population   
(Shah MA, 2015 ).   
Advanced esophageal cancer is a rapid ly fatal disease. Approximately 40% of patients diagnosed 
with esophageal cancer will have advanced or metastatic disease, with a median survival of 8 -10 
months and an expected 5 -year survival rate <  5% (Lin M, 2016 ; Drahos  J, 2013 ). These data, 
combined with the relative lack of highly effective treatment, are indicative of the large unmet 
medical need in patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer.  
1.1.1.  Treatment Options for Esophageal Carcinoma  
Esophageal cancer treatment is based on the extent of disease at presentation and tumor 
histology. International treatment guidelines are consistent in the approach to the treatment of 
this disease. Therapeutic treatment modalities include endoscopic resectio n for focal disease or 
esophagectomy with lymph node resection for larger tumors in patients who are considered 
medically fit ( Lordick F, 2016 ; NCCN Guidelines Version 1, 2 017; Japanese Gastric Cancer 
Association Gastric Cancer, 2017 ; Stahl M, 2009 ). Chemoradiation therapy may be given to 
those with larger tumors in the neo -adjuvant, peri adjuvant  or in the adjuvant setting. 
Post-operative chemotherapy or chemoradiation is commonly given to patients who have 
positive lymph nodes after R0 resection, or those with microscopic or macroscopic residual 
cancer (R1 and R2 resection, respectively) after su rgery. Systemic regimens given in the 
pre-operative or peri -operative setting commonly include chemotherapy doublets which include 
taxanes, platinum agents, fluorouracil, or irinotecan. Triplet combinations may also be 
considered, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], oxali platin and fluorouracil/capecitabine, but are more toxic and 
restricted to those patients with good performance status. In the pre -operative or peri -operative 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 setting, the choice of chemotherapy regimen is made independent of the tumor histology  
(Lordick F, 2016 ; NCCN Guidelines Version 1, 2017 ; Japanese Gastric Cancer Association 
Gastric Cancer, 2017 ; Stahl M, 2009 ). 
The choice of systemic chemotherapy agents for patients who are not surgical candidates or 
those who have recurrent or metastatic disease that cannot be adequately treatment with local 
therapy are similar to those described abo ve, and also similar to those treatments given to 
patients with advanced gastric cancer  (Lordick F, 2016 ). The choice of agents or regimen may be 
based on the patient’s performance status, and underlying comorbidities. Flu oropyrimidines 
(either 5 -Flourouracil or capecitabine) as monotherapy or in combination with either cisplatin or 
oxaliplatin, taxanes (either paclitaxel or docetaxel) given as monotherapy or with platinum 
agents, or irinotecan in combination with 5 -fluorou racil are suitable front -line treatments. The 
only difference in treatment recommendations between different esophageal histologic subtypes 
is the use of ramucirumab, which is indicated in combination with paclitaxel for patients with 
adenocarcinoma of the  esophagus.  
The overall response rate (ORR) to first -line chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease 
ranges from 20% to 48% and 5 -year survival rates of lower than 30% with significant toxicity 
rates  (Grunberger  B, 2007 ). There is no global consensus on the optimal second -line treatment. 
Very few prospective clinical studies have been completed evaluating second line treatments in 
esophageal carcinoma. Clinical studies have not shown that combination chemotherapy  impart 
an overall survival advantage compared to monotherapy, and have shown that combination 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_508933] ( Song ZB, 2014 ; Thallinger CM, 2011 ; 
Albertsson M, 2007 ). Chemotherapy monotherapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_397670], and include paclitaxel, 
docetaxel or irinotecan (Thallinger CM, 2011 ). There are regional preferences for the 
chemot herapy of choice and may be based on the toxicity profile of each agent. The following 
table ( Table 1) summarizes the efficacy outcomes between the 3 c hemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_259036]. It should be noted that some publications are summarizing data from retrospective 
analyses  (Shirakawa T, 2014 ; Song ZB, 2014 ; Mizota A, 2011 ; Fukushima R, 2014 ). Given these 
caveats, the ORR and median survival appear comparable amongst paclitaxel, docetaxel, and 
irinotecan.

As of 20 May 2019, 54 patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, n=23; 
squamous, n=26; other, n=5; missing, n=1) were enrolled in a Phase 1 clinical study (Study 
BGB -A317_Study_001). The median age of these enrolled patients is 6 2 years (range 30 -80 
years), 41 patients are men and 28 patients are white, 21  patients are Asian, and 5 are other races.  
Prior to study enrollment, these patients had received a median of 2 (range 0 -7) prior treatment 
regimens for their esophageal cancer , with [ADDRESS_658004] 3  prior treatments.   
Tislelizumab was administered for a median of 2.1 months (range 0.2 -31.7 months) in this 
patient cohort. Patients received BGB -A317 at a variable dose of 5  mg/kg; 1  patient was treated 
at the 2 mg/kg dose or a fixed dose of 200  mg.  
The majority (n=52 [96.3%]) of patients experienced at least 1 treatment -emergent adverse 
event. Twenty -eight (51.9%) patients experienced a treatment -related adverse event. The most 
common treatment -emergent adve rse events reported in ≥ 5% of patients in the esophageal 
cohort of any grade or causality included fatigue (27.8%); decreased appetite ( 22.2%); nausea 
(20.4%); cough and constipation (18.5% each);  back pain (13.0%); diarrhoea, vomiting, 
dyspnoea  and pyrex ia (11.1% each); abdominal pain upper, anaemia, arthralgia, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease,  hypercalcaemia, hypothyroidism, pneumonia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977], and weight decreased  (9.3% each ); abdominal pain  and musculoskeletal pain (7.4% 
each); dysp hagia, headache, hypokalaemia, infusion -related reaction, insomnia, myalgia, neck 
pain, oedema peripheral, oesohageal obstruction, pleural effusion, proteinuria, and pruritus (5.6% 
each).  
Serious adverse events were reported in 19 patients ( 35.2%). The ser ious adverse events that 
occurred in more than 1  patient included esophageal obstruction in 2 patients (3.7%), pneumonia 
in 4 patients ( 7.4%), and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_19272] 2  patients (3.7%). One patient 
experienced a treatment -related NCI -CTCAE Grade 3 event of dermatitis.  
Three patients reported adverse events with fatal outcome: mediastinitis (1), sepsis (1), and 
hemoptysis (1). These events are recognized complications of esophageal carcinoma; none were 
considered related to study treatm ent. 
Of 54 esophageal carcinoma patients, 53 patients were evaluable for response. Confirmed 
complete and partial responses were observed in 1 patient (1.9%) and 5 patients (9.4%), 
respectively. The resulting ORR was 11.3%. In addition, 14 patients (26.4%)  had a best overall 
response of stable disease (SD) . A total of 24 patients (45.3%) had a best response of progressive 
disease (PD) in this cohort, and the assessments for 8 patients (15.1%) were missing.  
Nivolumab  
Efficacy results in ESCC patients treated  with nivolumab, an anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody, 
were reported from an open -label, single -arm, multi -center phase 2 study (Kudo  T, 2017 ). This 
study enrolled 65 patients with squamous cell esophageal carcinoma even though the stu dy was 
designed to recruit patients with squamous, adenocarcinoma, or adeno -squamous cell histologies. 
These patients were considered refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidine, platinum, and 
taxane -based chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Patients were treated with nivolu mab 3  mg/kg given intravenously 
once every 2 weeks (Q2W). Tumor response was assessed approximately  every 6  weeks. Median 
follow -up was 10.8 months (Interquartile range 4.9 –14.3) and patients received a median of 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene

CI:10 -28) and 22% (95% CI:14 -33) by [CONTACT_3138]. The DCR, defined as the number 
of patients with a complete or partial response, and those with stable disease of any duration was 
42% (95% CI: 31 -54) by  [CONTACT_509002] 53% (95% CI:41 -65) patients by [CONTACT_69804]. The median duration of overall survival was 10.8 months (95% CI 7.4 –13.3). The 
median durations of progression -free survival were 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4 -2.8) and 2.3 (95% CI:1.5 –
3.0) months, by [CONTACT_397758], respectively. IrRECIST objective response 
and disease control were reported in 16 patients (25%, 95% CI: 16 -37) and 43 patients (67%, 
95% CI: 55 -77), respectively, and median irRECIST progression -free surv ival was 2.9 months 
(95% CI:1.9 -5.6).  
Pembrolizumab  
KEYNOTE -028 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), a multicohort, phase 1b study recruited advanced esophageal 
squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma patients with disease progression following 
standard therapy. Patients received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W . Response was asses sed 
every [ADDRESS_658005] v1.1 by [CONTACT_107443]. In this cohort of 23 patients, 87% received ≥ 2 prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_508934] 17 patients had esophageal sq uamous cell carcinoma. After a 
median follow -up of 7.1 mo nths (range, 1.3 -19.4 mo nths), ORR was 30% (95% CI: 13% -53%) 
(five patients with a response had ESCC and 2 patients had adenocarcinoma) and the stable 
disease rate was 9% (95% CI, 1% -28%). The median  duration of response was not reached 
(range, 5.5 -11.8 mo nths). The median time to response was 3.7 months (range, 1.8 -8.3 months) 
(Doi T, 2016 ). 
1.2. Background Information on Tislelizumab  
1.2.1.  Pharmacology  
Tislelizumab (also known as BGB -A317) is a humanized, immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) -variant 
monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death protein -1 (PD -1) under clinical 
development for the treatment of certain human malignancies.  
Tislelizumab acts by [CONTACT_509003] -1 with high specificity as 
well as high affinity (dissociation constant [K D] = 0.15 nM). It competitively blocks binding by 
[CONTACT_397760] -1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death protein ligand -
2 (PD -L2), thus inhibit ing PD -1-mediated negative signaling in T -cells. In in vitro  cell-based 
assays, tislelizumab was observed to consistently and dose -dependently enhance the functional 
activity of human T -cells and pre -activated, primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. I n 
addition, tislelizumab has demonstrated antitumor activity in several allogeneic xenograft 
models, in which peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co -injected with human cancer cells 
(A431 [epi[INVESTIGATOR_131715]]) or tumor fragments (BCCO -028 [colon canc er]) into 
immunocompromised mice.  
In addition, tislelizumab is an IgG4 variant antibody to gamma fragment crystallizable region 
(Fc) receptors (FcγR) such as FcγRI and FcγRIIIA, and has very low binding affinity to 
Complement 1q (C1q), a subunit of comple ment  1. In vitro assays with tislelizumab suggest 
either low or no antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody -dependent cellular

1.2.2.  Clinical Pharmacology  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetics  
In the Phase 1 BGB -A317_Study_001 and Study BGB -A317 -102, interim pharmacokinetics 
(PK) analysis (data cutoff date of [ADDRESS_658006] 2017) was conducted using noncompartmental 
methods, using serum concentrations from patients who r eceived doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, and 
10 mg/kg Q2W , and 2.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, and 200 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) (Phase  1a 
Parts 1, 2, and 3, and Phase 1b in BGB -A317_Study_001), and patients who received doses of 
200 mg Q3W in Phase 1 of Study BGB -A317 -102 (n=19). The maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C max) and the area under the plasma or serum concentration -time curve (AUC) 
increased in a nearly dose -proportional manner from 0.5  mg/kg to 10  mg/kg, both after 
single -dose administration and at steady -state. Preliminary PK data from 27 patients who were 
administered 1 dose of 200 mg Q3W (Phase  1a, Part 3 and Study BGB -A317 -102) showed 
tislelizumab concentrations between the range of concentrations observed for patients who were 
administered 2 mg/kg and 5  mg/kg doses.  
Preliminary population PK analysis using a [ADDRESS_658007] -order elimination 
shows a systemic plasma clearance (CL) of tislelizumab of 0.173 L/day, volume of distribution 
(Vd) in the central and peripheral compartments of 2.89 L and 1.76 L, respectively, and half -life 
(t1/2) of approximately 19 days. Race, gender, and body weight were not significant covariates on 
the CL of tislelizumab, which supports fixed -dosing across different ethnic groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Lack of Ethnic Differences in Ex posure  
Based on the information available to date, tislelizumab exposure in Asian and Caucasian 
patients is similar, and the safety profile at clinically relevant doses is tolerable and manageable.  
Preliminary PK data from Study BGB -A317_Study_001 are summ arized in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
above. Comparison of PK parameters indicates that after a single intravenous (IV) infusion of 
tislelizumab, dose -normaliz ed exposure (AUC 0-14day) was consistent between Study 001 with 
non-Chinese (n=91 mostly Caucasian) and Study 102 with Chinese (n=20) patients in the study, 
which was conducted in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, and Taiwan. Additionally, 
dose-normali zed exposure ( AUC 0-14day) was consistent between BGB -A317_Study_ 001 across 
Asian (n=27, including 20 Chinese and 7  non-Chinese Asian) and Caucasian (n=80) . 
These preliminary findings indicate that ethnic differences are unlikely to affect the exposure of 
tislelizumab.  
Furthermore, these data are consistent with findings of limited ethnic differences in studies of 
therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (Chiba  et al 2014 , Matsushima et al 2015 , Zhou et al 2012 ). In 
addition, t here do not appear to be clinically relevant differences in PK exposures from studies of  
2 other anti-PD-1 antibodies , nivolumab and pembrolizumab  (Shimizu et al 2016 ; Yamamoto et 
al 2017 ).

A pooled analysis of monotherapy studies was conducted to pro vide a comprehensive safety 
assessment separately from combination therapy. For monotherapy, the safety profile is similar 
across tumor types. There is no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of adverse events 
(AEs) to tislelizumab dose level. The safety profile for single -agent tislelizumab is similar to 
those observed in other PD -[ADDRESS_658008] that 
tislelizumab can result in antitumor activity across a variety of tumor types. Antitumor activi ty 
has been observed across the dose ranges evaluated in patients. In Phase 3 controlled studies, the 
safety profile of tislelizumab monotherapy is acceptable in the context of the observed clinical 
efficacy, and manageable using established safety guideli nes. Please find the overview of safety 
and efficacy in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Please refer to the Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure  for more detailed information on 
efficacy and safety of tislelizumab.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overview of Safety

Of the 1,273 total patients treated in the Pooled Monotherapy studies, 846 (66.5%) experienced 
at least one treatment -related TEAE. The most commonly occurring TEAEs assessed as related 
to tislelizumab were aspartate aminotransferase  (AST) increased (128  patients, 10.1%), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased (123 patients, 9.7%), hypothyroidism (113 patients, 8.9%), 
rash (96 patients, 7.5%), and pyrexia (94 patients, 7.4%).  
Related TEAEs by [CONTACT_509004] 1,273 total patients treated in the Pooled Mono therapy studies, 163 (12.8%) experienced 
at least one Grade 3 or higher TEAE assessed as related to tislelizumab . The only Grade 3 or 
higher TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 1% (12 or more patients) in the total study population were 
AST increased (19 patients, 1.5%) and ALT increased (15 patients, 1.2%).  
As of the data cutoff 20 May 2019, 105 patients (8.2% of the total population) died within [ADDRESS_658009] study drug dose in the Pooled Monotherapy studies. Of these 105 patients, there 
were 21 patients (1. 6% of the total population) who had an AE with a fatal outcome within [ADDRESS_658010] study drug dose. Of the 536 patients (42.1% of the total population) who died 
more than [ADDRESS_658011] study drug dose, 14 patients (1.1% of the total populat ion) died 
as a result of an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Overview of Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Study BGB -A317_Study_001 (Data Cutoff 20 May 2019)  
Study BGB -A317_Study_001 was a 2 -stage study consisting of a Phase 1a dose -escalation and 
dose-finding component with 3 parts to establish the maximum t olerated dose (MTD), if any, a 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the Phase 1b, and a flat dose (fixed dose) followed by a 
Phase 1b component to investigate efficacy in select tumor types in indication expansion arms 
and to further evaluate safety and tol erability of tislelizumab.  
As of the data cutoff 20 May 2019, there were 451 patients treated in the study and 441 patients 
were included in the efficacy evaluable set.  
Across all disease cohorts, there were 5 patients (1.1%) with a complete response (CR) . A total 
of 55 patients (12.5%) had a confirmed partial response (PR). The resulting overall clinical 
response rate was 13.6%. Additionally, there were 142  patients (32.2%) with a best overall 
response of SD. A total of 199 patients (45.1%) had a best res ponse of PD in this study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Study BGB -A317 -102 (Data Cutoff 20 May 2019)  
This is a two -phase , non -randomized, Phase 1/2 study of tislelizumab monotherapy in Chinese 
patients with advanced solid tumors. Phase 1 includes a dose verification  substudy  and a 
substudy of PK evaluation of the investigational products derived from 2  manufacturing 
processes and scales. Phase 2 is an indication expansion study . 
As of the data cutoff 20 May 2019 , of the 300 patients treated in Study BGB -A317 -102, 249 
patients were inc luded in the Efficacy Evaluable Analysis Set. Across all disease cohorts and 
study phases, there was 1 patient (0.4%) with a CR. A total of 44 patients (17.7%) had a 
confirmed PR. The resulting overall clinical response rate was 18.1%. Additionally, there were

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 91 patients (36.5%) with a best overall response of SD. A total of 113 patients (45.4%) had a 
best response of PD in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Immune -Related Reactions  
Of the 1273 total patients for the Pooled Monotherapy studies, 602 (47.3%) experienced at least 
one immune -related adverse events (irAEs) of any grade. The most commonly occurring irAEs 
of any grade were AST increased (129 patients, 10.1%), ALT increased (124 patients, 9.7%), 
hypothyroidism (113 patients, 8.9%), rash (97 patients, 7.6%), and pruritus  (78 patients, 6.1%). 
Analysis of the total patients with at least one irAE that also was ≥ Grade 3 in severity showed 
that 121 patients (9.5%) experienced such events.  The most commonly occurring irAEs 
≥ Grade  [ADDRESS_658012] increased (21 patient s, 1.6%), gamma -glutamyltransferase 
increased (17 patients, 1.3%), ALT increased (16 patients, 1.3%), pneumonitis and pneumonia (9 
patients each, 0.7%).  
Beyond patients treated with tislelizumab monotherapy, a case of fatal myocarditis and 
polymyositis was  reported in 1 patient who received a single dose of tislelizumab, in 
combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin. The patient’s initial symptoms were dyspnea and 
tea-colored urine 2 weeks after starting treatment. Elevated urine and serum cardiac and skelet al 
muscle enzymes were reported. The patient died of multi -organ failure 6 days later.  
1.2.4.  Benefit -Risk Assessment  
Patients with advanced unresectable/metastatic ESCC represent a population with a high unmet 
medical need. There is no globally accepted standard  of care regimen for patients with 
previously treated unresectable/metastatic ESCC. Single -agent chemotherapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_505465], but the choice of agent differs by [CONTACT_509005].  
Data from clinical studies of immu ne checkpoint inhibitors and the data collected in the Phase [ADDRESS_658013] potential 
benefit for these patients. The safety profile across immune checkpoint inhibitors is consistent, 
suppo rting an acceptable tolerability profile.  
Given the unmet medical need and limited treatment options for this indication, the benefit/risk 
assessment based on available tislelizumab Phase [ADDRESS_658014] of this study.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be established to regularly monitor 
the safety of tislelizumab when compared with investigator chosen chemotherapy (ICC).

3.3.1.  Screening Phase  
Screening evaluations will be performed within 28 days prior to randomization. Patients who 
voluntarily agree to participate will be required to sign the informed consent form (ICF) prio r to 
undergoing any screening procedure (refer to Appendix  1 for details).  Rescreening under limited 
conditions may be allowed after consultation with BeiGene, eg, when a patient narrowly misses a 
laboratory criterion and it is correctable and not due to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_508935]. Rescreening is allowed only once. T he investigator is to assess patient eligibility 
according to  the latest screening assessment results.  
Patients who are suspected to h ave serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_508936] ( refer to Appendix  1 for details ).  
Archival tissue is required to be collected for the purpose of biomarker analysis if available. If 
archival tumor tissue samples are not available, collection of a fresh tumor b iopsy at baseline is 
requested if accessible. Please refer to Section  7.[ADDRESS_658017] v1.1 criteria.  
3.3.2.  Treatment Phase  
After completing all screening activities, patients confirmed eligible will be randomized in a 1:1 
ratio to receive either tislelizuma b or ICC treatment (paclitaxel/docetaxel/irinotecan).  
Investigator chosen chemotherapy (ICC, paclitaxel/docetaxel/irinotecan) should be determined 
prior to randomization. The treatment plan is presented in Table  2.

from continued treatmen t, eg, the patient has evidence of “pseudo -progression”. Specific 
requirements for post -progression continuation of patients treated with tislelizumab are described 
in Section  7.17.1 . 
Radiologic assessment of tumor -response status will be performed approximately every 6  weeks 
(± 7 days) for 6 months, then every 9 weeks ( ± 7 days) until disease progression. Tumor 
response will be assessed by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1 (see Appendix  2) (Eisen hauer 
EA, 2009 ). Details are pr ovided in Section  7.4. 
Patients randomized to tislelizumab treatment will undergo blood sampling for PK assessment at 
predetermined timepoints, as outlined in Appendix  1. Procedures for collection of tislelizumab 
PK samples are described in the Laboratory M anual.  
The HRQoL measurement will be performed using the EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC 
QLQ -OES18 and the EQ -5D-5L at baseline, prior to study treatments on Day 1 of Cycles  1 
through 6 or at the End -of-Treatment Visit (whichever occurs first), and at the Safety Foll ow-up 
Visit.  
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_42466]/SAEs (toxicity grades assigned 
per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  [NCI -CTCAE] 
v4.03), new physical examination findings, and clinically si gnificant changes in laboratory 
assessments. Adverse events of special interest in this study will include the incidence and 
severity of irAEs. Vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group  (ECOG) performance status 
change, and electrocardiogram (ECG) re sults will also be used for safety assessment. Safety 
assessments are further detailed in Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  1).

Please refer to Section 7.12 for details.  
3.3.3.  End of Treatment  
The End -of-Treatment (EOT) Visit is conducted when the investigator determines that 
tislelizumab or ICC will no l onger be used, at which time all of the assessments listed for the 
EOT Visit will be performed. If a patient withdraws from treatment at a study visit when all 
assessments required for EOT have been completed, EOT assessments do not need to be 
repeated.  
Patients randomized to tislelizumab treatment who have RECIST -defined PD by [CONTACT_69804], but who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], have evidence of continued clinical 
benefit from tislelizumab  may continue to receive this drug only after revi ew and agreement by 
[CONTACT_7195]. In such cases, patients must complete the EOT visit only after permanent 
discontinuation of tislelizumab.  
If routine laboratory tests (eg, hematology, serum chemistry) are completed within 7  days before 
the End of Treatment Visit, tests need not be repeated. In subjects who discontinue study 
treatment, tumor imaging should be performed at the time  of treatment discontinuation 
(± 4 weeks window). If a previous scan was obtained within [ADDRESS_658019] them to determine the survival status.  
Optional biopsies and/or blood sam ples will be taken for the patients who have confirmed 
disease progression to explore resistance mechanism as outlined in Section 7.12. 
3.3.4.  Safety Follow -up Phase  
In both study arms, patients who discontinue treatment for any reason will be asked to return to 
the clinic for the Safety Follow -up Visit within 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study 
drug or before the initiation of a new anticancer therapy (whichever occurs first) to collect AEs 
or SAEs that may have occurred after the patient discontinued from the study treatment. All 
drug-related SAEs will be recorded by i nvestigator after treatment discontinuation until patient 
death, withdrawal of consent, or lost to follow -up, whichever occurs first. In addition, telephone 
contacts with patients should be conducted to assess irAEs and concomitant medications (if 
appropri ate, ie, associated with an irAE or is a new anticancer therapy) at 60  days (±  14 days), 
and 90  days (±  14 days) after the last dose of study drug, regardless of whether or not the patient 
starts a new anticancer therapy. If patients report a suspected irA E at a telephone follow -up 
contact, the investigator should arrange an unscheduled visit if further assessment is indicated . 
All AEs, including  SAEs, will be collected as described in Section  8.4.  
The End of Treatment (EOT) Visit may be combined with the Safety Follow -up visit, provided 
that the EOT occurred 30 days (± 7 days) after the last study treatment; the assessments for both 
visits should be performed. Patients who discontinue study treatmen t prior to disease progression 
will have their tumors assessed as outlined in Section  7.4.

and the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  1), until radiographically confirmed disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, death, or until the study completes, 
whichever occurs first . 
Patients will be followed for surv ival and further anticancer therapy information after 
discontinuation of study treatment via telephone contact, email, or other communications; review 
of patient medical records; and/or in -person clinic visits approximately 1  month (4  weeks ±  7 
days) after  the Safety Follow -up Visit and every month thereafter ( Section  7.16). 
3.3.6.  End of Study  
The end of study is defined as the timepoint when the final data for a clinical study were 
collected, which is after the last study patient has made the final visit to the study location.  
The sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reas ons for terminating the study 
early may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to patients  
 Overall patient enrollment is unsatisfactory  
The sponsor wil l notify each investigator if a decision is made to terminate the study. 
Prematurely discontinued patients should be seen as soon as possible for an EOT Visit and 
Safety Follow -up Visit.  
The investigators may be informed of additional procedures to be foll owed to ensure that 
adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will 
be responsible for informing Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IECs) of the early termination of the stud y. 
The sponsor has the right to close a site at any time. The decision will be notified to the site in 
advance. Reasons for closing a site may include but are not limited to the following:  
 Excessively slow recruitment  
 Poor protocol adherence  
 Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
 Noncompliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), applicable laws and regulations

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 3.4. Study Rationale  
3.4.1.  Rationale for Tislelizumab in the Treatment of ESCC  
High levels of FcγR -expressing myeloid derived cells (eg, M2 macrophage, MDSC) in tumor 
tissues predict a poor survival of tumor -bearing animals after anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody 
treatment; this is possibly due to Fc -FcγR -mediated ADCC or antibody -dependent cellular 
phagocytosis (ADCP) depletion of effector T cells ( Gül and van Egmond 2015 ; Prieto et al 2015 ; 
Makarova -Rusher et al 2015 ; Beers et al 2016 ; Dahan et al 2015 ). As a no - to low -FcγR -binding 
agent (thus causing minimal ADCC/ADCP effect), tislelizumab may show superio r efficacy and 
lower toxicity in esophageal carcinoma. Available data from a clinical study with other 
anti-PD-[ADDRESS_658020] both a manageable safety profile and pr omising antitumor activity in 
patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic ESCC ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Finally, according to the latest data collected from the Phase [ADDRESS_658021] common 
side effects consistent with known class effects of other anti -PD-1 antibo dies ( Section  1.2.3 ). 
Given the unmet medical need and limited treatment options in this indication, the benefit/risk 
assessment based on available  tislelizumab Phase [ADDRESS_658022] -in-human stu dy 
BGB -A317_Study_001, as well as other clinical study data, were analyzed in aggregate to 
determine the recommended dose for pi[INVESTIGATOR_397672]. The flat dose of 200  mg IV 
Q3W was selected for further evaluation.  
Rates of treatment -related a dverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in 
patients receiving 2  mg/kg and 5 mg/kg Q2W  and Q3W were comparable, suggesting no clear 
dose-dependence across these regimens. Similarly, confirmed overall response rates (ORRs) in 
patients treated with tislelizumab 2  mg/kg and 5  mg/kg Q2W  ranged between 10% and 15%, 
compared to a range of 15% to 38% for patients treated at 2 mg/kg and 5  mg/kg Q3W.  
According to PK data from BGB -A317_Study_001, Phase 1a, the CL of tislelizumab was found 
to be independent of body weight, ethnicity, and gender, and the observed serum exposure of a 
200 mg dose fell between serum exposure observed after 2 mg/kg and 5  mg/kg doses (dose range 
with comparable safety and efficacy rates).  
Additionally, no unexpected tr eatment -related AEs occurred in the 200  mg fixed dose cohort 
(BGB -A317_Study_001, Phase 1a, Part 3) when compared to body -weight -based cohorts. Of the 
evaluable patients treated (n=13), 3 patients (23%) had a BOR of partial response (PR), 
4 patients (31%) had a BOR of stable disease (SD), and 6 patients (46%) had a BOR of 
progressive disease (PD). Therefore, clinical activity with a manageable and tolerable safety 
profile is expected to be maintained in patients receiving tislelizumab 200  mg Q3W.  
In conclus ion, tislelizumab 200  mg Q3W is the recommended dose for this Phase 3 global study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 3.4.3.  Rationale for Selection of Paclitaxel/Docetaxel/Irinotecan as Comparator  
Current guidelines recommend the combination of fluorouracil and cisplatin, either alone or in 
comb ination with a third drug such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_464213] a taxane, as the most effective first -line 
treatment option (Ando  N, 2015 ). In China, cisplatin with a taxane is also preferred to treat 
ESCC as first -line therapy. Approximately 40% of patients for whom first -line treatment fails 
will be potential candidates for second line therapy  (Thallinger CM, 2011 ). In a relapsed or 
refractory disease setting, however, data in the second -line ESCC treatment setting are scarce, 
and there is no established consensus on the optimal second -line chemotherapy treatment so far.  
National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN, 2017 ) guidelines endorse u se of docetaxel, 
paclitaxel and irinotecan in the second -line treatment of esophageal carcinoma. While these 
agents are widely used, there are recognized geographic differences in the choice of treatment in 
this disease setting despi[INVESTIGATOR_508937], PFS and 
OS between agents. In Japan, taxanes are widely used as second -line treatment of esophageal 
carcinoma (Kuwano H , 2015 ). In China, irinotecan is often chosen as second -line treat ment . 
As discussed in Section  1.1.1 , ORR to single -agent chemotherapy with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or 
irinotecan range between 4% and 44% ( Table 1). Progression -free survival, being less than 4 
months, in the 13 single -agent studies reviewed by [CONTACT_509008] (2011 ). In addition, 
combination chemo therapy as second line therapy showed more serious adverse events than 
single regimen, suggesting an unfavorable risk benefit profile. So, new well -designed, 
adequately powered clinical second -line studies may lead to improved outcome, but Phase  3 
studies for comparison of the different forms of therapy are indispensable.  
3.4.4.  Rationale of Stratification Factors  
Patient enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_509009] (Asia excluding Japan vs 
Japan vs US/EU), ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), and  by [CONTACT_509010] (paclitaxel vs docetaxel 
vs irinotecan).  
The highest incidence of esophageal cancer is seen along two geographical belts, one from north 
central China through the central Asian republics to northern Iran, and one from eastern to 
southern Afr ica (Arnold M, 2015 ). Patient enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_509011], as well as other facto rs associated with those geographic regions (ie betel 
quid exposure, nutritional factors).  
Patients with an ECOG performance score (PS) of [ADDRESS_658023] atus has been shown to 
be prognostic for survival in patients with both limited and advanced squamous esophageal 
carcinoma ( Tustumi F, 2016 ; Uchinami Y, 2016 ). In a retrospective analysis , Tustumi et al 
(2016)  observed a 1 -year survival rate of 62.3% in patients with an ECOG PS <2 vs. 31.7% in 
patients with an ECOG PS ≥2. These results are consistent with that published by [CONTACT_509012] 
(2016)  who found a significant association of PS with outcome in a univariate analysis, but not 
in a multi -variate analysis, as well as data published by [CONTACT_509013] (2014) . 
The ICC option will be determined for all patients prior to the randomization. Since

physician for new adverse events, such as wo rsening of pre -existing conditions, or adverse 
events that cause any change in performance status or activities of daily living. Management of 
suspected adverse drug reactions may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of 
paclitaxel therapy. Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or 
discontinuation are provided in Section  8.6.  
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions on drug preparation, storage, and 
administration.  
5.2.3.  Docetaxel  
Docetaxel will be administered on Day 1, given every 21 days  after all procedures/assessments 
have been completed as detailed in Appendix  1 and Section  3.3.1 . The initial treatment of 
docetaxel should be administered within 3 business days of randomization. Docetaxel should be 
administered at a dose of 75 mg/m2 by [CONTACT_12781] 60 minutes according to manufa cturer 
standards. Doses lower than 75 mg/m2 are allowed if considered appropriate for any given 
patient. The labeled dose and schedule for docetaxel in Japan is 70 mg/m2 IV on Day 1, given 
every [ADDRESS_658042] dose of docetaxel is dependent upon the patient’s baseline body surface 
area. Subsequent doses of docetaxel must be recalculated if the change of body surface area 
(increase or decrease) is ≥ 10% from baseline. Subsequent doses should not be recalculated if the 
change (increase or decrease) of body surface area is < 10% from baseline.  
Premedication might be recommended prior to infusion of docetaxel according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions and local standard s. To alleviate the incidence and severity of fluid 
retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions, premedication of oral 
corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone 16 mg per day (eg, 8 mg twice daily) for 3 days should 
be given prior to infus ion of docetaxel. The premedication regimen should be determined by [CONTACT_509017]. All medications will be 
documented on the appropriate CRF.  
There is a 3 -day window for all treatment in subsequent cycles if the cycle length is 21 days. If 
dosing is delayed due to administrative or other reasons (holidays, intercurrent illnesses, etc.),

5.3. Handling of Overdose  
Any overdose (defined as ≥  600 mg of tislelizumab in a 24 -hour period) or incorrect 
administration of any study drug should be noted on the study drug administration eCR F. AEs 
associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug will be recorded on the AE 
eCRF. Any SAEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration are  required to  be 
reported within [ADDRESS_658044] (IMP) required for completion of this study (tislelizumab, 
paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan) will be provided by [CONTACT_456], as required by [CONTACT_509018] -specific guidance. The investigational site will acknowledge receipt of IMP. Any 
damaged shipments will be replaced.  
Accurate records of all IMP received, dispensed, returned, and disposed should be recorded on 
the site’s Drug Inventory Log. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details of IMP management.  
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_1755]/or study personnel at each patient visit and

investigator is responsible for tislelizumab, paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan, reconciliation, 
and record maintenance. In  accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the 
investigator or designated study center personnel must maintain tislelizumab, paclitaxel, 
docetaxel and irinotecan accountability records throughout the course of the study. This person 
will docu ment the amount of tislelizumab, paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan received from the 
sponsor, the amount supplied, and/or administered (and returned by [CONTACT_1962], if applicable).  
5.5. Disposal and Destruction  
After completion of the study, all unused tisleliz umab , paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan will 
be inventoried and packaged for return shipment by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_508942]. The inventoried supplies may also be destroyed on site or at 
the depot according to institutional policies, after receiving written sponsor approval.

antiemetics, antidiarrheals, pain m edications, and nutritional support) and in a patient ’s 
well-being  are allowed. All concomitant medications will be recorded on the eCRF including all 
prescription, over -the-counter, herbal  supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If changes 
(stop or start) in concomitant medication occur during the study,  documentation of drug and 
reason for use will be recorded on the  eCRF.  
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_658046] 1 month and 
be at non -immunosuppressive doses (≤ 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) before the next 
tislelizumab administration. The short -term use of steroids as prophylactic treatments ( eg, 
patients with contrast allergies to diagnostic imaging contrast dyes) is permitted.  
Patients with active hepatitis B defined as either detectable HBsAg or HBV DNA at baseline 
must initiate treatment [ADDRESS_658047] dose. Patients should continue effective antiviral treatment during the study to 
decrease potential viral re -activation risk. Tenofovir and entecavir are recommended in the 
American Association for the Study of Liver Dis ease (AASLD) guideline because they lack 
resistance with long -term use ( Terrault et al 2016 ; AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidance Panel, 2015 ). 
The investigator might use other antivira l agents, if appropriate, following local guidelines. 
Management of antiviral therapy is at the discretion of the investigator; however, reason(s) must 
be provided in the CRF if a patient with active hepatitis B is not treated with antiviral 
prophylaxis.  
BeiGene does not require patients with active hepatitis C to receive treatment with antiviral 
therapy. Patients with detectable HCV RNA and who are receiving treatment at screening should 
remain on continuous, effective antiviral therapy during the study. Investigators can consider 
treatment with sofosbuvir alone or in combination with other antivirals following the AASLD 
guideline or the local guidelines as appropriate. However, interferon -based therapy for either 
HBV or HCV is not permitted on study. Pati ents who are given antiviral therapy must initiate 
treatment at least [ADDRESS_658048] dose.

prior to enrollment and at a stable dose. Bisphosphonates are permitted during the study for a 
non-malignant indication.  
For those patients randomized to the ICC arm of the study, premedication  with steroids  is 
acceptable . 
Palliative (limited -field) radiation therapy is permitted, but only for pain control or prophylaxis 
of bone fracture to sites of bone disease present at baseline. If repeat imaging demonstrates new 
sites of bone metastases and the criteria for disease progression has been met, according to the 
investigator, then the patient should discontinue study treatment, and receive appropriate 
treatment  
 If the lesion being considered for palliative radiation is a target or non -target lesion 
per RECIST v1.1, it will become non -evaluable for response assessments  
 The case should be discussed with the medical monitor to ensure that the patient is 
still eligible to continue on study treatment  
Additionally, palliative radiation or other focally ablative thera py for other non -target sites of the 
disease is permitted if clinically indicated per investigators’ discretion and after consultation with 
the medical monitor. Whenever possible, these patients should have a tumor assessment of the 
lesion(s) before receiv ing the radiotherapy to rule out progression of disease.

CYP3A4. Caution should also be exercised when paclitaxel is concomitantly administered with 
known substrates (eg, repaglinide and rosiglitazone), inhibitors (eg, gemfibrozil), and inducers 
(eg, rifampin) of CYP2C8. Potential interactions between paclitaxel, a substrate of CYP3A4, and 
protease inhibitors (ritonavir, saquinavir, indinavir, and nelfinavir), which are substrates and/or 
inhibitors of CYP3A4, have not been evaluated in clinical studies.  
Patients receiving docetaxel should avoid concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin and voriconazole).; however, if strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 
cannot be avoided, the docetaxel dose should be reduced per the product label.  
Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or St. 
John’s wort) with irinotecan unless there are no therapeutic alternatives. Do no t administer 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], nefazodone, 
nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) and UGT1A1 inhibitor (eg, atazanavir,

6.3.2.  Supportive Care guidelines for Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Irinotecan  
Palliative and supportive care for other disease -related symptoms and for toxicity associated  with 
treatment will be offered to the subjects in ICC arm of  this study. Supportive care measur es may 
include but are not limited to antidiarrheal agents, antiemetic agents, opi[INVESTIGATOR_428289] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_508947], appetite stimulants, and granulocyte and erythroid growth factors. Non -drug 
supportive care procedures may be  performed as medically nece ssary and appropriate in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Details  of interventions, procedures, or blood products (eg, blood 
cells, platelets, or fresh frozen  plasma transfusions) should be recorded on the eCRF. 
Appropriate management of  hypersensitivity r eactions is described in Section 8.8.5 . The use of 
other specific  supportive care agents is presented as below.  
Diarrhea: In the event of Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, supportive measures may include hydration, 
loperamide, octreotide, or other antidiarrheals. If diarrhea is severe (ie, requires intravenous 
hydration) and associated with fever or severe (Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad – spectrum 
antibiotics ma y be prescribed as clinically necessary. Subjects with severe diarrhea or any 
diarrhea associated with severe nausea or vomiting should be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508948]. In cases of irinotecan induced diarrh ea, 
antibiotic therapy should be initiated if the subject develops ileus, fever or sever neutropenia.  
Nausea/Vomiting: The use of antiemetic agents is permitted at the discretion of the investigator  
(Hesketh PJ, 2016 ). 
Additional Supportive Care Guidelines:  
Analgesic Agents: The use of analgesic agents is permitted at the discretion of the investigator. 
The chronic use of non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with a  high risk of bleeding 
(eg, indomethacin, ibuprof en, naproxen, or similar agents) is strongly  discouraged unless at the 
discretion and responsibility of the investigator after careful  assessment of the individual 
bleeding risk of the subject. Chronic use of analgesic agents  with no or low bleeding risk ( eg, 
paracetamol/acetaminophen, metamizole, dipyrone,  propyphenazone) is acceptable.  
Granulocyte -Colony Stimulating Factors (G -CSF): The use of G -CSF is permitted during the 
study at the discretion of the investigator according to the standard of care pract ice guidelines. G -
CSF or similar agents are recommended following Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia of duration >  5 days 
or following any incidence of febrile neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L or < 1.0 x 109/L with 
predicted decline to < 0.5 x 109/L over the next 48 h ours with a single temperature  ≥ 38.5°C or a 
sustained temperature  ≥ 38.0°C over 1 hour) (Smith TJ, 2015 ). 
Erythroid Growth Factors: The use of erythroid -stimulating factors (eg, erythropoietin) is 
permitted at the discreti on of the investigator based on American Society of Clinical Oncology 
(ASCO) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, or according to local guidelines 
(Rizzo JD, 2010 ; Bokemeyer et al, 2007 ).

Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. All 
assessments must be performed and documented in the  medical record and eCRF for each 
patient.  
Dosing will occur only if the clinical assessment and laboratory test values (which must be 
available before any dosing) have been reviewed and found to be acceptable per protocol 
guidelines. If the timing of a p rotocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday, weekend, or 
other event s, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest feasible date (the visit window is 
provided in Appendix  1), with subsequent dosing continued on the scheduled [ADDRESS_658050] -of-care tests o r examinations performed prior to obtaining informed consent

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( Appendix  3) will be assessed at the 
Screening Visit (within 7 days prior  to randomization), pretreatment on Day [ADDRESS_658053] -of-
care tests or  examinations ( Appendix  1) performed prior to obtaining informed consent and ≤  [ADDRESS_658054] of care tests. During the study, patients will undergo tumor assessments approximately 
every 6 weeks (± 7 days) for 6 months, then every 9  weeks (±  7 days). All radiographic 
assessme nts performed to assess tumor status at baseline and during study treatment to assess 
response should be performed at the same investigative site.  
Screening assessments and each subsequent assessment must include computed tomography 
(CT) scans (with oral/I V contrast, unless contraindicated) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
of at least the neck, chest and abdomen. If a patient is known to have a contraindication to CT 
contrast media or develops a contraindication during the study, a non -contrast CT of the  chest 
plus a contrast -enhanced MRI (if possible) should be performed. If a CT scan for tumor 
assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner, the CT 
acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full -contrast diagnosti c CT scan.  
Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable brain 
metastases, ie, without evidence of progression by [CONTACT_9661] (confirmed by [CONTACT_509021], or confirmed by [CONTACT_509022]) for at least four 
weeks prior to randomization. Any neurologic symptoms must have returned to baseline and 
subjects must have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and have not used steroids 
for brain metastases for at leas t [ADDRESS_658055]/MRI of the head at baseline is required for patients who are suspected t o 
have central nervous system (CNS) metastases.  
Bone scans (Technetium -99m [TC -99m]) or sodium fluoride -PET (NaF -PET) should be 
performed at screening if clinically indicated. If bone metastases are present at screening and 
cannot be seen on subsequent CT  or MRI scans, or if clinically indicated, TC -99m or NaF PET 
bone scans should be repeated when either progression in bone or a CR in the target lesion is 
suspected.  
CT scans of the extremities and all other known sites should also be performed if clinical ly 
indicated and followed throughout the study, if there is evidence of metastatic disease in these 
regions at screening.  
For subsequent tumor assessments, the same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites 
at screening are required to be used th roughout the study (eg, the same contrast protocol for CT 
scans). All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at each 
subsequent tumor evaluation.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658056] v1.1 ( Appendix  2). The same 
evaluator should perform assessments, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits.  
At the investigator’s discretion, additio nal radiographic scans or more frequent assessments 
should be performed if clinically indicated.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment early for reasons other than disease progression or 
death will continue to undergo tumor assessments as scheduled unt il the patient begins a new 
anticancer treatment, experiences disease progression, withdraws consent, dies, lost to follow -up, 
or the study completes, whichever occurs first. If previous tumor imaging was obtained within 6 
weeks prior to the date of discon tinuation, then additional tumor imaging at treatment 
discontinuation is not required.  
After signing a separate informed consent, patients who continue tislelizumab treatment beyond 
the initial diagnosis of radiographic disease progression ( Section  7.17.1 ) will be monitored with 
a follow -up scan at least 4 weeks later or at the next scheduled tumor assessment (not to exceed 
6 weeks) from the prior ra diographic scan date.  
Tumor assessments are required to be performed on schedule regardless of whether study 
treatment has been administered or held.  
7.5. Adverse Event Collection  
All adverse events, including SAEs, will be collected as described in Section  8.2.  
7.6. Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination, including an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
cardiovascular, dermato logical, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and neurological 
systems is required to be performed at screening. Any abnormality identified at baseline will be 
recorded on the Medical History eCRF with appropriate disease/condition terms. Height  
(baseline only) will be measured and recorded in the eCRF.  
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations will be performed. Changes from baseline will be recorded in patient notes.  
7.7. Ophthalmologic Exam inations  
Eye examination, visual acuity test, and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic 
test) will be assessed at the Screening Visit in all patients. Eye examination, visual acuity test, 
and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent dia gnostic test for retinal examination) 
captured as standard of care prior to obtaining written informed consent and within 28 days of 
randomization may be used for the screening evaluation. Patients on the tislelizumab arm will 
undergo repeated assessments approximately every 15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment 
and a final assessment < 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment.   
In addition, investigators should solicit patients regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, 
or ocul ar inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab treatment. For any 
change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further management 
guidance (see Appendix  10).

Vital signs will include measurements of weight, pulse rate and blood pressure (systolic and 
diastolic) while the patient  is in a seated position after resting for 10 minutes, and  body 
temperature (˚C).  
For all infusions of tislelizumab, vital signs will be assessed before the infusion, and between [ADDRESS_658057] 10 minutes, and a repeat ECG should be performed t o confirm findings, if any.  
7.10. Clinical Laboratory Tests and Pharmacokinetic Blood Sampling  
Clinical laboratory assessments will include the following, of which certain elements will be 
collected:  
 Hematology (complete blood count [CBC], including red blood cell [RBC] count, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell [WBC] count with automated differential 
[neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils], and platelet 
count). A manual differential can be done if clinically indicated  
 Serum chemi stry (glucose, blood urea nitrogen [BUN] or serum urea, creatinine, 
sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphorus, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] [optional], total protein, albumin). All 
patients will have creatine k inase (CK) and creatine kinase -cardiac muscle isoenzyme 
(CK-MB) testing at screening and at all scheduled visits during the first 3 treatment 
cycles, all pre -dose assessments from Cycle 4 onwards, and at the EOT and Safety 
Follow -up Visits.  
NOTE : In the event that CK -MB fractionation cannot be evaluated in the local 
laboratory, troponin I and/or troponin T should be assessed instead; the same test

 HBV and HCV serology (HBsAg, HB cAb and HCV antibody)  
If laboratory tests at screening are not performed within 7 days prior to the administration of 
study drug(s) on Cycle 1 Day 1, these tests should be repeated and reviewed before study drug(s) 
administration. Hematology and serum chem istry (including liver function tests) as specified 
above should be performed weekly for the first 2 cycles and at the beginning of each subsequent 
cycle; results are to be reviewed within 3 business days before study drug administration. 
Weekly peripheral  blood cell counts should be performed on all patients receiving paclitaxel, 
docetaxel, and irinotecan.  
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], storage, and handling of samples for the assessment of tislelizumab PK and ADA 
assays will be managed through a central laboratory. Instructi on manuals and supply kits will be 
provided for all central laboratory assessments.  
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory:  
 ADA assays : Serum samples will be tested for the presence of ADAs to tislelizumab 
using a validated im munoassay  
 PK assay : Serum samples will be assayed for tislelizumab concentration with use of a 
validated immunoassay  
7.11. Anti -drug Antibody Evaluation Procedures  
Tislelizumab may elicit an immune response.  Patients with signs of any potential immune 
response  to tislelizumab will be closely monitored with repeat sampling for anti -drug antibody 
(ADA detection as well as clinical evaluations.  
Validated screening and confirmatory assays will be employed to detect ADAs at multiple 
timepoints throughout the study (Appendix  1).  The immunogenicity evaluation will utilize a 
risk-based immunogenicity strategy (Bai S, 2012 ; Worobec A, 2004 ) to characterize ADA 
responses to tislelizumab in support of the clinical development program.  
7.12. Tumor Tissue and Biomarker Assessment Procedures  
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], storage, and handling of archival tumor, fresh tumor, and residual tumor tissue for the 
assessment of biomarkers will be managed through a central laboratory. Refer to the Laboratory 
Manual for details of sample handling.  
Archival tumor tissues (representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or 
approximately 10 unstained tumor specimen slid es) are required to be sent to central laboratory 
for biomarker analysis such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PD -L1 status if 
available. In addition to PD -L1 expression, other exploratory predictive biomarkers, such as gene 
expression profiling , tumor mutation burden, MSI, and tumor -infiltrated immune cells , that are 
related to response or clinical benefit of tislelizumab may also be evaluated.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658059] confirmed disease progression 
during the study in accessible tumor sites to explore resistance mechanism. If feasible, follow -up 
biopsies should be taken from the same tumor lesion at baseline. Written patient consent i s 
required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
Tumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content. Fine -needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], brushing, cell pellets from pleural effusion, and lavage samples are not acceptable.  
Optional blood samples (appro ximately 10 mL each timepoint) will be taken at the time of first 
tumor response (tumor assessment is CR or PR), and/or disease progression for all randomized 
patients, to explore the association of blood -based biomarkers (such as ctDNA, cytokine, 
immune c ell profiling, etc) with response, resistance, and prognosis to tislelizumab or 
chemotherapy. Written patient consent is required for blood sample collections.  
Refer to the Schedule of Assessment ( Appendix  1) for detailed schedule.  
7.13. Health -Related Quality of Life Assessment  
Patients will be asked to complete the EORTC -QLQ -C30 ( Appendix  7), EORTC -QLQ -OES18 
(Appendix  8) and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires ( Appe ndix 9) prior to study treatment initiation, 
Cycle 1 through Cycle 6 Day 1 (± 7 days) or at treatment discontinuation (whichever occurs 
first), and at the Safety Foll ow-up visit according to the schedule in Appendix  1. The 
questionnaires will be provided in the patient’s preferred language and given to the patient prior 
to being seen by a health care professional.  
7.14. Timing of Assessments during the Treatment Phase  
All visits must occur within ± 3 days from the scheduled date, unless otherwise noted 
(Appendix  1). All assessments will be performed on the day of the specified visit unless an 
acceptable time window is specified. Assessments scheduled on the day of study treatment 
administration (Day 1) of each cycle should be performed prior to study treatment infusion 
unless otherwise noted. Laboratory results are required to be reviewed prior to study treatment 
administration.  
If the timing of a protocol -mandated study visit coincides with a holiday, weekend, or other 
event s, the visit should be scheduled on t he nearest feasible date (the visit window is provided in  
Appendix  1), with subsequent dosing rescheduled to meet the requirement of interval for dosin g 
visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 7.15. Safety Follow -up  
In both treatment arms, patients who discontinue treatment for any reason will be asked to return 
to the clinic for a Safety Follow -up Visit within 30 days (± 7 days) after the last study treatment 
or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever comes first. In addition, 
telephone contacts with patients should be conducted to assess irAEs and concomitant 
medications (if appropriate, ie, associated with an irAE or is a new anticancer therapy) at 60 (±14 
days), an d 90 days (±14 days) after the last dose of tislelizumab, regardless of initiation of a new 
anticancer treatment. Beyond 90 days, investigators should continue to report any SAEs that are 
believed to be related to study drug(s) if they become aware of them . If patients report a 
suspected immune -related AE at a telephone follow -up contact, the investigator should arrange 
an unscheduled visit if further assessment is indicated.  
All AEs, including SAEs, will be collected as described in Section  8.4. 
The EOT Visit may be combined with the Safety Follow -up visit, provided that the EOT 
occurred 30 days (± 7 days) after the last study treatment; the assessments for both visits should 
be per formed. Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to disease progression will have 
their tumors assessed as outlined in Section  7.4. 
See the st udy flowchart provided in Appendix  1 for assessments to be performed at the Safety 
Follow -up Visit.  
7.16. Survival Follow -up 
Following discontinuation of the study treatment, all patients will be followed for survival status 
and study drug -related SAEs, beginning approximately 1  month (4 weeks ±  7 days) after the 
Safety Follow -up Visit and approximately monthly thereafter or as directed by [CONTACT_456]. 
Information on Survival Follow -up and the subsequent anticancer treatment will be collected via 
telephone calls, email, or other communications; patient medical records; and/or clinic visits 
approximately every month until death, l oss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study 
terminatio n by [CONTACT_456].  
7.17. Patient, Treatment, Study, and Site Discontinuation  
Patients who discontinue study treatment early, but who have not withdrawn consent for 
follow -up, should be followed for ass essments of antitumor activity (unless a new anti -cancer 
treatment is initiated - see Section  7.4), safety ( Section  7.15), and survival ( Section  7.16), if 
possible.  
7.17.1.  Discontinuation of Patients  
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study or discontinue study treatment at 
any time for any reason. In addition, the investigator has the right to discontinue a patient from 
the study treatment at any time. Reasons that a pat ient may be discontinued from the study 
treatment may include, but are not limited to the following:  
 Patient withdrawal of consent at any time  
 Any medical condition that the investigator or sponsor determines may jeopardize the 
patient’s safety, if he or  she were to continue in the study  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 66  Investigator or sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
 Patient noncompliance  
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who discontinue from study 
treatment. The primary reason f or discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate 
eCRF.  
Patients should discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following:  
 Symptomatic deterioration (eg, uncontrollable pain secondary to disease or 
unmanageable ascites, etc.) a ttributed to disease progression  
 Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following:  
 Intolerable toxicity related to tislelizumab, paclitaxel, docetaxel or irinotecan, 
including development of an immune -mediated or paclitaxe l/docetaxel/ irinotecan -
mediated adverse event determined by [CONTACT_290267]’s potential response to therapy and severity of the event  
 Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues 
on study treatment  
 Use of another non -protocol anticancer therapy ( Section  6.2.2 )  
 Pregnancy  
Patients will be permitted to continue tislelizumab if pseudo -progression is suspected and/or 
there is a reasonable belief that the patient could derive benefit from tislelizumab after RECIST 
v1.1 criteria for progressive disease are met, and all of the following criteria are met:  
 Absence of c linical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including clinically 
significant worsening laboratory values)  
 ECOG PS ≤ 1  
 Absence of rapid progression of disease or progression at a critical anatomical site 
(eg, progression of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_508949]) or that 
necessitates urgent alternative medical intervention  
If, in the judgement of the investigator, the patient is anticipated to benefit from continued 
treatment, the patient must re -sign an informed consent, agreeing to continue treatment beyond 
radiographical disease progression. If patients agree to continue treatment beyond radiographical 
progression, a follow -up radiographic evaluation will be performed no later than 6 weeks after 
the initial scan that diagnosed progr essive disease, as outlined in Section  7.4.  
If, in the judgement of the investigator, rapid early progression is evident (“hyperprogression”) , 
tislelizumab should be discontinued.  
The primary reason for study drug discontinuation will be documented in the medical chart and 
on the appropriate eCRF. Patients who discontinue study drug prior to disease progression will 
not be replaced.

follow -up, or withdraws consent from the study, or until the sponsor decides to terminate the 
study (see Section 3.3.6  for End of Study).  
At the end of study, any patient assigned to tislelizumab who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
may continue to benefit from tislelizumab at study termination, will be offered the option to 
continue  treatment in a company -sponsored clinical trial until tislelizumab is commercially 
available in the country of the patient’s residence.

The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting t he criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  
8.1. Risks Associated With Study Drugs  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the 
criteria and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in  this protocol.  
8.1.1.  Risks Associated With Tislelizumab  
Tislelizumab is an investigational agent that is currently in clinical development. Limited safety 
data are available in patients and the full safety profile has not been characterized. The following 
recom mendation is based on results from nonclinical and clinical studies with tislelizumab and 
published data on other molecules within the same biologic class.  
The PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_658061] is involved in peripheral immune tolerance; therefore, such therapy 
may incre ase the risk of irAEs, specifically the induction or enhancement of autoimmune 
conditions. Immune -related AEs commonly associated with anti -PD-[ADDRESS_658062] been mild and self -limiting, 
such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major 
complications. Suggested workup procedures for suspected irAEs are provided in Appendix  10. 
8.1.2.  Risks Associated with Chemotherapy (Paclitaxel/Docetaxel/Irinotecan)  
Most common adverse reactions across all paclitaxel indications are neutropenia, leukopenia, 
alopecia, anemia, arthralgia/myalgia, peripheral neuro pathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
mucositis, infections, alkaline phosphatase elevations, aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations, 
hypotension, infusion site reaction, or bleeding. Most frequent Grade [ADDRESS_658063] occurred in 2% to 4% of patients 
recei ving paclitaxel in clinical studies. Fatal reactions have occurred in patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_315230]. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel should not 
be rechallenged with the drug.  
Most  common adverse reactions across all  docetaxel indications are infections, neutropenia, 
anemia, febrile neutropenia, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, dysgeusia, 
dyspnea, constipation, anorexia, nail disorders, fluid retention, asthenia, pain, nausea, diarrhea, 
vomiting, mucosi tis, alopecia, skin reactions and myalgia . Most frequent grade [ADDRESS_658064]  abnormal liver function . Severe hypersensitivi ty, 
including very rare fatal anaphylaxis, has also been reported in patients despi[INVESTIGATOR_508950].   
Common adverse reactions of irinotecan observed  in single -agent therapy clinical studies are: 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, di arrhea, constipation, anorexia, neutropenia, leukopenia 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 (including lymphocytopenia), anemia, asthenia, fever, body weig ht decreasing, and alopecia. 
Most frequent Grade 3 or 4 adverse events are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, 
neutropenia, abdominal  pain and asthenia. Early and late forms of diarrhea can occur. Early 
diarrhea may be accompanied by [CONTACT_509023][INVESTIGATOR_050]. Late diarrhea can be life threatening and should be treated promptly with 
loperamid e. Monitor patients with diarrhea and give fluid and electrolytes as needed. If patients 
develop ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia, they should receive antibiotic therapy, per institution -
specific guidelines. If severe diarrhea and myelosuppression occur , irinotecan should be 
interrupted and either discontinued or dose reduced for subsequent cycles to subsequent doses.  
Patients should be tested locally for the UGT1A1*28 allele to determine if modifications to the 
starting dose are needed as outlined in th e prescribing information or according to local 
guidelines.  
Selected precautions:  
 Neutropenia: Fever or other evidence of infection must be assessed promptly and 
treated aggressively following the local clinical practice and/or the guidelines.  
 Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and irinotecan therapy should not be given to patients with 
solid tumor who have baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1,500  cells/mm3. To 
monitor the occurrence of bone marrow suppression, primary neutropenia, which 
may be severe and result in  infection, it is recommended that frequent peripheral 
blood cell counts be performed on all patients receiving paclitaxel, docetaxel, and 
irinotecan.  
 Anaphylaxis reactions: Anaphylaxis reactions and severe hypersensitivity reactions 
have occurred in 2% t o 4% of subjects treated with paclitaxel. Fatal reactions have 
occurred in subjects despi[INVESTIGATOR_250896]. All subjects should be pretreated with 
corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists. Subjects who experience 
severe hypersensitivity reaction s should not be rechallenged.  
 Diarrhea: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan) is 
usually transient and infrequently severe. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more 
than 24  hours after administration of irinotecan) can be  life threatening since it may 
be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Monitor 
patients with diarrhea and give fluid and electrolytes as needed. Early diarrhea may 
be accompanied by [CONTACT_509024][INVESTIGATOR_050]. Late diarrhea can be life threatening and should be treated promptly with 
loperamide. Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea.  
For toxicities not listed above, dose modifications are permitted per local stan dards.  
8.1.3.  General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients enrolled to in this study. Results 
from the nonclinical toxicology studies and clinical data with tislelizumab, as well as the 
nonclinical/clinical data from other PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_658065] one of the 
chemotherapy drugs in ICC treatment arm.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Monitoring Plan  
Safety will be evaluated in this study through reporti ng and monitoring of all AEs, defined and 
graded according to NCI -CTCAE v4.03. Patients will be assessed for safety (including 
laboratory values) according to the schedule in Appendix  1. Clinical laboratory results must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_509025]. Patients 
receiving irinotecan will be monitored for diarrhea and giv en fluids and electrolytes at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
In this study, all enrolled patients will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests 
before and at regular intervals during their participation in this study. General safety asses sments 
will include review of medical history, physical examinations, ophthalmologic examinations, and 
specific laboratory studies, including but not limited to serum chemistry and blood counts (see 
Appendix  1 for the Schedule of Assessments). In addition, patients will be closely monitored for 
the development of any signs or symptoms of autoimmune conditions and infection.  
Serum samples will be drawn f or determination of ADAs to tislelizumab in patients randomized 
to the tislelizumab arm, if treatment assignment is known. Administration of tislelizumab will be 
performed in a setting where emergency medical equipment and staff who are trained to respond 
to medical emergencies are available (see Section  5.1.4 ). 
All AEs will be recorded during the study (AE from the time of the first dose and SAEs fr om the 
time of signing of informed consent) and for up to [ADDRESS_658066] dose of study drug(s) 
(including paclitaxel, docetaxel and irinotecan) or until the initiation of another anticancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first. At the end of treatment, ongoing AEs considered related to study 
treatment will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline or ≤  Grade  1, the event is 
assessed by [CONTACT_226876], the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws 
consent, or it has been d etermined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the 
AE. 
Immune -related AEs will be recorded up to [ADDRESS_658067].  
Investigators are instructed to report a ll AEs (including pregnancy -related AEs).  
The potential safet y issues anticipated in this study, as well as measures intended to avoid or 
minimize such toxicities, are outlined in the following sections.  
During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or 
symptoms of autoimmune c onditions and infection. Patients will receive standard of care 
medications for any adverse event according to the judgement of the investigator.  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 Reporting requirements for SAEs are discussed in Section  8.4.2 . In addition, the medical monitor 
or Safety Physician will review and evaluate observed AEs on a regular basis.  
Patients who discontinue treatment for any reason will be asked to return to th e clinic for a 
Safety Follow -up Visit within 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study treatment or before 
the initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  
8.2. Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Definition and Reporting Guidelines  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
result), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of AEs include:  
 Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in 
severity, frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse 
outcome  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it 
may ha ve been present before the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug 
or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should no t be reported as an AE or SAE)  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory results, and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the AE or SAE. The investigator will th en record all relevant information regarding an AE or 
SAE in the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_69780]. In this instance, all patient identifiers will be redacted on the 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] o f the medical records prior to submission to the sponsor.  
8.2.2.  Assessing Severity  
The investigator will assess the severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study. All AEs 
and SAEs are to be assessed and graded based upon NCI -CTCAE v4.03.  
Toxicities that  are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; lim iting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
 Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72  Grade 4 : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5 : Death related to AE  
NOTE : The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a measure 
of intensity (for example, grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grad e 2], 
severe [Grade 3], or life -threatening [Grade 4]), whereas seriousness is classified by 
[CONTACT_184760]. Seriousness serves as the guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations from the sponsor to applicable regu latory 
authorities as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
8.2.3.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in death.  
 Is life -threatening  
NOTE : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in 
which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does n ot refer to an AE, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12331] : In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69783] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting.  
 Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE : The term disability means a substanti al disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental tra uma (eg, sprained ankle), which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is considered a significant medical AE by [CONTACT_509026] ( eg, may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above)  
The following are NOT  considered SAEs:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
from base line 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations  
 Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for 
transfusion support or convenience  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658068] clinical judgment. Alternative causes, such as natural history of 
the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of 
the AE or SAE to the stu dy drug should be considered and investigated. The investigator should 
consult the tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure  in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and th e investigator has only limited 
information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses causality for every SAE prior to transmission of the SAE report to 
the sponsor, since the causa lity assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may subsequently change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_508951] -up information and may amend the SAE report accordingly.  
The causality  of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_1694] “related” or 
“not related” based on all information available at the time of reporting. An AE is considered 
related if there is “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may have been caused  by [CONTACT_5257] 
(ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causation). A number of factors 
should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study 
procedure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered “related” to study drug if any of the following criteria are met, 
otherwise the event should be assess ed as not related:  
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is 
unlikely  
 There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, the influence of 
other factors may have contributed to the AE (eg, the patient’s clinical condition or 
other concomitant AEs)  
8.2.5.  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, clinical chemistry, CBC, coagulation, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (eg, ECGs or vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_509027] t will be recorded as AEs or SAEs. This includes clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen during the study. The definition of clinically significant is left to t he judgement of the 

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658069] abnormalities assessments or other abnormal 
assessments that:  
 are associated with clinical signs or symptoms, or  
 require active medical intervention, or  
 lead to dose interruption  or discontinuation, or  
 require close observation, more frequent follow -up assessments, or  
 further diagnostic investigation.   
8.2.6.  Follow up of Adverse Events  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information to the sponsor on the condition of the patient.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_69846]/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolu tion, the condition stabilizes or is considered 
chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up or the patient 
withdraws consent. Once resolved, the appropriate AE or SAE will be updated. The investigator 
will ensure that fo llow-up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, radiographic imaging, or consult ation 
with other health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE. The  investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient dies during participation in the 
study or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
post-mortem findings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information wi ll be recorded on the originally completed SAE report, with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The updated SAE report should be re -sent to the 
sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
8.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is a serious adverse reaction that is 
both unexpected (ie, not present in the produc t’s Reference Safety Information [RSI]) and meets 
the definition of a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR), the specificity or severity of which is 
not consistent with those noted in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
8.4. Timing, Frequency, and Method of Capturing A dverse Events  
8.4.1.  Reporting All Adverse Events  
After informed consent has been signed but prior to the administration of the study drug, only 
SAEs should be reported.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658070] dose of study treatment (including paclitaxel, docetaxel 
and irinotecan) or initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Immune -related 
AEs (serious or non -serious) should be reported for [ADDRESS_658071] dose of tislelizumab 
regardless of initiation of a subsequent anticancer therapy. After this period, the investigator 
should report any SAEs that are believed to be related to tislelizumab treatment.  
8.4.2.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
As soon as the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, the 
event must be reported promptly to the sponsor or designee as described in Table 4. 
Table 4: Timeframes and Documentation Methods for Reporting Serious Adverse

Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; SAE, serious adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Completion and Transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report  
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a patient, he/she is to report the 
information to the sponsor within 24  hours as outli ned above in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . The SAE report 
will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all available details of the SAE and 
forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the designated time frames.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she is not to wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor or designee of the SAE and 
completing th e form. The form will be updated when additional information is received.  
The investigator must always provide an assessment of causality for each SAE as described in 
Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_658072] contacts for SAE receipt.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures 
detailed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . The sponsor has a lega l responsibility to notify , as appropriate, both 
the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_509028].    Timeframe for

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 76 The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requir ements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the IRB/IEC.  
All S[LOCATION_003]Rs (as defined in Section  8.3), will be submitted to all applicable regulatory authorities 
and investigators for tislelizumab studies.  
This protocol is being filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol amendment with 
the US FDA. All IND safety reports submitted to the FDA will also be sent to all inve stigators 
conducting studies under this IND.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up report or other safety information (eg, 
revised IB) from the sponsor, the responsible person according to local requirements is required 
to promptly notify hi s/her IRB or IEC. The investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_508952].  
8.4.3.  Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The investigator or designee will ask about AEs by [CONTACT_509029]:  
 “How are you feeling?”  
 “Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?”  
 “Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?”  
8.4.4.  Recordin g Disease Progression  
Disease progression (including fatal disease progression), which is expected in this study 
population and measured as an efficacy endpoint, should not be reported as an AE term. Instead 
the symptoms, signs or clinical sequelae that r esult from disease progression should be reported 
as the AE term(s).  
For instance, a patient presents with pleural effusion resulting from disease progression of 
metastasis to lungs. The event term should be reported as “pleural effusion” instead of diseas e 
progression. If a patient experienced a fatal multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the term 
“multi -organ failure” should be reported as the SAE with death as outcome instead of reporting 
“fatal disease progression” or “death due to disease pro gression.” . 
8.4.5.  Recording Deaths  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an event . If the only information available is 
death and the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an event, eg, “death,” 
“death of unknown cause,” or “unexplained death”.  
8.4.6.  Recording Pregnancies  
If a female patient or the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant while receiving 
investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_658074] dose of paclit axel/docetaxel/irinotecan , a pregnancy report form is required to be 
completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate outcome follow -up.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 77 Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, 
follow -up will be no longer than 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a preg nancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be always reported as an 
SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the 
study drug should be recorded and reported as an SAE.  
8.4.7.  Recording Post -Study Adverse Events  
A post -study AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting 
period that is defined in Section  8.4.1 . 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former patients. However, if the 
investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been dis charged 
from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the investigator will 
notify the sponsor.  
8.4.8.  Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Investigators, Institutional Review 
Boards, and Independent Ethics Committees  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs against cumulative study drug experience to identify 
and expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, investigators, 
IRBs, and IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requi rements for individual SAEs, the sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the following reference documents:  
 Tislelizumab Investigator’s Brochure  
 Local prescribing information for paclitaxel  
 Local prescribi ng information for docetaxel  
 Local prescribing information for irinotecan  
8.5. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
Regular s afety monitoring (at least every 6 months) and efficacy monitoring will be performed 
by [CONTACT_223233] ( IDMC). The first IDMC safety review will 
occur after at least [ADDRESS_658075] been randomized to study treatment (ie, approximately 
25 patients  per treatment arm) and have been on treatment for at least one treatment cycle. The 
IDMC may recommend modificat ions to the study procedures or conduct based on available 
data. The function and membership of the IDMC will be described in the IDMC Charter.  
In addition to the planned IDMC review(s), ad hoc reviews may take place based on new 
information.  
Following ID MC review and discussion, the sponsor will make all final decisions regarding any 
change in study conduct. Please see the details in the IDMC Charter.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 8.6. Dose Delays or Modifications  
Every effort should be made to administer the study drug(s) according to the planned dose and 
schedule every 3 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1. In the event of significant toxicities, dosing may be 
delayed and/or reduced based on the guidelines provided below. Reasons for dose modifications 
or delays, the supportive measures taken, an d the outcome will be documented in the patient 
chart and recorded in the eCRF.  
8.6.1.  Dose Delay or Modification for Tislelizumab  
There will be no dose reduction of tislelizumab in this study. Dose delays or interruption of 
< 12 weeks will be permitted. The inve stigators should make every effort to maintain dose 
intensity in patients.  
Patients may temporarily suspend study treatment if they experience toxicity that is considered 
related to tislelizumab and requires that a dose be withheld. If the administration delay is 
≤ 10 days, the delayed dose will be administered. If the delay is >  10 days, the delayed dose will 
be omitted in this cycle. As long as the AE resolves within 14  days, the next cycle will be 
administered as planned If the delay of tislelizumab is > [ADDRESS_658076] feasible date (refer to the visit window in 
Appendix  1), with subsequent  dosing continued on the [ADDRESS_658077] be discontinued. Once the dose has been decrea sed, it should 
remain reduced for all subsequent administrations or further reduced if necessary. There will be 
no dose escalations in this study. Chemotherapy treatment may be delayed up to 21 days, if the 
reason for the delay is toxicity/adverse event. A ll subsequent chemotherapy doses must be 
rescheduled according to the last chemotherapy dose administration date. If any chemotherapy 
agent is held for more than 6 weeks from the anticipated treatment date, or the dose level -2 is 
not tolerated, chemothera py should be permanently discontinued.

 Any drug -related AE which recurs after 2 prior dose reductions for the s ame drug -
related AE requires discontinuation of the drug(s)  
 Any Grade 3 or 4 drug -related hypersensitivity reaction or infusion reaction requires 
discontinuation of the drug(s) felt to be causing the reaction. The drug not considered  
to be related to the h ypersensitivity reaction or infusion reaction may be continued  
 Any Grade 4 AE which the investigator considers related to study drug and 
inappropriate to be managed by [CONTACT_29874](s) requires discontinuation of drug(s). 
The drug not considered to be rel ated to the event may be continued  
 If any toxicity does not resolve within 42 days, the targeted treatment will be 
discontinued unless the treating physicians determines that the patient is clinically 
stable, the toxicity has stabilized, and the benefit of  continuing the treatment 
compared to the risk of the toxicity is favorable  
 For any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness not listed above, 
the investigator should use their medical judgment to determine whether any 
individual che motherapy agents should be discontinued, in accordance with subject’s 
well-being and local standards  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658092], a minimum of a 30 -minute monitoring period is 
required in an area with resuscitation equipment and emergency agents.  
The management for infusio n-related reactions, severe hypersensitivity reactions and irAEs 
according to the NCI -CTCAE criteria are outlined below.   
8.8.1.  Assessing and Recording Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Since treatment with anti -PD-1 therapy can cause autoimmune disorders, AEs considered by [CONTACT_397798] -related should be classified as irAEs and identified as such in the 
eCRF AE page, until day 90, after treatment discontinuation.  
If the events listed below ( Table  5) or similar events occur, appropriate diagnostic tests, which 
may include but is not limited to serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, should be 
ordered to exclude alternative causes suc h as infection, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or 
other neoplastic causes, and other drugs. If alternative explanations have been excluded, the AE 
required the use of systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy and is 
consisten t with an immune mediated mechanism of action, the irAE field in the eCRF should be 
checked. The purpose of this action is to assess the cumulative incidence and severity of irAEs in 
the study and to detect any correlation with efficacy. Any serious irAEs should be reported 
according to the seriousness criteria above in Section  8.4.2 . For the investigator’s guidance, a list 
of potential irAEs appears  below in Table  5. All conditions similar to those listed should be 
evaluated to determine whether they are irAEs, based on a similar diagnostic process to those 
reactions that are presented in more detail in Appendix  10.  
Recommendation for diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs is based on a recent 
ESMO guideline ( Haanen JBAG, 2017 ) and common immune -related toxicities are  detailed in 
Appendix  10. For any adverse events not included in Appendix  10, please refer to the recent 
ESMO guideline ( Haanen JBAG, 2017 ) for further guidance on diagnostic evaluation and 
management of immune -related toxicities.

Dose modification and management for irAEs are detailed in  Appendix  10. 
If a toxicity does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 12 weeks, study drug(s) should be discontinued 
after consultation with the sponsor. Patients who experience a recurrence of any event at the 
same or higher severity grade with rechallenge  should permanently discontinue treatment.  
8.8.2.  Managing Immune -Related Adverse Events  
Immune -related adverse events may develop during the course of the study, including following 
last dose of tislelizumab. Corticosteroids are usually prescribed at medium to h igh doses 
(0.5 to 1 mg/kg of prednisone) and should be continued until symptoms resolve, become mild, or 
return to baseline levels, whereupon the doses given can be tapered over at least 1  month 
(Boutros C, 2016 ; Champi[INVESTIGATOR_136] S, 2016 ). See Appendix  10 for irAE evaluation and management.  
8.8.3.  Managing Infusion -Related Reactions due to Tislel izumab  
The symptoms of infusion -related reactions include fever, chills/rigor, nausea, pruritus, 
angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness 
or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial 
infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic shock. Patients should be closely monitored 
for such reactions. Immediate access to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or equivalent environment 
and appropriate medical therapy ( including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, IV antihistamines, 
bronchodilators, and oxygen) must be available to treat infusion -related reactions.

 Immediate access to resuscitation equipment (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, 
IV antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen) must be available to treat infusion -
related reactions  
 Patients should be instructed to seek emergency care if they experience 
lightheadedness, shortness of breath, wheezing, or swelling after they have left the 
treatment center  
Once the tislelizumab  infusion rate has been decreased by 50% or suspended due to an 
infusion -related reaction, it must remain decreased for all subsequent infusions with 
premedication. If the patient has a second infusion -related reaction ( ≥ Grade 2) on the  slower 
infusion rate, infusion should be discontinued and the patient should be withdrawn from 
tislelizumab t reatment.

monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of an infusion reaction.  
CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction:  Proper medical management should be instituted 
immediately, as indicated per type and severit y of the reaction. This includes but is not limited to 
oral or IV antihistamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, and oxygen.  
8.8.5.  Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu -Like Symptoms  
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the patie nt must be treated according to the best available 
medical practice as described in the complete guideline for emergency treatment of anaphylactic 
reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council ([LOCATION_006]) ( Soar et al 2008 ). 
Patients should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to the investigator immediately.  
In the event of a systemic anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction (typi[INVESTIGATOR_397690]/antigen,  and characterized by: [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506]; 
laryngeal edema; and/or intense bronchospasm; and often followed by [CONTACT_509030][INVESTIGATOR_60319]; cutaneous manifestations such as pruritus and urticaria 
with/without edem a; and gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, crampy 
abdominal pain, and diarrhea), the infusion must be immediately stopped and the patient 
discontinued from the study.  
The patients will be administered epi[INVESTIGATOR_508955].  
For prophylaxis of flu -like symptoms, a dose of 25 mg indomethacin or a compara ble dose of 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (eg, 600 mg ibuprofen, 500 mg naproxen sodium) may be 
administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of study drugs(s) infusion. 
Alternative treatments for fever (eg, paracetamol) may b e given to patients at the discretion of 
the investigator.  
8.8.6.  Renal Function Abnormalities  
Patients with moderate renal dysfunction (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
≥ 30 mL/min/1.73  m2 and < 60  mL/min/1.73  m2 by [CONTACT_10657][INVESTIGATOR_508956]) may be enrolled into the study. The following algorithm is proposed for 
the use of steroid treatment in the management of irAEs:  
 If the serum creatinine is normal at baseline, please see Section  8.8.1  and refer to 
Appendix  10 for diagnosis and management of patients with abnormal renal 
laboratory values.  
 If the serum creatinine is Grade 1 at baseline and increase in serum creatinine meets 
criteria for serum creatinine increase ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_658093] 50% 
from the baseline value OR the eGFR falls below 20 mL/min.  
  If the serum creatinine is Grade 2 at baseline and increase in serum creatinine meets 
criteria for serum creatinine increase ≥ Grade 3 after starting treatment with 
tislel izumab, refer to Appendix  10 for diagnosis and management of patients with 
abnormal renal laboratory values. In the setting of a Grade 3 serum creat inine 
increase only, study treatment will be held until serum creatinine improves to baseline 
and treatment may resume only after discussion with the medical monitor.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 90 9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
The statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_509031]. 
Data will be listed and summarized per sponsor agreed report ing standards, where applicable. 
Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.1. Analysis Sets  
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized patients. It will be the primary 
analysis set f or the efficacy analysis.  
Safety analysis set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. It will 
be the primary analysis set for safety analysis.  
Per-Protocol (PP) analysis set includes patients who have received ≥ [ADDRESS_658094] efficacy evaluation. Major protocol deviations 
will be determined and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis  
The PD -L1 positive  analysis set includes patients whose tu mor and immune cell score (TIC 
score) met the pre -defined cut -off (specified in the statistical analysis plan) using VENTANA 
PD‑L1 (SP263) CDx Assay. TIC score is the total percentage of the tumor area covered by [CONTACT_509032] -L1 membrane staining an d tumor‑associated immune cells with PD -L1 staining at 
any intensity.  
The PK analysis set includes all patients who received at least [ADDRESS_658095]-baseline ADA result.  
9.2. Patient Disposition  
The number of patients randomized, treated, discontinued from study drug and/or study and 
those with major protocol deviations will be counted and summ arized. The primary reason for 
study drug and/or study discontinuation will be summarized according to the categories in the 
eCRF. The end of study status (alive, dead, withdrew consent or lost to follow -up) at the data 
cutoff date will be summarized using  the data from the eCRF.  
Major protocol deviations will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_338546].  
9.3. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarized in the ITT analysis set and 
the PD-L1 posit ive analysis set  using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables include age, 
weight, vital signs, time since initial cancer diagnosis, and time since advanced/metastatic 
disease diagnosis; categorical variables include, gender, ECOG status, geographica l region of 
enrollment, country, race, age (<45 years old, ≥45 to ≤65 years old and >65 years old), TNM 
Classification of Malignant Tumors staging (smoking status [never, previous and current],

locations of metastases, and number of metastatic lesions (≤ 1 site vs ≥ 2 sites).  
9.4. Prior and Concomitant Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_508957] 11 -digit code using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary drug codes. Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code indicating therapeutic classification. Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_397800] (CSR) for this protocol. Prior medications will be defined as medications that 
stopped before the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medications will  be defined as 
medications that (1) started before the first dose of study drug and were continuing at the time of 
the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on or after the date of the first dose of study drug up to 
30 days after the patient’s last dose  (Safety Follow -up visit). In addition, telephone contacts with 
patients should be conducted to assess irAEs and concomitant medications (if appropriate, ie, 
associated with an irAE or is a new anticancer therapy) at 60 and 90  days (±  14 days) after the 
last dose of study drugs regardless of whether or not the patient starts a new anticancer therapy. 
A listing of prior and concomitant medications will be included in the CSR for this study.  
9.5. Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint of OS in the ITT analysis set  will be tested once at a one -sided alpha of 
0.025. If the null hypothesis for OS in the ITT analysis set is rejected, the key secondary 
endpoint will be tested sequentially for OS in the PD -L1 positive analysis set. The inferential test 
for OS in the PD -L1 positive analysis set will be stopped at the non -significant endpoint of OS in 
the ITT analysis set. The familywise type I error will be strongly controlled at one -sided level 
0.025. More details will be given in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.5.1.  Primary Ef ficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is OS in the ITT analysis set as defined in the primary endpoint 
section. In the absence of death, patients will be censored either at the date that the patient was 
last known to be alive or the date of data cut-off, whichever comes earlier.  
OS will be compared between tislelizumab and ICC arms in a stratified log -rank test using a  
significance level of one -sided 0.025.  
The null hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0: OS in tislelizumab = OS in ICC against the alternati ve: 
H1: OS in tislelizumab ≠ OS in ICC  
This will be the primary analysis once the targeted event number of approximately [ADDRESS_658096] will be calculated, stratified by [CONTACT_508999] (0 vs 1) and ICC option (paclitaxel vs 
docetaxel vs irinotecan). Sample size calculation is included in Section 9.9. 
The median OS and the cumulative probability of OS at every 3 months, if estimable, will be 
calculated for each treatment arm and presented with two -sided 95% CIs. Kaplan -Meier survival 
probabilities for each arm will be plotted over time.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658097] ratio 
(HR) of OS will be estimated and presented with a two -sided 95% CI.  
These analyses will be performed in the ITT analysis set as the prim ary analysis. Outcomes in 
the Per Protocol analysis set will be evaluated as a sensitivity analysis.  
9.5.2.  Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint -OS in PD -L1 positive analysis set:  
The OS in the PD -L1 positive  analysis set will be analyzed similarly as described in the primary  
analysis for OS in the ITT  analysis set. 
Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for selected stratification factors (ECOG and 
ICC option) in the ITT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis set will be provided for ORR 
per RECIST v1.1. The two-sided 95% CIs for the odds ratio in ORR will be cal culated, as well 
as Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs of ORR for each treatment arm.  
PFS based on assessment by [CONTACT_440277] v1.1 will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier (KM) method in the ITT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis set. PFS 
censori ng rule will follow [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 
for Industry, Clinical Trial Endpoints for Approval of Cancer drugs and Biologics ( 2007 ). Data 
for patients without disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the 
time of the last tumor assessment. Data for patients who are lost to follow -up prior to 
documented disease progression will be censored at the last tumor assessment date when the 
patient is known to be progression -free. Data for patients who start to receive new anti -cancer 
therapy will be censored at the last tumor assessment date prior to the introduction of new 
therapy.  
A log -rank test stratified by [CONTACT_509000] (ECOG and ICC optio n) will be used to 
test the PFS differences between two treatment arms. The stratified Cox regression will be used 
to estimate the hazard ratio of PFS. A 95% confidence interval (CI) of HR in PFS will be 
constructed. Median PFS and PFS every 3 months for e ach treatment arm, if estimable, will be 
presented.  
Duration of response based on assessment by [CONTACT_509001].  
EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -OES18 will be summarized using functional 
scale/symptom scale/sing le item. Observed values and changes from baseline for functional 
scale/symptom scale/single item will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Time to 
clinically meaningful worsening in HRQoL domains will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier 
method. Log -rank test will be employed for testing treatment difference.  
EQ-5D-5L will be compared between tislelizumab and ICC arms. Descriptive statistics will be 
used to show the changes from baseline in each arm. These HRQoL assessment will be analyzed 
in both the I TT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis set.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658098] overall response (BOR) is defined as the best response per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_658099]-baseline 
response assessment (for any reason) will be considered non -responders for BOR. The 
proportion and its corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% CI for each of the response categories 
(CR, PR, SD and PD) will be presented by [CONTACT_2939].  
DCR will be analyzed similarly as ORR in the ITT analysis set and the PD -L1 positive analysis 
set. 
PD-L1 expression and, gene expression profiling , tumor mutation burden, MSI, and 
tumor -infiltrated immune cells  may be examined in the ITT analysis set. Efficacy analyses, 
including but not limited to OS, PFS, and ORR, may  be explored  according to biomarker status . 
Other potential predictive markers may also be assessed.  
Methodology for exploratory analyses  will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
9.6. Safety  Analyses  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_397753] -CTCAE 
v4.03. Laboratory values (eg, hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation and urinalysis), vital 
signs, ECGs, and physician examinations will also be evaluated  in defining the safety profile of 
each treatment arm. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze all safety data in the Safety 
analysis set.  
9.6.1.  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to each study drug will be summarized descriptively as the number of cy cles 
received (number and percentage of patients), duration of exposure (days), cumulative total dose 
received per patient (mg), dose intensity, and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of patients requiring dose reduction, interruption, dose d elay, and drug 
discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized for each study drug. Frequency of the above dose 
adjustments and discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_17203].  
Patient data listings will be provided for all dosing records and for calculated summary statistics.  
9.6.2.  Adverse Events  
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator’s description from the eCRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Adverse events will be coded to  MedDRA (Version 20.0 or higher) lower level term 
closest to the verbatim term. The linked MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred 
Term (PT) are also classified.  
In this protocol, a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that had  an 
onset date or a worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) on or after the first dose of 
study drug up to [ADDRESS_658100] dose of study drug regardless of whether or not the patient starts a new anticancer 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 94 therapy. Only those AEs that were treatment emergent will be included in summary tables. All 
AEs, treatment emergent or otherw ise, will be presented in patient data listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_3592]. A patient will be counted only once by [CONTACT_397806]-CTCAEv.4.03 within an SOC an d PT, even if the patient experienced more than 1 TEAE 
within a specific SOC and PT. The number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_53429].  
Serious adverse events, deaths, TEAE with grade 3 or above, irAE , related TEAE and TEAEs 
that led to treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, dose interruption or dose delay will be 
summarized.  
9.6.3.  Clinical Laboratory Analyses  
Clinical laboratory (eg, hematology, serum chemistry) values will be evaluated as appropriate. 
Abnormal laboratory values will be flagged and identified as those outside (above or below) the 
normal range. Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory parameters will be included in the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR) for this protocol. Descriptive summary sta tistics (eg, n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical 
variables) for laboratory parameters and their changes from baseline will be calculated. 
Laboratory values will be summarized by [CONTACT_509033].  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in NCI -CTCAEv.4.03 will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE grade. In the summary of laboratory parameters by [CONTACT_12134] -CTCAE grade, parameters 
with NCI -CTCAE grading in both high and low ranges (eg, glucos e, potassium, sodium) will be 
summarized separately.  
9.6.4.  Vital Signs  Analyses  
Descriptive statistics for vital sign parameters (eg, blood pressure, temperature) and changes 
from baseline will be summarized.  
9.6.5.  Ophthalmologic Examination  
Ophthalmologic examination results will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  
9.7. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected in this study as outlined in Appendix  1, and only from 
patients randomized to receive tislelizumab and in sites that are able to adequately perform 
sampling, handling and processing procedures outlined in the Laboratory Manual.  
Tislelizumab serum concentration data, including but not limited t o C trough, will be tabulated and 
summarized for each cycle at which pharmacokinetics are collected. Descriptive statistics will 
include means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations, as appropriate.  
Additional PK analyses such as population PK analysis and exposure -response (efficacy or 
safety endpoints) analysis may be conducted as appropriated and the results of such additional 
analysis may be reported separately from the CSR.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658101] of immunogenicity on PK, 
efficacy and safety may be evaluated if data allow.  
9.9. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size calculation is based on the primary efficacy analysis of OS comparison between 
tislelizumab and ICC arms in the ITT analysis set. Assuming an OS -HR (Arm Tislelizumab/Arm 
ICC) of 0.75 and a dropout rate o f 5% per year, approximately 500 patients will be enrolled and 
randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_658102] 
patien t is enrolled when median OS in the tislelizumab and ICC arms are 8  months and 
6 months, respectively. Assuming OS -HR is 0.75, based on recently published results of anti -
PD-1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_508931] ( Kojima et a l 2019 ; Kato et al 2019 ; Huang et 
al 2019 ), the study will have a power of 82% with a one -sided alpha of 0.025.  
9.10. Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658103] 
operating procedures (SOPs), working practice documents, and applicable regulations and 
guidelines. Site audits may be conducted periodically by [CONTACT_456]’s or contract research 
organization’s qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the 
study team responsible for conduct of the study.  
10.1. Data Collection  
Data required by [CONTACT_509034]. All study -related data collected or received by [CONTACT_509035]. In no event should the entry of the study 
data into the eCRF be later t han what is stipulated in the site contract after the data is collected or 
received by [CONTACT_509036].  
Data collection in the eCRF must follow the instructions described in the eCRF C ompletion 
Guidelines (eCCGs). The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting 
of all clinical data entered in the eCRF. The investigator or designee must sign the completed 
casebooks to attest to its accuracy, authenticity, an d completeness.  
Data contained in the eCRFs are the sole property of BeiGene and should not be made available 
in any form to third parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized 
representatives of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory a uthorities.  
10.2. Data Management/Coding  
All final patient data, both eCRF and external data (eg, laboratory data), collected according to 
the protocol, will be stored at the sponsor’s facility at the end of the study.  
Standard procedures (including following  data review guidelines, computerized validation to 
produce queries and maintenance of an audit file which includes all database modifications) will 
be followed to support accurate data collection. Data will be reviewed for outliers, logic, data 
inconsiste ncies and completeness.  
During the course of the study, a study monitor (ie, clinical research associate) will make site 
visits to review protocol compliance, compare eCRFs against individual patient’s medical 
records and ensure that the study is being con ducted according to pertinent regulatory 
requirements.  
eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained. Checking the eCRFs 
for complet eness, clarity and cross checking with source documents is required to monitor the 
progress of the study. Direct access to source data is also required for inspections and audits, and 
will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medi cal confidentiality.  
Adverse events and concomitant diseases/medical history will be coded using MedDRA version 
20.[ADDRESS_658104] a regulatory inspection 
of this study. Such audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after com pletion of the 
study. If an audit or inspection occurs, the investigator and institution agree to allow the 
auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time 
of his/her personnel to the auditor/inspector to  discuss findings and any relevant issues.  
10.4. Data Integrity Protection Plan and In -house Blinding  
Due to the open -label design of the study, access to the unblinded patient level clinical data in 
the EDC system will only be assigned to predefined study perso nnel. Functions/persons with 
access to the EDC system shall be prohibited from using the EDC system to generate 
unnecessary listings/summaries that may introduce unwanted bias, or share such outputs or the 
unblinded data from the EDC system with other func tions/persons who do not have access to the 
EDC. Although the study is open label, analyses or summaries generated by [CONTACT_509037]. More details 
will be described in a Data Int egrity Protection Plan (DIPP).  
10.5. Study Records Retention  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should 
be classifi ed into at least the following 2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2) patient 
clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspo ndence, informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameter s independent of the CRFs) would include (although not be limited to) 
the following: patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, 
original laboratory reports, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, radio imaging, path ology 
and special assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and t imely retrieval, when needed 
(eg, audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel. Where permitted 
by [CONTACT_1207]/regulations or instituti onal policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in 
a format other than hard copy (eg, microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must assure that all reproductions are 
legible, are a true and accurate copy of the original, and meet accessibility and retrieval 
standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the investigator must 
ensure there is an acceptable back up of these reproductions and tha t an acceptable quality 
control process exists for making these reproductions.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658105] applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_69882], or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the 
retention period will default to [ADDRESS_658106] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, 
but not limited to, the following: archival at an off -site facility, transfer of ownership of the 
records in the event the investigator leaves the study center.  
If the i nvestigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be re turned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786].  
Biological samples at the conclusion of this study  may be retained as outlined in the agreement 
with the CRO managing the biological samples, for the shorter of: a period of up to 10 years or 
as allowed by [CONTACT_5282]/IEC.  
10.6. Publication and Data Sharing Policy  
A clinical study report will be prepared and provi ded to the regulatory agency(ies). BeiGene will 
ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the International Council for Harmonization 
(ICH) Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an 
abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases.  
The results of this study will be published or presented at scientific meetings in a timely, 
objective, and clinically meaningful manner that is consistent with good science, industry and 
regulator guidance, and the need t o protect the intellectual property of BeiGene (sponsor),

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in 
accordance with health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by 
[CONTACT_11577]/IEC and a rchived in the site’s study file.  
11.4. Confidentiality  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_508960], storage, transmission, and 
processing of patien ts’ personal and medical information. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_508961] a unique patient identification number. This approach ensures that patients’ names 
are not included in any data set transmitted to any sponsor location.  
Patient medical information obtained by [CONTACT_509042] (or a separate authorization for the use and disclosure 
of personal health information that has been signed by [CONTACT_102]), unless permitted or required 
by [CONTACT_2371]. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality of a patient’s personal and medical 
information, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_38107], as  appropriate, shall fulfill all remediation 
steps and reporting obligations under applicable data privacy laws.  
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate medical 
personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare,  for treatment purposes.  
Data generated by [CONTACT_158529], China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), and all other national and local health 
authorities; by [CONTACT_338557], represe ntatives, and collaborators; and by [CONTACT_1026]/IECs for 
each study site, as appropriate.  
The investigator must assure that patients’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. The investigator ag rees that all information 
received from sponsor, including but not limited to the Investigator’s Brochure, this protocol, 
CRFs, the IND, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of 
sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to 
any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as 
required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from sponsor. The investigator further agrees to 
take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_509043].  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study is executed, and that contract includes 
confidentiality p rovisions inconsistent with this section, that contract’s provisions shall apply to 
the extent they are inconsistent with this section.  
11.5. Financial Disclosure  
The investigator will provide the sponsor with sufficient and accurate financial information, in 
accordance, with local regulations to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial

responsible for providing information about their financial in terests during the course of the 
study and for 1 year after completion of the study (ie, last patient, last visit).  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658108] of the 
study may be fully documented. Such records include, but are not limited to, the protocol, 
protocol amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/IEC and governmental approvals. In 
addition, at the end of the study, the investigator  will receive patient data, which will include an 
audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to such data.  
12.1.1.  Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the study monitor must have direct access to the 
investigat or’s source documentation to verify the data recorded in the CRFs for consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, an d accuracy of the 
data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to 
verify the entries on the CRFs. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure 
that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
12.1.2.  Access to Information for Auditing or Inspections  
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of BeiGene may conduct inspections or audits any 
time during or after completion of this clinical study. If the investigator is n otified of an 
inspection by a regulatory authority the investigator agrees to notify the sponsor or its designee 
immediately. The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or 
BeiGene access to records, facilities, and personn el for the effective conduct of any inspection or 
audit.  
12.2. Case Report Forms  
For each patient randomized/assigned to treatment, an eCRF must be completed and signed by 
[CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_508962] a reasonable time period after data c ollection. 
If a patient withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted in the appropriate eCRF. If a 
patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should 
be made to clearly document the outcome.  
The eCRF exist s within an EDC system with controlled access managed by [CONTACT_338558]. Study staff will be appropriately trained in the use of 
eCRFs and applications of electronic signatures before being given access to the EDC s ystem. 
Original data and any changes of data will be recorded using the EDC system, with all changes 
tracked by [CONTACT_135953]. The investigator attests that the 
information contained in the eCRF is true by [CONTACT_1541] a n electronic signature [CONTACT_509070]. After final database lock, the investigator will receive a copy of the patient data from 
that site (eg, paper, CD, or other appropriate media) for archiving the data at the study site.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 104 12.3. Protocol Deviations  
The i nvestigator is to document and explain any deviations from the IRB/Ethics committee 
approved protocol. The investigator must promptly report any major deviations that might 
impact patient safety and/or data integrity to the sponsor and to the IRB/IEC, in a ccordance with 
established IRB/IEC policies and procedures, and shall report all protocol deviations to sponsor.  
12.4. Study Site Inspections  
Site visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_338560], 
patients’ medical records, and eCRFs. The investigator is to permit national and local health 
authorities; sponsor study monitors, representatives, and coll aborators; and IRB/IEC members to 
inspect all facilities and records relevant to this study.  
12.5. Protocol Amendments  
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by [CONTACT_456]. Protocol amendments will be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC and to regulatory authorities i n accordance with local regulatory 
requirements.  
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/IEC and regulatory authorities (as locally required) 
before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to patients or  changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (eg, change in 
medical monitor or contact [CONTACT_3031]).

day cycle unless otherwise noted. There is a 2 -day window for treatments given on a weekly schedule. Efficacy assessments will be performed 
approximately every 6  weeks for 6 months, then every 9 weeks regardless of the duration of a  chemotherapy cycle.  
3 The End -of-Treatment (EOT) Visit is conducted when the investigator determines that tislelizumab or ICC will no longer be used, at which  time all of 
the assessments listed for the EOT Visit will be performed. If routine laboratory test s (eg, hematology, serum chemistry) are completed within [ADDRESS_658115] assessment.   
4 The mandatory Safe ty Follow -Up Visit is required to be conducted 30 days (±  7 days) after the last dose of study therapy, or before initiation of a new 
anti-cancer treatment. At the end of treatment, ongoing AEs considered related to study treatment will be followed until t he event has resolved to 
baseline or ≤ Grade 1, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been 
determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE . The EOT Visit may be combined with the Safety Follow -up Visit, provided 
that the EOT occurred 30 days (± 7 days) after the last study treatment; the assessments for both visits should be performed.  
5 Survival follow -up information will be collected via tel ephone calls, email or other communication; patient medical records; and/or clinic visits 
approximately 1  month (4 weeks ±  7 days) after the Safety Follow -up Visit and approximately monthly thereafter until death, loss to follow -up, 
withdrawal of consent, or study termination by [CONTACT_3211]. All patients will also be followed for new anti -cancer therapy information unless the patient 
requests to be withdrawn from follow -up. 
[ADDRESS_658116] dose of tislelizumab regardless of initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. After this period, the investi gator should report any SAEs 
that are believed to be related to tislelizumab treatment ( Section  8.4.1 ). All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is 
considered chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained , the patient is lost to follow -up or the patient withdraws consent ( Section  8.2.6 ). 
9 A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of  the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -directed physical examinations 
are required t o be performed. Height will only be measured and recorded at Screening Visit. Investigators should solicit patients regarding  changes in 
vision, visual disturbance, or ocular inflammation at each scheduled study visit during tislelizumab treatment. For any  change in vision, referral to an 
appropriate specialist will be made for further management guidance.    
10 ECOG performance status are required to be obtained within 7 days prior to randomization.  
11 Vital signs to include temperature, pulse, blood pressure, a nd weight; pulse and BP should be recorded while the patient is in a seated position after 
resting for 10  minutes. For all infusions of tislelizumab , the patient’s vital signs should be recorded before the infusion, and between [ADDRESS_658117] be collected during the infusion if clinically indicated. For the subjects randomized to Paclitaxel, patients will be

should be resting and in a sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_658118] not be enrolled until further definite testing with HBV DNA titers < 500 IU/mL (or 2500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL).  
14 Local or central laboratory assessments on serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will  be conducted, of which certain elements will 
be collected as specified in Section  7.10. Laboratory tests are required to be obtained within 14 days of randomization. If laboratory tests are not 
performed within 7  days prior to the administration of study drug(s) on Cycle 1 Day 1, these tests should be repeated and reviewed before study drug(s) 
administration. Hematology and serum chemistry (inclu ding liver function tests) will be performed weekly for the first [ADDRESS_658119] 
creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase -cardiac muscle isoenzyme (CK -MB) testing at screening and at all scheduled visits during the  first 3 treatment 
cycles, all pre -dose assessments from Cycle 4 onwards, and at the EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits. In the event that CK -MB fractionation cannot be 
evaluated in the local laboratory, troponin I and/or troponin T should be assessed instead ; the same test should be administered throughout the study. 
Urinalysis and coagulation parameters are to be assessed during the treatment period only if clinically indicated. Refer to Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_658120] (for women of childbearing potential, including women who have had a tubal  ligation) must be performed and documented as 
negative within [ADDRESS_658121] will be performed at each visit prior to study 
treatment; a serum pregnancy test must be performed if the urine pregnancy test is positive or equivocal.  
16 Thyroid function tests will be performed within 7 days prior to randomization with analysis of free T3, free T4 and TSH. They  will be tested every 
3 cycles thereafter (eg, Cycles 4, 7 and 10, etc.) from random ization and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit in tislelizumab arm. Thyroid function 
testing performed during the study and at the Safety Follow -up Visit will only be for patients on the tislelizumab arm.  
17 Only for patients randomized to tislelizumab. Only in sites that can adequately perform sampling, handling and processing procedures outlined in the 
Laboratory Manual. Procedures for collection of tislelizumab PK samples are described in the Laboratory Manual. Predose (with in 60 min before start 
infus ion) samples are required to be collected at Day 1 of Cycle 1, 2, 5, 9 and 17; post -dose (within 30 minutes after completing tislelizumab infusion) 
samples are required to be collected at Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 5. An additional PK sample is required to be c ollected at the Safety Follow -Up Visit. If a 
patient present with any immune -related adverse event, additional blood PK samples may be taken to determine the plasma concentration of BGB - 
A317. These tests are required when it is allowed by [CONTACT_1295] s/IRBs/ECs.  
[ADDRESS_658122] for anti -tislelizumab antibodies should be collected within 60 minutes before beginning 
the Day 1 infusion of Cycles 1, 2, 5, 9, and 17 and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit . All samples should be drawn at the same time as blood 
collection for predose PK analysis. These tests are required when it is allowed by [CONTACT_427]/IRBs/ECs.  
[ADDRESS_658123]/MRI of the head at baseline is required for patients who are suspected to have central n ervous system (CNS) 
metastases. All measurable and evaluable lesions are required to be assessed and documented at the screening visit. The same radiographic procedure 
must be used throughout the study for each patient. Patients will undergo tumor assessments approximately every 6 weeks (± 7 days)  for 6 months, then 
every 9 wee ks (± 7 days)  from last assessment afterward s. Patients who discontinue from treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death 
will continue scheduled tumor assessments until the start of a new anti -cancer therapy, disease progression, death, l ost to follow -up, withdrawal of 
consent, or until the study completion, whichever occurs first. Investigators may perform additional scans or more frequent a ssessments if clinically 
indicated. If previous tumor imaging was obtained within [ADDRESS_658124] 4 weeks later or at the next regularly 
scheduled timepoint (not to exceed 6 weeks) before discontinuation of study treatment.  
20 The initial infusion of tislelizumab will be delive red over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second infusion and each subsequent infusion may be administered 
over [ADDRESS_658125] of care. The treatment window for paclitaxel given on a w eekly schedule is ± 2 days. The dosing 
frequency in this appendix will not be applicable for patients receiving weekly paclitaxel as a chemotherapy regimen, and the y should follow the dosing 
regimen described in Table  2 of Section  3.3.2  or Table 3 of Section  5.1.4 , or other local guidelines, as applicable.  
22 Representative tumor specimens i n paraffin blocks (preferred) or approximately [ADDRESS_658126] confirmed disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples to explore resistance 
mechanism. If feasible, any follow -up biopsy should be ideally taken from the same tumor le sion at baseline. Written patient consent is required for 
fresh tumor biopsies.   
23 Optional blood samples (approximately 10 mL each timepoint) will be taken at the time of first tumor response  (tumor assessment is CR/PR)  and/or 
confirmed disease progression for all randomized patients, to explore the association of blood -based biomarkers with response, resistance, and prognosis 
to tislelizumab or chemotherapy. Written patient consent is required for blood sample collections.  
24 All HRQoL assessments are to be pe rformed prior to study treatment initiation, Cycles 1 -6 Day 1 or at the EOT Visit (whichever occurs first), and at the 
Safety Follow -Up Visit.  A visit window of ±  7 days will apply to an HRQoL visit assessment. HRQoL instruments are to be given to the patient prior to 
being seen by a health care professional. NOTE: HRQoL assessments are to be conducted both at screening and C1D1 visit; if sc reening visit is <  [ADDRESS_658127] serious/severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_508965], to assist the determination of suitability for enrollment on the study. Uncertain cases should be discussed  with the medical monitor.  
[ADDRESS_658128], and optical coherence tomography (or equivalen t diagnostic test for retinal examination) captured as standard of 
care prior to obtaining written informed consent and within [ADDRESS_658129], and optical coherence tomo graphy (or equivalent diagnostic test) will be assessed at the Screening Visit. Patients on the tislelizumab arm 
will undergo repeated assessments approximately every 15 weeks (±  7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment < 30 days (± 7 days) af ter the 
last dose of study treatment. Investigators should solicit patients regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocula r inflammation at each 
scheduled study visit during tislelizumab treatment. For any change in vision, referral to an approp riate specialist will be made for further management 
guidance.  
[ADDRESS_658130] (or equivalent diagnostic test)

TUMORS (RECIST) GUID ELINES, VERSION 1.1  
The text below was obtained from the following reference:  
 Eisenhauer EA, Therasse P, Bogaerts J, Schwartz LH, Sargent D, Ford R, et al. New 
response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECIST guideline (Version 
1.1). Eur J Cancer. 2009; 45:228 -247. 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed 
by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee (Version 1.1). 
Changes in only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are 
used in the RECIST  criteria.  
 
NOTE : Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below. The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesio ns: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 [ADDRESS_658131] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the 
slice thickness and a minimum of 10  mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_12148] (when superficial).  
 [ADDRESS_658132] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_658133] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be ≤  5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including sm all lesions (longest diameter ≥  10 to <  15 mm 
with conventional techniques or <  [ADDRESS_658134] scan), are considered non -measurable 
disease. Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast 
disease, lymphangitic  involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly 
identified by [CONTACT_338571] -measurable.  
Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 116  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be eva luated by [CONTACT_233082].  
 Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that  meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be con sidered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesi ons situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols should detail the conditions 
under whi ch such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all 
involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥ [ADDRESS_658135] in which the image 
is obtained (for CT scan, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition 
may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, 
an abdominal node which is reported as being 20  mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20  mm and 
qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20  mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10  mm but < 15  mm) 
should be considered non -target lesion s. Nodes that have a short axis < 10  mm are considered 
non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as t he baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 117 sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the meas urable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesio ns should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, “mul tiple enlarged 
pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never 
more than 4  weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during fo llow-up. Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are accessible by [CONTACT_12148].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and P10  mm diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is 
suggested. As noted above, when lesions ca n be evaluated by [CONTACT_338573], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be 
reviewed at the end of the study.  
 Chest X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression  is 
an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in 
identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered 
measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
 CT, MRI: CT is the best curr ently available and reproducible method to measure 
lesions selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_658136] slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in 
certain situations (eg, for body scans).  
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in 
their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator 
dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be 
taken from one  assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_397838], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern 
about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 118  Endoscopy, lapar oscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in studies 
where recurrence following comple te response or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor 
response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in co mplete response. Because tumor 
markers are disease specific, instructions for their measurement should be 
incorporated into protocols on a disease specific basis. Specific guidelines for both 
CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and prostate -speci fic antigen (PSA) 
response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published. In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_658137] -line studie s in 
ovarian cancer.  
 Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and 
CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types 
such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can r emain). When 
effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (eg, with certain 
taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the 
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment ca n be 
considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease to 
differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of a ll target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to 
< 10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diam eters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20 %, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm. (NOTE: the appearance 
of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual 
short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the 
baseline examination),  even if the nodes regress to below 10  mm on study. This 
means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 119 may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph 
node is defined as having a short axi s of <  [ADDRESS_658138] achieve a short axis <10  mm. For 
PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in 
the sum of target lesions.  
 Target lesions that become “too small to measure”. While on study, all lesions (nodal 
and non -nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded 
at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2  mm). However, 
sometimes lesions or lymph no des which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an 
exact measure and may report them as being “too small to measure”.  
When this occurs, it is important that a value be  recorded on the eCRF. If it is the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0  mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (NOTE: It is 
less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a 
definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be pr esent and is faintly 
seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_658139] slice thickness 
(but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The me asurement of 
these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore providing this default value 
will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To 
reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, th at should 
be recorded, even if it is below 5  mm. 
 Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum. Similarly, as les ions coalesce, a plane between them may be 
maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer 
separable, the vector of the longest diameter in thi s instance should be the maximal 
longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation  of Non-target  Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
 CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. 
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10  mm short axis).  
 PD: Unequivocal progression (as detailed below) of existing non -target lesions. 
(NOTE: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.)  
 Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 120  When the patient also has measur able disease: I n this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall  tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non -target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The 
designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non -target disease 
in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
 When the patient has only non -measurable disease:  This circumstance arises in some 
Phase  [ADDRESS_658140] measurable disease. 
The same general concept apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there 
is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in 
non-measurable disease burden. Because wors ening in non -target disease cannot be 
easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test 
that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider 
if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non -measurable 
disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare 
PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 
73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent t o a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion).  
Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large”, an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as 
“sufficient to require a c hange in therapy”. If “unequivocal progression” is seen, the patient 
should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for exam ple, some “new” 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). This is particularly 
important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For example, 
necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan  report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it 
is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 121 If a new lesion is equivoc al, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initi al scan.  
While fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning 
in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease). New lesions on the basis of 
FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: This is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at  follow -up: If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is 
PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on 
CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine i f there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial 
abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a 
pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis  of the anatomic 
images, this is not PD.  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study drug treatment 
until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  On occasion, a 
response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols should be clear if 
post-treatment assessments are to be considered in determination of best overall response. 
Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced b efore progression will affect best 
response designation. The patient’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings 
of both target and non -target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new 
lesions. Furthermore, depe nding on the nature of the study and the protocol requirements, it may 
also require confirmatory measurement. Specifically, in non -randomized studies where response 
is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the “best ov erall 
response”.  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best response 
determination in studies where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT required: 
Best response in these studies is defined as the  best response across all timepoints (for example, 
a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment 
has a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet 
the protocol spec ified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is 
otherwise the best timepoint response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent 
assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD at second and do es not 
meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of PD. The same patient lost to 
follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered unevaluable.

When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to “normal” 
size (< 10  mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measureme nt should 
be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that patients with CR may not 
have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
In studies where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ timepoint assessments may 
complicate best response determination. The analysis plan for the study must address how 
missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and progres sion. For 
example, in most studies it is reasonable to consider a patient with timepoint responses of 
PR-NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patient s with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective resp onse: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and unevaluable response” are study 
specific and should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, 
treatment periodicity).  
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biops y) before assigning a status of 
complete response. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to 
a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this  circumstance should be prospectively described in the 
protocol and supported by [CONTACT_198369]. However, it must 
be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of 
FDG -PET and b iopsy resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes, 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at 

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 123 the next scheduled assessmen t, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.  
 
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/DURATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In non -randomized studies where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR  and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. This will also 
permit appropriate interpretation of results in the context of historical data where response has 
traditionally required confirmation in such studies . However, in all other circumstances, ie, in 
randomized studies (phase 2 or 3) or studies where stable disease or progression are the primary 
endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the 
interpretation of study re sults. However, elimination of the requirement for response 
confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, in particular 
in studies which are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at  least once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).  
Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until  the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded on study).  
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement crite ria are 
first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized studies, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for  progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).  
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and diseases. If 
the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time is an endpoint 
of importance in a particular study, the protocol should specify the minimal time interval 
required between two measurements for determination of stable disease.  
NOTE : The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are 
influenced by [CONTACT_150065] -up after baseline evaluation. It is not in the scope of this 
guideline to define a standard follow -up frequency. The freque ncy should take into account 
many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and standard practice. 
However, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint should be taken into 
account if comparisons between studies are to be made.

OF “WOMEN OF CHILDBE ARING POTENTIAL” AND  
“WOMEN OF NO CHILDBE ARING POTENTIAL”  
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. 
These methods include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen - and p rogestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
 Intrauteri ne device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized male partner  
NOTE : This is only considered a highly effective form of birth control when the 
vasectomized partner is the sole partner of the study participan t and there has been a 
medical assessment confirming surgical success.  
NOTE : A sterile male is one for whom azoospermia, in a semen sample examination, 
has been demonstrated as definitive evidence of infertility. Males with ‘low sperm 
counts’ (consistent w ith ‘sub -fertility) are not to be considered sterile for purposes of 
this study.  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of exposure associated with the study treatment)  
NOTE : Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is 
in line with the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (eg, 
calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of 
abstinence for the duration of exposure to  study drug, and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) 
is not considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this method mus t be 
combined with another highly effective form of birth control listed above.  
Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potential" and “Women of Non -Childbearing Potential” 
are applicable to both study participants and sexual partners of male participants.  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 128 Conversely, “women of non -childbearing potential” are defined as female patients meeting any 
of the following criteria:  
 Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy)  
 Post-menopausal, defined as:  
 > 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for > 12 months OR  
 < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for > 12 m onths AND with 
postmenopausal follicle -stimulating hormone concentration > 30 IU/mL  
Study participants receiving chemotherapy have a potential risk of irreversible infertility. 
Patients should be advised to speak to their physician for further information about their locally 
available options for fertility preservation.

AND MANAGEMENT  
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any irAE  are intended as a 
guidance. This document should be used in conjunction with expert clinical judgement (by 
[CONTACT_509049] e xperienced in the treatment of cancer using immunological agents), and 
individual institutional guidelines or policies. However, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_508967].  
Criteria used to diagnose irAEs include blood tests, diagnos tic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbiology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, 
and adverse effects of concomitant drugs. In addition to the results of these tests, the following 
factors should be considered when making an irAE diagnosis:  
 What was the temporal relationship between initiation of tislelizumab and the adverse 
event?  
 How did the patient respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab?  
 Did the event recur when tislelizumab was reintroduced?  
 Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
 Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
 Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the irAE field, 
associat ed with the AE in the eCRF should be checked.

Neurological Toxicity  Perform a comprehensive neurological examination and brain MRI for all 
CNS symptoms; review alcohol history and other medications. Conduct a 
diabetic screen, and assess blood B12/folate, HIV status, TFTs, and 
consider autoimmune serology. Consider the need for brain/spi[INVESTIGATOR_65034]/MRA and nerve conduction study for peripheral neuropathy. Consult 
with a neurologist if there are abnormal findings.  
Colitis  Review dietary intake and exclude steatorrhea. Consider comprehensive 
testing, including the following: FBC, UEC, LFTs, CRP, TFTs, stool 
microscopy and culture, viral PCR, Clostridium difficile  toxin, 
cryptosporidia (drug -resistant organism).  
In case of abdominal discomfort, consider imaging, eg, X -ray, CT scan. If a 
patient experiences bleeding, pain or distension, consider colonoscopy with 
biopsy and surgical intervention, as appropriate.  
Ocular Disorders  If patients experience acute, new onset, or worsening of eye inflammation, 
blurred vision, or other visual disturbances, refer the patient urgently to an 
ophthalmologist for evaluation and management.  
Hepatitis  Check ALT/AST/total bilirubin, INR/albumin;  the frequency will depend 
on severity of the AE (eg, daily if Grade 3 or 4; every 2 -3 days if Grade 2, 
until recovering). Review medications (eg, statins, antibiotics) and alcohol 
history. Perform liver screen including Hepatitis A/B/C serology, Hepatitis  
E PCR and assess anti -ANA/SMA/LKM/SLA/LP/LCI, iron studies. 
Consider imaging, eg, ultrasound scan for metastases or thromboembolism. 
Consult with a hepatologist and consider liver biopsy.  
Renal toxicity  Review hydration status, and medication history. T est and culture urine. 
Consider renal ultrasound scan, protein assessment (dipstick/24 -hour urine 
collection), or phase -contrast microscopy. Refer to nephrology for further 
management assistance.  
Dermatology  Consider other causes by [CONTACT_14664] a physical  examination, consider 
dermatology referral for skin biopsy  
Joint or muscle inflammation  Conduct musculoskeletal history and perform complete rheumatology 
examination. Consider joint X -ray and other imaging as required to exclude 
metastatic disease. Perfo rm autoimmune serology and refer to 
rheumatology for further management assistance.  
For suspected myositis/rhabdomyolysis/myasthenia include: CK, ESR, 
CRP, troponin and consider a muscle biopsy

 For some Grade 3 toxicities that resolve quickly, rechallenge with study drug may be 
considered if there is evidence of a clinical response to study treatment, after 
consultation with the study medical monitor  
 Steroid dosages in the table below are for oral or intravenous (methyl)prednisolone. 
Equivalent dosages of other corticosteroids can be substituted. For steroid -refractory 
irAEs, consider use of steroid -sparing agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF])  
 Consider prophylactic antib iotics for opportunistic infections if the patient is 
receiving long -term immunosuppressive therapy  
 Tislelizumab must be permanently discontinued for any onset of Grade 4 or recurrent

In adults, the most widely -used equations for estimating glomerular filtrati on rate (GFR) from 
serum creatinine are the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] (CKD -EPI) 
equation1 and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation. The National

which are isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable. All laboratories should be using 
creatinine methods calibrated to be IDMS traceable. Read more about creatinine standardization.  
This CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_508985]/dL. This equation is 
recommended when eGFR values above 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 are desired.  
GFR = 141 x min (Scr /κ, 1) α x max (Scr /κ, 1) -1.209 x 0.993Age x 1.018 [if female] x 1.159 [if

Scr is serum creatinine  in mg/dL,  
κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males,  
α is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males,  
min indicates the minimum of Scr /κ or 1, and

Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 153 Study Assessments:  
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed among evaluable patients after [ADDRESS_658171] 80% of the dose 
and completed all safety assessments required during the first [ADDRESS_658172]. 
Patients will be evaluated for any AEs and serious adverse events  (SAEs) occurring up to 
[ADDRESS_658173] dose of study drug (all severity grades, per NCI -CTCAE v4.03) or 
initiation of a new anticancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and immune -related AEs (irAEs) 
occurring up to [ADDRESS_658174]. All s tudy drug -related SAEs will be followed until they resolve to baseline or 
≤ Grade  1, the investigator assesses the AE as stable and unlikely to improve, or the patient is 
lost to follow -up, whichever occurs first.  
Safety and efficacy monitoring will be per formed by [CONTACT_269395] (IDMC) as per the main protocol ( Section  8.5). The IDMC will additionally 
evaluate and confirm the Phase 3 dose based on the safety and tolerability of tislelizumab, and 
decide whether to add unscheduled dose levels for the study. The IDMC may recommend 
modifications to the study, including termination due to safety and/or efficacy concerns.  
Dose Le vel 
Based on the safety results of the Phase 1 studies of tislelizumab (Studies 
BGB -A317_Study_001 and BGB -A317 -102), this study will initially assess the safety and PK 
characteristics of fixed dose 200  mg once every three weeks (Q3W) in Japanese patients with 
advanced unresectable/metastatic ESCC. Other dose levels may be further explored based on 
the tolerability in these patients . 
Among the 6 patients in the 200 mg Q3W cohort, if 2 or more patients experience DLT in 
Cycle 1, that starting dose will be co nsidered as exceeding the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD), and a lower dose (eg, 150 mg Q3W), will be subsequently assessed in 3 to 6 patients.  
If the 200 -mg Q3W regimen passes the DLT assessment, the cohort at that dose level can be 
expanded to approximately  10 patients to further assess the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics and preliminary pharmacodynamic characteristics of tislelizumab. Up to 
20 patients may be enrolled if a lower dose level is evaluated (such as 150 mg Q3W).  
Dose -limiting Toxicity  
All AEs will be graded according to the NCI -CTCAE v4.03. The occurrence of any of the 
following toxicities during Cycle 1 will be considered DLT, if judged by [CONTACT_509052]:  
Hematologic Dose -limiting Toxicities : 
1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >  7 days  
2. Febrile neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <  1000/mm3 with a single 
temperature of 38.3°C or a sustained temperature of 38°C for >  1 hour)  
3. Grade 3 neutropenia with infection  
4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia  with bleeding  

BGB -A317 -302 BeiGene  
Protocol Amendment 4.0 20 March 2020  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 154 5. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
6. Grade 4 anemia (life -threatening)  
Non-hematologic Dose -limiting Toxicities : 
1. Grade 4 or above toxicity  
2. Grade 3 toxicity lasting > 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_508986] : The following AEs will not be considered as DLTs:  
 Grade 3 endocrinopathy that is adequately controlled by [CONTACT_509053]  
 Grade 3 AE of tumor flare (defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of 
known or suspected tumors)  
 Grade 3 rash  
 Grade 3 to Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae 
(eg, LDH)  
In addition, clinically important or persistent toxicities that are not included above may also be 
considered a DLT following review by [CONTACT_184160].  
Patients who received less than two -thirds (67%) of the assigned dose of tislelizumab (eg, 
because the infusion had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience 
a DLT will not be taken into account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for that 
particular dose level.  
Key Eligibility Criteria:  
The population under study is adult Japanese patients (≥  20 years of age on the day the patient 
voluntarily agrees to participate in the study) with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ESCC 
with tumor progression during or after  first-line treatment for advanced 
unresectable/metastatic disease. All patients are also required to have at least one evaluable 
lesion per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_658175], Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Tislelizumab will be administered at a dose of 200 mg intravenously (IV) Q3W. The proposed 
dose level can be further adjusted according to the safety and tolerability observed in the dose 
verification stage, and lower dose levels may be added if necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 155 Statistical Methods:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the demographic, disease characteristic, 
efficacy and safety data. No statistical hypotheses are planned in this exp loratory study.  
All patients who have received tislelizumab will be included in the Safety analysis set. All 
patients with valid tislelizumab PK sampling after treatment will be included in the PK 
analysis set. For other parameters, all evaluable data will  be included in the summaries.  
Efficacy Analysis : 
The efficacy per RECIST v1.1 (ie, ORR, PFS and DOR) will be summarized to explore the 
preliminary anti -cancer activities in Japanese patients.  
The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who had confirmed complete response (CR) 
or partial response (PR) assessed by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1.  
The DOR is defined as the time from the first determination of a confirmed objective response 
by [CONTACT_440277] v1.[ADDRESS_658176]. 
The ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be summarized in the Safety analysis set. Both 
PFS and DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. Waterfall plot of maximum 
tumor shrinkage per patient will be presented.  
Safety Analysis : 
Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_509054] (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis). Vital signs, physical examinations, and ECG 
findings will also be used in determining safety. The severity of AEs will be gra ded per 
NCI-CTCAE v4.03. The incidence of DLT events and treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) will be reported as the number (percentage) of patients with TEAEs by [CONTACT_136492]. Descriptive summary statistics (eg, n, mean, sta ndard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical 
variables) and changes from baseline will be determined for laboratory parameters and vital 
signs.  
Statistical methods will be described in detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Before initiating this Phase 3 study in Japan, a substudy investigating the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy is planned. This study is a dose -validation 
clinical study of the monoclonal anti body BGB -A317 in Japanese patients with advanced 
unresectable/metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), aiming to explore safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. This study is carried out based on Phase 1 studies evaluating 
tislelizumab (BG B-A317_Study_001 and BGB -A317 -102). Per the preliminary results of the 
Phase  1A Study BGB -A317_001, 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg once every two weeks (Q2W) are all 
tolerable doses. In addition, 2 and 5 mg/kg Q3W (once every 3 weeks) and [ADDRESS_658177] 
also bee n confirmed as tolerable. A 200 mg Q3W fixed dose was selected as the pi[INVESTIGATOR_508987]  3 studies. In the Phase 1 clinical study in China, six patients were administered the 200 mg 
Q3W fixed dose and PK analysis indicated that this is equivalent to 2. 4 to 3.8 mg/kg, based on 
body weight. The comparison results of dose normalized C max and area under the concentration -
time curve from Day 0 to Day 14 (AUC0 -14d) showed that the PK is consistent in Chinese and 
Caucasian patients. The available safety and PK  data suggest that the proposed dose of 200  mg 
Q3W tislelizumab is expected to be a safe dose to investigate in Japanese patients.  
The background on ESCC and on the monoclonal antibody, BGB -A317 is provided in the main 
study in Section  1 , Introduction.

3.1. Summary of Study Design  
This is an open -label, multicenter, non -randomized Phase 1 clinical study in Japanese patients 
with advanc ed unresectable/metastatic ESCC who have received prior treatment. Screening can 
last up to [ADDRESS_658178] until the investigator considers the patient is no longer 
benefiting from tislelizumab, toxicity, or voluntary withdrawal of study tr eatment. A minimum 
of 6 patients and a maximum of 10 patients will be enrolled to assess dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) and to adequately address the PK profile of tislelizumab in Japanese patients. Up to 
[ADDRESS_658179] 30 days (±  7 days) after the last dose of tislelizumab or before the initiation of a new 
anti-cancer treatment, whichever occurs first for any AEs, and up to [ADDRESS_658180] dose 
of tislelizumab for irAEs, regardless of initiation of subsequent anticancer treatment. Survival 
follow -up information will be collected approximately 1  month (4 weeks ±  7 days)  after the 
Safety Follow -up Visit and approximately monthly thereafter until death, loss to fol low-up, 
withdrawal of consent, or study termination by [CONTACT_3211]. The first [ADDRESS_658181] cycle of treatment.

hematology, serum chemistry) are complete d within [ADDRESS_658187] assessment.  
The mandatory Safety Follow -Up visit is required to be conducted 30 days (±  7 days) after the last dose of study therapy, or before initiation of a new 
treatment. At the end of treatment, ongoing AEs considered related to study treatment will be followed u ntil the event has resolved to baseline or 
≤ Grade  1, the event is assessed by [CONTACT_226876], the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that 
study treatment or participation is not the cause of the AE .

and/or clinic visits approximately 1  month (4 weeks ±  7 days) after the Safety Follow -up Visit and approximately monthly thereafter until death, loss to 
follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by [CONTACT_3211]. All patients will also be followed for new anti -cancer therapy information unless the 
patient requests to be withdrawn from follow -up.

believed to be related to tislelizumab treatment ( Section  8.4.1 ). All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is 
considered chronic, the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient is lost to follow -up or the pati ent withdraws consent ( Section  8.2.6 ).  
8 A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, cardiovascular, dermatolo gical, musculoskeletal, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated),  limited, symptom -directed physical examinations 
are required to be performed. Investigators should solicit patients regarding changes in vision, visual disturbance, or ocula r inflammation at each 
scheduled study visit during tislelizumab treatment. For an y change in vision, referral to an appropriate specialist will be made for further management 
guidance.     
[ADDRESS_658189] to be repeated at Cycle 1 Day 1.  
10 Vital signs to include temperature, pulse, blood pressure, height and weight. Height will only be measured and recorded at Sc reening Visit. Pulse and BP 
should be recorded while the patient is in a se ated position after resting for 10 minutes. For all infusions of tislelizumab , the patient’s vital signs should be 
recorded before the infusion, and between [ADDRESS_658190] be collected during the infus ion if clinicall y indicated .  
11 Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings will be obtained during screening, End of Treatment, and as clinically indicated at other timepoints. Patients should 
be resting and in a sitting or  supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] [ADDRESS_658191] not be enrolled until further definite testing with HBV DNA titers < 500 IU/mL  (or 2500  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) . 
13 Local or central laboratory assessments on serum chemistry (including liver function tests), hematology, coagulation, and uri nalysis will be conducted  
within 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1, of which certain elements will be collected as specified in Section  7.10 of the main protocol. If laboratory tests at 
screening are not performed within 7 days prior to the administration of study drug on Cycle 1 Day 1, these tests should be r epeated and reviewed before 
study drug administration. Serum chemistry (including liv er function tests) and hematology will be performed weekly for the first [ADDRESS_658192] creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase -cardiac muscle isoenzyme (CK -MB) testing at screening and all scheduled visits during the first 3 treatment 
cycles, all pre -dose assessments from Cycle 4 onwards, and at the EOT and Safety Follow -up Visits. In the e vent that CK -MB fractionation cannot be 
evaluated in the local laboratory, troponin I and/or troponin T should be assessed instead; the same test should be administe red throughout the study. 
Urinalysis and coagulation parameters are to be assessed during t he treatment period only if clinically indicated. Refer to Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_658193] (for women of childbearing potential, including women who have had a tubal ligation) must be performed a nd documented as 
negative within seven days prior to Cycle [ADDRESS_658194] is positive or equivocal.  
15 Analysis of T3, T4 and TSH will be performed by [CONTACT_941] l ocal study site laboratory. Thyroid function tests will be performed within 7 days prior to Cycle  1 
Day 1 and every three cycles thereafter (eg, Cycles 4, 7 and 10, etc.), and at the mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit.  
16 Procedures for collection of tislelizu mab PK and ADA samples are described in the Laboratory Manual. Refer to Table 8 for details on timing of PK and 
ADA sample collection; additional PK and ADA samples are required to be collected at the Safety Follow -Up Visit. If a patient presents with any 
immune -related adverse event, additional blood PK samples may be taken to determine the plasma concentration of tislelizumab. These tests are require d 
when it is allowed by [CONTACT_427]/IRBs/ECs.  

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658195]/MRI of the head at baseline is required  for patients who are suspected to have CNS metastases. All measurable and evaluable lesions 
are required to be assessed and documented at the screening visit. The same radiographic procedure must be used throughout th e study for each patient. 
The investig ator must review radiograph results before dosing at the next cycle. Patients will undergo tumor assessments approximately  every 6 weeks 
(± 7 days)  for 6  months, then every 9 weeks (± 7 days) afterward s. Patients who discontinue from treatment for reasons other than disease progression or 
death will continue scheduled tumor assessments until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, death or start of a new ant i-cancer therapy. 
Investigators may perform additional scans or more frequent assessments if clin ically indicated. Imaging timing should follow calendar days and should 
not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Patients who continue tislelizumab treatment beyond radiographic disease progress ion will be monitored with a 
follow -up scan at least 4 week s later or at the next regularly scheduled timepoint (not exceed 6 weeks) before discontinuation of study treatment.  
18 The initial infusion of tislelizumab will be delivered over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second infusion and each subsequent infusion may be  administered 
over [ADDRESS_658196] period  permissible  for infusion.  
19 Representative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or at least 10 unstained slides is required to be submitted for  biomarker analysis if available. 
In the absence o f archival tumor tissues, a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion at baseline is highly recommended.  
20 All HRQoL assessments are to be performed prior to study treatment initiation, Cycles 1 - 6 Day 1 or at the EOT Visit (whichever occurs first), and at the 
Safety F ollow -up Visit.  A visit window of ±  7 days will apply to a HRQoL visit assessment. HRQoL instruments are to be given to the patient prior to 
being seen by a health care professional. NOTE: HRQoL assessments are to be conducted both at screening and C1D1 vi sit; if screening visit is <  [ADDRESS_658197] serious/severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_508988], to assist the determination of suitability for enrollment on the study. Uncertain cases shoul d be discussed with the medical monitor.  
[ADDRESS_658198], and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test for retinal examination)  captured as standard of care 
prior to obtaining written informed consent and within [ADDRESS_658199], and optical coherence tomography (or equivalent diagnostic test) will be assessed at the Screening Visit. Patients will  undergo repeated assessments 
approxima tely every 15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment < 30 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of stud y treatment.  
[ADDRESS_658200] (or equivalent diagnostic test) should only be performed once at 
either the EOT or during safety follow up within 30 days (± 7 days) of study treatment end.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 164 3.3. Duration of Study  
Total duration of study participation will vary by [CONTACT_4676]. Each study phase is further discussed in 
the main protocol in Section  3.3.1  though Section  3.3.5 . 
3.4. Dose -Limiting Toxicities  
Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be assessed among evaluable patients after [ADDRESS_658203] 80% of the dose 
and completed all safety assessments required during the first 21 days, or any patient who has 
experienced a DLT within 21 days.  
Among the six patients in the 200 mg Q3W cohort, if two or more patients experience DLT 
within 21 days, t hat dose will be considered as exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
and a lower dose (eg, 150 mg Q3W) will be subsequently assessed in three to six patients. The 
first six patients will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508989] 1; after the fi rst week they 
will be monitored with weekly complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry through the 
end of the 21 -day DLT assessment period. After the DLT assessment period, hematology and 
serum chemistry (including liver function tests) will be perform ed weekly for Cycle 2 and Cycle 
3 and then at the beginning of each subsequent cycle for Cycle 4 and beyond.  
If the 200 mg Q3W dose passes the DLT assessment, the cohort at that dose level can be 
expanded to approximately 10 patients to further assess the safety, tolerability, PK and 
preliminary pharmacodynamic characteristics of tislelizumab. Up to 20 patients may be enrolled 
if more than dose level is evaluated. To continuously monitor safety, if the cohort has been 
expanded to 10  patients and ≥  33% of th em have experienced DLT within 21 days, enrollment 
will be suspended, and an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) meeting will be 
immediately held to discuss and determine whether that dose is safe.

5. STUDY TREATMENT  
5.1. Formulation, Packaging, Handling, and Storage  
Please refer to the Section  5.1 of the main protocol for information on the formulation, 
packaging, handling and storage of tislelizumab.  
5.2. Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
Patients will be treated with 200 mg intraveno us (IV) tislelizumab Q3W until intolerable 
toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or until the patient is no longer benefiting from study 
therapy in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. All patients will be monitored continuously for AEs. 
Treatment modifica tions (eg, dose delay, reduction, interruption, or discontinuation) will be 
based on specific laboratory assessments and AE criteria, as described in Section  8.[ADDRESS_658218] Accountability  
Please refer to Section  5.4 of the main protocol for detailed information.  
5.5. Disposal and Destruction  
Please refer to Section  5.5 of the main protocol for detailed information.  
6. PRIOR AND CONCOMITAN T THERAPY  
Please refer to Section  6 of the main protocol for detailed information.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 170 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Study assessments and procedures will be similar to those in the main protocol, Section  7 
(Section  7.1 through Section  7.17), with the exception that patients will not be randomized for 
the substudy and there is no second treatment arm. In addition, PK assessments have been 
increased in this substudy for thorough characterization of PK after a single dose and at steady 
state in Japane se patients and are provided in further detail in Section  9.[ADDRESS_658219] and electronic case report form (eCRF) for 
each patient.  
Tumor response will be as sessed by [CONTACT_509059] v1.1. For immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_508991], pseudo -progression may occur due to immune -cell infiltration and other 
mechanisms leading to an apparent increase of existing tumor masses or appearance of new 
tumor l esions. Thus, for progressive disease (PD) suspected by [CONTACT_509060] -
progression, the following criteria must be met to treat patients continuously until PD is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_509061]:  
 Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including worsening 
laboratory values)  
 ECOG PS ≤ 1  
 Absence of rapid progression of disease or progression at a critical anatomical site 
(eg, progression o f a spi[INVESTIGATOR_508992]) or that 
necessitates urgent alternative medical intervention  
If, in the judgement of the investigator, the patient is anticipated to benefit from continued 
treatment, the patient must re -sign an informed c onsent, agreeing to continue treatment beyond 
radiographical disease progression. If patients agree to continue treatment beyond radiographical 
progression, a follow -up radiographic evaluation will be performed no later than 6 weeks after 
the initial scan that diagnosed progressive disease, as outlined in Section  7.4 of the main 
protocol.  
If, in the judgement of the investigator, rapid early progress ion is evident (“hyperprogression”), 
tislelizumab should be discontinued.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 171 8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
Safety monitoring and reporting procedures will follow those in the main protocol ( Section  8). 
Another addition to this substudy is the definition of DLTs. All toxicities or AEs will be graded 
per NCI -CTCAE v4.03. The occurrence of any of the following toxicities within [ADDRESS_658220] week of Cycle 1; 
after the first week, they will be monitored with weekly CBC and serum chemistry through the 
end of the 22 -day DLT assessment period. After the DLT assessment period, the patients will be 
further assessed on a weekly basis for up to 3  cycles.  
Hematologic:  
1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days  
2. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia (defin ed as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <  1000/mm3 
with a single temperature of 38.3oC or a sustained temperature of 38oC for >  1 hour)  
3. Grade 3 neutropenia with infection  
4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
5. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
6. Grade 4 anemia (life -threatening)  
Non-hematologic:  
1. Grade 4 or above toxicity  
2. Grade 3 toxicity lasting > 7 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_508993] : The following AEs will not be considered as DLTs:  
 Grade 3 endocrinopathy that is adequately controlled by [CONTACT_509053]  
 Grade 3 AE of tumor flare (defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites 
of known or suspected tumors)  
 Grade 3 rash  
 Grade 3 to Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities that are not associated with clinical 
sequelae (eg, LDH)  
In addition, clinically im portant or persistent toxicities that are not included above may also be 
considered a DLT following review by [CONTACT_184160].  
Patients who received <two -thirds (67%) of the assigned dose of tislelizumab (eg, because the 
infusion had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will 
not be taken into account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level.  
Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An IDMC (described in Section  8.5 of the main protocol) will evaluate and confirm the Phase  3 
dose based on the safety and tolerability of tislelizumab, and decide whether or not to add 
unscheduled dose levels for  study. To confirm the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 dose, an IDMC meeting will 
be held within 6 weeks after the sixth patient is treated. If ≥ 33% of patients have experienced a 

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658221] dose of tislelizumab, enrollment will be suspended, and the 
IDMC will determine whether such a dose is safe or if a lower dose level should be tested. If < 
33% have experienced DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 10 patients in total to provide more 
safety experience on treatment.  
Safety review will then subseq uently be followed as per the main protocol. The IDMC may 
recommend modifications to the study, including termination due to safety and/or efficacy 
concerns.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 173 9. STATISTICAL METHODS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
As described in the main protocol, Section  9, the statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_509062]. Data will be listed and summarized using 
SAS® Version 9.3 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) per sponsor agreed 
reporting standards, where applicable. Details of the statistical analyses will be included  in a 
separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.1. Analysis Sets  
 DLT Evaluable Analysis Set:  Includes all patients who have received at least 80% of 
the dose and completed all safety assessments required in Cycle 1, or any patient who 
has experienced DLT in Cycle  1 
 PK Analysis Set:  Includes all patients who receive at least one dose of tislelizumab 
per the protocol, for whom any post -dose PK data are available. To get an adequate 
sample size to characterize PK, patients will be replaced if necessary  
 Safety Analysis Set: Includes all patients who received at least one dose of study drug 
and is the primary analysis set used for all safety analyses  
9.2. Patient Disposition  
Please refer to Section  9.[ADDRESS_658222] received tislelizumab will be included in the Safety analysis set. All 
patients with valid tislelizumab PK sampling after treatment will be included in the PK analysis 
set. For other parameters, all evaluable data will be includ ed in the summaries.  
9.5.1.  Primary Analyses  
Tislelizumab safety and tolerability: The safety of tislelizumab will be assessed throughout the 
study by [CONTACT_509063] -CTCAE v4.03, relevant physical 
examination, ECGs and laboratory assessme nts as needed.  
The recommended dose for the Phase [ADDRESS_658223] v1.1 (ie, ORR, PFS and DOR) will be summarized to explor e 
the preliminary anti -cancer activity in Japanese patients.  
The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients who had confirmed complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) assessed by [CONTACT_26309] v1.1.  
The DOR is defined as the time f rom the first determination of a confirmed objective response 
by [CONTACT_440277] v1.[ADDRESS_658224].  
The ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be summarized in the Safety analysis set. Both 
PFS and DOR will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. Waterfall plot of maximum 
tumor shrinkage per patient will be presented.  
Immunogenic responses to tislelizumab will be assessed by [CONTACT_509064].  
9.5.3.  Exploratory Analyses  
Assessments of the correlations between drug expo sure and response (efficacy and safety 
endpoints) will be made. Results of such exploratory analysis may be reported separately from 
the clinical study report (CSR).  
9.6. Safety Analyses  
As described in the main protocol ( Section  9.6), safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_509065] -CTCAE v4.03. Laboratory values (eg, hematology, clinical 
chemis try), vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations will also be used in determining safety. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze all safety data in the Safety analysis set. Substudy 
Protocol Section  8 includes DLT definitions as well as specific information on the role of the 
IDMC in the assessment of DLTs and the confirmation of the Phase 3 dose.  
9.7. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic sam ples will be collected in this study as outlined in Table 8. The PK analysis 
will include, but is not limited to, area under the concentration -time curve from Day 0 to Day 21 
(AUC 0-21d), C max and T max, Ctrough, t1/2, CL and Vd. Mean serum tislelizumab concentration data 
and PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_765]/cycle at which these data are 
available. Concentrations of tislelizumab will be summarized descriptively. Descriptive statistics 
will include means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations, as appropriate. Additional PK 
analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  
Details concerning handling of PK serum samples, including labeling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_508994]. Samples will be shipped to the central laboratory 
where all samples will be an alyzed for serum tislelizumab concentrations using a validated 

BGB -A317 -[ADDRESS_658225] minute in the 
eCRF and recorded in the database.  
9.8. Immunogenicity Analyses  
As described in the main protocol ( Section 9.8), the immunogenicity results will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_509066] e 
anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The incidences of positive ADAs and neutralizing ADAs will be 
reported for evaluable patients. The effect of immunogenicity on PK, efficacy, and safety may be 
evaluated if data allow.

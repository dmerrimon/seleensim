[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] Effect of Combined Red and Near Infrared Light -emitting Diode (LED) Therapy on Tissue 
Regeneration Post Laser Treatment  (Document date:  11/29/2023 ) 
 
STUDY PROTOCOL  
 Background & Purpose of the Research  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a combination of near infrared (830 nm) red (633 nm) and blue (465nm) light -emitting diode (LED) therapy on wound healing after application of low density ablative 
fractional laser to bilateral inner biceps, close to the axilla. Our hypothesis is that the LED therapy will result in less post treatment pain and in a faster healing time after ablative fractional laser application.  
 Literature reveals that light- emitting diodes (LED) promote healing of skin wounds by [CONTACT_347296]ﬂammation, 
increasing ﬁbroblast proliferation, stimulating angiogenesis, formation of granulation tissue, and increasing collagen synthesis.[ADDRESS_431587] to the medical community in large part for its safety proﬁle – at 6.5 
milliwatts, it emits energy far less than that of a household ﬂashlight. To further determine the extent to which LED promotes healing and to evaluate the relative speed at which it does so compared to other conservative management, this study sets out to assess wound healing with LED treatment after application of fractional ablative laser to the bilateral inner biceps, close to the underarm. Ablative fractional laser treatment results in well -
healed regeneration of the superﬁcial layers of the skin, thus an ablative fractional laser with the following parameters will be used to induce a two -inch by [CONTACT_1192] -inch, superﬁcial wound on each ventral bicep: 650 
micrometers at 1 50 J and 5.5% density, similar to parameters used to treat scars. After laser application, we will 
evaluate the effect of a combination of near infrared (830 nm) red (633 nm) and blue (465nm) light -emitting diode 
(LED) therapy on wound healing post laser treatment. Product under investigation: BioPhotas Celluma LED device Technical parameters Red: 640nm+/ -25nm NIR: 880nm+/- 50nm Blue 465nm Irradiance 6.5 mW/cm2 Fluence 
11.7J/cm2  Literature reveals that light- emitting diodes (LED) promotes healing of skin wounds by [CONTACT_347296]ﬂammation, 
increasing ﬁbroblast proliferation, stimulating angiogenesis, formation of granulation tissue, and increasing collagen synthesis. One proposed mechanism for these changes called the Karu Model is shown below  (Figure 1) :  
 
Many studies have demonstrated these effects on wound healing in vitro, as below, where “LLLT” refers to low -level 
light therapy . See Figures 2 & [ADDRESS_431588] -CO2 laser 
treatment.  
 
Further study on the mechanism by [CONTACT_347297] I, II, III, IV, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome C (part of complex IV) ultimately leading to increased nitric oxide (NO) and thus increased wound healing.  
 Given these past results, we now want to conﬁrm response in human subjects.  
 
 The primary endpoint of this study is time in days to complete healing of the treatment sites. Clinical grading shall be by [CONTACT_347298], using recognized assessment techniques. A secondary outcome measure will be post -
treatment pain on a 10 -point scale.

 Methods of assessment  
Authors note:  
Scales used to describe healing in leg ulcers and general or surgical wounds, apart from the Leg Ulcer Measurement Tool LUMT, lack comprehensive and quality evaluation with respect to validity, reliability, and sensitivity. The author has reviewed the Food  and Drug Administration’s guidelines on wound healing and has 
identiﬁed the following areas that constitute important measurement metrics in wound healing.  
 
Clinical assessment  
Clinical photography  
Digital clinical photography shall be taken at baseline, immediately post treatment and at each assessment point.  
 Healing assessment  
Clinical assessment shall be performed by [CONTACT_347300], based on visual examination and clinical photography of the test and control areas at baseline (before the ﬁrst session), and at each assessment point.  
 Healing shall be graded at each assessment on a 5 -point visual analogue scale as follows:  
i. Excellent : 81% - 100% healing  
ii. Very Good :  61% - 80% healing  
iii. Good:  41% - 60% healing  
iv. Fair:  21% - 40% healing  
v. Little or no change:  0% - 20% healing  
 Erythema  
Clinical assessment shall be performed by [CONTACT_347301], based on visual examination and clinical photography of the test and control areas at baseline (before the ﬁrst session), and at each assessment point.  
 Erythema shall be graded at each assessment on an 11 -point scale as follows:  
i. Little to No Erythema  
- [ADDRESS_431598] and control areas at baseline (before the ﬁrst session), and at each assessment point.  
 
Swelling shall be graded at each assessment on a 11 -point scale as follows:  
i. No Swelling evident  
- [ADDRESS_431599] and control areas at baseline (before the ﬁrst session), and at each assessment point.  
 Crusting shall be graded at each assessment on a 11 -point visual analogue scale as follows:  
i. No crusting evident  
- [ADDRESS_431600] assessment  
 Pain  
Pain shall be assessed using an 11 -point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0 -10-point scale). The Scale will be used at 
the following timepoints.  
i. Immediately after the test area performance  
ii. [ADDRESS_431601] treatment session of Biophotas Celluma.  
iii. Daily, immediately before and 30 minutes after each Biophotas Celluma treatment.  
 Discomfort  
Discomfort shall be assessed using an 11 -point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0 -10-point scale). The Scale will be 
used at the following timepoints.  
i. Immediately after the test area performance  
ii. [ADDRESS_431602] treatment session of Biophotas Celluma  
iii. Daily, immediately before and 30 minutes after each Biophotas Celluma treatment  
 Itching  
Itching shall be assessed using an 11 -point Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0 -10-point scale). The Scale will be used 
at the following timepoints.  Daily, immediately before and 30 minutes after each Biophotas Celluma treatment.  
  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
The primary endpoint measured in the study is length of days to reach either a 0 or 1 on the 11 -point scale for 
erythema, swelling, and crusting, as well as 80 -100% overall healing on the treatment arm compared to the control 
arm. Comparisons of pain, discomfort, and itch ratings will also be made between treatment and control arms by [CONTACT_347302].  
 Times to full healing and times to resolution of all side effects will be described by [CONTACT_347303] 95% conﬁdence limits.   A comparable study of LED therapy involving [ADDRESS_431603] mean (SD) treated healing time of 13.5 (1.1) days and mean (SD) untreated healing time of 26.8 (1.6) days. Mean (SD) of relative reduction in healing time was 50% (2.2%) and the lowest relative reduction was 48%. Assuming similar results for the proposed study, the study size of 25 would virtually guarantee statistically signiﬁcant reductions in healing time. Based on 95% conﬁdence 
intervals, the mean treated healing time, mean untreated healing  time and mean relative reduction in healing time 
will be estimated with precisions of 3.1%, 2.3% and 1.7%.

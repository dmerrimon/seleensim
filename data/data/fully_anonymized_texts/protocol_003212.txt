Study Design:
This is an open -label, randomized, parallel -group study to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of 
vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) 108 mg for injection administered in 2 different device delivery presentations in 
healthy  subjects. A minimum 102 subjects (51 per group) will be randomized to 1 of 2 device presentations (Group A 
or B).
Group Approximate Number of Subjects Treatment Description (a)
A 51 Single dose vedolizumab SC 108 mg delivered by [CONTACT_57783] (PFS) (reference).
B 51 Single dose vedolizumab SC 108 mg delivered by [CONTACT_57784] (PFS+AI) (test).
(a) Subjects randomized to each device will also be randomized for the site of administration (abdome n, thigh, or arm). 
Thus, within each treatment group, there are 3 sites of administration (abdomen, thigh, or arm) randomly assigned, for 
a total of 6 treatment combinations.
Subjects will be screened up to 28 days to determine eligibility before randomization. Enrolled subjects will return to 
the clinic at Check -in (Day -1).

Subjects with active or latent tuberculosis, regardless of treatment history.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
PK:
Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected for the determination of serum vedolizumab concentrations at the following 
times: predose (within 30 minutes before the start of SC dosing), 2, 8, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours after Day 1 dosing, 
and o n Days 10, 15, 29, 43, 64, 85, 106, and Fin al Visit Day 127/Early Termination.
The following serum PK parameters for vedolizumab SC will be analyzed as primary PK endpoints for each 
presentation: maximum observed serum concentration (C max), area under the serum concentration -time curve from

phase half -life. 
Safety:
Thefollowing safety variables will be used to characterize the safety and tolerability of vedolizumab SC: physical 
examination findings, treatment -emergent adverse events, clinical laboratory test results (clinical chemistry, 
hematology, urinalysis), vital s ign measurements, and 12- lead electrocardiogram. Percentage of subjects who are 
positive for antivedolizumab antibodies (AVA) and/or neutralizing AVA.

CONFIDENTIALStatistical Considerations:
PK:
For summary statistics and median plots by [CONTACT_31065], the nominal PK sampling time will be used; for individual 
subject plots by [CONTACT_5586], the actual PK sampling time will be used.
The PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148], by [CONTACT_57787], and a combination of 
treatment and site of administrati on. For AUC last, AUC ∞, and C max, individual subject parameters will be plotted by 
[CONTACT_57788]. 
Natural log transformed AUC∞(if data permit), AUC last, and C maxwill be analy zed using an analysis of covariance
model with treatment and site of administration as fixed effect and weight as a continuous covariate. Estimates of the 
adjusted mean differences (Test -Reference) and corresponding 90% CIs will be obtained from the model. The 
adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences will be exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of 
adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Single doses of 108 mg of vedolizumab 
administered as PFS (reference treatment) will be compared vs PFS+AI (Test Treatment). Comparability between the 
test and reference treatments will be concluded if the 90% CI for C maxand AUC lastare contained within therange of 0.8 
and 1.25.
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size of 51 subjects per group will provide 90% probability of concluding that the ratios of central values 
for area under the serum concentration -time curve (AUC) or Cmaxbetween 2 different device presentations is between  
0.8 and 1.25. This is assuming that the true difference between the central values is no more than 5% and based on 
24% coefficient of variation on AUC or C maxfrom no n-Japanese subjects in study MLN0002SC_101. An 18% 
drop-out rate was assumed for the sample size calculation.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Vedolizumab (also known as MLN0002, ENTYVIO, or KYNTELES) is a recombinant 
humanized mo noclonal  antibody  (mAb) com posed of 2 light chains of the subclass and 
2immunoglobulin G 1 heavy  chains that binds specifically to the human lymphocyte integrin 4β7. 
The 4β7integrin i s a pi[INVESTIGATOR_57770] y and inflammat ion because of its unique 
role in mediat ing the migrat ion of lymphocy tes into gut -associated lympho id tissue and lamina 
propri a, via binding to m ucosal  addressin cell adhesion molecule -1 (MAdCAM -1). Thus, 
vedo lizumab acts as a gut- selective immuno modulator. 
Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) has been developed as a treatment for ulcerative co litis (UC) and 
Crohn’s disease (CD), which are characterized by [CONTACT_57789]. 
Marketing approval has been granted in the [LOCATION_002], European Unio n, and mult iple other 
countri es for the treatm ent of adult patients with moderately to severely act ive UC or CD who have 
failed conventional therapy (ie, corticosteroids or immunom odulators) or tum or necrosis factor 
alpha antagoni sts. 
Two presentations o f vedo lizumab have been developed: a lyophilized powder for IV infusio n and 
a liquid for subcutaneous (SC) inject ion. Vedolizumab SC (also known as Vedolizumab Injection, 
for Subcutaneous Use; Vedo lizumab Solut ion for Inject ion in Prefilled Syringe; or MLN0002 SC) 
is a liquid presentation that has been developed for SC administration. To develop vedo lizumab 
SC, the vedo lizumab IV presentation was modified to ensure the long -term stabilit y needed for a 
liquid product. However, the vedo lizumab SC drug product presentation is similar to that of the 
vedo lizumab IV presentation after reconstitution. No changes were made that would impact the 
primary  structure of the protei n, and comparable biochemical properties and in vitro funct ional 
activit y have been demonstrated. Therefore, the nonclinical and clinical informat ion from studies 
with vedolizumab IV are considered relevant.
The bioavailabilit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), and safet y of vedolizumab following a single SC 
inject ion of vedo lizumab SC at 3 dose levels (54, 108, and 160 mg) relat ive to a single IV infusio n 
of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg was examined in a phase 1, open- label study  (MLN0002SC_101). 
Forty -eight (24 Japanese and 24 n on-Japanese) healt hy, adult male and female subjects were 
rando mized. A total o f 12subjects received a single dose of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg and 
36subjects received a single dose of vedo lizumab SC at 54, 108, or 160 mg (12 subjects per dose 
group). The bioavailabili ty estimate from vedo lizumab SC was 75.1%. The SC bioavailabilit y was 
independent of the SC doses evaluated (54, 108, and 160 mg vedolizumab SC). All other PK 
param eters estimates were very  similar to the values derived from phase 3 data with ve dolizumab 
IV, and there were no PK differences by [CONTACT_545] (Japanese vs non- Japanese). In study  
MLN0002SC_101 ,75.0% of subjects (36 of 48 subjects) had treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs). The percentage of subjects with a TEAE was the same when comparing subjects who 
received vedo lizumab SC and subjects who received vedolizumab IV. All TEAEs were considere d 
by [CONTACT_57790] y; no TEAEs of severe intensit y were 
reported. Four subjects had persistently moderate to high antivedolizumab antibodies ( AVA) t iters

and were not included in the nonco mpartmental  PK summaries. Overall, vedo lizumab SC and 
vedo lizumab IV were well tolerated in this study. The observed TEAEs were consistent with the 
overall safet y profile o f vedo lizumab.
Previou sly conducted clinical  studi es have characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab IV, a lyophilized formulat ion. As of 
19November 2016, vedolizumab exposure has extended for ≥12months in 1832 subjects, 
≥24months in 1379 subjects, ≥36months in 1169 subjects, ≥48months in 862 subjects, 
≥60months in 645 subjects, ≥72months in 308 subjects, ≥84 months in 32 subjects, and 
≥96months in [ADDRESS_63016] recent drug shipment data (19 November 2016), the 
cumulative pat ient exposure to vedo lizumab IV since its marketing approval in May [ADDRESS_63017] ive UC or CD who achieved clinical response fo llowing open -label 
vedo lizumab IV therapy  (MLN0002SC -3027 and MLN0002SC -3031) . The current presentation 
of the SC form ulation is in a prefilled syringe. 
The main purpose of this phase 1 clinical study is to compar e the PK of a vedo lizumab SC 108 mg 
dose in a prefilled sy ringe (PFS) vs prefilled syringe in autoinjector (PFS+ AI). The PFS+ AI
presentation is planned to be commercially available device after approval.
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile 
The proposed study  (VedolizumabSC -1022) i s designed to evaluate the PK and variabilit y of a 
vedo lizumab SC 108 mg dose in a PFS vs PFS+ AI. No changes were made to the vedo lizumab SC 
drug product composit ion that would impact the primary structure of the protein, and co mparab le 
biochemical properties and in vitro funct ional activity have been demonstrated. Therefore, the 
nonclinical and clinical informat ion from studies with vedolizumab IV are considered relevant.
The safet y of the vedo lizumab SC presentation is expected to be similar to that of vedo lizumab IV 
because of similar exposure, outside of expected local administration site events, such as 
inject ion-site reacti ons. The observed adverse events (AEs) with vedolizumab SC are consistent 
with the vedo lizumab IV safet y profile in ongo ing phase 3 clinical studies.
A phase 1 single dose study  with the SC form ulation in healt h volunteers was conducted and 
ident ified no safet y concerns. This study  is comparing different devices and the safet y is expected 
to be similar among thes e devices. 
Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies, including a phase 1 study of 
vedo lizumab SC.

(a) Subjects randomized to each device will also be randomized for the site of administration (abdomen, thigh, or arm). 
Thus, within each treatment group, there are 3 sites of administration (abdomen, thigh, or arm) randomly assigned, for 
a total of 6 treatment combinations. Seventeen subjects will be allocated to each site of administration within each 
treatment.
Subjects will be screened up to 28 day s to determine eligibilit y before randomizat ion. Eligible 
subjects will return to the clinic at Check -in (Day -1). On Day 1, all doses will be ad ministered by
a healt h care professio nal. A schemat ic of the study design is included as Figure 6.a. A schedule o f

6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
This study  is designed in accordance wit h Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 
docum ents [1,2] . The primary  PK endpo ints C maxand area under the serum concentration -time 
curve (AUC) are standard parameters to compare the rate and extent of absorption.
This study  will be perf ormed in heal thy subjects, rather than the target subj ect popul ation 
(ie,patients wi th UC or CD) because of the potential for immunogenicit y in subjects after single 
dose administration. Similar PK has been observed in healt hy subjects and pat ients with UC or CD 
following administration of vedoli zumab IV.
The study  design is open -label, since the primary object ive is to assess object ive variables, that is, 
vedo lizumab PK using mult iple device presentations. Because this is an object ive measurement, 
there is consequent ly no  risk of potential bias of the study results; hence, neit her study blinding nor 
inclusio n of a placebo group is required. 
Vedolizumab is a mAb wit h a lo ng half -life that precludes a crossover design. Therefore, a paralle l 
design will be used .
Vedolizumab SC dose of [ADDRESS_63021] resul ts are comm only used safet y 
endpo ints.
6.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study or Study Site
6.3.1 Crite ria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study
The study  will be co mpleted as planned unless 1 or more of the fo llowing criteria are satisfied that 
requi re tem porary  suspensi on or early  terminat ion of the study .
New informat ion or other evaluat ion regarding the safet y or efficacy  of the study  drug that 
indicates a change in the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the 
risk/benefit is no longer acceptable for subjects participat ing in the study .
Significant vio lation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the abilit y to achieve 
the primary  study  objectives or compromises subject safet y.
6.3.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Study Sites
A study  site may  be terminated prematurely  or suspended if the s ite (including the invest igator) is 
found in significant vio lation of GCP, protocol, or contractual agreement, is unable to ensure 
adequate performance of the study , or as otherwise permitted by  [CONTACT_39778].

Protocol 11 December 2017
CONFIDENTIAL9.1.9.3 Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The following definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
* A wom an is considered a woman of childbearing potential, that is, fertile, fo llowing menarche 
and until beco ming postmenopausal unless permanent ly sterile. Permanent sterilizat ion methods 
include hyst erectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state is defined as no 
menses for 12 months wit hout an alternative medical cause. A high FSH level in the 
postm enopausal  range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in younger 
women (eg, those <45 years old) or women who are not using hormonal contraception or hormona l 
replacement therapy . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.
** Sterilized men should be at least [ADDRESS_63054] –bilateral vasectomy and have confirmed that they 
have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate or have had bilateral 
orchi dectomy .
The follow ing procedures apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance.
1.Highly effect ive methods of contraception are defined as “those, alone or in combinat ion, that 
resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly and 
correctly ). In this study, where medicat ions and devices containing hormones are included, th e 
acceptable methods of contraception are: 
Nonhorm onal Methods: 
–Intrauterine device. 
–Bilateral tubal occlusio n. 
–Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the study 
participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgi cal success. 
–True sexual abst inence, only if this is in line wit h the preferred a nd usual lifestyle o f the 
subject. True abst inence is defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during 
the ent ire peri od of  the study , from [ADDRESS_63055] dose.
Horm onal Methods: Horm onal contracepti on m aybe suscept ible to interaction with the 
investigat ive co mpound, comparator, concomitant medicat ions, which may reduce the 
efficacy  of the contracepti on method.
–Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibit ion of ovulat ion init iated at least [ADDRESS_63056] dose of study  drug OR 
combined wit h a barrier method (male condom, female condo m or diaphragm) if for 
shorter duration unt il she has been on contraceptive for 3 months:
Oral. 
Intravaginal (eg, ring).

Protocol 11 December 2017
CONFIDENTIALTransde rmal. 
–Progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation 
initiated at least [ADDRESS_63057] dose of study  drug OR combined with a 
barrier method (male condo m, female condo m or diaphragm) if shorter till she has bee n 
on contraceptive for 3 months:
Oral. 
Injectable.
Implantable.
2.Subjects will be provided with information on highly effect ive methods of contraception as 
part of the subject informed consent process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating 
that the y understand the requirements for avo idance of pregnancy, donat ion of ova, and sper m 
donati on during the course of the study .
3.During the course of the study, regular serum hCG pregnancy tests will be performed only for 
wom en of childbearing potential and a ll subjects (male and female) will receive continued 
guidance wi th respect to the avoidance of pregnancy  and sperm  donat ion as part of the study  
procedures. Such guidance should include a reminder of the fo llowing:
a)Contraceptive requirements of the study .
b)Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in men with pregnant partners.
c)Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
–Have you used the contraception consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
– H ave y ou forgotten to use contracept ion since the last visit ?
–Are y our menses l ate (even in wom en wi th irregular or infrequent menstrual cy cles a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”)
–Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?
4.In addit ion to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at Screening, female subjects of 
childbearing potential must also have confirmed menses in the mo nth before first dosing (no 
delayed menses), a negat ive serum hCG pregnancy test as close as possible and before first 
dose of study  medicat ion, preferabl y on the same day . 
9.1.[ADDRESS_63058] is found to be pregnant during the study  she shoul d be wi thdrawn and any 
sponsor -supplied drug (vedolizumab SC) should be immediately discontinued. In addit ion, any 
pregnancies in the partner of a male subject during the study or for [ADDRESS_63059]’s partner. 
Vedolizumab SC
Study No. VedolizumabSC -[ADDRESS_63060] and/or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care physician 
being informed, the invest igator should notify the primary care physician that the female 
subject/female partner of the subject was participating in a clinical study  at the time she became 
pregnant and provide details o f the study  drug the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as 
applicable).
All reported pregnancies, including female partners of male subjects, will be fo llowed up to final 
outcom e, using the pregnancy  form. The outcom e, including any  premature terminat ion, must be 
reported to the sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the child will also be conducted.
9.1.[ADDRESS_63061] 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), Day  1(predose [within 
0.[ADDRESS_63062] ion]) and Final Visit Day  127/ Early Terminat ion. When an 
ECG recording is scheduled for the same day as blood draws (eg, PK or AVA sampling), the ECG 
recording will be co llected [ADDRESS_63063] safet y.
ECGs will be read automatically and also, the investigator or subinvestigator will manually 
interpret the ECG using 1 of the follow ing categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not 
clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically  significant. All [ADDRESS_63064] paper 
speed of 25 mm/sec and gain o f 10m/mV or digital recordings will be used.
One copy  of the 12 -lead ECG with the physician’s signature [CONTACT_57823]. If the original ECG is printed on 
thermal paper, the ECG report must be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_57777]. The photocopy will be filed wit h 
the original ECG in source.
9.1.12 Immunogenicity Sample Collection

events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168]. 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm allaboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laborator y values or ECG findings are only  considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG re -test and/or continued mo nitoring of an abnormal value or finding is not

verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless related 
to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).

occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures the change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ingdegenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, 
rheumatoi d arthri tis), worsening of the condit ion shoul d only be recorded as a PTE/AE if 
occurrin g to a greater extent to that which would be expected. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a P TE after the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complic ation of  an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serio us PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early  (eg, as an em ergency) because of a worsening of the pre -exist ing con dition, the 
Vedolizumab SC

Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject ’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested side effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the CRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.7 Relationship of AEs to Study Drug(s)
The rel ationship (causalit y) of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although factors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments , may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PTEs and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possi bility that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
Thestop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. Al l other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug 
Drug withdrawn –a study  drug i s stopped because of the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  drug.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been pos sible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, eg,the 
study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study drug was already stopped before 
the onset of the AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was interrupted because of the particular AE.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.13 Outcome
Recovered/reso lved – Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/res olving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irrever sible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Reso lved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (e g, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death.

special interest AE CRF or an SAE form. The SAE form shoul d be com pleted and reported to the 
SAE reporting contact i n Sect ion 1.0within 24 hours.
Hypersensitivity Reactions (Including Injection Site Reactions)
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedication 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence, such premedicat ions 
are unlikely to be necessary  or beneficial.
Vedolizumab SC will be administered by a hea lthcare professio nal, who should be prepared to 
manage hypersensit ivity react ions including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and 
medical support measure should be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed during 
the SC admi nistrati on and for [ADDRESS_63081] ion site pain, redness and/or swelling, etc, that may represent an administra tion-related 
reacti on to study medicat ion. Subjects will be asked to report administration -related AEs to the sites 
immediately  as they  are experienced or after having received appropriate medical care. Appropriate 
treatm ent and follow -up will be determine d by [CONTACT_17062]. If si gns or symptoms of an 
administration -related reaction are observed during the administration of study medicat ion, it should

or serious administration -related reaction (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, angioedema, 
life-threatening change in vital signs, severe injection site reactions) must be withdrawn fro m the 
study  (see Study  Manual ). 
Any inject ion site reaction will be collected and graded as fo llows:

12.1 CRFs (Electronic and Paper)
Com pleted CRFs are requi red for each subject who signs an informed consent.
The sponsor or its designee will supply study  sites wi th access to CRFs. The sponsor will make 
arrang ements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the CRF. These forms are used to transmit  
the informat ion collected in the performance of this study to the sponsor and regulatory authorities. 
CRFs must be completed in English. Data are transcribed dir ectly onto CRFs.
After complet ion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be issued by [CONTACT_1748] (or designees) and will be answered by [CONTACT_779].
Correcti ons are recorded i n an audit trail that captures the old informat ion, the new informat ion, 
ident ificat ion of the person making the correction, the date the correction was made, and the reason 
for change. Reasons for si gnificant correcti ons should addit ionally be included.
The principal invest igator must review the CRFs for completeness and accuracy and must sign and 
date the appropriate CRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the invest igator must retain full 
responsibilit y for the accuracy  and a uthent icity of all data entered on the CRFs .
CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and acceptabilit y at the study  site during peri odic visi ts 
by [CONTACT_3552]. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review the subject’s 
medical and hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1680]. The completed 
CRFs are the sole property  of the sponsor and should not be made available in any  form to thi rd 
parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmenta l health or regul atory  
authorities, wi thout wri tten permissio n of the sponsor.

13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finali zed before database lock. This 
docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all study  objectives.
A targeted review will be conducted before database lock. This review will assess the accuracy and 
completeness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the planned 
statist ical methods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
Safety Set:
The safet y analysis set will consist of all subjects who are enrolled and received [ADDRESS_63094] ics and safet y 
summaries.
PK Set:
The PK set will consist of all subjects who receive study drug and have at least [ADDRESS_63095] ics will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], and by [CONTACT_57803]. Summary  statisti cs (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum and 
maximum) will be generated for con tinuous variables (eg, age and weight) and the number and 
percentage of subjects within each category will be presented for categorical variables (eg, sex, 
ethnicit y, and race). 
13.1.[ADDRESS_63096] parameters will be 
plotted by  [CONTACT_57804]. 
Natural  log transform ed AUC ∞(if data permi t), AUC last and C maxwill be analyzed using an 
analysis of covariance model wit h treatment and site of administration as a fixed effect and weight 
as a continuous covariate. Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test -Reference) and 
corresponding 90% CIs will be obtained from the model. The adjusted mean differences and 90% 
CIs for the differences will be exponentiated to provide est imates of the ratio of adjusted geometric

CONFIDENTIALmeans (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Single doses of 108 mg of vedo lizumab 
administer ed as PFS (reference treatment) will be compared vs PFS+ AI(test treatm ent). 
Com parabili ty between the test and reference treatments will be concluded if the 90% CIs for C max
and AUC last are contained within the range of 0.8 and 1.25. 
Addit ional statistical analyses may  be perform ed if deem ed appropri ate.
A more detailed descript ion of the planned analyses will be presented in the SAP.
13.1.4 Safety Analysis
For all safet y summary  tables stated under this section, the tables will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], 
by [CONTACT_57805], and by [CONTACT_57806]. AEs will be 
summarized using the safet y analysis set. 
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Data will be summarized using preferred term and primary 
system  organ cl ass.
The number and percentage of subjects with TEAEs, defined as any AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, AESIs for vedolizumab (ie, PML, liver injury, injection site reactions), 
and SAEs, which occur on or after dosing in subjects, will be summarized by [CONTACT_57807], and preferred term, by [CONTACT_11370] y, and by [CONTACT_57808]. Separate summaries 
will also be generated for AEs by [CONTACT_3148] -related and severit y. Data list ings will be provided for 
all AEs (including PTEs for enrolled sub jects), AEs leading to study  drug di scont inuat ion, AEs 
leading to study  visit discontinuat ion, SAEs, and AEs resulting in death.
Baseline, postbaseline ,and change fro m Baseline in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs ,and ECG 
resul ts will  be summarized. Subjects with markedly abnormal values for laboratory  tests, vi tal 
signs and ECG results will be tabulated. The mappi[INVESTIGATOR_57780] a table. Individual result s for clinical laboratory tes ts, vital 
signs and ECG measures will be listed.
Data from the LTFU survey will be summarized descript ively.
VNS pain scale assessment data will be summarized.
The proportion of subjects with posit ive AVA and proportion of subjects with posit ive neutralizing 
AVA during the study  will be summarized at each visit. 
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination
No interim analysis is planned.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size of 51 subjects per group would provide 90% probabilit y of concluding that the 
ratios of  central  values for AUC or C maxbetween 2 different device presentations is between 0.8 
and 1.25. This is assuming that the true difference b etween the central  values is no m ore than 5% 
and based on 24% coefficient of variat ion on AUC or C maxfrom non-Japanese subjects in study  
MLN0002SC_101. An 18% drop -out rate was assumed for the sample size calculat ion.

2.Allow the red top Vacutainer to sit at room temperature for approximately 30 to 60 minutes 
(refer to product in formation for correct time) to ensure proper clot formation.
3.To separate the serum samples, centrifuge the Vacutainers for 10 minutes at approximately 
1100 to 1300 relat ive centrifugal force at room temperature in a centrifuge. Note: if using a 
collect ion device other than Becton -Dickinson, refer to m anufacturer’s instruction for proper 
centrifugation force and t ime.
4. To ensure a more homogeneous sample, all serum should first be transferred into 1 aliquot. 
From  there, split the serum evenly  between the 2 al iquots i nto polypropylene tubes. A 
minimum o f 1.0mL needs to be obtained for each sample. Labeling may include protocol 
number (VedolizumabSC -1022 ), matrix (i e, serum), analy te (vedolizumab), randomizat ion 
sequence number, no minal day and time, and either “SET 1” (for original sample) or “SET 2” 
(for duplicate sample).
5.Cap the labeled storage tubes and freeze the serum samples immediately at approximately 
-70°C. No m ore than [ADDRESS_63120] be allowed to elapse between collecting 
blood and freezing the serum sample.
6.Keep samples frozen at approximately -70°C or lower unt il shipment to Quest Pharmaceutical 
Services (QPS), Newark, DE before shipment to QPS. “SET 1” samples will be shipped first 
on dry  ice, followed by [CONTACT_57821] “SE T 2” samples after “SET 1” samples have 
been received.

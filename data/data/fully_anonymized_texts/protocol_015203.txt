RESEARCH STRATEGY 
A. Significance
     A.1.   Borderline Personality Disorder and its Treatment Challenges 
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent and enduring psychiatric condition 
found in approximately 2% to 5.9% of the population [1, 2] and 20% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337601]. Suicide rates of approximately 10% have been reported [3]. One of the most prominent 
clinical features of BPD is extreme mood shifts [4-6] occurring in response to external 
social/emotional events [7-9]. The emotional instability in BPD contributes to many of the most 
disabling, even life-threatening, symptoms of the disorder, including suicidality, outbursts of 
intense anger, and seriously impaired role functioning [10]. The severity of the BPD symptom 
profile, its prevalence, chronicity and high burden upon health care services [11-13] make the 
development of effective and accessible treatment for BPD a high priority. Although several 
psychological treatments show promise [1417] and medications are of value in ameliorating 
certain specific symptoms [18, 19], no medications are currently indicated to treat the BPD 
syndrome [19] and extant psychological treatments have small effect sizes, are resource 
intensive and of limited availability [20, 21]. The development of new treatment approaches is 
therefore essential. Neuroimaging is useful in treatment development to identify neural 
mechanisms underlying key symptoms, guide targeted treatments and assess their impacts.  
     A.2.   Cognitive Reappraisal as Therapeutic Focus 
 Intense, unstable or prolonged emotional reactions to psychosocial events characterize 
BPD, contributing to high levels of distress, disturbed relationships and impaired role 
functioning. Reducing affective instability (AI) in BPD is important to the successful treatment of 
the disorder because of the central role of AI in BPD’s most disabling and life-threatening 
symptoms [4, 5, 10]. Thus, the enhancement of emotion regulation is central to the treatment of 
BPD. A growing body of research has characterized the dynamics of emotion regulation [22]. A 
number of classes of regulation strategies have been described, including changing the 
situation (e.g., avoiding stressful situations), attentional redeployment (e.g., diverting attention 
away from the stressor), cognitive change, and modulating one’s emotional response (e.g., 
suppressing the expression of emotion) [23-25]. Cognitive change in particular is one of the 
most highly adaptive and versatile classes of regulation strategies, with cognitive reappraisal 
(CR) representing a particularly valuable strategy for implementing cognitive change [25]. CR 
entails re-construing a situation in such a way as to alter its emotional valence.  
Two CR tactics have been described as a means of operationalizing reappraisal [26, 27]. 
The first, distancing, is a strategy in which the subject construes the emotional situation as 
psychologically distant – i.e. calmly, objectively, and not emotionally relevant personally, or far 
away in time or place, so as to reduce its negative valence. This is the mechanism, for example, 
which underlies the “clinical distancing” that enables an emergency room physician to function 
effectively even in the face of intensely upsetting situations. The second is reinterpretation – a 
strategy in which the subject creates a different (e.g., more benign) narrative for a situation to 
change its valence (e.g. re-conceptualizing bad performance on a test as a “learning 
opportunity”, rather than as a marker of failure) [28] [26, 27].

Overall, cognitive reappraisal has been demonstrated to be a particularly effective 
strategy. Individuals who use cognitive reappraisal, in comparison to other regulation strategies, 
show a better sense of well-being, enhanced social relationships, better memory and less 
cardiovascular sympathetic arousal [25, 29, 30]. In particular, the distancing tactic of CR had the 
largest effect size (d=.45) [31] of various emotion regulation strategies examined [22]. Further, a 
direct comparison of distancing and reinterpretation CR tactics has shown that longitudinal 
training in distancing uniquely yields significant reductions in perceived stress in daily life [26].  
We have previously shown that BPD patients show impairments in cognitive reappraisal 
associated with anomalous neural activation when attempting to reappraise-by-distancing (see 
C.1.3.1. for previous results). They fail to engage the top-down cortical regions typi[INVESTIGATOR_337602] (HCs) and do not downregulate amygdala activity as HCs do [32]. 
This observation motivated us to explore whether BPD patients could be trained to enhance the 
effectiveness of cognitive reappraisal-by-distancing, the central aim of our recently completed 
NIMH funded study (R01 MH077813). In this study, we demonstrated that with 5 sessions of 
focused cognitive reappraisal-by-distancing (CRD) training, BPD patients were able, when 
reappraising negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (vs. just looking), to reduce activity (p=0.03, one-tailed) in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_337603] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_31166]) network, a whole-brain pattern derived 
through machine learning that is sensitive and specific to pi[INVESTIGATOR_337604] [33].  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_337605]. 
This network is more sensitive and specific for emotional reactions to negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_337606], such as the amygdala, insula, salience 
network and default mode network.  In addition to the decreased PI[INVESTIGATOR_337607], we found 
that, behaviorally, subjects showed a decrease in ratings of negative valence after training (p 
<0.03).  
This body of work convinced us to pursue development of focused cognitive reappraisal 
training as a novel approach to the treatment of BPD, either as a stand-alone treatment or in 
concert with evidence-based treatments for BPD. To accomplish this objective, we propose the 
current R61/R33 study. In the R61 phase, the proposed study will develop and manualize an 
enhanced form of focused cognitive reappraisal training, building upon the model explored in 
our previous work, will confirm that the manualized treatment can be delivered adherently, will 
demonstrate that this treatment influences targeted behavioral measures and specific 
hypothesized circuits, and will identify an optimal dose for the treatment. Should we 
demonstrate that the intervention can significantly influence activity in the targeted neural 
circuits, we will proceed to examine the R61determined optimal dose in the R33 phase of the 
study. In this phase, we will confirm that the treatment can be delivered reliably with good 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_337608], and will examine whether the treatment will have a 
beneficial effect on clinical outcome measures, including measures of overall BPD symptom 
score, affective lability, mood, impulsivity, and perceived stress. In addition this phase will allow 
us to replicate, in a new sample, that the treatment influences the target neural networks 
identified in the R61 phase, and to test whether change in clinical outcome measures correlate 
with changes in target circuit activation and behavioral reappraisal response. We will also 
examine the near-term durability of the treatment effect by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-assessing the clinical outcome 
measures 1 and 4 months after the end of the treatment.

A.3. From Proximal Target Engagement to Symptom Change: Modeling the Effects of 
Treatment  
The ultimate objective of the proposed treatment for BPD is to reduce the disabling 
symptoms of the disorder that 
contribute to personal distress, 
interpersonal impairments and 
social role dysfunction. These key 
symptoms include affective 
instability, unstable patterns of 
relating to others, impulsivity, 
inappropriate anger, self-destructive 
behaviors and inconsistent 
experience of self in terms of 
values, goals and beliefs. Affective 
instability, the tendency for emotions 
to be excessively reactive to events, 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_337609], reaching high 
levels of intensity and being slow to 
return to baseline, is an especially 
critical symptom of BPD. We have 
previously shown that many of the 
symptoms of BPD, including suicidal 
threats, gestures and acts, inappropriate anger, chronic emptiness and identity disturbances, 
are correlated with affective instability [10].  
Hence we propose a treatment that directly aims to reduce affective instability 
by [CONTACT_337660] (CR). From moment to 
moment, the effective use of CR should reduce the intensity with which negative stimuli are 
experienced and reduce activity in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_337610]. On the basis of the findings from our 
previous study (see A.2. above and C.1.3.3. below), we predict that CR training will lead to: 1) 
reduced PI[INVESTIGATOR_337611] 2) a reduction in behavioral 
ratings of negative valence (improved reappraisal success). Of the two, we expect that neural 
response will be the more sensitive measure of the proximal training effect because it is less 
subject to demand expectations and reporting bias.  
Our prior work demonstrated that with [ADDRESS_417154] that CR techniques 
will generalize beyond the treatment setting and be implicitly activated as subjects contend with 
emotionally stressful events in their daily lives (Fig. 1). This will lead to a decrease in affective 
instability and a consequential decrease in the BPD symptoms linked to affective insatiability: 
suicidal threats gestures and acts, inappropriate anger, chronic emptiness and boredom, and 
identity disturbances.  These hypotheses will be explicitly tested in the R33 phase.  
     A.4. Studies of Cognitive Reappraisal Enhancement 
 A number of recent studies have examined the degree to which individuals can be 
trained to enhance cognitive reappraisal. These studies employed a variety of training

techniques including: longitudinal mentor guided training in the lab, smart-phone based home 
practice focusing on daily life events, and practice providing counseling to others using 
reappraisal, delivered over an internet platform. The duration of training varied from one to three 
weeks, with session frequencies ranging from every 3 to 5 days to daily. Five of the seven 
studies examined healthy subjects [26, 34-37] and one each examined those with social anxiety 
[38] or high levels of neuroticism [29]. Most studies focused upon the reinterpretation tactic, but 
in their study of healthy subjects, Denny et al [26] compared training in reinterpretation and in 
distancing. They reported a robust reduction in self-reported negative affect relative to the 
control condition in both the distancing and reappraisal training conditions, with the effect in the 
distancing group greater than in the reappraisal group. Moreover, the distancing group showed 
a decrease in perceived stress following training. Overall, training in CR across these various 
studies appeared to be effective and was associated with symptom improvement. None of 
these studies examined BPD and only one defined a group based upon a clinical symptom [38]. 
While we are unaware of any studies, other than our own preparatory work (see C.1.33), 
directly examining the effect of focused CR training on neural activity, one study examined 
regional BOLD activity as a predictor of outcome in cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) of 
subjects with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder [39]. The authors report that, 
during a task in which subjects were instructed to “keep up” or “reduce” their emotional 
reactions, which the authors characterize as a reappraisal task, activation in the right 
hippocampus and left uncus during “keep up”, and in the left transverse temporal gyrus, left 
anterior insula, right and left superior temporal gyrus, left supramarginal gyrus, left precentral 
gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, and right substantia nigra during “reduce” predicted, using a 
random forest model, outcome to CBT treatment. Goodman and colleagues [40] reported that 
BPD patients who received 12-months of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) showed reduced 
amygdala activation to emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_337612]-reported 
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS, [41]). One component of DBT is the 
development of emotion regulation skills, although cognitive reappraisal is not explicitly taught. 
Nevertheless this study provides some support for the hypothesis that CR training may be 
valuable for BPD patients. The current proposed study will, however, test the hypothesis that 
focused CR training, as a highly targeted intervention, may shorten the time to clinical change.  
 Although these findings are highly encouraging, there are some important limitations to this 
literature. Few studies used objective measures of reappraisal utilization and effectiveness, 
instead relying primarily on self-reports. One of these studies involving assessment of neural 
activity showed that repeated CR-by-distancing training uniquely attenuated amygdala activity 
one week following training [37], but that study was confined to healthy subjects and examined 
massed CR practice over two days, rather than longitudinal training. Critically for the current 
application, are no reports of CR-specific treatments that have been manualized and 
there is no data on optimal dose. Further, significantly, no CR training study has examined 
BPD, the paradigmatic condition of emotional dysregulation. Thus, several important 
knowledge gaps remain: 1) can patients with BPD be trained to improve their ability to 
regulate emotion and improve symptoms and functional outcome by [CONTACT_337661], 2) what are the neural mechanisms by [CONTACT_337662], and 3) what is the optimal form of such training in terms of technique and dose? 
Addressing these knowledge gaps, the present study is positioned to translate cognitive 
reappraisal training into an addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for BPD, efficiently 
targeted to known mechanisms of emotion regulation, and impacting the key symptom domains 
of BPD. It may also have wider application to other disorders marked by [CONTACT_337663].

characterized its phenomenology in BPD [42], 
examined its relationship to the suicidality and 
interpersonal dysfunction in the disorder [10]  
and contrasted affective instability in BPD to that 
of bipolar disorder [43]. We have continued to 
further refine the affective instability construct 
[44]. 
C.1.2.  Neuroimaging Studies of Passive 
Emotion Processing in BPD.  We contrasted 
patterns of BOLD activation between 19 BPD 
patients and 17 HC subjects while they passively 
viewed emotional images [45]. When viewing 
negative International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_337613] 
(IAPS) pi[INVESTIGATOR_337614], BPD patients showed greater 
activity than HCs in the amygdala, fusiform 
gyrus, primary visual areas, superior temporal 
gyrus (STG) and premotor areas (Fig 1), 
whereas healthy controls showed greater activity 
in the insula, middle temporal gyrus and 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. 
C.1.3.  Neuroimaging Studies of Emotional 
Dysregulation in Borderline Patients  To 
understand the basis for the 
emotional dysregulation in BPD, we conducted a 
study (R01MH077813) examining two 
hypotheses: (1) that BPD patients were emotionally dysregulated because they could not 
effectively bring to bear the common and highly adaptive emotion regulating mechanism of 
cognitive reappraisal by [CONTACT_337664] (see A.2.), and (2) that BPD patients were emotionally 
dysregulated because they could not habituate as healthy subjects could, to repeated 
encounters with negative emotional stimuli. 
C.1.3.1. (1) Neuroimaging Studies of Reappraisal by [CONTACT_337665]. The first 
goal of this previous R01 study was to compare neural activation between BPD and HC 
subjects and the psychopathological control group of AvPD patients as they employed CRD 
when viewing aversive emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. We published findings contrasting 18 BPD patients 
and 16 HC’s [32]. When distancing compared to looking, BPD patients did not activate the 
dorsal ACC (dACC) and intraparietal sulci (IPS) as strongly as HC’s

(Fig. 2), did not downregulate the amygdala to the extent that HC’s 
did and activated the superior temporal 
sulcus (STS) and superior frontal 
gyrus more strongly than HC’s. This 
study was the first imaging study, to 
our knowledge, to contrast cognitive 
reappraisal processes in BPD patients 
and healthy controls. To determine 
whether the effects we observed were 
characteristic of personality disorders 
in general or more specific to BPD, we 
included the AvPD group in the 
comparison (19 BPD, 20 AvPD and 18 HC’s). Examination of the 
effect of distancing (vs. looking) in amygdala when viewing aversive images showed a 
significant Condition (distance vs. look) Χ Group interaction (F(2,54)=4.85, p=.01).  Post hoc 
tests demonstrated that for HC’s there was significantly less amygdala activity when distancing 
vs. looking (F(1,18)=9.05, p=.008) and for AvPD’s the effect was in the same direction but less 
marked (F(1,19)=3.66, p=.07), while BPD’s do not show a reduction in amygdala activity 
(F(1,17)=1.20, NS) (Fig. 3). Correspondingly, in the ACC (4,34,22) we found the greatest 
increase in activation from looking to distancing in HC’s, the least in BPD’s, with AvPD’s 
intermediate (Fig. 4).

C.1.3.2. (2) Neuroimaging Studies of Habituation to Single Repeat Viewing in BPD vs 
HC’s.  Our second goal in this study was to determine whether there are differences between 
BPD, AvPD and HC subjects in the degree to which neural networks habituate or sensitize to 
emotional stimuli. We found [46] in a sample of [ADDRESS_417157] ratings (t=2.71,df=24,p<0.01, one-tailed). 
HC’s, but not BPDs showed increased activity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) 
when viewing repeat vs novel 
aversive pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (156 voxel cluster, 
p<.05, k=150, FWE, Fig.5). 
Importantly, activation in this region 
was negatively correlated with 
affective instability (ALS score) for 
HC and BPD patients (r=-.038, 
p >0.04 and r=-0.56, p<0.01, one-
tailed, respectively, Fig. 6).  
C.1.3.3. Preparatory Studies of Reappraisal Training in BPDs 
Having demonstrated that BPD patients could not down-regulate 
amygdala activity and could not engage top-down regulatory 
networks as healthy volunteers could when attempting cognitive 
reappraisal-by-distancing (see C.1.3.1 above and [47]), we carried 
out a study (R01 MH077813) to determine whether focused 
training could enhance reappraisal in BPD, examining neural 
circuits implicated in reappraisal. BPD subjects (N=19), and healthy volunteers (HC; N=18) 
performed a cognitive reappraisal-by-distancing task 5 times: at baseline while fMRI images 
were acquired, then for three additional training sessions, and again on a 5th session when fMRI 
images were once again acquired. The sessions were separated by 2-3 days each. The 
reappraisal-by-distancing task, similar to the task to be employed in the present proposal (see 
more detailed description below), comprised 3 conditions presented in random order, in 
which subjects received the instruction either: 1) to apply reappraisal-by-distancing when 
viewing negative emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] (Reappraise-Negative Condition; RNeg), 2) to simply look 
at a negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], self-monitoring feelings induced by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_1103] (Look-Negative Condition; 
LNeg), or 3) to simply look at a neutral pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], self-monitoring the feelings present (Look-Neural 
Condition; LNeu). Following each pi[INVESTIGATOR_337615], the subject 
was prompted to rate how negative they were feeling on a scale 
from 1 (least negative) to 5 (most negative), after they carried out 
the instruction. A total of 90 trials (30 each condition) were 
presented each day, with different pi[INVESTIGATOR_337616]. We selected 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_337617]. The reappraisal 
training carried out each day consisted of two parts and followed a 
standardized script. First the subjects read a brief description of the 
distancing strategy written in lay language and were encouraged to 
discuss their understanding of the strategy and ask questions of the 
experimenter. Subjects practiced distancing with several pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], describing their thought 
process to the experimenter and receiving feedback to help shape their performance. Second, Fig. 5.  BPD patients fail to increase 
dorsal anterior cingulate activity to

End Date:5/27/[ADDRESS_417158] of reappraisal training carried over to the 
Look condition, even without conscious intention. This observation is particularly encouraging in 
terms of training generalizability, since it suggests that training in distancing may facilitate its 
automatic engagement , without need for deliberate intent. We found (see fig 7) that the total 
negative valence ratings for RNeg and LNeg showed a significant decrease post-training (p< 
0.05, twotailed). In terms of neural activity, we hypothesized that effective reappraisal of 
negative affective pi[INVESTIGATOR_337618] a downregulation of activity in a network known to 
represent a sensitive and specific neural 
signature [CONTACT_337704][INVESTIGATOR_499], the PI[INVESTIGATOR_337610] [33]. We 
found that, as expected, after reappraisal training 
BPD patents showed decreased PI[INVESTIGATOR_337619] (vs. looking) relative to pre-
training, with a large effect size (d=0.73, p<0.03, 
one-tailed; see Fig. 8). Thus, we found that with 
5-days of reappraisal-by-distancing training BPD 
patients were able to significantly improve their 
ability to downregulate activity in the brain 
network activated by [CONTACT_337666], and behaviorally to reduce how negatively they rated 
aversive pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. 
C.2.  Overall Design 
The present proposal follows the R61/R33 experimental medicine model to refine and test a 
proposed clinical intervention for BPD patients, training in reappraisal-by-distancing, in terms of 
its ability to influence hypothesized neural and behavioral targets and, once that is established, 
to demonstrate its ability improve clinically relevant outcome measures.  
C.2.1.  R61 Phase.  Specifically, in the R61 phase we will determine whether reappraisal 
training will have an effect upon hypothesized proximal neural targets (see below) and 
behavioral measures (assessed by [CONTACT_337667]; C.2.6.), further develop our 
treatment manual and will test 3 doses of the treatment with BPD patients -- treatment delivered 
2 times a week for 2, 4 and 6-weeks. The reappraise-treatment condition will be contrasted with 
a control condition (C.2.7.2). Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s adherence to the manual will be assessed.  
Based upon an extensive body of research on the neural correlates of cognitive 
reappraisal [48-50], we expect reappraisal training focused upon down-regulating reactions to 
negative emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_337620], the PI[INVESTIGATOR_337621]. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_337622] a particularly appropriate target, 
because it has been shown to vary monotonically with subjective emotion ratings and has been 
shown to be specific to pi[INVESTIGATOR_337604] [33]. Moreover, we found in our 
preparatory study (C.1.3.3) that reappraisal training was associated with a significant reduction 
in activation of this region. Hence our milestone for R61 success will be based upon change in 
the PI[INVESTIGATOR_337610] (see C.2.2). Although not specified as milestones, we will also examine

ROI’s identified in the reappraisal literature: the amygdala, and the top-down control regions: 
the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the 
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and the 
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) [48]. In addition, we will examine behavioral reappraisal success. 
The effect of reappraisal training upon all of these targets will be monitored at baseline and at 
weeks 2, 4 and 6 by [CONTACT_337668] (see C.2.6. below).  
C.2.2.  Milestones to Proceed to R33 Phase and Optimal Dose Determination. We have 
selected milestones for the present study, cognizant of the need to achieve a balance: criteria 
sufficiently stringent to insure that a target-based treatment is genuine on the one hand, yet 
which also guards against discarding an important treatment advance on the other. Ultimately, 
the goal of reappraisal training is to improve subject’s ability to reduce their negative emotional 
reactions to aversive cues, which we expect (and will test in the R33 phase) to improve their 
ability to handle stress and to reduce the clinical symptoms of BPD. We hypothesize that such 
clinical improvements would be associated with an improved ability to downregulate activity in 
the negative emotion responsive brain regions. As described above, with training, we expect to 
see an improvement in downregulation of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_337623]. 
Our prior studies (see C.1.3.3 ) suggest that the neuroimaging measures are more sensitive to 
change than the behavioral measures – the effect size of 5days of training on PI[INVESTIGATOR_337624] (d =0.73), while the effect on behavioral ratings of negative valence, though 
significant, was small (d=0.15). We did not see an increase in activity of the top-down control 
regions with training in the BPD, although after training the BPD’s maintained activity in these 
regions at baseline levels in contrast to HC’s whose activity decreased, possibly because of 
increased efficiency. Thus it is possible that, unlike HC’s, BPD’s do not have the ability to 
upregulate these regions, but rather bring about decreased PI[INVESTIGATOR_337625] “bottom-up” regulatory processes. These questions require further exploration.
The milestone to proceed to the R33 phase is based on a statistically significant 
difference between the experimental and the control conditions. Should all three doses be found 
to be significantly superior to the control condition, the dose that shows the largest effect size 
will be considered for the R33 phase. Among doses with similar or same effect size the one that 
requires the fewer number of weeks will be selected.  
C.2.3.  R33 Phase.  In this phase we will examine, in a new sample of BPD patients, the effect 
of the optimal treatment dose (R61) upon clinically relevant symptom measures of BPD. In 
addition, using the same techniques as in the R61 phase we will repeat assessment of the 
effect of treatment upon PI[INVESTIGATOR_337626], activation of the top-down control regions 
and behavioral measures of negative valence during reappraisal, (see C.2.5). This component 
of the R33 phase specifically addresses reproducibility as a priority in this research 
design. We will obtain subjective reports, using established measures (e.g. DERS and ERQ, 
see C.3.3), of the extent to which specific emotion regulation strategies, including reappraisal-
by-distancing, were used by [CONTACT_337669]. We will record 
drop-out rates and obtain subjective measures of treatment acceptability and relevance by [CONTACT_337670][INVESTIGATOR_337627]. To assess short-term durability of 
treatment, we will obtain re-assessment of the clinical measures one and four months after 
treatment completion. These R33 phase measures will enable us to assess the clinical 
effectiveness and feasibility of the treatment and to replicate the neural and behavioral effects 
Effective Date: 2/12/2025
End Date:5/27/[ADDRESS_417159] population. Finally, we will examine whether change in 
the targeted neural processes is correlated with clinical symptom change.  
C.2.4.   Overview of the Treatment and Control Conditions in the R61 and R33 phases 
The same treatment and control conditions will be used in both R61 and R33 phases, differing 
only in dose delivered. In the R61 phase, three doses – 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_417160] comparisons available in the single cohort 6-week staged-dosing model that we 
will use.  
The reappraisal-by-distancing treatment (described in section C.2.7.1 below) is an 
extension of the method developed by [CONTACT_337671] [51] and employed by [CONTACT_337672] [32, 52] and three R01 grant studies. Our group is experienced in these 
methods, having trained over 60 subjects in the distancing strategy. The treatment control 
condition will be Downregulate (CD), an alternative regulation strategy (see C.2.7.2), well-
matched to the experimental condition [22, 23]. Subjects in both conditions will practice an 
emotion regulation task: either reappraisal-by-distancing or the control task, while viewing 
emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_499] [ADDRESS_417161] hours with the trainer.  
Effective Date: 2/12/2025

experience with, having employed it in 
published work [47, 53] and over the last ten 
years in three R01 studies. It is modeled after 
that of [51]. Subjects will be asked to view 
affective pi[INVESTIGATOR_337628] 3 conditions: 1) look at 
neutral pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], 2) look at negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and 3) regulate reactions to negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. 
Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_337629] 10 seconds and preceded with an instruction (“Look” or 
“Regulate”), which will appear on the screen for 2 seconds. Subjects will be told that when they 
see the “Regulate” instruction, they should employ reappraisal-by-distancing (treatment group) 
or downregulate (active control group). The “Look” instruction will be paired with neutral and 
negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]; “Regulate” with negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_337630], since an instruction to emotionally 
down-regulate reactions to neutral pi[INVESTIGATOR_337631]. The order of the 
instruction/pi[INVESTIGATOR_337632]. Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_337633] a rating screen at 
which time subjects rate the valence of their reaction to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_337634] a 9-point scale (from -4 to 4) using an fMRI compatible slider. The rating screen 
will appear for 4 sec followed by [CONTACT_183001]-trial screen that will be present for a jittered 2 – 6 sec. 
There will be 40 trials for each of the 3 conditions for a total of 40 minutes, divided into 4 runs 
of 10 minutes each.  
Prior to the baseline imaging task scan, subjects are familiarized with the 2 instructional 
conditions by [CONTACT_194071], using standardized scripts for the treatment and control 
conditions.  Subjects in both conditions will be instructed that in the “Look” condition, they 
should simply look at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_337635]. For 
those in the CRD treatment group, training for the “Regulate” condition consists of two parts. 
First, the subjects will read a brief description of the distancing strategy.  The following 
description of the strategy in lay language is presented: “view the photos in a very neutral way, 
knowing that you are not personally involved, and/or imagine that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_337636] a long time ago. As you view each pi[INVESTIGATOR_337637], what is important is 
that you cut all personal ties to the event in a way that any negative emotional reaction is 
decreased as much as possible.” In our experience, BPD subjects readily understand the 
strategy explained in this way. Subjects will next practice distancing to a series of IAPS slides, 
not subsequently used in the scanning sessions. The experimenter will have the subject 
describe aloud how he/she implements distancing, slide-by-slide, and will assist the subject to 
shape effective strategies. The subject will next practice the distancing task in a block of 20 
trials presented outside the scanner on a laptop computer. The training for subjects in the 
downregulate (CD) control group will be the same, except that subjects will be instructed that 
when they see the “Regulate” prompt they should use whatever emotion regulation strategy 
works for them to reduce their negative feelings. As for the treatment group subjects, the 
researcher will shape their behavior in [ADDRESS_417163] from the images in any of the 
conditions.

C.2.6.  Distancing-Training and Downregulate Control Condition in R61 and R33 Phases 
 Training in distancing and in the suppression-control condition will be the same in both 
R61 and R33 phases, except that in the R33 phase only a single dose, the optimal dose 
(number of sessions) determined in the R61 phase will be employed.  
C.2.6.1.  Cognitive Reappraisal-by- Distancing (CRD) Training.  We present here a 
brief summary of Distancing Training, which is more fully described in our treatment manual 
(see Appendix). Training is carried out in two 45 minute sessions a week. In the initial session, 
the experimenter reviews the description of distancing (see C.2.6.) and explains that the training 
sessions are designed to help the subject become efficient in using emotion regulation-by-
distancing, emphasizing that it is an important skill to develop since it can be helpful in dealing 
with distressing situations in daily life. Subjects will then engage in an interactive distancing 
practice to [ADDRESS_417165], making suggestions (drawn from those in the treatment manual) 
to enhance the process, e.g. “Try looking at the scene from a neutral position, distancing as 
though you are a newspaper reporter collecting information for a story.” In each session, 
following this period of guided instruction, subjects intensively practice, by [CONTACT_45200] 40 negative 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_337639], distancing to 20 and carrying out the “look’ instruction to 20. This laptop 
practice is similar to imaging task described above (C.2.6.), except that it does not include the 
Look-Neutral condition.  In order to foster carryover of the developi[INVESTIGATOR_337640], subjects will be encouraged in each session to watch for emotional situations in their daily 
life where the distancing strategy might be useful. Ten to [ADDRESS_417166] training program is based upon the 
model that we employed to train 60 subjects in our prior R01 study, modified by [CONTACT_337673]-world situations component.  
 C.2.6.2  Control Downregulate (CD)  Condition.  We addressed a number of 
considerations to identify a control condition that would be credible and well-matched to the 
experimental condition, would be neutral in its neural and behavioral effects and would not be 
detrimental to subjects. We chose a condition in which subjects are told we will help them build 
upon their own natural way of downregulating negative feelings to disturbing situations by [CONTACT_337674], using negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], during a training period. See the control 
treatment manual (see Appendix) for fuller description.  While we appreciate that this control 
condition has the drawback of heterogeneity, the fact that it draws upon what our symptomatic 
subjects are already doing speaks the the neutrality of its effect. We will monitor the strategies 
subjects are actually using by [CONTACT_337675]. Our 
concern over the heterogeneity is also mitigated by [CONTACT_337676] 
“treatment-as-usual” control condition successfully. 
Like CRD training, CD training is carried out in two 45-minute sessions a week. It will involve 
viewing the same negative and neutral pi[INVESTIGATOR_337641] a laptop and comparable contact [CONTACT_337677] a trainer, as in the reappraisal training condition. Moreover, the fMRI task for 
the CD condition parallels that of the training condition, incorporating the same set of neutral 
and negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_337642]. In the first session, subjects are instructed that 
they will learn how to regulate negative emotions by [CONTACT_337678]. Each session will follow the same structure as the CRD training, with 
description of the CD strategy, practice and behavior shapi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] 5 negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], 
independent practice with 20 look-negative and 20 suppress-negative trials, and discussion of 
use of the technique in real world settings. 
Effective Date: 2/12/2025
End Date:5/27/[ADDRESS_417167]-Induction Stimuli.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_337643] (IAPS [55]) and the Nencki Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_337644] (NAPS;[56]), stimuli 
widely used in emotion research, which have normed valence and arousal ratings. The 
assignment of images to scan day (baseline, 2-,4-,or 6- weeks in R61 or baseline and endpoint 
in R33) and the assignment of negative images to the look or regulate conditions will be 
counterbalanced among subjects. 
C.3.2.   Choice of Regions of Interest for Imaging Analyses.  We will assess negative 
reactivity by [CONTACT_337679][INVESTIGATOR_337645] (PI[INVESTIGATOR_31166]) 
network. We selected this network because its activation has been demonstrated to be specific 
to and monotonically proportional to subjective reactions to the negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_337646]. Moreover, it has been shown to outperform the three ROI’s, the amygdala, insula 
and ACC, and seven whole brain networks, including the salience, default and somatomotor 
networks, commonly associated with negative affect [33]. Although PI[INVESTIGATOR_337647], we will also separately examine activity in each of the 
above specific ROI’s and in the salience, default and somatosensory networks. Although not 
primary outcome measures, we will also examine the effect of training upon the top-down 
control regions implicated in cognitive reappraisal that have been highlighted in the meta-
analysis by [CONTACT_337680]. al. [48]: the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the ventrolateral PFC 
(vlPFC), the posterior dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC).  
C.3.3   Outcome Measures.  R61: The primary outcome measure will be change in PI[INVESTIGATOR_337648]. Other outcome measures will be change in activity in the top-down control 
regions described above and in behavioral valence ratings of the image stimuli during 
reappraisal. R33: The primary outcome measure will be change in BPD symptomatology (total 
score in the Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline Personality, self-report (ZAN-BPD, [57])). 
Secondary outcome measures will be the ZAN_BPD sector scores, Affective Lability Scale total 
(ALS, [58], Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; [59]),Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale Scores 
(DERS; [41]), Beck Depression Scale score (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Scale Score (STAXI).  
C.3.4 Rationale for Eye Gaze and Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_337649]. Eye gaze direction will be 
assessed in both R61 and R33 phases to determine whether changes in BOLD activity during 
regulate conditions are associated with diversion of gaze [60] away from emotionally salient 
portions of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. Change in pupil diameter (regulate-look) will be recorded during each 
scan, as an index of cognitive effort [61].  
    C.4.[ADDRESS_417168] Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for R61 and R 33 Phases  
C.4.1.1  Inclusion Criteria. Male and female BPD subjects 18 to 55 years old meeting 
criteria for DSM-5 Borderline Personality Disorder and not meet criteria for Schizotypal 
personality disorder (SPD).  Subjects meeting criteria for a non-IV substance use disorder more 
than [ADDRESS_417169] PTSD 
will not be excluded unless they are currently experiencing symptoms. All subjects will be free of 
psychotropic medications for 2 weeks (6 weeks for fluoxetine) and will not be in current 
psychotherapy. We will monitor our recruitment rate every three months during the course of the 
R61 and R33 phases and should extrapolation of these rates suggest that we will not meet our 
recruitment goals we are prepared to liberalize the inclusion criteria to allow patients who are 
currently taking psychotropic medications or are in psychotherapy, so long as there has been no 
change in mediation or psychotherapy over the preceding two months. In this case, medication 
type and dosage and psychotherapy type and duration will be recorded and available for

subsequent analyses. Educational level will be recorded and will be available as a covariate in 
the analyses. Subjects will be medically healthy.  
C.4.1.2. Exclusion Criteria. Subjects will not meet criteria for Schizotypal Personality 
Disorder (SPD). SPD is excluded to avoid a possible confound from the restricted affect that 
characterizes SPD. BPD subjects will not meet DSM-[ADDRESS_417170] or present bipolar I 
disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, substance dependence, organic mental 
syndromes, head trauma, CNS neurological disease, or seizure disorder. Subjects currently 
meeting DSM-5 criteria for PTSD will be excluded, unless they are in remission or not currently 
experiencing symptoms. Subjects currently meeting criteria for major depressive disorder will 
also be excluded (except as described above). However, since depression is commonly 
associated with BPD (Koenigsberg et al., 1999), too stringent a depression exclusion criteria 
would yield a clinically atypi[INVESTIGATOR_337650]. For this reason, BPD patients with Axis I 
depressive disorders other than major depression and those with a past history of major 
depression, will not be excluded. Suicidal subjects will not be excluded, unless referral to a 
higher level of care is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_337681]. Subjects must not 
have met criteria for a substance use disorder for [ADDRESS_417171] a pacemaker, surgical 
clips, any metallic implants, or shrapnel fragments that would contraindicate MRI scanning. 
Pregnant women will be excluded.

C.4.2.3.   Assessments     All subjects receive the diagnostic, medical, self-report assessments 
and ratings indicated in Table 1. Assessors will be blind to training assignment. Research 
diagnoses (DSM-5) are made by [CONTACT_337684]-structured interviews, the SADS and SID-P,

instruments (Table 1). Subjects will receive a medical evaluation (see Table 1) and will be 
randomized (1:1) to CRD training or CD control conditions using a randomization scheme in 
random blocks of 2, [ADDRESS_417174] at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) 
([ADDRESS_417175] floor). This will include routine blood tests (complete blood count, 
metabolic and electrolyte panel, thyroid function tests, and a routine urinalysis. The urine drug 
screen will be administered in our office ([ADDRESS_417176]) on the day of your Medical 
Evaluation. On a separate day, subjects will carry out the baseline imaging task (see C.2.6). For 
R61 Phase: Within about [ADDRESS_417177]-
training or control CD training, which will continue for 6 weeks. At 2-, 4- and 6- weeks, subjects 
will receive an fMRI scan similar to the baseline scan (different image sets will be employed for 
each scan, counterbalanced for sequence among scans across subjects) and the assessment 
measures as indicated in Table 1. For R33 Phase: The procedures will be as in the R61 phase 
except that training will last for [ADDRESS_417178] session for follow-up (see Table 1). 
 C.4.3.2  Regulation-Training Procedures, Adherence Assessment and Refinement of 
the Treatment Manuals for both R61 and R33 Phases 
Regulation-training (for CRD and CD) will be carried out, guided by [CONTACT_337686] (see appendix for manuals). It will be carried out by a clinical psychologist, who will be 
instructed in the manualized treatments by [CONTACT_337687] (authors of the treatment manuals). All 
treatment sessions will be video and audio recorded. The treatment sessions will be done in 
person via the approved e-prime program, and remotely via the approved PowerPoint slides 
Teleconference supervision for the trainers will be available from HWK or BTD. To assess 
adherence, one random session will be recorded from 20% of the treatments for review by [CONTACT_337688] (see adherence rating scale in appendix to training manual) and additional supervision 
will be provided if low adherence (defined by [CONTACT_337689]) is identified. The 
Specific Aim R61-[ADDRESS_417179] about the importance of regular attendance and telephoning 
subjects after missed sessions to encourage attendance at the next session and to troubleshoot 
factors that might interfere with attendance. (See also section 2.5 Recruitment and Retention 
Plan)  
C.5.    Behavioral Data Analysis 
 C.5.1 R61 Phase.  Analyses for Aims R61-2a and R61-2b are described in image 
analysis (C.6.4, below). Aim R61-2c: Data will be checked for normality and appropriate 
transformations will be applied to normalize them. Data analysis will primarily use linear mixed 
models, incorporating fixed effects for Training Group (CRD and ES), Session, and Trial Type 
(Look Neutral, Look Negative, and Regulate Negative), and their interactions, as well as a 
random effect consisting of an intercept for each participant. We will examine additional models 
that incorporate and estimate random-effects slope variance across participants on the time 
effect (i.e., Session). Outcome variables will be repeated measures in self-reported negative 
affect and reappraisal success (defined as the Look Negative minus Regulate Negative 
behavioral valence rating at each Session). Although we do not anticipate large differences in

baseline characteristics between the groups, given that the trial is randomized, we will include 
variables that are strongly unbalanced at baseline (p< 0.01) as covariates in our models.  
     C.5.2 R33 Phase. Aim R33-1: The primary outcome measure is the Zanarini total score 
(ZTS;[57]). We compare the change in ZTS from baseline to end of treatment (EOT) between 
groups by [CONTACT_337690], time and their interaction as fixed effects. A similar 
analysis will be carried out for the additional outcome measures specified in C.3.3. (Table 1), 
using the Holm’s procedure for correction for multiple comparisons. Aim R33-2 : The analysis 
will be as for R61 Aims R61-2 a,b and c. Aim R33-3 : The analysis is described in imaging 
analysis section C.6.3. Aim R33-4: As above, we will use linear mixed models to examine 
change in ZTS as the outcome variable. Bonferroni corrections will be applied for multiple 
clinical outcome measures. P-values throughout will be 0.05, two tailed. All analyses will be 
conducted according to the intent-to-treat principle for both the R61 and the R33 phase. As a 
sensitivity analysis we will also consider models that adjust for the number of sessions actually 
received. Missing data will be assumed as MAR. Under this assumption, a mixed model 
approach that uses all available information will yield reasonable estimates of the effect sizes.   
   C.6.    Image Acquisition and Analysis 
   C.6.1  Image Acquisition. Participants will all be scanned 4 times in the R61 Phase 
(0, 2, 4, 6 weeks) or 2 times in the R33 Phase (Baseline, End-of-Treatment [EOT]) using the 
same 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra MRI system equipped with a 16-channel head coil. For each scan 
session, 4 series of 550 T2*-weighted images will be acquired during the 4 runs of the emotion 
regulation task using a multi-band echo-planar imaging sequence sensitive to the blood 
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal (multi-band factor = 7; repetition time = 1200 ms; 
echo time = 35 ms; flip angle = 60º; field of view = 228 mm2; matrix = 108 × 108; slice thickness 
= 2.1 mm; 70 slices). A high-resolution anatomical image will be acquired with a T1-weighted 
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence.
C.6.2  Image Preprocessing.  The 4 time series of T2*-weighted images acquired 
during the emotion regulation task at each time point will be separately motion corrected and co-
registered to the respective MP-RAGE image. Time series with more than 1 voxel of motion (≥ 
2.1 mm) or rotation (≥ 2.1°) will be discarded. Next, to optimize the images for cross-session 
contrasts of treatment effects, the week 2, week 4, and week 6 time series will be separately co-
registered to the week 0 series (R61) and the EOT time series will be co-registered to the 
baseline series (R33). The coregistered sets of time series will then be jointly normalized to the 
Montreal Neurological Institute template and smoothed with a 6-mm Gaussian kernel. C.6.[ADDRESS_417180]-Level Modeling of Individual Treatment Effects. General linear models (GLM) will be 
conducted individually for each participant to jointly fit the week 0, 2, 4, and 6 time series (R61) 
or the baseline and EOT time series (R33). Beta weights will be fit to regressors for the [ADDRESS_417181] (Look Neutral, Look Negative, and Regulate Negative) and [ADDRESS_417182] (Instruction, Rating), as well as 6 motion parameters [62], convolved with the 
hemodynamic response function [63]. Appropriate linear contrasts will be applied to the beta 
weights for Regulate Negative events minus Look Negative events in week 2, week 4, and week 
6 (all versus week 0) in the R61 phase and EOT versus baseline in the R33 phase. The 
resultant contrast maps represent the effects of treatment on whole-brain activation for emotion 
regulation. To estimate the effect of treatment specifically on PI[INVESTIGATOR_337626], the 
contrast maps will be scaled by [CONTACT_978][INVESTIGATOR_337651] (downloaded from 
Chang_PLoSBiology_PI[INVESTIGATOR_31166]) by [CONTACT_337691]-wise dot product of the two maps. The 
effect of treatment on neural activation in emotion-specific regions (e.g., amygdala) and top-
down control regions (e.g., dlPFC) will be modeled using the unweighted contrast maps together 
with masks derived from the “aal.002” atlas for automatic anatomic labeling [64] and the meta-
analysis conducted by [CONTACT_337680]. al. [48].

C.6.4  Second-Level Analysis of Group Differences in Treatment Effects. Random-
effects GLM will use two-sample t-tests to compare the neural effects of reappraisal-by-
distancing (CRD) and control training. The [ADDRESS_417183] maps (weeks 2, 4, 6) for each participant 
in the R61 phase and the EOT versus baseline contrast map for each participant in the R33 
phase will be entered as dependent variables in separate GLM in which gender, age, education 
level, and pre-treatment ALS score will serve as covariates. The speculative purpose of the 
R61/R33 mechanism justifies setting the alpha level at a relatively liberal value of p<0.[ADDRESS_417184] 
associated with improvement on clinical outcome variables for distancing training compared to 
the control condition. The 3 regressors will include: (1) % change in clinical outcome variable; 
(2) dichotomous treatment type variable; and (3) an interaction term (i.e., product), which 
identifies activation change related to differential response to the two treatments. The 
regressors will be centered on zero. 
C.7. Power Analyses:  
R61 Phase: The primary outcome measures are decreases from baseline in PI[INVESTIGATOR_337652] (vs. LOOK) conditions in CRD training vs. the CD condition at the 2-, 
4-, and 6-week treatment doses. A significant effect at any dose will meet milestone criteria. In 
our previous work (see C. 1.3.3 above), we obtained a strong effect size of d = 0.73 for 5 days 
of training. We will, however, power the current study at a more moderate power of d = .65 to 
increase our detection sensitivity. We can achieve this at α = 0.05 (two – tailed), power = 0.80 
with an n = 39 per group (G-Power 3.1). R33 Phase: The primary outcome measure for the R33 
is the effect of CRD-training upon BPD relevant symptoms, assessed by [CONTACT_337692] (see C.4.2.3). A meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials of psychotherapy for 
BPD reported an effect size of 0.56 for seven stand-alone trials employing BPD-relevant 
outcomes [65]. Powering to detect an effect size of 0.56 with a power of 0.80 at two-tailed α = 
0.05 requires 51 subjects per group.  
      C.8  Potential Study Complications and Alternative Outcomes 
R61 or R33:  Recruitment Shortfall: We will closely monitor the rate of subject recruitment. If the 
rate at the 3- or 6-month time points, extrapolated, suggests that the recruitment goals will not 
be met, we will implement the measures described in section 2.5 (Recruitment and Retention 
Plan), including, modifying exclusion criteria to allow entry of subjects currently on psychotropic 
medication and /or in psychotherapy, provided that dose or session frequency has not changed 
in the prior 2 months. Treatment will be recorded and entered as a covariate in analyses. R61: 
Alternative Outcomes: It is possible that, contrary to our hypothesis, CRD-, will not be superior 
to CD-training in reducing PI[INVESTIGATOR_337653]. While such a finding would not meet milestone 
criteria, this observation would motivate future research to further explore the active features of 
CD (as well as nonspecific factors) in the treatment of BPD. 
D. Resource Sharing Plan
Data obtained in this study will be shared via the National Database for Clinical Trials 
related to Mental Illness. Upon study enrollment the following information will be collected to 
permit generation of a GUID for each participant: sex, first name, last name, middle name, date 
of birth, and city/municipality of birth. Submission of descriptive/ raw data will be accomplished 
semi-annually and other data will be submitted upon publication or conclusion of the study. A 
Effective Date: 2/12/2025
End Date:5/27/[ADDRESS_417185] semiannually (January 15 and July 15) 
and will be checked for accuracy before submission and after submission. All other data will be 
provided at the time of publication or at the end of the grant, whichever comes first. We will 
share positive and negative results specific to the study cohorts. We will disseminate findings 
from this study via publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at national and 
international meetings. We will make our treatment manuals available to interested clinicians. In 
addition we will present our findings to lay borderline advocacy groups such as TARA and 
Emotions Matter, groups with which we currently have ongoing relationships.
E. Sources of Materials
Diagnostic and assessment information is obtained by [CONTACT_337693]. Medical 
assessment involves a history and physical examination of the subject as well as blood 
samples, urine samples, an EKG and a chest x-ray if indicated. Brain anatomic information is 
obtained by [CONTACT_337694]. 
Eye gaze and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_337654], (Milwaukee, WI) eye 
gaze fMRI compatible system. All of this material will be obtained specifically for research 
purposes.
F. Potential Risks
No short-term risks have been reported for MRI. Some people have claustrophobic 
reactions in the MRI scanners. An individual will be present to reassure the subject and aid in 
relaxing, but should the subject wish, the MRI scanning can be stopped immediately. Because 
of possible risks from metallic objects in the scanner magnetic field, subjects with surgical clips 
or metallic prostheses (such as artificial hip or knee), a pacemaker or any metal implants or 
shrapnel in the body, may not participate in the study. The effect of fMRI scanning upon the 
fetus has not been studied. Consequently pregnant women will not be permitted to participate in 
the study. There are no known risks associated with eye gaze measurement. Subjects may 
experience distress when viewing some negative-valence emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], but such distress 
is expected  to be transient. The negative-valence emotional pi[INVESTIGATOR_337655]. The blood drawing 
carried out as part of the medical screening has the small risk of bruising or infection at the site. 
The cognitive training programs of cognitive reappraisal-by-distancing (CRD) and the control 
downregulate condition (CD) are not expected to have adverse effects, however it is possible 
that subjects will become more upset or experience exacerbations of symptoms, or 
inappropriate apply regulation strategies during the course of the treatment. Training sessions 
will be video and audio recorded. There is the risk of embarrassment if there is a breach of 
confidentiality with respect to personal information included in study assessments or the video 
recordings of training sessions. All of the above are research risks, as these procedures are not 
part of treatment.

interest in participating and after the study has been explained to the subject by [CONTACT_3021]. 
Consents will be obtained at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai or the James J Peters 
VA Medical Center in a private office setting by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a delegate approved 
by [CONTACT_337696]/or JJPVA IRBs. After the protocol is described to the subject and the 
subject’s questions are answered, the subject will be asked to summarize the procedures that 
he/she will undergo and to describe 2 risks involved in the study to confirm understanding. A

subjects are cognitively intact and have no impairment in reality testing, however, if there is any 
doubt about a BPD subject’s capacity to give consent, a psychiatrist independent of the study 
will assess the subject to determine whether they understand the study and can give informed 
consent.
F.1.[ADDRESS_417188] a claustrophobic reaction in the scanner, a 
member of the research team will be available to reassure them and aid them in relaxing. 
Subjects will be informed that the scanning will be stopped immediately should they wish it. 
Subjects are prescreened at two points in time – when they sign the informed consent and 
again just prior to scanning – to insure they have no metallic implants. Women will receive a 
pregnancy test to exclude subjects who are pregnant.  Trained technicians will draw blood, 
using sterile technique to minimize risk of bruising or infection the structural MRI scans of all 
subjects will be routinely reviewed by a neuroradiologist at the Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337656]. If indicated, we will refer 
them for medical or neurological follow-up. 
A number of protections are implemented to minimize psychological risks. At the time of 
initial rating, subjects will be routinely screened for suicidal ideation, employing the Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). If present, the subject will be assessed by a research 
psychiatrist or clinical psychologist and, as clinically indicated, will be referred for treatment or 
emergent evaluation and treatment. If there is no clinical indication for emergent treatment or 
referral, subjects with suicidal ideation will not be excluded . Subjects will also be provided with a 
24-hour emergency phone number to contact [CONTACT_337699]. The CRD and CD training will be carried out by a clinical 
psychologist and procedures for handling any emergent crises are incorporated in the treatment 
manuals. These include reassessment with the Columbia Suicide Rating Scale, consultation 
with a study psychiatrist, referral for additional treatment, or for emergency evaluation. To 
minimize adverse reactions to the images employed in the study, subjects will be informed of 
the general nature of the negative pi[INVESTIGATOR_337657]. An individual will be present to provide 
reassurance for subjects who find any pi[INVESTIGATOR_337658]. 
Serious adverse events and any harm to a subject that is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], unexpected and at least probably related to the research procedures will be 
reported to the Mount Sinai and James J Peters VA Medical Center IRB’s within 5 days and 
other adverse events as required by [CONTACT_1201]’s. All adverse events will be reported to study Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB, see below) and to the NIH in the annual progress report. The

The following procedures will be employed to protect confidentiality: Data, including session 
recordings, will be stored in locked cabinets and password-protected computer files. No 
published reports will identify any subject individually. Each subject will be assigned a coded 
identifier that will be used to associate stored data with each subject. Subjects’ names will be 
entered initially on the telephone screening forms when subjects inquire about the study. These 
names will then be removed from the forms and replaced with a coded identifier. Subsequent 
questionnaires and forms will not have identifiers that can be linked to the subject other than the 
coded identifier. Diagnostic interviewers will only enter coded identifiers on their notes and 
forms. The only forms that will contain the subjects names and identifying information will be the 
consent forms which will be stored separately in a locked file and in the research chart (if the 
patient has a medical chart at Mount Sinai or the James J Peters VA Medical Center a copy will 
also be placed in that chart), and the medical screening examination and medical lab tests

which will be stored separately in a locked file in the research office and in the Clinical Research 
Center (CRC). The list associating subject’s names with coded identifiers will be maintained 
separately from the data and in a locked file. 
F.1.3 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others 
By [CONTACT_337700], this study can provide proof of 
concept that reappraisal-by-distancing training can help BPD patients better regulate their 
emotions. This would provide a neurobiological rationale for the use of cognitive distancing 
training as a novel approach in the psychotherapy of BPD. In providing information directly 
relevant to psychotherapeutic practice, this study may enhance the treatment of BPD, a 
prevalent and difficult to treat disorder. The research will not be of immediate benefit to the 
participants (apart from the benefits of thorough psychiatric and medical evaluations). Since 
risks involved in this study are small, and the potential benefit in the treatment BPD is 
substantial, the benefit to risk ratio is favorable.
F.1.[ADDRESS_417189] (DSMB), which will consist of [ADDRESS_417190], should urgent safety concerns 
arise. 
Data quality and security will be monitored on a continuous basis by [CONTACT_337701]. Interim reviews of the imaging and physiological data will be 
conducted quarterly to insure data integrity. **Any data collected remotely will be through 
HIPAA-Compliant Zoom accounts to ensure the protection of participants personal information** 
G. Dissemination Plan for both the R61 and R33 Phase
This study will be registered under ClinicalTrials.gov as outlined in the NIMH policy.
Results information will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov following the timelines of the policy. 
Results from the study will also be disseminated via presentation at national meetings and 
submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The informed consent for this study will 
include a specific statement indicating posting of clinical trial information at ClinicalTrials.gov.
The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has an internal policy in place to insure clinical 
trials registration and results reporting are in compliance with policy requirements.

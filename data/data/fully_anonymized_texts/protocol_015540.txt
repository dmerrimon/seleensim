After a 2-week run-in period, subjects will be randomized to one of the [ADDRESS_876952] and a total of 5 clinic visits 
will be performed during the study (see the flow chart below)
A pre-screening visit (Visit 0) will be carried out in order to fully 
explain the study to potential eligible subjects, to obtain their written 
informed consent and to instruct them on screening visit procedures 
(such as medication restrictions).
A screening visit (Visit 1) not more than 7 days after Visit 0 will help 
establish the eligibility of subjects for inclusion in the study (including 
routine hematology and blood chemistry, vital signs, medical history, 
weight and height, smoking status, serum and urine pregnancy tests for 
women of childbearing potential, physical examination, 12-lead ECG, 
CAT (COPD Assessment Test) and BDI assessment, spi[INVESTIGATOR_653535] & post-BD, and training on the use of inhalers). Concomitant 
Medication and Adverse Events will be assessed. Dispensing of 
subject’s diary will be done.

Dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (QVAR® Inhalation Aerosol 80µg/actuation) and this 
treatment regimen should remain stable for the entire run-in period and 
the remainder of the study. Subjects will receive rescue medication 
(albuterol HFA 90µg/actuation) for the treatment or prevention of 
bronchospasm, with instructions for “on demand” (prn) use for the 
entire study period.  
At randomization visit (Visit 2), inclusion/exclusion criteria, adverse 
events and concomitant medications will be reviewed. Eligibility 
recheck will be completed. Smoking status will be checked,  urine 
pregnancy test will be collected if appropriate for women of 
childbearing potential.  24-hour digital ECG Holter device, that would 
have been placed the day before the visit, will be kept on. Training on 
the use of inhalers will be conducted.  Pre-dose vital signs, 12-lead 
ECG, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333] [FEV 1, FVC, IC (slow vital capacity 
maneuver)] will be performed. The BDI and CAT questionnaires will 
be assessed. Subject’s e-diary will be checked for daily data 
transmission. Eligible subjects will then be randomized to one of the 
treatment groups and will receive the 1st dose of study drug under 
medical supervision. The subjects will then undergo a 12-hour post-
dose serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_653536] 24-hour digital ECG Holter 
Monitoring. Lung function (FEV 1, FVC) will be evaluated and 
recorded at the following time points: T-[ADDRESS_876954] dose of study drug.  Vital signs 
(SBP, DBP) will also be assessed before and at [ADDRESS_876955] the clinical center and will be 
instructed to return the next day to remove the Holter monitor leads 
(24h post 1st [morning] dose of study drug), and in 3 weeks’ time for 
Visit 3. Study drug will be dispensed. Subject e- diary will be re-
dispensed.
At Week 3 (Visit 3), subjects will undergo pre-dose vital signs 
assessment and 12-lead ECG. Pre-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333] (trough 
FEV 1, FVC, IC) will be performed and TDI will be assessed. Smoking 
status, concomitant medication, urine pregnancy test for women of 
childbearing potential and adverse events will be assessed. Study drug 
will be returned and accountability will be performed. Study drug will 
be dispensed. Subject’s e-diary will be checked for daily data 
transmission. The subject will be instructed to return to the clinical 
center in 3 weeks’ time.
At Week 6 (Visit 4), subjects will come to the clinical center and will 
have the 24-hour digital ECG Holter device, which would have been 
placed the day before the visit, collected.  Physical examination, 
smoking status, concomitant medications, adverse events, serum 
pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential.  
Routine hematology and blood chemistry will be performed, as well as 
pre-dose TDI questionnaire, vital signs, 12-lead ECG and spi[INVESTIGATOR_252855] [FEV 1, FVC, IC]. The subject will receive the last dose of study

(FEV 1, FVC) will be evaluated and recorded at the following time 
points: 15, 30, 45 min and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11.5 and 12h after study 
drug intake. Vital Signs  (DBP/SBP) will be measured at [ADDRESS_876957]’s e-diary will be returned and checked for daily 
data transmission. After the last, a follow-up phone call will be 
scheduled with the subject.
A safety follow-up phone call (Visit 5) will be performed by [CONTACT_96882] 1 week after the final visit 
(Visit 4) or Early Termination Visit to check the status of unresolved 
AEs and to record any new AEs that may have occurred after Visit 4, as 
well as related concomitant medications.

A total of 594 evaluable subjects (99 per group) will provide 80% power to 
detect a mean difference of 120 mL between each dose of CHF 5259 pMDI 
and placebo at a two-sided significance level of 0.0125 (since 4 dose levels 
will be tested, the Bonferroni adjustment has been taken into account: 
0.0125 = 0.05/4), assuming a standard deviation of 250 mL.
Since four dose levels will be tested, the Edwards and Berry method will be 
used to control the family-wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 (two-sided) 
level. In the sample size calculation, the Bonferroni adjustment of the

ensure the required power for each test, since the Edwards and Berry 
method is uniformly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 702 
subjects (117 per group) will be randomized.
Statistical methods Primary efficacy variable
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_653592] a linear mixed model for repeated measurements including 
treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], US regions and smoking 
status at screening as fixed effects, and the baseline value (average of the 
pre-dose FEV 1 measurements on Day 1) and baseline by [CONTACT_653593]. An unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed. 
The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference 
between treatments and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) will be 
estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. The CIs and the p-values of the comparisons 
between each dose of CHF 5259 pMDI and placebo at Week 6 will be 
adjusted for multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the parametric 
simulation method by [CONTACT_96886]. At each dose level, the 
superiority of CHF 5259 pMDI will be demonstrated by a statistically 
significant difference (adjusted p-value < 0.05) favouring CHF 5259 pMDI.
All the other comparisons between treatments will be performed as 
secondary efficacy analyses with no multiplicity adjustment.
Secondary efficacy variables
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed in the secondary efficacy 
analyses.
For change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_96877]

TDI response at Week 3 and Week 6 will be analyzed using a logistic 
regression model including treatment, US regions and smoking status 
at screening as fixed effects and baseline (BDI [Baseline Dyspnea 
Index] focal score assessed on Day 1) as a covariate.
Change from baseline to each inter-visit period in percentage of rescue 
medication-free days, in average use of rescue medication and in 
average E-RS total score and domain scores will be analyzed using a 
similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy analysis. The 
inter-visit period will be considered instead of visit in the model. 
Comparison between treatments over the entire treatment period will 
also be derived from this model.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 22/821. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND STUDY RATIONALE
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) currently ranks as the 4th leading cause of 
death in the world, and is expected to be in 3rd place by 2020.[1] COPD is both a preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_96896][INVESTIGATOR_96807]/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by [CONTACT_96897] (e.g. cigarette smoke, biodiesel fumes).  A mixture of lung abnormalities are 
characteristic of COPD, including small airway and parenchymal disease (obstructive bronchiolitis; 
emphysema), with variable contributions in any given subject.[2]
The NHANES III national survey estimated the U.S. prevalence of COPD to be 10.2% to 20.9% 
based on whether pre- or post-bronchodilator values were used and which diagnostic criterion 
(fixed ratio or lower limit of normal {LLN}) was applied.[3] COPD most often occurs in people [ADDRESS_876969] a history of smoking (current or former smokers). While not 
everybody who smokes gets COPD, approximately 80-90% of the individuals who have COPD 
have smoked. [4]
Smoking cessation can have the greatest influence on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96808], as well as 
increasing survival and reducing morbidity.[5]  However, long-term quit success rate rarely exceed 
25%. [2][6]
Existing pharmacologic therapy is used to improve airflow, symptoms, exercise capacity, health 
status, and reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations in stable COPD. To date, there is no 
conclusive evidence that any available pharmacotherapy for COPD modifies the long-term decline 
in lung function.  The main stay of pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_96809], and consist of the following:
Short acting or long-acting bronchodilators (SABD; LABD):
oShort acting and long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (SABA; LABA) improve 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_96810] [ADDRESS_876970] smooth muscle tone, and 
tend to reduce dynamic hyperinflation (Residual Lung Volume) at rest and during 
exercise, and improve exercise performance.
Adverse events include sinus tachycardia, rhythm disturbances, and 
hypokalemia. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96811], no association 
between the use of this class and loss of lung function and increased 
mortality has been reported in COPD.[7][8][9] 
oShort-acting and long-acting antimuscarinics (SAMA; LAMA). These drugs act 
mainly by [CONTACT_96898] M3. Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_96812] a LAMA that has been shown to improve 
lung function, symptoms, health status,[10] effectiveness of pulmonary 
rehabilitation,[11][12] and to reduce exacerbations and related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602][13] 
compared to placebo. Studies have shown that the effect of glycopyrronium, another 
LAMA, versus placebo is similar to that of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_653543], as well as improving lung function, exercise tolerance, and 
health status in subjects with COPD. [14][15][16][17] 
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 23/82Adverse events of this class of medications are mainly due to their 
anticholinergic activities, and include dry mouth, constipation, urinary 
retention and increased intraocular pressure.
An unexpected small increase in cardiovascular (CV) events in subjects with 
COPD regularly treated with ATROVENT® (ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893]) has been 
reported.[18][19]
A large, 4-yr long clinical trial in subjects with COPD treated with 
SPI[INVESTIGATOR_381055]® HANDIHALER® (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]) added to other standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_653544].[20]
oCombination Bronchodilators: Combining bronchodilators using a LABA and a 
LAMA increases FEV 1, albeit not to the full additive effect of each individual 
component; improves PROs and reduces exacerbations vs monotherapy.  One study 
(FLAME trial) in subjects with post-BD FEV 1 ≥25% and < 60% predicted, an 
mMRC score of ≥2, and a history of ≥1 exacerbation reported an 11% further 
reduction in COPD exacerbations with fixed combination of once daily indacaterol 
110µg + glycopyrronium 50µg (LABA+LAMA) compared to fixed combination 
twice daily fluticasone propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 500µg + salmeterol 50µg (ICS+LABA).[21] 
Combining a SABA and a SAMA or a LABA and LAMA can be done using 
separate inhalers or using a single inhaler containing a fixed dose combination.  
Anti-inflammatory agents
oInhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) alone: The available evidence does not support a 
beneficial effect of ICS monotherapy in subjects with COPD.[22]
oICS in combination with LABD: Most studies in subjects with mod-severe COPD 
and history of exacerbations found a beneficial effect of ICS+LABA fixed dose 
combination over either component alone in improving lung function, health status, 
and in reducing exacerbations.  Studies that evaluated withdrawal of ICS have 
yielded equivocal results.
High quality evidence has confirmed an increased rate of pneumonia, oral 
candidiasis, hoarseness and skin bruising with ICS 
treatment.[23][24][25][26][27]  Factors associated with a higher risk for 
pneumonia on ICS include: current smokers, age ≥ [ADDRESS_876971] a history of 
prior exacerbation or pneumonia, a BMI < 25 kg/m2, a poor MRC dyspnea 
grade, and/or severe airflow limitation.[28][29] A meta-analysis suggested 
that subjects with COPD with lower blood eosinophil counts (<2%) had more 
pneumonia events than did those with higher counts.[30]
RCTs have reported variable outcomes regarding ICS effect on decreased 
bone mineral density (BMD) [31][32]  and risk of fractures,[33] and 
observational studies suggest an increased risk of diabetes / poorly controlled 
diabetes,[34] cataracts,[35][36] and mycobacterial infections, including 
tuberculosis. [37]
Triple Combination of ICS+LABA+LAMA: Available evidence from RCTs suggests that 
adding a LAMA to an ICS+LABA (or vice-versa) further improves lung function, PROs and 
reduces exacerbations risk. [38][39][40][41][42][43] This step-up therapy can be achieved 
using various available approaches and products. More studies with this combination are 
needed to understand the benefits and risks and the target population.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 24/82Chiesi Farmaceutici has patented MODULITE®, a technology for the development of pMDI as 
HFA solution formulations.  It  currently markets FOSTER®, a fixed dose combination of an 
ICS/LABA (beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] 100µg / formoterol fumarate 6µg) for the maintenance 
treatment of asthma (1-2 inhalations bid, and 1 inhalation prn, not to exceed 8 inhalations/day) and 
COPD (2 inhalations bid) in subjects [ADDRESS_876972] was launched in [LOCATION_013] in 
2006 and is currently available in 35 countries worldwide including Russia and China, but not the 
US.  FOSTER® is dispensed as a Pressurized Inhalation Solution (pMDI, Modulite®) and as a dry 
powder for inhalation (DPI) by [CONTACT_96903]® device, releasing extra-fine particles.[44] 
FOSTER® pMDI has been developed with a high “extrafine” (< 1.1µm) BDP particle size fraction, 
similarly to another HFA BDP marketed formulation (QVAR® Inhalation Aerosol, Teva 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], LLC).
Chiesi Farmaceutici is also developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fixed dose triple combination of an ICS/LABA/LAMA 
(CHF 5993) with beclomethasone dipropi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (BDP) + formoterol fumarate (FF) + 
glycopyrronium bromide (GB), and on Sep 29, [ADDRESS_876973] to the European Medicine 
Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of COPD.  The product is administered using a single 
pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI), specifically formulated to deliver extra-fine particles 
efficiently reaching both central and peripheral airways.
The submission of the EMEA dossier is based on the results of a large and comprehensive 
development program performed by [CONTACT_96904] 2009, which included 12 clinical studies involving 
more than 8,000 subjects. [45]
As part of the US development program of this fixed dose triple combination for COPD, a full 
characterization of the individual components (BDP, FF, GB) using the same inhaler device is 
required, including clinical dose-ranging studies at multiple doses, and using appropriate 
comparators for benchmarking purposes.  An inhaled formulation of GB delivered via 
hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) using the Modulite® technology 
has been developed  by [CONTACT_653601]-ranging trial.
Previously, HFA GB pMDI (CHF 5259) has been assessed as a single dose at 12.5 – 200µg/day, 
and in a multiple dose study over 1 week at 25 – 100µg/day, compared to placebo, in subjects with 
COPD.[46] This will be a longer (6-week), multi-dose, placebo and active-controlled dose-ranging 
trial, conducted in subjects with COPD, to satisfy US FDA’s recommendations for dose-finding. 
Since SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® (glycopyrrolate) inhalation powder [47] has not yet been marketed 
in the US at the time of the development of this protocol, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_381055]® HANDIHALER® (tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_653545]) 18µg once daily was  chosen as the active comparator in this study, 
considering its well characterized efficacy and safety profile.[48] 
Glycopyrronium Bromide (Glycopyrrolate):
Description and Mechanism of Action:
Glycopyrronium bromide (GB), also known as glycopyrrolate,  is a synthetic quaternary ammonium 
compound that acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.  It has similar 
affinity to the subtypes of muscarinic receptors M1 to M5. In the airways, glycopyrrolate exhibits 
pharmacological effects through inhibition of M3 receptor at the smooth muscle leading to 
bronchodilation. [47] The medication, which is the active moiety, is also known as 
glycopyrronium.[49]

the long-term, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in subjects with COPD.  Each capsule 
contains 15.6µg of glycopyrronium bromide (glycopyrrolate) inhalation powder. Each delivered 
dose (under standardized in vitro testing at a fixed flow rate of 90 L/min for 1.3 seconds) contains 
13.1 µg of glycopyrronium bromide equivalent to 12.5µg of glycopyrronium (ex-mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]).[47]
Dose selection for SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® in COPD was supported by a 28-day, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-period, crossover study evaluating 7 doses of glycopyrrolate 
(15.6µg, 31.2µg, 62.4µg, and 124.8µg once-daily and 15.6µg, 31.2µg, and 62.4µg twice-daily) or 
placebo in 388 subjects with COPD.  The dose-ranging results supported the evaluation of 
glycopyrrolate 15.6µg twice-daily in the confirmatory COPD trials for US registration.[50] Two 
replicate phase III, 12-week, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials 
(GEM1; n=441 and GEM2; n=432) subsequently evaluated and confirmed the efficacy of 
SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® 15.6µg bid in subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD (30% ≤ predicted 
FEV 1 > 80%). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h following the 
morning dose at Day 85 compared with placebo. In both trials, SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® 
demonstrated a larger increase in mean change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h compared to 
placebo.[51][52] The mean peak FEV 1 (maximum FEV 1 recorded within 4 hours after the morning 
dose) improvement from baseline for SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® compared with placebo at Day 1 
and at Day 85 ranged between 0.137L and 0.163L.  Subjects treated with SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® 
used less daily rescue albuterol during both trials compared to subjects treated with placebo, and the 
responder rate to the St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ), defined as an improvement 
in score of 4 or more as threshold, ranged between 49%-55% in the SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® 
treatment arm compared to 41%-42% for placebo.
CHF 5259 pMDI – TRIPLE 9 (TRIGON) study: A phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way cross-over study evaluated the efficacy and safety of HFA GB 
pMDI (CHF 5259), 12.5µg/inhalation (2 inhalations bid, TDD = 50µg) given for 4 weeks in 100 
symptomatic subjects (BDI focal score ≤10) with moderate-very severe COPD (post-BD FEV1 < 
60% predicted).  Subjects were allowed to continue on an ICS (switched to an equivalent dose of 
QVAR®) if they were receiving it at baseline.[53] HFA GB pMDI was superior to placebo in terms 
of change from baseline in pre-dose (trough) morning FEV 1 on Day 28 (primary efficacy variable)  
with a difference in adjusted means (95% CI) between treatments of 0.088L (0.039L; 0.137L) 
(p<0.001), and in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_653602] 28 (key secondary efficacy variable) 
with a difference in adjusted means between treatments of 0.121L (95% CI: 0.079L - 0.162L; p<0.001). 
Superiority was also demonstrated for other lung function parameters (FVC, IC) and clinical 
outcome measures (TDI, SGRQ, rescue medication use). 
Clinical Safety of glycopyrronium bromide:
SEEBRI™ NEOHALER®: The safety database included 3415 subjects with COPD in four 12-week 
lung function trials and one 52-week long-term safety study.[51][52][54][55] A total of 1202 
subjects received treatment with SEEBRI NEOHALER 15.6µg bid.
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 26/82In the two 12-week trials with SEEBRI™ NEOHALER®, the most common adverse reactions 
(incidence ≥ 2% and higher than placebo) were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_653546].  The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions 
was 2.4% for the SEEBRI™ NEOHALER®-treated subjects and 3.8% for placebo-treated subjects. 
Other adverse reactions occurring more frequently with SEEBRI™ NEOHALER® than with 
placebo, but with an incidence < 1% include rash, pruritus, gastroenteritis, hypersensitivity, atrial 
fibrillation, insomnia, pain in extremity, dysuria, vomiting, productive cough, and diabetes 
mellitus/hyperglycemia.
In the 52-week long safety trial comparing glycopyrrolate 15.2µg bid to indacaterol 27.5µg qd, 
(GEM3; n=507) adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in the 12-week long 
placebo-controlled trials. Additional adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≥ 2% in the 
group receiving glycopyrrolate that exceeded the frequency seen in the indacaterol 75µg treatment 
arm were: diarrhea, nausea, upper abdominal pain, fatigue, bronchitis, pneumonia, rhinitis, back 
pain, arthralgia, dyspnea, and wheezing.[55]
Additional adverse reactions that have been identified during worldwide post-approval use of 
glycopyrrolate, the active ingredient in SEEBRI™ NEOHALER®, at higher than the recommended 
dose are angioedema and paradoxical bronchospasm. [47]
CHF 5259 pMDI – TRIPLE 9 (TRIGON) study:[53] Overall, no safety concerns were raised with 
GB compared to placebo in the clinical trial described above. Twenty (20.6%) patients experiencing 
25 TEAEs during treatment with CHF 5259 pMDI and 17 (17.7%) patients experiencing 21 TEAEs 
during treatment with placebo. Six TEAEs led to study treatment discontinuation: 4 (4.1%) patients 
due to 4 TEAEs (2 TEAEs of COPD exacerbation, 1 TEAE of bronchial carcinoma and 1 TEAE of 
death) during treatment with CHF 5259 pMDI and 2 (2.1%) patients due to 2 TEAEs of COPD 
exacerbation during treatment with placebo. No clinically significant ECG abnormalities were 
found. 
Like other antimuscarinic agents, glycopyrrolate should be used with caution in subjects with 
narrow-angle glaucoma and in subjects with urinary retention as it may exacerbate these 
conditions. [56]
More detailed description of the efficacy and safety data available with CHF 5259 pMDI can be 
found in section 6.2.1 and in the Investigator’s Brochure.
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and 
amendments), ICH E6 Good Clinical Practices and all other applicable laws and regulations.

Chiesi has patented MODULITE®, a technology for the development of pMDI as HFA solution 
formulations. Since the non-CFC propellant Norflurane (HFA-134a) has poor solvency properties, 
ethanol has been included in the formulation to enhance the solubility of the active ingredients (co-
solvent). Hydrochloric acid has been added as pH adjuster for the stabilisation of the formulation.

An inhaled formulation of glycopyrronium bromide delivered via hydrofluoroalkane (HFA-134a) 
pressurized metered dose inhaler (CHF 5259 pMDI) under development by [CONTACT_653606]-ranging study.  This formulation uses the Modulite® technology 
and contains the same excipi[INVESTIGATOR_653551]® (fixed combination ICS+LABA available in EU).  
The rationale of dose selection in this study is based on the following completed clinical trials and 
discussions with FDA. 
GLYCO study - Part 1 and 2 [46]: HFA GB pMDI (CHF 5259) was assessed as a single dose (Part 
1) at 12.5, 25, 50, 100 and 200µg/day, and using repeated dosing over 1 week (Part 2) at 12.5, 25 
and 50µg bid compared to placebo in 24 and 38 subjects with COPD, respectively. 
In the single dose study, the highest mean FEV [ADDRESS_876988] 
frequently reported TEAE was headache. Two subjects were withdrawn from the study due 
to TEAEs: atrial fibrillation following inhalation of placebo and ventricular extrasystoles

Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 35/82following treatment with 50μg CHF 5259 pMDI.  Overall, all doses of GB were safe and 
well tolerated.
In the 1-week treatment study, all doses tested demonstrated superiority over placebo (one-
sided p <0.001, adjusted for multiplicity) in the primary endpoint of trough FEV [ADDRESS_876989]-dose on Day 7.  This difference was clinically significant with the GB 50 and 
100µg/day doses (≥ 120mL). Between-dose comparisons revealed statistically significant (p 
≤ 0.037)  differences in favor of the GB 50 vs the 25µg/day dose on peak and trough FEV 1 
on Days 7 and 8; in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h on Day 8, in sGAW AUC 0-12h and VC AUC 0-12h on Day 
7.  No statistically significant differences were observed between the GB 50 and 100µg/day 
doses in derived lung function and body plethysmography parameters. Sixteen (44.4%), 12 
(35.3%), and 15 (39.5%) subjects had at least one TEAE during treatment with 25, 50, and 
100µg/d CHF 5259 pMDI, respectively. Fifteen (42.9%) subjects had at least one TEAE 
during placebo inhalation and 12 (35.3%) subjects had at least one TEAE during treatment 
with tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]. TEAEs that were reported in more than [ADDRESS_876990] mean QTcF increase was observed at time 
point 8 h after 50µg bid of CHF 5259 (6.3ms). At Day 7, at [ADDRESS_876991] mean QTcF increase was observed at time point 3 h after 50µg bid of CHF 
5259 (7.9 ms).
TRIPLE 3 study [57]: This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, active controlled, 4-way cross-
over, multi-dose study evaluated the efficacy of 3 doses of GB-HFA pMDI 12.5µg (1 inhalation 
bid) , 25µg (1 inhalation bid) and 25µg (2 inhalations bid) added to FOSTER® (BDP+FF 100/6µg, 
2 inhalations bid), compared to FOSTER® alone, in 178 patients with COPD and 30% ≤FEV 1 ,60% 
and ≥[ADDRESS_876992]-BD (ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], 84µg) partial reversibility. Treatments were for 1 week, 
separated by 1 week washout period. On the primary endpoint of FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by 
[CONTACT_653602] 7,  the addition of HFA GB pMDI at daily doses of 50 and 100µg for 7 days resulted in 
both a statistically (p<0.001) and clinically significant lung function improvement of 100 and 
112mL respectively over FOSTER® alone.  The magnitude of improvement with the 25µg/d dose 
was statistically significant at 87 mL (p<0.001). The difference was statistically significant between 
the 100µg vs. 25µg/d doses, but not between the 50 and 100µg/d doses.  In general, there were no 
significant advantages with the 100µg over the 50µg daily dose. Overall, TEAEs and TEADRs 
were reported less frequently during treatment with any FOSTER® + GB combination than in 
FOSTER® alone. SAEs were reported in 3 patients receiving FOSTER® + GB combination (abscess 
intestinal on FOSTER® + GB 25µg/d; Bladder transitional cell carcinoma stage II on FOSTER® + 
GB 50µg/d; and enteritis infectious and acute prerenal failure on FOSTER® + GB 100µg/d.  No 
deaths were reported during the study.
CARSAF study[58]: provided supportive evidence in [ADDRESS_876993] 
when added to FOSTER® (BDP/FF 100/6µg 2 inhalations bid)
TRIPLE 9 (TRIGON study)[53]:  The efficacy and safety of 4-week treatment with HFA GB 
pMDI (CHF 5259) 12.5µg/actuation  (2 inhalations bid) was investigated in a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way cross-over study in 100 symptomatic subjects with COPD (post-
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 36/82BD FEV1 < 60% predicted, BDI focal score ≤10). HFA GB pMDI was superior to placebo in terms 
of change from baseline in pre-dose (trough) morning FEV1 on Day 28 (primary efficacy variable), 
and in FEV1 AUC0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_653602] 28 (key secondary efficacy variable) ; and in 
other lung functions (FVC, IC) and clinical outcome measures (TDI, SGRQ, rescue medication 
use). No active control was included in this study.  Overall, no safety concerns were raised with GB 
compared to placebo.
These studies supported the conclusion that HFA GB pMDI 50µg/day is the optimal dose to 
incorporate into the fixed triple inhaler combination program (CHF 5993) that was conducted and 
filed in Europe. 
 
Following consultation with the US FDA, this planned study will be a longer (6-week), multidose, 
placebo and active-controlled dose-ranging trial, conducted in subjects with COPD, to satisfy US 
FDA’s recommendations for dose-finding. The study will test 4 doses of CHF 5259 pMDI (6.25, 
12.5, 25 and 50µg twice daily) vs placebo and an active comparator SPI[INVESTIGATOR_381055]® HANDIHALER® 
(tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1893] 18µg once daily) in adult subjects with moderate COPD.  The chosen doses of 
glycopyrrolate in CHF 5259 are in close proximity to the doses tested in the US FDA-approved  
SEEBRI® NEOHALER® inhalation powder development program (15.6µg, 31.2µg, and 62.4µg 
glycopyrrolate bid; [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Corp. East Hanover, NJ),[50] and to the doses tested 
in a single-dose as part of an on-going investigational program using a co-suspension formulation 
delivered via pMDI (14.4, 28.8, 57.6, and 115.2μg of glycopyrronium, ex-actuator; Pearl 
Therapeutics, Inc).[59]

7.2 Investigations (by [CONTACT_653600]):
7.2.1 BDI Questionnaire
The Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI)[61] is a validated, interviewer-administered rating of severity of 
dyspnea. It provides a multidimensional measurement of dyspnea that evokes dyspnea in activities 
of daily living, in symptomatic individuals during the last 2 weeks. The BDI consists of 24 items 
divided into 3 domains: Functional Impairment, Magnitude of Task, and Magnitude of Effort.  Each 
category is rated on a 5-point scale from 0 (very severe) to 4 (no impairment), with a total score 
ranging from 0-12. 
The same investigator or designee will interview the subject for the BDI and TDI during the study 
period. BDI will be assessed at V1 and the morning of V2. 
7.2.2 TDI Questionnaire
The Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) is a validated,[62] interviewer-administered questionnaire 
that measures changes in dyspnea severity from the baseline established by [CONTACT_445905].  TDI consists 
of the same 24 items and 3 domains as the BDI, with the same 2-week recall period.  Each category 
is rated by 7 grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), with a total 
score ranging from -9 to +9. The MCID is considered a change of ≥1 unit [63]. 
The same investigator or designee will interview the subject for the BDI and TDI during the study 
period. TDI will be assessed at V3, V4 and Early Termination. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_877044] (CAT™)
The CAT is a subject-completed validated questionnaire [64][65] to measure the global impact of 
COPD on a subject’s life in an objective way and to monitor changes over time. It consists of [ADDRESS_877045]’s life. No target score represents the best achievable 
outcome.  Although an MCID has not been determined, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_653562] a group-
level MCID of 1.[ADDRESS_877046] suggested that a score < 10 = low impact; 10-20 = 
medium impact, 21-30 = high impact, and > [ADDRESS_877047]. 
The CAT has been used in the GOLD 2011 and GOLD 2017 Reports.  A CAT score of ≥ 10 points 
is considered an indicator of a high symptom burden (GOLD category B & D)[2] and a threshold 
for initiating regular treatment of COPD symptoms including dyspnea.[66] 
The subject will complete the CAT at V1 and V2.

thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of candidiasis.[67] Asthmatics who are using β-2 
agonists show a decreased salivary flow rate, which in turn can be associated with higher oral 
Candida counts.[68]
The subject’s mouth and throat will be visually inspected by [CONTACT_96939]-looking white lesions / oral thrush. If deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_96940], the suspected lesion should be swabbed/scraped with a 
sterile cotton and the tissue sample sent to a laboratory for microscopic and culture identification.  
Appropriate treatment of oropharyngeal thrush (e.g. using topi[INVESTIGATOR_96838]-fungal agents) 
can be prescribed at the discretion of the study investigator as deemed necessary throughout the

In case of relevant ECG abnormalities, the inclusion of the subject will be judged by [CONTACT_1275]. If there are any doubts the Investigator may consult the study’s medical monitor. The 
final decision for enrolment would be documented in the Medical File of the subject.  Clinically 
significant abnormalities at Visit [ADDRESS_877052] dose of study drug (Visit 2) and for [ADDRESS_877053] dose of study drug (Visit 4). 
Two sets of analysis will be conducted for this trial: arrhythmia and electrocardiographic analysis.
For the arrhythmia analysis, the 12-lead Holter recording will be scanned for the presence or 
absence of arrhythmia including, but not limited to:
Atrial fibrillation,
Sinus Pauses,
PACs,
SVT,
PVCs,
Ventricular tachycardia,
AV Blocks.
Details of arrhythmia analysis and how the Holter variables are calculated will be provided in the 
Holter Analysis Plan.
The ECGs database will be made from discrete 12-lead ECGs (10-sec recording duration each) that 
will be extracted from the Holter recording. To facilitate data quality, the subject will be asked to 
assume a supi[INVESTIGATOR_653563], but awake, beginning at [ADDRESS_877054], there will be:

Throughout the study (after randomization), the clinic visits and the lung function measurements 
will start in the morning between 7:00 and 9:[ADDRESS_877057].
The following parameters will be recorded at Visits 1, 2, 3 and 4 or Early Termination Visit:
Forced Expi[INVESTIGATOR_96843] 1st second (FEV 1, L)
oThe volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_96844]. FEV 1 is decreased in obstructive lung diseases.
Forced Vital Capacity (FVC, L)
oThe maximal volume of gas that can be exhaled from full inhalation by [CONTACT_96944][INVESTIGATOR_2595].
The following parameter will be recorded at Visits 2, 3 and 4 or Early Termination Visit:
Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10226] (IC, L)
oThe volume of air that can be inspi[INVESTIGATOR_653566], after a normal, relaxed

equates to the difference between the Total Lung Capacity (TLC) and Functional 
Residual Capacity (FRC, or the amount of gas remaining at the end of normal quiet 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]). IC is decreased in obstructive lung diseases. 
The following parameter will be recorded at Visit 1:

Subjects should be relaxed (shoulders down and relaxed) and asked to breathe regularly for several 
breaths until the end expi[INVESTIGATOR_96846] (this usually requires at least three tidal 
maneuvers). They are then urged to take a deep breath to TLC (Total Lung Capacity) with no 
hesitation. FEV [ADDRESS_877059] FEV 1 (values corrected for BTPS) will be selected after 
examining the data from all of the usable spi[INVESTIGATOR_96847], even if they do not come from the same 
maneuver. An adequate test requires a minimum of [ADDRESS_877060] 
FEV 1 and FVC is ≤ 150mL (≤ 100 mL when FVC is < 1L).[72] If these criteria are not met in 3 
maneuvers, additional trials should be attempted, up to, but usually no more than 8. 
IC will be assessed at -45 min pre-dose at V2, V3, V4 and Early Termination using the Slow Vital 
Capacity (SVC) maneuver. The average of at least 3 acceptable slow vital capacity (SVC) 
maneuvers will be recorded. Acceptable IC repeatability is considered when the coefficient of 
variation for all IC values is ≤ 6%. The SVC maneuvers must be performed before the FVC 
maneuvers used to assess FEV 1.
In the rare event where a subject shows a progressive decline in FEV 1 or FVC with a 
cumulative drop exceeding 20% of start value, the test procedure should be terminated in the 
interest of subject safety.
The rescue medication (albuterol) must be withheld as much as possible for at least [ADDRESS_877061] requires rescue medication within this

During the serial 12-hour spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], rescue medication (albuterol) use should be avoided as much 
as possible, and administered only under investigator’s oversight. The serial measurements may 
continue after rescue treatment intake, if there is no safety risk to the subject. Details including 
exact time of the intake of rescue medication during the study visits must be recorded in the eCRF. 
The run-in medication (QVAR®) or the study drug should not be taken on the morning of the visit.

(ipratropi[INVESTIGATOR_653571]) Inhalation Aerosol (21µg/ actuation, total dose = 84µg) at 30-sec 
intervals.[73][74][75] The following inclusion criteria must be met at Visit 1:
A post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of < 0.7, and
a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥40% and <80% of the predicted normal value.
An increase in FEV 1 of ≥5% from pre-bronchodilator value constitutes a positive 
reversibility test.[59][76] In case the reversibility threshold is not met at screening, the test

childbearing potential at these Visits.
The following evaluations will be performed using a central laboratory:
Hematology test: red blood cells count (RBC), white blood cells count (WBC) and 
differential, total hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), and platelets count (PLT).
Serum chemistry test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN), cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinine, uric 
acid, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Gamma-glutamyl 
transpeptidase ( γ-GT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatases, albumin, total proteins, and 
electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride). 
Fasting blood glucose
Serum pregnancy test (serum β-hCG) in women of child-bearing potential.
Blood collection and sample preparation will be performed according to procedures provided by [CONTACT_96946]. In case of clinically 
significant abnormality, findings will be reported in the medical history (if occurred at Visit 1), or 
as an Adverse Event (if occurred after Visit 1).

Daily symptom assessments offers several potential advantages over periodic assessments, 
including 1) reduced recall bias, providing a prospective, daily account of symptom severity, 2) 
information on day-to-day symptom variability, 3) analytical flexibility, allowing the evaluation of 
symptoms over various time intervals.
To date, however, there is no standardized method for evaluating respi[INVESTIGATOR_653573].[77][78] Formerly known as the EXACT-Respi[INVESTIGATOR_653574], the Evaluating 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_653575] (E-RS™: COPD) instrument uses 11 respi[INVESTIGATOR_653576] 14-item questionnaire, and has been shown to be a reliable, valid and responsive measure 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_653577], suitable for use in clinical trials. The E-RS total 
score quantifies respi[INVESTIGATOR_653578] 3 domains: breathlessness, cough and sputum, 
and chest symptoms.  
 
Higher E-RS scores indicate more severe symptoms and a declining 
total score indicates health improvement. 
Using the electronic diary dispensed at V1, subjects will be instructed to enter once daily a record of 
their COPD symptom scores and for each 24h period as follows: 
Subjects are instructed to complete the E-RS diary each evening just prior to bedtime, 
reflecting back on their experiences “today”.[79]  
Enter daily number of study drug doses taken.  
Enter daily number of albuterol rescue doses taken.
Record daily all doses of QVAR® (only for subjects on background ICS).
7.2.12 Handling of COPD Exacerbations:
Subjects who experience a moderate or severe COPD exacerbation any time after screening (V1) as 
defined below will be instructed to visit the site as soon as possible for an Early Termination Visit 
and will be withdrawn permanently from the study. The Adverse Event form will be completed and 
appropriate medical management of the COPD exacerbation according to standard medical practice 
will be ensured by [CONTACT_1704], with the aim to preserve the research subject’s wellbeing 
at all times.
A COPD exacerbation is defined as “a sustained worsening of the subject’s condition (increased 
dyspnoea, cough, wheeze, sputum purulence/volume), from the stable state and beyond normal day-
to-day variations, that is acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medication including 
prescriptions of systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics or need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].”

10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
10.1 Definitions
An Adverse Event is “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment”.
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 62/82An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
An Adverse Drug Reaction is an “untoward and unintended responses to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any dose administered”.
All adverse events judged by [CONTACT_96949] a reasonable 
causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression “reasonable 
causal relationship” means to convey in general that there are facts (evidence) or arguments meant 
to suggest a causal relationship.
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, 
including misuse and abuse of the product.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR) is any untoward 
medical occurrence or effect that at any dose falls in one or more of the following categories:
- Results in death
Death is not an adverse event but an outcome. It is the cause of death that should be regarded as the 
adverse event. The only exception to this rule is “sudden death” where no cause has been 
established; in this latter instance, “sudden death” should be regarded as the adverse event and 
“fatal” as its reason for being serious.
- Is life-threatening
Life-threatening refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event 
(e.g., aplastic anemia, acute renal failure, and anaphylaxis). The term does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.
- Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96855] a situation whereby [CONTACT_653616][INVESTIGATOR_307], usually for purpose of investigating and/or treating the AE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96856] a medical condition that occurs on an “elective” or “scheduled” basis or for a 
pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study should not necessarily be regarded as an 
AE. Complications that occur during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is an SAE. Emergency room visits that do not result in a formal admission 
into hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96857] (e.g., life-threatening; 
persistent or significant disability or incapacity; medically significant).
- Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
The term significant disability should be viewed as any situation whereby [CONTACT_96951] a clinically 
important effect on the subject’s physical or psychological well-being to the extent that the subject 
is unable to function normally.
-       Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
- Is a medically significant adverse event
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 63/82This criterion allows for any situations in which important adverse events/reactions that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96858]’s 
health or may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples of such events 
are: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an event is serious 
because medically significant.
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infection agent in also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
A Non-Serious Adverse Event/Non-Serious Adverse Drug Reaction is an adverse event or 
adverse drug reaction that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse event/serious 
adverse drug reaction.
10.2 Expectedness
An expected adverse reaction is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent 
with the applicable reference safety  information (Investigator’s Brochure for CHF [ADDRESS_877070] Information for SPI[INVESTIGATOR_381055]® HANDIHALER®), otherwise it is 
considered unexpected. 
Reports which add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented serious adverse drug reaction constitute unexpected events. For example, an event 
more specific or more severe than described in the Investigator’s Brochure would be considered as 
“unexpected”. Examples of such events are: (a) acute renal failure as a labeled ADR with a 
subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis and (b) hepatitis with a first report of fulminant 
hepatitis.
In the event an exacerbation is interpreted as due to lack of efficacy, it should not be classified as 
drug related.
10.[ADDRESS_877071] be rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:
Mild:  The event causes a minor discomfort, or does not interfere with daily activity of the 
subject, or does not lead to either modification of test treatment dosage or establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Moderate: The event perturbs the usual activity of the subject and is of a sufficient severity 
to make the subject uncomfortable. The event leads to a diminution of dosage of the test 
treatment, or a temporary interruption of its administration or to the establishment of a 
correcting treatment.
Severe:  The event prevents any usual routine activity of the subject and causes severe 
discomfort. It may be of such severity to cause the definitive interruption of test treatment.

The following “binary” decision choice will be used by [CONTACT_96952]:
Reasonable possibility of a relatedness
No reasonable possibility of relatedness
The expression “reasonable possibility of relatedness” is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments meant to suggest a causal relationship.
The Investigator will be asked to consider the following before reaching a decision on causality 
assessment:
Time relationship between study drug intake and event’s onset;
Dechallenge (did the event abate after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21395]?);
Rechallenge (did the event reappear after reintroduction?);
Medical history;
Study drug(s);
Mechanism of action of the study drug;
Class effects;
Other treatments-concomitant or previous;

Consent signature [CONTACT_96985]’s study participation ends.
Clinically significant abnormalities detected at Visit [ADDRESS_877074] be completed, as appropriate. A diagnosis, if 
known, or clinical signs and symptoms if diagnosis is unknown, rather than the clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, should be reported on the AE eCRF page. If no diagnosis is known 
and clinical signs and symptoms are not present, then the abnormal finding should be recorded.
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed-up in order to elucidate as 
completely and practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, 
clinical recovery is complete, laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached 
or until the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up may therefore continue after the subject has left 
the study. In this case, the follow-up will continue with no timelines for related SAEs, while for 
unrelated SAEs the type and extent of follow-up undertaken will be determined for each individual 
case and will depend upon the nature (e.g. events with poor prognosis or which do not resolve), 
severity and medical significance of the event.

Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66/82Reporting of SAEs from the investigator site is from the time of subject’s signature [CONTACT_653625]’s study participation ends.  After this date, even if no 
active monitoring of subjects is required, SAEs occurring to a subject should be reported if 
the investigator becomes aware of them.
Up to the closure of the site, SAE reports should be reported to the  Safety 
Contact.  New serious adverse event occurring after the site is closed should be reported 
directly to the Chiesi Safety Contact.
10.10 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Authorities/Ethics Committees/IRB
The Sponsor or designated CRO will report adverse events to the regulatory authorities in 
compliance with the timelines and standards of reporting according to local regulations (Guidance 
for industry and Investigators-Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies, 
December 2012). All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), which occur with 
the investigational medicinal product or marketed active comparator, within or outside the 
concerned clinical trial, will be reported by [CONTACT_96954], as required, as well as to the Investigators and Central IRB, if applicable, by 
[CONTACT_96955]/CIOMS form. The Investigator (or Sponsor/CRO where required) must inform the IRB 
per Sponsor instruction upon receipt of the S[LOCATION_003]R notification. An IND and/or NDA Safety 
Report will be submitted to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating Investigators and IRB 
will receive a blinded IND Safety Report, unless otherwise specified.
With regard to regulations in force for Pharmacovigilance, the Investigator must fulfil his/her 
obligation according to the law in force in his country. 
10.11 General Notes
In case of death, a comprehensive narrative report of the case should be prepared by [CONTACT_96956] /Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96957], retaining a copy on site.
If an autopsy is performed, copy of autopsy report should be actively sought by [CONTACT_96956] /Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96958], 
retaining a copy on site. 
In case of pregnancy, the subject will be immediately withdrawn from the study and she will 
be followed with due diligence until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. The pregnancy 
must be reported by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours by [CONTACT_6791]/e-mail/via Monitor to the 
/Chiesi Safety Contact [CONTACT_96959]. The 
Safety Contact [CONTACT_96960]. 
The first two pages of the Pregnancy Report Form should be completed by [CONTACT_96961] /Chiesi Safety Contact. The 
third page will be completed as soon as the investigator has knowledge of the pregnancy 
outcome together with a follow-up of the first two pages, if necessary (e.g. an update in the 
medication received during pregnancy by [CONTACT_23169]). If it meets the criteria for immediate 
classification of a SAE (e.g. spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) the Investigator should follow the procedure for reporting 
SAEs.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 67/82If it is the partner, rather than the subject, who is found to be pregnant, the same procedure 
regarding pregnancy reporting is to be followed and the Pregnancy Report Form should be 
completed. 
If the pregnancy is discovered before taking any dose either of study drug or of the run-in 
/rescue medication, the pregnancy does not need to be reported; it is only required that the 
subject is immediately withdrawn from the study.
11. DATA MANAGEMENT
An electronic CRF (eCRF) will be filled-in by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her designee. All subjects 
who sign the informed consent will be databased. For subjects who are screened but not 
randomized, a minimum set of information is required: date of informed consent signed, 
demography, assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria when applicable, primary reason for not 
continuing, prior medications, adverse events and concomitant medications if any.  Subject’s 
questionnaire (BDI, TDI, CAT) answers will be databased.
Front-end edit checks will run at the time of data collection and back-end edit checks will be used 
by [CONTACT_653618]. 
Medical history, Concomitant Procedures and Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA 
dictionary; medications will be coded using the WHO Drug dictionary and Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical classification (ATC).
External data (IRT, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], Holter ECG, electronic Diary, Central Laboratory) will be 
processed centrally and reconciled against data recorded in the eCRF as part of cleaning activities.  
After cleaning of data, a review meeting will be held to determine the occurrence of any protocol 
violation and to define the subject populations for the analysis. Once the database has been declared 
to be complete and accurate, it will be locked, the randomization codes will be opened and the 
planned statistical analysis will be performed. Only authorised and well-documented updates to the 
study data are possible after database lock. 
At the study conclusion, a complete copy of the study data will be created for archival purposes at 
Chiesi. The investigators will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_653580].
12. STATISTICAL METHODS
12.1 Sample Size
The sample size has been calculated to evaluate the superiority of CHF 5259 pMDI at different 
doses over placebo in terms of change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_653590] 
6.
A total of 594 evaluable subjects (99 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a mean 
difference of 120 mL between each dose of CHF 5259 pMDI and placebo [51][52] at a two-sided 
significance level of 0.0125 (since 4 dose levels will be tested, the Bonferroni adjustment has been 
taken into account: 0.0125 = 0.05/4), assuming a standard deviation of 250 mL.
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 68/82Since four dose levels will be tested, the Edwards and Berry method will be used to control the 
family-wise Type I error rate at the 0.05 (two-sided) level. In the sample size calculation, the 
Bonferroni adjustment of the significance level has been taken into account (0.0125 = 0.05/4). This 
will ensure the required power for each test, since the Edwards and Berry method is uniformly more 
powerful than the Bonferroni procedure.
Considering a non-evaluable rate of 15%, a total of approximately 702 subjects (117 per group) will 
be randomized.
12.2 Populations for Analysis
Safety population: all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.
Intention-to-Treat population (ITT): all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of 
the study drug and with at least one available evaluation of efficacy (primary or secondary 
efficacy variables) after the baseline.
Per-protocol population (PP): all subjects from the ITT population without any major 
protocol deviation (i.e., wrong inclusions, poor compliance, non-permitted medications). Exact 
definition of major protocol deviations will be discussed by [CONTACT_96963].
Since the superiority of CHF 5259 pMDI at different doses over placebo will be tested, the primary 
efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT population. The primary efficacy analysis will be also 
performed on the PP population for sensitivity purposes. 
The secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed in the ITT population.
The safety variables will be analyzed in the Safety population. 
In case of deviation between randomized treatment and treatment actually received, the treatment 
actually received will be used in the safety analyses (i.e. an as-treated analysis will be performed).
12.3 Statistical Analysis
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be described in a separate document. The plan might be 
reviewed and updated as a result of the blind review of the data and will be finalized before 
breaking the blind. 
12.3.1 Descriptive Statistics 
Descriptive statistics will be provided in summary tables by [CONTACT_653619].
Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables will include n (the number of non-missing values), 
mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum values. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_96964].
-Clinical Study Protocol-
Clinical Study Code: CCD-05993AA3-02 Version No.: 3.0 
IND No.: 133681 Date: 9JAN2018
CONFIDENTIAL Page 69/8212.3.2 Missing data
For the primary efficacy analysis, a linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used to 
handle missing data. Under the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption, this model provides an 
unbiased estimate of the treatment effect that would have been observed if all subjects had 
continued on treatment for the full study duration. This approach addresses efficacy (or de jure) 
hypotheses, estimating the causal effects of the initially randomized drug if taken as directed 
(in contrast with effectiveness, or de facto, hypotheses, evaluating the effect of the drug as 
actually taken) [82]. The efficacy estimand is considered appropriate in the context of a phase 
II study aiming at characterising dose-response.[83][84][85] 
If one of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_96860] 45 min and 15 min pre-dose is not available, then the 
non-missing measurement will be taken as the pre-dose value (corresponding to time 0 for the 
calculation of AUC). If no measurement is available, then the pre-dose value will be considered 
as missing.
In the calculation of AUC normalized by [CONTACT_5586], missing values will be replaced as follows:
oIf the pre-dose value is not available, the entire curve will be considered as missing;
oSingle, isolated missing values (not pre-dose or last value) will be replaced by [CONTACT_96966];
oIf the value at [ADDRESS_877076]-dose is missing, it will be replaced by [CONTACT_96967] 11.5 h;
oIn case of two or more consecutive missing values or more than three missing values, the 
entire curve will be missing.
In case of rescue medication intake during the serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] (from pre-dose to [ADDRESS_877077]-
dose), all spi[INVESTIGATOR_96861] 6 
hours will be excluded from the analysis of primary efficacy endpoint on PP population.
In case of less than three missing values among post-dose spi[INVESTIGATOR_96860] [ADDRESS_877078]-dose 
values over the time interval considered (4h). In case of three or more missing values, the peak 
value will be considered as missing.
In case of at least one post-dose timepoint with change from baseline in FEV 1 ≥ [ADDRESS_877079]-dose timepoint with change from baseline 
in FEV 1 ≥ 100 mL in the time interval considered (12 h). In case of no timepoint with change 
from baseline in FEV 1 ≥ [ADDRESS_877080] will be considered as censored in the analysis.
A minimum of 7 days with available measurements will be required for each inter-visit period 
(including run-in period) to consider the following variables as non-missing: percentage of 
rescue medication-free days, average use of rescue medication, average E-RS total score and 
domain scores.
The BDI and the TDI focal scores will be considered as missing if at least one response will be 
included among the following: “W”, “X”, “Y”, “Z”.
In the responder analysis, subjects with missing data at the relevant visit will be considered as 
non-responders.
Further details on dealing with missing data, along with the handling of possible outliers, will be 
described in the SAP. Other critical missing data, if any, will be discussed during the review of the 
data. Decisions will be fully documented in the Data Review Report.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 70/8212.3.[ADDRESS_877081] demographics and baseline characteristics
The following variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_325549] (and on the 
Safety or PP populations, if relevant): demographic characteristics, medical history and concomitant 
diseases, previous and concomitant medications, efficacy and safety parameters at screening and/or 
at baseline. 
12.3.4 Primary efficacy variables
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_653620] a linear mixed 
model for repeated measurements including treatment, visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], US 
regions and smoking status at screening as fixed effects, and the baseline value (average of the pre-
dose FEV 1 measurements on Day 1) and baseline by [CONTACT_487463]. An unstructured 
covariance matrix will be assumed. 
The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between treatments and 
their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) will be estimated by [CONTACT_10994]. The CIs and the p-values of 
the comparisons between each dose of CHF 5259 pMDI and placebo at Week 6 will be adjusted for 
multiplicity. The adjustment will be based on the parametric simulation method by [CONTACT_653621].[86] At each dose level, the superiority of CHF 5259 pMDI will be demonstrated by a 
statistically significant difference (adjusted p-value < 0.05) favouring CHF 5259 pMDI.
All the other comparisons between treatments will be performed as secondary efficacy analyses 
with no multiplicity adjustment.
12.3.5 Secondary efficacy variables
No multiplicity adjustment will be performed in the secondary efficacy analyses.
For change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_96877] 1, the adjusted means 
in each treatment group and the adjusted mean differences between treatments at Day 1 will be 
estimated with their 95% CIs and p-values by [CONTACT_653594].
Change from baseline in FEV 1 AUC 0-4h normalized by [CONTACT_96948] 1 peak 0-4h at Day 1 and 
Week 6 and change from baseline in pre-dose morning FEV 1 at Week 3 and Week 6 will be 
analyzed using the same model as for the primary efficacy variable.
Change from baseline in FVC AUC 0-12h normalized by [CONTACT_5586], in FVC AUC 0-4h normalized by 
[CONTACT_96884] 0-4h at Day 1 and Week 6 will be analyzed using a similar model as the 
one used for the primary efficacy analysis.
Time to onset of action (i.e., change from baseline in post-dose FEV 1 ≥ 100 mL[15][81]) at 
Day [ADDRESS_877082] model including treatment, US regions 
and smoking status at screening as fixed effects, and baseline (average of the pre-dose FEV 1 
measurements on Day 1) as covariate. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be presented. 
Change from baseline in pre-dose morning IC at Week 3 and Week 6 will be analyzed using a 
similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy analysis. 
TDI focal score at Week 3 and Week 6 will be analyzed using a similar model as the one used 
for the primary efficacy analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 71/82TDI response at Week 3 and Week 6 will be analyzed using a logistic regression model 
including treatment, US regions and smoking status at screening as fixed effects and baseline 
(BDI [Baseline Dyspnea Index] focal score assessed on Day 1) as a covariate.
Change from baseline to each inter-visit period in percentage of rescue medication-free days, in 
average use of rescue medication and in average E-RS total score and domain scores will be 
analyzed using a similar model as the one used for the primary efficacy analysis. The inter-visit 
period will be considered instead of visit in the model. Comparison between treatments over 
the entire treatment period will also be derived from this model.

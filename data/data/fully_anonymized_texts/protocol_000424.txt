 1.0 Background and Rationale 
 
1.1 Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumors 
Neuroendocrine tumors are solid malignant tumors that arise from dispersed neuroendocrine cells found 
throughout the body. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can be divided into two groups: Carcinoid tumors that may arise from the lungs, stomach, small bowel or colon and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (also known as pancreatic islet cell tumors). The clinical behavior of NETs is extremely variable; some may cause hormone hypersecretion and others may not, the majority of them are slow-growing tumors (well -differentiated NETs), whereas some NETs are highly aggressive (poorly 
differentiated NETs). The incidence of NETs is increasing, from 1.1/100,000 per year in 1973 to 5.3/100,000 per year in 2004
1. Among NETs, 25% have distant metastases and 25% have regional involvement at the 
time of initial diagnosis1.  Other tumors that express high levels of somatostatin receptors include 
neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma2-4. 
 The radiological detection and staging of these tumors is challenging and requires a multimodality approach. Somatostatin receptor imaging with In-111 Pentetreotide (OctreoScan) and multiphase CT are the most commonly used modalities although the use of endoscopic ultrasound and MRI is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_330095]. Surgery 
is the only curative option for NETs. However, curative surgery in malignant NET is possible in less than 30% of patients with recurrence identified in the majority of patients as late as 15 years after initial surgery. Treatment with somatostatin analogs, which include the short acting subcutaneous and long acting release (LAR) octreotide as well as long acting lanreotide, are effective in stabilizing NETs and have been recently 
demonstrated to prolong the time to progression of disease
5,6. Chemotherapy is generally not effective in low 
grade NETs, but it may be helpful in high grade and pancreatic NETs.  On the other hand, neuroblas toma 
and medulloblastoma are initially responsive to chemotherapy, but relapses are common and salvage 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330096], resulting in <30% overall survival at 5 years7-9. 
 
1.2 Somatostatin Receptor Targeted Im aging  
Tumors that express somatostatin receptors can be targeted with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues for  
imaging and treatment (Figure 1), making theranostics using peptide analogs of somatostatin feasible by 
[CONTACT_330118] a different radionuclide for therapy.  
Somatostatin receptor gamma camera imaging with In-111 DTPA -octreotide (OctreoScan) targeting 
somatostatin receptor 2 ( SSTR2 ), is used routinely for imaging of neuroendocrine tumors with a detection 
rate >90% for well -differentiated carcinoid tumors and majority of pancreatic NETs, but only a 50% detection 
rate for insulinomas, which may show a weaker expression of SSTR210.   Over 90% of neuroblastoma tumors 
express somatostatin receptors11; they can be imaged with Octreoscan and they respond to 90Y-DOTATOC 
therapy12,13.  Medulloblastoma has recently been categorized into four genetic categories, each one of which 
includes tumors which express somatostatin receptors, but no category is 100% positive for somatostatin 
receptor expression14-16.  We have also imaged medulloblastoma using Octreoscan12. 
More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals have been developed that can be labeled with Gallium -68 (Ga-68). Gallium -[ADDRESS_407819] with a half-life of 68 min (compared to 67 
hours for In- 111 in OctreoScan). The parent nuclide of Ga-68 is Germanium -68, which has a half-l ife of 270.8 
days. Ga-68 decays by 89% through positron emission and 11% by [CONTACT_330119].  Another advancement 
has been the identification of DOTA as a superior chelator compared to DTPA, increasing the stability and receptor targeting of somatostatin analogues
17. 
A number of Ga-[ADDRESS_407820] been introduced, including 68Ga-DOTATOC, Ga -68 
DOTA0-1NaI3-octreotide (68Ga-DOTANOC) and Ga -68 DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotate (68Ga-DOTATATE). All of 
these radiolabeled peptides bind to sstr2, although DOTANOC also binds to sstr3 and sstr5, and DOTATOC 
to sstr518. The primary advantage of Ga-[ADDRESS_407821] been minimally effective due to the short range of 
auger electrons utilized in this therapy. The efficacy of sstr2 targeted treatment was improved with the 
development of somatostatin analogues labeled with beta emitting radioisotopes.  
 
90Yttrium -DOTA complexes are extremely stable; the dissociation constant for this complex is approximately 
10-25 M. The high stability of the 90Y-DOTA chelated complex is a major advantage.  Additionally, 90Yttrium is 
a high-energy beta minus particle-emitter  with a physical half-life of 64.1 h and a mean range of 5 mm in 
tissue, permitting effective treatment of tumors with heterogeneous sstr 2 expression due to by[CONTACT_330120].  90Yttrium is commercially available in sufficient amounts and in a no-carrier-added form  that allows the 
preparation of a radioligand with high specific activity.  
 
There is now a large clinical experience with 90Y-DOTA TOC peptide radioreceptor therapy (PRRT) in Europe, 
primarily in adults with neuroendocrine tumors20. An international Phase II clinical trial  then followed and 
included several trial sites in the [LOCATION_002], notably the University of Iowa; we entered [ADDRESS_407822] now conducted a Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTATOC 
in children and young adults at the University of Iowa, which also shows promise of efficacy of this treatment in pediatric patient population
13.   
 
  
 
  
 
 
Figure 2.  Chemical identity of 
90Y- DOTATOC and 68Ga-DOTATOC  
Figure 1:  Conceptual representation of 
targeted molecular imaging and therapy of 
cancerous tumors. A cell surface receptor is 
identified that is upregulated in cancerous 
tumor cell relative to normal surrounding tissue 
and organs. A peptide vector is developed that 
binds with high affinity and specificity to the 
molecular target. A chelator is added to the 
targeting vector via a molecular linker. The 
chelator can be used to couple a positron 
emitter as the reporter signal for PET, or with a 
beta emitting radionuclide (e.g., 90Y) for 
molecular therapy.  To be effective, the high 
binding affinity of the vector for the target 
antigen and the stable high specific activity 
radiometallation must be maintained after 
placement of the chemical linker.

 1.4  Somatostatin Receptor Targeted Therapy 
Known as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), this molecularly targeted internal radiation has been 
utilized in Europe for nearly 20 years.  The two main radiopharmaceutical agents are 90Y-DOTATOC and 
177Lu-DOTATATE, both targeting sstr2.  The response rates are very similar with very few complete 
responses, 20-30% partial responses, and greater than 50% stable disease among patients who have progressed on other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
22,23.  The time to progression following PRRT, for these patients wi th 
progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors has been 36-[ADDRESS_407823] imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by [CONTACT_330121] -based calculation of renal doses from 
previous cycles  not to exceed 23 Gy for the total renal dose.  
 
68Ga-DOTATOC PET  imaging and 90Y-DOTATOC peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) are readily 
available in Europe, but neither radiopharmaceutical is approved for use in the [LOCATION_002] . We are 
presently conducting a safety and efficacy trial of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET in adults and children under IND# 
114,398, that to date has included over [ADDRESS_407824] conducted a 
single institution Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTATOC therapy in children and young adults under IND# 61,[ADDRESS_407825] participated in a Phase II trial of 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT in adults , 
also with no dose limiting toxicities21.  
 
The total radiation dose to kidneys with PRRT using 90Y-DOTATOC is currently limited to ≤ [ADDRESS_407826] and second cycles of therapy.  The 
method for performing the dosimetry will take advantage of a positron decay component of Yttrium -90 that 
will allow quantification of radiation dose using PET imaging to measure rate of 90Y-DOTATOC into kidneys , 
coupled with semi -quanti tative measurement of bremsstrahlung energy using single photon emission 
tomography (SPECT) to follow the body clearance of 
90Y-DOTATOC over [ADDRESS_407827] of the FDA, to compare the efficacy of 68Ga-
DOTATOC PET + a low dose CT with 111In-DTPA -tyr3-Octreotide (Octreoscan) SPECT/CT + a high 
resolution, contrast enhanced CT (or MRI).  There are 3 major advantages of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT over 
Octreoscan SPECT/CT: 1)  lower dose of radiation using Gallium -68 (T½=68 min) versus Indium -11 (T½=2.8 
day); 2) greater sensitivity of PET compared to SPECT imaging; and 3) 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT can be 
completed in a single, 3 -hr visit whereas Octreoscan requires 2 visits over a 24 hr period. We now propose to 
utilize  68Ga-DOTATOC  (or 68Ga-DOTAT ATE) and 90Y-DOTATOC  in a dosimetry -guided theranostics trial for 
both children and adults with neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor positive tumors.   
 
 
[ADDRESS_407828] Goals  
 
2.1  Demonstrate safety and efficacy of renal uptake dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy 
(PRRT) using 90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide  (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with neuroendocrine and other 
somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.  2.2  Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using 
90Y-DOTATOC.  
 2.3  Establish

therapy. 
 
3.0 Hypotheses  
 
3.1 Hypotheses:  
1.  We hypothesize that dosimetry -guided, individual dosing of 90Y-DOTATOC will provide excellent tumor 
response.   
2. We hypothesize that individual, dosimetry -guided dosing of 90Y-DOTATOC will provide maximum safe 
dose to tumor and minimize renal toxicity while limiting renal radiation dose to ≤ 23 Gy. 
3. We hypothesize that 68Ga-DOTATOC  or 68Ga-DOTATATE  PET/CT will accurately stage extent of 
disease at study entry and accurately measure response to therapy at six months following last 90Y-
DOTATOC treatment. 
4. We hypothesize that both quantitative PCR and semi -quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of 
somatostatin receptor 2 (sstr2) expression on the first diagnostic biopsy of neuroendocrine tumor will 
positively correlate with standard uptake value (SUV) of that subject’s first 68Ga-DOTATOC  or 68Ga-
DOTATATE PET scan at study entry.

Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed.  Cycles 2 and 3 doses will be  
determined by [CONTACT_330121] -based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles; total renal dose ≤ 23Gy .  
 6.1 Delivery of Therapeutic Infusion 
 90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide and amino acid infusions  will be administered on Day 2 of each treatment 
cycle.  A large IV, either 20 gauge peripheral IV or a PI[INVESTIGATOR_67688], will be inserted to provide free flow of the 
hyperosmolar amino acid solution, thus avoiding local inflammation with risk of blistering.  Amin o acid 
infusion will begin 30 min prior to infusion of 90Y-DOTATOC and continue 3.5 hrs after infusion of 
radiotherapeutic  drug.   If rate of amino acid infusion is decreased due to nausea, the length of infusion 
11 
 may be longer than 3.5 hrs. There will be rescue Sandostatin available (subcutaneous bolus of 200 µgm 
(200 µgm/mL)) in case of carcinoid crisis after 90Y-DOTATOC infusion has been completed. 
 
6.2 Methods for Dosimetry Estimates 
Renal dosimetry: Each subject will have renal 90Y-DOTATOC time -of-flight (TOF) PET/CT images taken 
within approximately 48 hours (40-56 hours) after the administration of 90Y-DOTATOC.  
 
Bone Marrow dosimetry: Blood dosimetry will be performed as a surrogate of bone marrow dosimetry. 
Blood samples will be obtained prior to start of Amino Acid infusion, again within 1-4 hours after 
administration of 90Y-DOTATOC and at 48 hrs (40-56 hrs).  
 
6.3 Measurement of Renal Dose 
 The following information is required to estimate the dose to the kidneys:  
a) An estimate of the radioactivity accumulated in the kidneys,  
b) The kinetics of the radioactivity, and  
c) The size (mass) of the kidneys.  
 
The renal accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical will be measured with Y -[ADDRESS_407843] images.  
 
The methods of kinetic analysis of the renal clearance of Y -90 DOTATOC is modified based on our previous 
experience. Our analysis of 47 prior administrations demonstrate that the renal clearance of Y -90 DOTATOC 
follows a biexponential pattern with the majority of the radiation exposure to the kidneys coming from the slow 
(long) component of clearance after the initial fast elimination. The rate constant of the slow component was gaussian distributed with a standard deviation less than 30% of the mean. This allows us to use a population 
based rate constant for slow clearance adjusted based on the uptake at 48 hours. The estimated renal 
radiation dose using this approach shows excellent correlation with the measured radiation dose (See Appendix 1t:  Single Timepoint Dose Estimate for Exponential Clearance) and allows for a clinically feasible 
personalized treatment dosimetry with one follow -up visit after [ADDRESS_407844] that the safe range of < 23 
Gy for radiation to kidneys delivered by [CONTACT_330124], is more likely 30-35 Gy when delivered as 
divided doses of targeted internal radiation58.  Furthermore, there were no dose limiting renal toxicity events 
in children or young adults  enrolled in the Phase I study.  Nevertheless, because of the young age of 
pediatric subjects described in Aim 1, we limited the total dose to kidneys, including any previous external 
beam radiation to < [ADDRESS_407845].  If this total dose is <[ADDRESS_407846] will be calculated according to the following formula:   
1000 x (23 Gy – summed renal dose (Gy))/ renal dose per activity (mGy/MBq).  
 
All subjects will receive a concomitant amino acid infusion as renal protectant13.   A parenteral amino acid 
solution which supplies >27 g each of lysine and  arginine in 2 liters of normal saline ( < 800 mOsm/ L) will b e 
administered IV at a max of 8.3 mL /kg/hour (max 4 50 mL/hr) for 4 hours to begin 30 minutes prior to infusion 
of 90Y-DOTATOC . Initial infusion rate should be 300m L/hr or less; if tolerated for initial 30 min, rate may be 
increased to max rate. The total minimum volume which shall be infused is 1600 mL. This will constitute an 
off-label use of these approved amino acid solutions due to the higher than recommended volume infused.  Any further information regarding dosing should be obtained from the manufacturer's instructions.  
 Patients will be pre-medicated with EMEND  and Lorazepam, and/or another anti -emetic, [ADDRESS_407847] Base line

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  3 cycles or until 
one of the following criteria applies:  
• Cumulative renal radiation dose exceeds 23 Gy. 
• Intercurrent illness prevents further administration of treatment. 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  such as irreversible renal or hematopoietic toxicity .    
• Initiation of another tumor specific therapy.  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study.  
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
Other causes of discontinuation from study:  
• Termination of study by [CONTACT_2728]. 
• Subject’s condition no longer requires study drug.

clinically uninteresting. Otherwise, an additional 29 subjects will be enrolled. If 20 or more responses are observed in the total of 64 subjects, then the treatment will be ruled worthy of further study.  
 
9.0  
Regulatory and R eporting R equirements 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center will 
provide data and safety monitoring for this study. “The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center” provides standard operating procedures to monitor all clinical cancer trials at the UIHC. All investigator -initiated trials are automatically monitored by [CONTACT_6802]. The Data 
Safety and Monitoring Plan for this risk level [ADDRESS_407852] frequent adverse events observed in adults treated with these drugs are listed below. 
Severity of adverse events will be graded according to NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0) which is available at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting//ctc.html
. 
Adverse events will be collected from time of consent until [ADDRESS_407853] 90Y treatment. Labs will only be 
collected as adverse events if deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. Serious Adverse Events (SAE’s) that occur >[ADDRESS_407854].  
 
9.1.1 Routine Adverse Event Reporting Requirements to DSMC  
An adverse event (AE) is defined in the CTEP, NCI Guidelines  [2005] as “any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unl ikely, 
possible, probably or definite).”  
14 
 Routine adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_330126]. 
      9.1.2 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to DSMC  
Serious adverse events occurring during study procedures with 90Y-DOTATOC will require a 
notification to the DSMC as described in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (see appendix 1) below regardless of attribution to study intervention. The investigator will continue to follow or obtain documentation until the resolution of such an event until it is resolved (with or without 
sequelae)  
9.1.3 Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines –  
Documentation will begin after radiotracer injection and continue through 1 calendar day following 
imaging. This study will use the guidelines developed by [CONTACT_254936] 
(CTEP) for PET and/or SPECT IND agents. For purposes of the below table, it should be noted that the 
radioactive half-life for 
90Y is 64.1 hours. Therefore, 10 radioactive half- lives will be 27days for the 
purposes of adverse event reporting.  
 
9.2 Expected Adverse Events Associated with 90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC)  
Treatment involves administering a radioactive drug into the bloodstream from where it may attach to 
any cell (cancerous and healthy) that has  somatostatin receptors on its surface and normally comes in 
contact [CONTACT_330127].  Therefore, healthy cells may potentially be killed or damaged by [CONTACT_218068].  
Healthy cells that contain somatostatin receptors are present in the pancreas, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, large intestine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and ovaries.  No damage to these organs has been seen in the adults who have taken this drug.  Other healthy organs which do not contain somatostatin receptors but which normally come in contact [CONTACT_330128].   
 
Kidney exposure is due to the renal clearance of this drug as well as the normal amino acid recirculation 
mechanism that operates to conserve amino acids and small peptides. The kidney contains somatostatin 
receptors and also comes in contact [CONTACT_4490] 
90Y-DOTATOC as it is being excreted.  This means the kidney 
usually receives the most radiation of any normal tissue in the body. Adult humans who have received 
90Y-DOTATOC have experienced some damage to the kidney. Some adults have experienced 
permanent decrease in kidney function, but no adults have required dialy sis. There is a risk that severe 
kidney damage could occur which may result in the need for permanent dialysis.   Kidney 
damage may occur as a late effect, months after the last dose of 90Y-DOTATOC .  
 
Adults and children have been treated with 90Y-DOTA TOC .  Side effects that were observed include:  
bowel obstruction, diarrhea, weight loss, reduced red blood cells (anemia), reduced white blood cells 
(increased chance of infection), and reduced platelets (increased chance of uncontrolled bleeding).  These effects depended on the dose of 
90Y-DOTATOC  and occurred at higher doses tested.  Most 
patients recovered from these effects after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 90Y-DOTATOC ; however, two patients (of a total of 
over 2500 patients treated as of 12/31/13) have developed myelodysplastic syndrome.  
 
An unexpected allergic reaction following the administration of 90Y-DOTATOC  or the amino acids may 
consist of shortness of breath, wheezing, lowering of blood pressure, fever, chills, hives, itchiness or damage to the blood vessels.  The amino acid solution is hyperosmolar and may cause local inflammation or in rare cases, blistering at the infusion site.  A [ADDRESS_407855] agree to practice a medically acceptable birth control measure (abstinence, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], intrauterine devices, vaginal diaphragm, vaginal sponge, or condom with spermicidal jelly) throughout the study and for eight months following the end of the last treatment.  Any females who 
are nursing must refrain from nursing while on study and for three months following the end of the last 
treatment.   
9.3  Expected Adverse Events Associated with Amino Acid Infusions:  
Generalized flushing, fever, and nausea have been reported during infusions of amino acid 
solutions.  Local reactions consisting of a warm sensation, redness, inflammation of the vein and blood 
clotting at the infusion site have also occurred. Low or high potassium and phosphate levels have been observed in some adult patients.  These levels have not been clinically significant and have returned to 
within normal limits after completion of therapy except in one case out of more than 400 individual infusions of amino acids.  To avoid this rare electrolyte disturbance, we will check heart rate and 
potassium level 60 min prior to end of amino acid infusion; if >6 meq/L and/or heart rate < 60 bpm, we will administer oral or IV NaHCO
3 and keep patient sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_330098] >65 bpm. 
 
 
9.4  Research radiation dose estimate 
 
9.5  Risks of 90Y-DOTATOC PET /CT Scan Procedure  
 Risks of Investigational PET/CT: Additional risks include radiation exposure from the investigational low dose CT scan and the inconvenience of the investigational PET/CT scan. Children may require sedation 
or anesthesia to remain still during the PET/CT  scanning procedure.  The risks of sedation include a 
reaction to the medication used for sedation or anesthesia.  If anesthesia is required, there is a risk of injury to the throat or airways from insertion of the breathing tube. 
 
10.0  Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
10.1  Dosage Modifications 
Dosimetry will be acquired following treatments 1 & 2.  The kidney dose/mCi will be calculated and the 
total target dose that will limit renal dose to ≤  23 Gy.  The target dose minus 120 mCi  will then be divided 
into two equal doses for Cycles 2 and 3 with adjustments based on dosimetry.  Regardless of the total 
dose to kidneys as determined by [CONTACT_330121], the maximum dose in Cycle 2 will be 15 0 mCi; Cycle 3 will 
be limited to ≤  Cycle 2 . 
 
Dose  of 90Y-DOTATOC  will be decreased 25-50% for any subject in whom  dosimetry measurement on 
first or second dose indicates probable total renal dose for three cycles will be >23 Gy.  Dose may be increased on subsequent cycles so long as summation of dosimetry measurements limits total renal dose to < 23 Gy.  
 
Dose of 90Y-DOTATOC will be increased 10-20% for any subject in whom dosimetry measurement on 
first or second dose indicates probable total renal dose for three cycles will be significantly  <[ADDRESS_407856] will receive > 420 mCi total dose of 
90Y-DOTATOC.   
 
Subjects who had a nuclear GFR measured at baseline will be followed for nephrotoxicity  by [CONTACT_330129] . If they demonstrate a > 30% decrease in GFR as determined by [CONTACT_330130], their dose will 
be reduced by 50% on the next cycle.  Full dose may then be given when GFR returns to 90% of 
baseline.  Patients who experience > 30% decrease in GFR will be placed on an age appropriate dose of 
captopril  or other ACE inhibitor .   
Also, patients that experience a rise in serum creatinine above 1.2 (who previously had normal levels) will be h ydrated and have their serum creatinine repeated. If the creatinine level after hydration remains 
16 
 elevated above 1.2, then nuclear GFR will be measured. If applicable, dose reductions will be 
implemented as described above.  
 
Nephrotoxicity as demonstrated by > 50% decrease in nuclear scan GFR will be considered a DLT if the 
resulting GFR is below normal for subject’s age, height and weight.  Subjects who experience a DLT are 
eligible to receive subsequent cycles of 90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide at a reduced dose if the DLT has 
returned to baseline value within [ADDRESS_407857]'s subsequent dose must be reduced to 50% of the untolerated dose. 
 
10.2 Dose Delay     
The time elapsed between the end of week 6 of a Cycle Study Period and Day 1 of the next Cycle Study Period should be < [ADDRESS_407858]'s continuation will be at the discretion of the Principal Investigator; approval will not be unreasonably withheld.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_407859] may not receive any other approved or investigational anti -neoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330099]-receptor positive tumor during the course of the study, excluding somatostatin analogues and bisphosphonates.  However, all subjects on somatostatin analogue therapy will discontinue therapy from 12 hours prior to a) injection with 
68Ga-DOTATOC, and b) infusion with 90Y-
DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide until [ADDRESS_407860] been on hormonal therapy  
(other than somatostatin analogues) for > [ADDRESS_407861] continue into the 
Long-Term Follow -up Study Period at the point of treatment discontinuation.  This is necessary to 
determine any long-term effects of treatment with 90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide.   
 
Subjects may receive, at the discretion of the investigator, appropriate medical treatment for medical problems that arise while on study.  
 
11.0 Response Criteria/End of Study Assessments 
11.[ADDRESS_407862] 1.1 include:   
    
  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete 
Response 
(CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <10 mm. 
    
Partial 
Response 
(PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
    
17 
 Progressive 
Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).  
    
Stable Disease 
(SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study  
    
  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete 
Response 
(CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
    
  Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
    
    
Non-CR/Non -
PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
    
Progressive 
Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression  should not normally trump target lesion status.  It 
must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
 
12.0 Data Analysis and Statistics:  
12.1 Primary Objective 1 
Treatment efficacy, defined as  a complete response, partial response or stable disease (CR+PR+SD), is the 
primary endpoint of interest in this dosimetry -guided Phase II trial.  Tumor response will be defined according 
to RECIST1.1 criteria applied on up to five target lesions (primary tumor if not surgically removed, up to two 
liver lesions, up to two nodal metastases , metastatic lesion in other organs, such as ovary, breast) that will be 
quantified and compared between pre-therapy  and 3-[ADDRESS_407863]-
enhanced CTs. O sseous metastases may be followed as non-target lesions. 90Y-DOTATOC will be deemed 
worthy of further study if its associated response rate is ≥ 0.6 0, and clinically uninteresting if its  rate is ≤ 0.40. 
Enrollment will proceed according to an optimal  Simon two-stage study design. Sixteen (16)  subjects will be 
enrolled in the first stage; if [ADDRESS_407864] is not 
observed at the 6 month follow -up will be treated as censored observations in the survival analysis.  
12.2 Primary Objective 2   
Adverse events will be recorded and reported in tabular form by [CONTACT_16624]. If four or more subjects experience renal toxicity  ≥ Grade 4, the radiopharmaceutical will be declared too toxic and the trial will be 
stopped. If any other irreversible Grade [ADDRESS_407865] recent CTE guidelines.  
12.3 Secondary Objective 1 
For subjects who participated in the 
68Ga-DOTATOC  Comparator trial (IRB # 201212736), the number, size, 
and location of discordant lesions between 68Ga-DOTATOC PET /CT and Octreoscan  will have been 
tabulated. T his analysis will be updated using the results of post- therapy 68Ga-DOTATOC PET /CT for those 
patients who participated in the comparator study , but only received the initial 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT due 
to progression on the Octreoscan + high-resolution, contrast- enhanced CT. Lesions that were positive on 
PET, but negative on Octreoscan will be considered true positive if a response to PRRT is documented after either Cycle [ADDRESS_407866] 
90Y-DOTATOC infusion.  
For subjects who did not participate in the 68Ga-DOTATOC  Comparator trial, all 68Ga-DOTATOC  PET/CT 
scans will be acquired as part of this study; number, size, and location of lesions will be analyzed between first and subsequent 
68Ga-DOTATOC  PET/CTs.  
 
12.4 Secondary Objective 2 
Compare SUVmax between primary tumor, liver lesions, and extra-hepatic lesions with expression levels of 
sst2 using qRT-PCR and /or receptor IHC from fresh frozen or paraffin-embedded samples where available. 
Compare maximum SUVs of primary tumor, liver lesions, and extra-hepatic lesions with expression level of sst2 RNA and IHC on fresh frozen tissue, or paraffin embedded samples (block (s) or 10 unstained slides)  to 
determine whether or not any correlation exists between SUVmax, sst2 expression, or sst2 protein and response to PRRT. The study is expected to delineate whether measurement of sst2 expression by [CONTACT_330131]-PCT or immunohistochemistry at diagnosis can predict response to 
90Y-DOTATOC. We will construct a 
table tabulating SUVmax, level of RNA expression, and IHC level for all lesions biopsied. With 64 subjects 
the correlation between SUV max, RNA expression and IHC will be determined. Analysis of SUVmax compared with sst2 RNA and receptor protein expression on primary tumor and metastatic lesions will be considered worthy of further study if > 50% of lesions demonstrate a positive correlation. Tissue will be sent 
to 3080 Med Lab i n University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330100].  
13.0 Study Drug  
 13.1  
90Y-DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC); IND# 61,907 
 13.1.1 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control  
Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT)  requires a peptide conjugate that consists of the peptide 
receptor ligand as the targeting moiety and a chelator to bind the radionuclide as shown in Figures 1 and 2. 
[90Y]Yttrium -DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) consists of the targeting peptide tyr3-octreotide which is 
conjugated to the chelating moiety (DOTA) to bind the radionuclide ( [90Y]Yttrium ).  [90Y]Yttrium -DOTA 
complexes are extremely stable36.  
 
The manufacture of 90Y-DOTATOC will be conducted in the University of Iowa Nuclear Medicine 
Radiotherapeutics Laboratory. At least two technical personnel, one of whom has a postgraduate degree 
19 
 (MS, PharmD, M D, or PhD) will be present during manufacture and quality control procedures to confirm 
adherence to standard operating procedures and release criteria. Reagents  and supplies  used for the 
preparation of 90Y-DOTATOC are received and inspected per specification sheets and accepted or rejected.  
Accepted reagents  and supplies  are labeled with appropriate expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], initialed, assi gned 
identification numbers and then stored in specified locations in the R adiotherapeutics Laboratory.  
 
Manufacture: 
The starting material , DOTA -tyr3-Octreotide (DOTATOC), is manufactured under GMP conditions and is 
obtained commercially with appropriate certificate of analysis documentation.  Manufacturing of 90Y-
DOTATOC will be performed using a synthesis unit specifically designed for this purpose ModularLab 
PharmTracer from Eckert & Zeigler, [LOCATION_010].  The system utilizes  a purpose-built, disposable, GMP -
certifi ed (sterile, pyrogen -free) cassette that is snapped into place  on the synthesis unit.  Computer contr ol 
manages  the flow of reagents for radiolabeling, purification, and transfer of the product to the final product 
vial via a hydrophilic PVDF steri lizing 0.[ADDRESS_407867] collection vial is labelled with the batch number and other relevant information (see section 
13.1.2 L abeling). The vial is weighed, then prefilled under aseptic conditions with sterile isotonic saline for 
injection containing ascorbic acid. This solution acts as a diluent and the ascorbic acid as an agent to aid in prevention of radiolysis of the final product.  Ascorbic acid 10-[ADDRESS_407868] is added later in the process (~ 16 mL solution) the solution will be close to 100 mL. This volume, in this vial, gives a finely defined geometry for accurate 
radioactivity dose measurement.     
 GMP grade [
90Y]Yttrium chloride, measured against a NIST standard, is purchased commercially (e.g., 
Perkin-Elmer) for each manufacturing procedure37.  The received [90Y]Yttrium chloride radioactivity (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
50 – 250 mCi) is calibrated to expected time of start of synthesis.  Prior to synthesis the amount of received 
radioactivity is confirmed with the dose calibrator in the Radiotherapeutics Laboratory. The PharmTracer 
system transfers the [90Y]Yttrium chloride using the ascorbate buffer  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 50 mg ascorbic acid in 1.5 mL 
ultrapure water) directly to a reaction vess el. The ascorbic acid serves not only as a buffer but also as an aid 
in prevention of radiolysis. The reaction vessel contains DOTATOC precursor dissolved in ultrapure water.  To achieve maximum radiolabeling and high specific activity , the amount of precursor is restricted to the 
range 50-200 micrograms, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 115 µg. The reaction mixture is heated to 95 °C for 25±[ADDRESS_407869] is purified by [CONTACT_330132] (approximately 2-3 mL) through a solid phase 
extrac tion (SPE) C-18 cartridge, which retains the 
90Y-DOTATOC while allowing any remaining free 
[90Y]Yttrium to pass through the column into the waste vial. The C-18 cartridge is rinsed with isotonic sal ine 
for injection to remove any  residual free [90Y]Yttrium , followed by [CONTACT_330133] 90Y-DOTATOC with 47.5% ethanol 
in water (2 mL), followed by [CONTACT_330134] (14 mL), directly through a sterile 0.[ADDRESS_407870] collection vial, containing ~[ADDRESS_407871] suitable for quality control sampling and final release 
measurements.   
 Small aliquots (total 1.5 – 2 mL)  are then taken for quality control testing and the product line and vent filter 
are removed. The final pr oduct collection vial is  weighed and the contained radioactivity measured and 
recorded on the master batch sheet that then translates to the final product label. Radiochemic al yields of 
>90%  (uncorrected for decay) are routinely achieved. The final sterilization filter is retained for a QC pressure 
test to ensure filter integrity. The production process requires approximately 3 h ours to complete. 
 
Quality Control: 
The QC process takes approximately 1.[ADDRESS_407872] as shown in Table 1 below.

Appearance:  Any visible cloudiness or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_330101].  
 
Filter Test: A filter pressure test is conducted by [CONTACT_330135] 2 bar inert gas 
(nitrogen or argon) and monitoring the leak rate for [ADDRESS_407874] sterilization. The system pressure should be greater than 1 bar (100 kPa, 15 psi) above atmospheric 
pressure after [ADDRESS_407875] may be re-filtered with a fresh sterile filter under aseptic conditions with all the quality control tests being conducted on samples of the newly filtered material.   
pH: The pH of the final product is measured by [CONTACT_330136]. 
 
Radiochemical Purity: The radiochemical purity of the final product is determined on a reverse phase high 
pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a radiation detector, using a C18 reverse phase column and mobile phase of 0.1% TFA in water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B).  
Using  this column and mobile phase system, free Y -90 will elute with the void volume of the column while 
90Y-DOTATOC will be retained for a significant time on the column and the two species can be differentiated 
by [CONTACT_330137].  Radiochemical purity is determined by [CONTACT_330138] 90Y -
DOTATOC peak at a known retention time (7.8±0.5 min) and comparison to any peaks of trace free Y-90 and 
degradation peptides that may be present.  This determination will be conducted by [CONTACT_330139].  
 
Bacterial Endotoxins: Samples of final product will be tested using the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) gel -
clot test.  If either the positive control or  product fails in the LAL gel -clot test, the entire test will be repeated in 
triplicate. Failure of any one of the triplicate gel clot tests will disqualify the product for human use.

University of Iowa investigators also hold the only IND (#61,907) in the [LOCATION_002] for this radiopharmaceutical and have completed the only Phase I trial of 
90Y-DOTATOC PRRT in children.  
University of Iowa investigators have treated 18 children and young adults as well as 40 older adults with 90Y-
DOTATOC PRRT; no irreversible renal toxicity has been experienced in these patients, primarily due to rigorous hydration prior to and after administration of the therapy as well as providing the total dose in 3 moderately sized doses rather than 2 higher doses.  The major goal of this present study will be to determine if individualized, dosimetry -guided dosing of 
90Y-DOTATOC can successfully optimize dose to tumor while 
limiting renal toxicity for every patient. 
 
13.4 Pharmacology and Toxicology Information 
The above summary of human experience provides strong evidence that the amount of investigational drug 
(DOTATOC) in mass quantity and the amount of radiation (as also provided via our measured radiation dosimetry) are acceptable in terms of risk. The NOAEL level of DOTATOC has never been established in 
humans, despi[INVESTIGATOR_330104], with some using multiple 
large doses
5.  The radiation toxicity from the investigational radioisotope is also, accordingly, within the 
acceptable range for patients with life -threatening malignancies whose treatment we believe will benefit from 
the use of the proposed investigational imaging procedure.  Accordingly, we believe the risk/benefit of our proposed investigation to be justified.  13.5 Other Agents:  Amino Acid Solution 
The amino acid solution will be prepared in the University of Iowa Pharmacy. The solution used for these

Appendix I  
Single Timepoint Dose Estimate for Exponential C learance 
Introduction:   Personalized dosimetry is highly desirable for many radionuclide therapy protocols in 
order to deliver the maximum tumor dose while sparing the critical organs. The determination of the 
total integrated activity (Ã) for radiation dose estimates generally requires measurements of tissue 
activity at multiple time points with a minimum of at least 2 time samples for each exponential 
component.  This can add many additional days to the procedure creating a burden for both the patient 
and the clinic.   
The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that in certain situations where the clearance of the radiotracer 
is describe d by a mono - or bi -exponential model and quantitative information about the long 
component is approximately known, it may be possible to obtain a useful estimate of Ã  from a single 
time point measurement ( Ã*).  This approach may prove to be accurate and simple enough to allow 
personalized dosimetry to more effectively manage radionuclide cancer treatments and thereby [CONTACT_330144].  
Single exponential derivation:  We first derive the single point estimation approach for a single component  exponential:      A(t) = A
0 exp( -kt)   Eq. 1 
Where A 0 is the activity at t = 0 and k  is the effective clearance rate constant.  
The total number of decays  associated with Eq. 1 is:    Ã = A 0/k                    Eq.  2  
If k is known and a quantitative activity measurement is made at time T, then   is determined from:  
        Ã = A(T) exp(kT)/k Eq. 3     
Suppose we can accurately measure A(T)  but only a population mean value is known for k  (indicat ed by 
k*).   We hypothesize that Ã can be estimated from :        
       Ã* = A (T) exp(k*T)/k*   Eq. 4 
In Eq. 4, A(T)  and T  are measured and k*  is known from either previous population measurements of 
from theoretical pharmacokinetic considerations.   
26 
 
Optimal sampling time:  The time T  where  Ã * is exactly equal to  Ã for all values of k can be 
determined  by [CONTACT_330145]. 2 equal to Eq. 3 :   A 0/k = A(T) exp(k*T)/k* =  A 0 exp( -kT) exp(k*T)/k*  .  
Solving this for T yields:  
T = ln(k*/k)/(k*- k)  = (1/k*) ln(k*/k)/(1 – k/k*) =  τ* ln(k*/k)/(1 – k/k*) , Eq. 5 
where τ * is the mean life of the estimated clearance rate. A plot of Eq 5 as a function of is shown in 
Figure 1

is a 
singu larity 
when k*/k 
= 1 since all 
sampling 
points are 
equally 
valid.   
For the situation in which k*  is the expectation 
value for the random variable k , the best sample time is therefore T  =  τ*. 
Validation of single exponential case:  We hypothesize that Eq. 4 can be used to estimate the actual 
total number of decays without precisely knowing the actual clearance rate k  if we know the 
expectation value k* for a population of samples .  As noted abov e, k*  may have been determined from 
previous studies where sufficient samples were acquired to accurately determine individual k  values or 
in some cases from prior knowledge about the tracer pharmacokinetics.  To evaluate this  hypothesis , a 
simulation usin g Excel  was performed where values of k  are randomly sampled  for a set of initial 
activity levels ( A0).  Without any loss of generality, k*  is assumed to equal 1/time (with arbitrary time 
units) and the values of k  are selected from a random number generator with a gaussian distribution 
with a mean of [ADDRESS_407886] the 
estimated total number of decays Ã* determined from Eq. 4 as a function of sampling time T.  Linear 
regressions were performed on the plots of Ã as a function of Ã * to determine the slope, intercept, 
correlation coefficient and the standard error of estimate.

 The plot of the simulation data shows an excellent correspondence between the estimated total decays 
calculated from a single time point sample and the actual total decays.  Table 1 demonstrates that ideal 
sample time occurs at the mean life associated with k* as expected from the results given by [CONTACT_330146] 5 and 
the plot shown in Figure 1.  
 Single exponential derivation:  The derivation for bi- exponential clearance is similar to the mono -
exponential derivation:    A(t) = A
1 exp( -k1t) + A 2 exp( -k2t)         Eq 6     
The total decays  are equal to:   Ã = A 1/k1 + A 2/k2              Eq [ADDRESS_407887] radionuclide therapy cases, the major portion of the radiation dose comes from the longer 
component (k2).  Hence, Eqs 6 & 7 are rewritten in terms of A 2 and k 2.  
 Define A 1 /A 2 = c;    k 1/k2 = a , then                    
    A(t) = cA 2 exp( -ak 2t) + A2 exp( -k2t)   Eq 8   
  and    Ã = A 2/k 2 (c/a + 1)                        Eq 9  
The activity at time t = T is:  A(T) = cA 2 exp( -ak 2T) + A 2 exp( -k2T)    
Solving for A2,  A 2  = A(T)/(c exp( -ak 2T) + exp( -k2T)), thus:     
  Ã   =                         A(T) x    (c/a + 1)                        Eq 10                  
                     [(c exp(-ak 2T) + exp( -k2T)) x k 2] 
Using a similar approach as with the single exponential case, the equation for the estimated total decays 
is written as:  
  Ã* =                  A (T) x    (c*/a* + 1)                Eq  11   
              [(c* exp(-a*k 2*T) + exp( -k2*T)) x k 2*] 
As with the single exponential case,  k2* is the effective clearance rate constant for the long component, 
but now there are 2 additional parameters that need to be included,  c* and  a*. At first glance, having 
this many parameters might seem to make the approach challenging and in the general case that is true.   
However, in instances that will be useful for radionuclide therapy, it will often be the case that a* > 10 and c*  will be less than 2.  When that is true, then:  
(c*/a* + 1)  ≈ 1 and    [(c* exp(-a*k
2*T) + exp( -k2*T)) x k 2*] ≈ exp( -k2*T)) x k 2*, 
Thus,   Ã*  ≈    A (T) exp( k2*T)) /k 2*  which is an approximation of the result obtained for the single 
exponential case in Eq 4 . 
  
29 
 Validation of the biexponential case:  Using a similar approach as with the single exponential case, we 
hypothesize that Eq. 11  can be used to estimate the actual total number of decays without precisely 
knowing the actual biexponential parameters c, a, and k2 as long as  we know the ir expectation values 
(c*, a*,  k2*) for a population of samples . To evaluate this  hypothesis, a simulation using Excel  was 
performed wher e values of c, a  and k 2 are randomly sampled  for a set of initial activity levels ( A2).  For 
this simulation, the values of c*, a* and k2* were determined from an actual clinical protocol that 
focused on the radiation dose to kidneys from Y -[ADDRESS_407888] deviation associated with k2* is relatively small, the standard deviations associated with c* and a* are large.

Retrospective analysis of clinical study:   There has been an ongoing clinical trial at the University of 
Iowa in which three cycles of Y -[ADDRESS_407891] 2 cycles was determined using the following procedure.  
After administration of Y -90 DOTATOC and amino acids (~ 5 h), subjects were imaged with PET/CT to 
quantify kidney activity and then immediately imaged with bremsstrahlung SPECT/CT.   Additional  
SPECT/CT was acquired at 24, [ADDRESS_407892]/CT 
clearance scaled by [CONTACT_31526]/CT activity measurement.    
The single time point approach was applied retrospectively to this data and used to calculate the kidney dose as a function of sampling time using the population means obtained for c* , a* and k
[ADDRESS_407893] sampling time from our protocol (t = 48 hours).  This is 
fairly close to the ideal sample time of 1/k2* = 50 hours.

 Discussion and conclusions:  In this paper we have demonstrated that under conditions where there is 
exponential clearance of a radiotracer and some prior knowledge about the tracer kinetics is available, 
it is possible to accurately estimate the total numbers of decays (and thereby [CONTACT_330147]) from a 
single time point measurement of activity.  The simulations from both the single exponential and 
biexponential cases show excellent results for the estimations when the appropriate sample time is 
used.  We have demonstrated that the best sample time is equal to the mean time associated with the 
rate constant k for a single exponential and k2 for the biexponential case.  The simulations support this 
result since the minimum standard error of estimate is found when T = τ .  More importantly, the actual 
clinical results obtained by [CONTACT_330148].  These results support the contention that the management of administered activity to 
patients undergoing radionuclide therapy can be determined with sufficient accuracy with a single time 
point activity measurement if information exists about population averages for the tracer kinetic 
parameters.  The most favorable condition will be obtained when the rate constant of the long 
component ( k2) is gaussian distributed with a standard deviation that is less than 30% of the mean.   
This does appear to be the case for Y -[ADDRESS_407895] one of the activity samples that was used to calculate the dose.  If there is a strong 
linear relationship, then subsequent treatments could rely on the single time point method given in this paper.  There is reason to believe that the application of this approach will substantially reduce the 
burden of both patients and the clinic through the reduction of imaging procedures over many days 
while still providing sufficient radiation dose information to guide the treatment of these patients.

Reporting and Monitoring Requirements:  
All institutional investigator initiated trials (IITs), regardless of assigned risk level are subject to routine 
DSMC monitoring activities which may include but are not limited to review of signed consent documents, eligibility and adverse event reporting .  
 
All institutional IITs have the following reporting requirements as part of their DSMP: 
• Provide an annual progress report to the DSMC and PRMC 
• Register subjects in HCCC’s Clinical Trial Management System, OnCore  
• Document Adverse Events  
• Document protocol deviations  
 
Selected monitoring strategy based on risk -level:  
 
Risk Level 4  
Interventional treatment trials involving investigational agents or devices with a risk of death* (>5% or grade 4 – 5 SAE >5%), e.g. all investigator initiated INDs, most Phase  I/II trials, gene therapy, gene manipulation or 
viral vector systems high -risk clinical procedures if performed solely for research purposes.  The use of a new 
chemical or drug for which there is limited or no available safety data in humans. 
 
Study Safety Review  
An independent study monitor and/or the DSMC Chair (or designee), will review study data (provided by [CONTACT_1600]/available in OnCore) and communicate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_330108].  A copy of this communication will be forwarded to the DSMC and PRMC Chairs.   
 
Additional Reporting Requirements:  
- A scanned copy of the completed eligibility checklist, with screening information and signature [CONTACT_330152], will be attached in OnCore for ongoing review by [CONTACT_330149].  
- Serious adverse events will be entered directly into an OnCore SAE report by [CONTACT_5051].  OnCore will send an automatic notification to the DSMC Chair/acting Chair and staff for review.  
34 
 - The DSMC utilizes a risk -based monitoring approach.  The trial's researc h records will be monitored at 
minimum twice per year.  Monitoring may be done more frequently depending on the protocol, risks to 
subjects, reported serious/adverse events, patient population and accrual rate.   Records for a minimum of 25% of subjects wi ll be monitored for the entire study.    
Monitoring will involve the following: 
• review eligibility of patients accrued to the study,  
• check for the presence of a signed informed consent,  
• determine compliance with protocol’s study plan, 
• determine whether SAE s are being appropriately reported to internal and external regulatory 
agencies,  
• compare accuracy of data in the research record with the primary source documents,  
• review investigational drug processing and documentation, 
• assess cumulative AE/SAE reports for trends and compare to study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
  Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
 For non-serious Adverse Events, documentation will begin after radiotracer injection and continue through [ADDRESS_407896] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last 
administered.  [
90Y is 64.1 hours . Therefore, 10 radioactive half -lives will be 27days ]. 
 Collected information should be recorded in the electronic/Case Report Forms (eCRF/CRF) for that subject. A description of the event, its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug (if a grade 3 or higher) should be included. Documentation should occur in real time.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
 For any experience or condition that meets the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE), recording of the event will begin after radiotracer injection and continue through [ADDRESS_407897] whole day, after the agent/intervention was last administ ered.  [
90Y is 64.1 hours. 
Therefore, 10 radioactive half -lives will be 27days ] 
Investigators must report to the DSMC any serious adverse events (SAE), whether or not they are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64).  SAEs must be reported via an OnCore 
SAE Report within 1 business of learning of the event.  
  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY of the following outcomes:   
 
1. Death  
2. A life -threatening adverse event  
3. An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330109] ≥ [ADDRESS_407898] normal life 
functions  
5. A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subj ect and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. (FDA, 21 CFR 312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6). 
  
Data Monitoring and Management  
All studies that undergo PRMC review and/or utilize HCCC Clinical Res earch Services (CRS) resources are 
required to register subjects in OnCore. Subject registration includes the following: 
• Consent date and the IRB approved consent used  
• Date of eligibility and eligibility status (eligible, not eligible)  
• On study date and s ubject’s disease site (and histology if applicable)  
• On treatment date (if applicable)  
 If/when eCRFs are developed for this study, the following data monitoring strategy will be used:  
  Subject Data  In addition to the subject registration and subject status data entered in OnCore for all HCCC trials, research staff also enter the subject study data into electronic case report forms (eCRFs) for HCCC investigator initiated studies. eCRFs are approved by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_330110]. All information on eCRFs will be traceable to the source documents which are generally maintained in the subject’s file. eCRF data are expected to be entered into OnCore within [ADDRESS_407899]’s study visit.  
 Forms Monitoring  OnCore eCRF data are monitored on a routine basis (dependent on accrual) to ensure all mandatory fields are entered completely, accurately and within time requirements. The assigned DSMC monitor manages the 
logistics associated with the data monitoring review. Once the clinical trial is identified for monitoring, the monitor arranges for a selection of cases to review from among the subjects registered in OnCore.  As part of the forms monitoring process, the assigned monitor will issue queries within the eCRF to resolve missing, incomplete and/or incorrect information. A member of the research team is expected to respond to monitoring queries within [ADDRESS_407900]’s data record is continually available to the PI, research staff, and DSMC fr om 
OnCore’s Biostat Console. The availability of this information is a valuable tool for the preparation of final reports and manuscripts as well as ongoing deficiency reports.

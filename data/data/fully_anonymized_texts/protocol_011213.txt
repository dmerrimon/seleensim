Specific Aims  
Permanent supportive housing (PSH) using a Housing First approach is an evidence -
based  intervention to end chronic homelessness by [CONTACT_7932] -barrier affordable housing 
paired with flexible health  and social services.1 In Los Angeles County (LAC), where the 
number of PSH units is expected to increase  dramatically over the next 10 years,2 clinical 
guidelines and standards for support services are lacking. This is  especially problematic given 
that the target population is older and prematurely ageing . The chronically  homeless population 
in the [LOCATION_002] has an average age approaching 60 years old3 and experiences  accelerated 
aging,4 including an elevated prevalence of geriatric syndromes such as functional impairment,  
falls, and urinary incontinence that can jeopardize PSH tenants’ ability to live independently and 
age in place.5–7 Current support services are not equipped to address these needs, which 
ultimately jeopardizes the success  of PSH to maintain high rates of housing stability while 
tenants “age in place.”[ADDRESS_7205] —Advancing Better Living for Elders, 
is a client -directed, home -based  intervention that consists of time -limited services (no more than 
6 months) from an occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (OT),  a nurse, and a handyman working collaboratively 
with the older adult client.9 CAPABLE was developed to  support older adults who are returning 
to independent living after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7923] (activities 
of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental activities of daily living [IADLs]), decrease  falls and  
nursing home admissions, and reduce health care costs based on multiple studies including 
several  randomized controlled trials.9–[ADDRESS_7206] . 
 
The specific aims of this study were to: 
1. Examine the impact of CAPABLE on PSH client outcomes (e.g., ADLs, IADLs, 
falls).  This aim  was accomplished using a pre –post design with a waitlist control 
group.  
2. Determine what adaptations, if any, need to be made to implement CAPABLE in 
PSH.  We accomplish ed this aim by [CONTACT_7933] (DAP) 
implementation approach, which  was designed to allow for an evidence -based 
practice to be adapted in a planned and considered,  rather than ad hoc, manner.  
 
Background and Significance  
The chronically homeless population in the [LOCATION_002] represents a stable, aging 
cohort whose  functional age is significantly older than its chronological age.3,[ADDRESS_7207] became visible in the 1980s. More  than three  decades into the homelessness crisis, nearly 
half of homeless adults are aged 50 or older, a significant  increase from only 11% in the early 
1990s and 32% in 2003.3,[ADDRESS_7208]  chronic disease rates  like 
housed adults aged 65 or older.4,19–[ADDRESS_7209] a higher  prevalence of geriatric 
syndromes (e.g., functional and cognitive impairments, frailty,  depression, hearing and  visual 
impairments, urinary incontinence) compared to population -based samples that are [ADDRESS_7210] approach has been recognized as the 
“clear solution” to chronic homelessness by [CONTACT_941] U.S.  federal government.[ADDRESS_7211] decade from a  previous focus  on shelters and transitional 
housing. PSH has been shown to increase quality of life27,28 and reduce overall  public costs by 
[CONTACT_7934][INVESTIGATOR_600], jails, shelters, and life on the 
streets10,3 and placing them in independent  community living.29–31 In 2013, there were more than 
280,000 PSH units  across the country, a figure that has been increasing by [CONTACT_7935] 10,000 units annually since  2006.32,33 In LAC, local health service systems and tax 
initiatives are supporting the  development of more than  20,000 units of PSH over the next 10 
years.2 To date, there has been limited research that considers whether  and how PSH programs 
can help residents maintain independent living as they age (i.e., “age in place”).[ADDRESS_7212] (TAP) study (R21AG050009; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_7924]). As part of the PI’s 
recently  completed NIA -funded R21 study, 237 adults aged 45 or older were recruited from two 
PSH agencies in Los  Angeles, [LOCATION_004]. Residents completed in -person interviews on 
demographics, housing and homelessness  history, and overall health status. We also assessed 
common geriatric syndromes. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_7925] 57 years old, we found 42% of 
respondents had difficulty performing ADLs (e.g., bathing, dressing) and  68% reported having 
difficulty performing IADLs (e.g., taking transportation, managing medication). More than  half 
of the sample (56%) had experienced one or more falls in the past year. [ADDRESS_7213]  (SRHT), to pi[INVESTIGATOR_7926]. SRHT ha d the required staffing for 
CAPABLE, including an  advanced practice OT staff member , nurses from LAC DHS who are 
assigned to SRHT tenants through their existing  Housing for  Health program, and existing 
handyman resources. CAPABLE training is required for nurses and  OTs, which will be provided 
by [CONTACT_7936], where the intervention was  developed . The training 
took approximately 20 hours to complete and include d: five 60 -minute o n-line learning modules 
(self-paced, recommended to be completed  over the course of two  weeks); up to an 8 -hour live 
(virtual) training; and five coaching calls or webinars. The implementation of CAPABLE over 6 
months  was used to accomplish both study aims.  
The program was initially scheduled to begin in March 2020 but due to the onset of the 
COVID -19 pandemic was delayed until February 2021. During this time, study measures were 
updated to be maximally consistent with other CAPABLE studies in collaboration w ith Johns 
Hopkins School of Nursing (JHSN) that provided Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) data 
dictionaries. JHSN also provided on-line CAPABLE training to RNs and OTs along with 
ongoing technical assistance phone calls throughout the project. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the trained OT 
was a full -time staff member at the PSH agency, and the two trained RNs worked part -time 
through an online sche duling platform with oversight from a local federally qualified health 
center .

Aim 1: Examine the impact of CAPABLE on PSH client outcomes.  
Implementation of CAPABLE.  We trained  two registered nurses (RNs) and an OT to 
handle a  caseload of [ADDRESS_7215] cases, the OT made  six visits, the RN made  four 
visits, and a  handyman made one to two visits to modify the client’s home during a 6 -month 
period. However, t he program can be  completed in fewer visits, with a  minimum of four OT 
visits and three RN visits . CAPABLE home visits are key to meeting participants “where they 
are.” The first visits for the OT and RN were usually [ADDRESS_7216] of 30 tenants randomized to initially 
receive  the intervention. Two  tenants  decided they no longer wanted to participate in the 
program and one  could not be r econtact[INVESTIGATOR_530]  (the team later discovered this person had died), 
leaving [ADDRESS_7217] control group completed a follow -up research assessment, along with the 17 who 
had finished the CAPABLE intervention at that time. By [CONTACT_933] 2021, the remaining 10 
tenants all completed the CAPABLE program but only nine had completed the follow -up 
research assessment; one person declined to complete but was contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] [ADDRESS_7218] intervention visits occurred in person at the participant’s residence (a few visits by 
[CONTACT_7937]). All research data collection was conducted by [CONTACT_7938] -19 safety protocols. PSH tenants received a $[ADDRESS_7219] for completing the baseline 
assessment and a $[ADDRESS_7220] year at baseline ; these items were 
asked again at follow -up but used only a 6 -month retrospective. Additional health -related 
outcomes measure d at baseline and follow -up included  information on : ADLs and IADL s; falls 
efficacy; de pression; pain interference  with usual activities; self -rated hea lth; and overall quality 
of life. A desc ription of primary outcome measures are inclu ded in the following table:  
 
Table 1. Descri ption of primary outcome measures.  
 
Mea sure Description  
Katz Activities of 
Daily Living Scale  The modified Katz ADL Scale w as used to rate ability to bathe, 
dress, transfer, toilet, and eat using three  categories: no difficulty , a 
little or some difficulty , or a lot of difficulty or inability to perform .[ADDRESS_7221] year w as assessed by [CONTACT_7939]: “Did 
you fall to the ground  in the past year ?” [ADDRESS_7222] year w as also assessed. 
Falls eff icacy  Participants rated their confidence they could do each of 10 
activities without falling on a 10 -point scale, with total scores 
ranging from 10 (not very confident) to 100 (very confident) using 
the Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale.  
Depression  Eight of the nine items in the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 were 
used to measure depression, rated on a 4 -point scale of how 
frequently participants were bothered by [CONTACT_7940] a 
2-week period (0 = not at all, 1 = several days, 2 = more th an half 
the days, and 3 = nearly every day). 39 Items were summed to obtain 
a score with minimum and maximum values of 0 to 24, respectively, 
whereby [CONTACT_7941].  
Pain interfere nce with 
usual activities  Pain interference with usual activities was assessed using an item 
from the 3 -item PEG to assess average pain intensity (P), 
interference with enjoyment of life (E), and interference with 
general activity (G) on a 10 -point Likert scale from 0 (does not 
interfere) to 10 (completely interferes).  
 
 
Statistical Analysis  Plan. We conducted a power analysis using G*Power to estimate the power 
obtained with [ADDRESS_7223] up to a 30% overall dropout rate 
while maintaining sufficient power . 
The balance between the intervention and control groups at baseline was assessed using 
Fisher ’s exact test for nominal varia bles, the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel test for ordinal 
variables, and two -sample  t-tests for continuous and count variables. Given that the main 
analytic goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_7927], we calculated 
within - and between -group standardized mean differences (Cohen’s  d) between time points. 
These tests were also used to compare differences in falls, ER visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7928] -up. To consider statistically significant changes in key outcomes in 
each study group (i.e., intervention versus  control) between baseline and follow -up, we also used 
paired  t-tests. Between -group analyses included a two -sample  t-test to test whether the mean 
change in outcomes between baseline and follow -up differed between the intervention and 
control groups .  
Aim 2: Determine what adaptations, if any, need to be made to implement CAPABLE in 
PSH.  
Adaptation of CAPABLE.  Following the DAP implementation approach, which was 
designed to allow an evidence -based practice to be adapted in a planned and considered, rather 
than ad hoc, manner,[ADDRESS_7224] ed that within PSH, CAPABLE w ould need to  include 
collaboration with existing PSH case workers and social workers. DAP is a continuously 
iterative  process, in that ongoing experience can inform continued adaptation as needed. 
Although DAP can be used  during all four phases of the implementation conceptual model 
known as EPIS (i.e., exploration, preparation,  implementation, and sustainment),41,42 this study 
focus ed on two of the phases: preparation and  implementation. The initial exploration phase was 
completed as part of our previous work (see  Preliminary Studies section), and the 
implementation  phase represents this next step .  
Data collection and monitoring.  The investigative team (Henwood and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7929]) had primary  
responsibility for monitoring the implementation of CAPABLE through weekly case reviews and  
note taking  on any possible deviations from the model. The investigative team met monthly with 
the larger  implementation resource team (IRT), which  include d the developers of the CAPABLE 
model, via a  conference call to discuss fidelity to CAPABLE and consider adaptation needs. 
With DAP, adaptations were  explicit and done in a planned way by [CONTACT_6606], in conjunction with 
service providers and coaches, to preserve  fidelity to core components. This w as accomplished 
by [CONTACT_7942]. Discussion and decisions were 
documented through an ongoing audit trail.43  
Data analysis.  At the end of the implementation phase, the IRT review ed all 
implementation decisions  documented in the audit trail and determine d what adaptations of 
CAPABLE should be included for PSH. These  decisions w ere formalized through a written 
manual to be used for future implementation and research  projects.

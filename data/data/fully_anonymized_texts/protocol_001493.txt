1. INTRODUCTION  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous 
system (CNS) that a ffects approximately 2.[ADDRESS_791098] patients event ually experience progression and accumulation 
of symptoms which can include profound muscle weakness, impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive and visual impairments and sexual dysfunction [1].  
In patients that have disability t hat involves the upper extremity, this  
can lead to loss of independence in activities of daily living such as dressing, feeding and hygiene [2]. Upper extremity (UE) strength is also important for a 
patient being able to independently shift weight in a wheelchair, maneuver an 
electric wheelchair,  and change position in bed, thus minimizing risk for 
decubitus ulcers. As opposed to lower extremity function, a very small loss of strength and function can translate into significant changes in functional independ ence. The loss of independence then impacts quality of life ( QoL) for 
both the patient and the caregiver(s).  
 
2. OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIV ES 
To measure for clinical stabilization  (defined as no significant change ( ≤20%)  
from baseline of UE function  in multiple sclerosis patients with upper extremity  
impairment  treated with Ocrevus™.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_791099] IVES  
To evaluate the relationship between UE function (objective and subjective)  and 
fatigue, cognition and QoL.  
 
3.      STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF  THE STUDY  
Ocrevus™ is the first FDA approved disease- modifying treatment for primary 
progressive MS as well as relapsing MS [3]. In the clinical trials considered by [CONTACT_1622] (OPERA I/II, ORATORIO), the highest Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) inclu ded in the participants was 5.5 (OPERA I/II) and 6.5 
(ORATORIO) [4]. The EDSS score is heavily weighted on walking ability and is not a useful measurement for UE function [5,6]. The primary endpoint in the primary progressi ve MS trial with Ocrevus™ was EDS S and in the relapsing MS 
studies, EDSS was used as a secondary endpoint. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) score (Z score), a composite of quantitative measure of walking speed, upper limb coordinated movement ([ADDRESS_791100]/9HPT ) and c ognitive function, was obtained as a secondary clinical 
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
4/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  measure with scores being favorably higher in patients treated with Ocrevus™ 
(OPERA I/II).The z score, however, is not very useful in delineating which of the three clinical functions was maintained or showed less progression given that three domains are included in the score [7,8,9]. Data presented recently  from 
the Oratorio trial analyzed the intention to treat population of PPMS patients and 
the subgroups of patients with upper extremity functional impairment using the 
9HPT ; results demonstrated reduction in risk of clinical progression in upper 
extremity disability in patients treated with Ocrevus compared to placebo.  There 
was improvement in the change from baseline to week 120 in 9HPT time in 
treated patients.  Abnormal baseline  9HPT was defined as >25 seconds and 
upper extremities were defined as “better hand” and “worse hand” , each 
individually tested, with clinical progression determined at 12 and 24 weeks in 3 sub-categories of progression: leng thened time of 9HPT >15%, >20% and 25%. 
[10] 
In our study w e aim to not only replicate the results in the Oratorio  trial with 
upper extremity dysfunction, but also widen the spectrum of patients that may benefit (given an expanded MS population of patients , not exclusive to PPMS 
and widen the range of potential disability that the patients may have (broader  
EDSS rage 4 -8). We anticipate that by [CONTACT_2329] a test that better emulates activities 
of daily life performed with the upper extremity, such as the TEMPA ( Test 
d’Evaluation de la performance des membres Superieurs e Personnes Agees)  
we will obtain more real life application of the benefits of receiving treatment with 
Ocrevus, and anticipate that patients can maintain the function they have or potentially imp rove function.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_791101] UDY DESIGN 
We anticipate the use of Ocrevus™ in patients with progressive disease which 
includes  those with advanced disability , regardless of a dearth of data to guide 
the prescriber regarding its effect in this populat ion.  The rational for this study is 
to gain information which will help the prescribers of Ocrevus™ answer the question “Will Ocrevus™ help me  if I have hand or arm weakness ?” especially  if 
posed by a more advanced MS patient (EDSS 4 .0-8.0 with UE involvement) 
than those included in the clinical trial s. In previous trials (ORATORIO), the 
included patients were only those diagnosed with primary progressive MS and their entry EDSS was of a lower disability range (3.0- 6.5) than those proposed in 
this study. T herefore, the results cannot be completely extrapolated to the 
population of multiple sclerosis patients with more advanced disability that we propose to study.  We aim to identify MS patients that have weakness in at least 
one upper limb , knowing that delaying disability affecting the functional use of 
the UE will help patients remain independent for some activities of daily life and 
will contribute to an improved quality of life.  
 The importance of choosing validated upper limb outcome assessment tools cannot be emphasized enough. The Nine- Hole Peg Test ( 9HPT), an objective 
measure of manual dexterity, which is  incorporated into the MSFC , is a widely 
used measure across most  clinical trials in multiple sclerosis populations.   
 
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
5/P Version 4.[ADDRESS_791102] d'Evaluation de la performance des Membres Supérieurs des 
Personnes Agées  (TEMPA ) has been previously studied for validity in clinical 
trials  and specifically in multiple sclerosis patient populations  and the re was a 
strong  correlation between the TEMPA and 9HPT . [11, 12] The TEMPA consists 
of 9 tasks that mimic tasks of daily living such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a jar, pouring water 
from a pi[INVESTIGATOR_39179], handling coins, writing on an envelope and opening a pi[INVESTIGATOR_598223] , as examples . The tasks are assessed by a rater by [CONTACT_598236] (seconds)  and by [CONTACT_598237]’s independence in 
performing them using an ordinal scale of 0 (completed without difficulty) to - 3 
(could not complete the task ). The test provides a unilateral and bilateral score 
and evaluates different grasp, grip and pi[INVESTIGATOR_598224].  Obtaining baseline 
scores and sequential measurements will  allow us to graph  scores over time for 
each patient and assess the change. T his type of testing  would give us a clear 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_598225] - stability of function vs 
clinical progression >20% change from baseline. This  key data would be a 
helpful reference when discussing starting treatment with Ocrevus™ in this 
population of patients.  
 
The normative values available for the TEMPA were obtained in the elderly (ages 60- 80, men and women). The speed of execution of the 9 tasks in each 
hand takes about 70 to 80 seconds to complete in this population.  [12] 
When one reviews the validity study of the TEMPA in MS patients [average EDSS was 7 and age median was 46 years old], this same parameter took them between 100 and 400 seconds [1  and 1/2 to 6 minutes] to complete.  
 Schwid et al in 2002 showed that MS patients did not vary from their baselines in performing the 9HPT  by >20% day -to day and therefore the if there was 
change measured >20% from their baseline this was stipulated to indicate change in function [13]. 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_43297] a technology enhanced training program for improving upper limb muscle strength in MS patients the TEMPA was used at baseline and 8 weeks later, and there was a trend towards statistical significance of improvement in function with TEMPA change of 20 to 40 seconds [14].  
Since the 9HPT and TEMPA have been show to correlate and there are numerical values measured in both, we plan to emulate the Oratorio study 
and look at   >15%, >20% and >25% [in better hand and in worse hand] change 
from baseline with increases in time implying clinical progression and stability or decrease in time implying stability or improvement in function.  
  
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
6/P Version 4.[ADDRESS_791103] 
to meas ure grip strength  [15]. Grip strength is an important part of daily living  
tasks and can give clinicians insight into patient restrictions and clinical 
changes.   
 
The Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) is a self -report questionnaire that  
has been found reliable, valid and sensitive as a patient - reported outcome 
measure tool for quantifying UE function  rated on a 5 -point Likert scale This 20-
item measure is recommended in research and clinical setting due to its uni -
dimensionality: it measures only UE  function [ 16,17]. Scores range from 0 to 60 
with lower scores indicating more functional difficulty.  It has been used in 
several studies in patients with musculoskeletal upper extremity problems, to 
include patients with MS, and UEFI scores correlated with mean 9- HPT scores. 
[18] We anticipate  that patients in our study will have perceived stabilization of 
their upper extremity function and plan to use the UEFI to measure this by [CONTACT_598238] [ADDRESS_791104] (SDMT) is a validated measure used to assess mental processing speed in MS clinical trials and has an oral response version.  
There is  evidence that cognitive measures may correlate with upper extremit y 
function. This can possibly be explained by a cerebral relationship between 
motor function and cognition [ 19]. As a secondary measure we will collect 
SDMTs at each visit to explore correlations with upper extremity function, as well as QoL measures . 
 The natural history of progression of disability in MS is foreseeable in a 2- year 
span period  and this is evident when one examines the placebo population in 
the recent Oratorio trial ; obtaining these measures over a 2- year period aims to 
observe stability of  the upper limb function with Ocrevus™ treatment.  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES  
• The UE function will be assessed every [ADDRESS_791105] a sufficient  length of time 
that can be compared in order to assess for any type of change over time. *  
• Incidence of UE  functional changes (improved, worsening or stable)  with scores 
of time and performance on the TEMPA.  
• In this group of patients (advanced disability) there is less concern with relapse rate red uction; relapses happen at a low rate. There is more concern regarding 
any loss of function, and we will focus on UE  function. Studies like this would 
provide better data for this type of patient aiding in the process of selecting appropriate disease modif ying therapy.  
*UE function includes measures on the TEMPA, UEFI and 9HPT.  
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
7/P Version 4.[ADDRESS_791106] ive and answered by [CONTACT_102]. The Upper Extremity Functional 
Index (UEFI) is a self -administered questionnaire which measures disability in 
patients  with upper extr emity conditions. The questionnaire lists [ADDRESS_791107] poss ible score is 0. A lower score indicates that 
the person is reporting increased difficulty with the activities as a result of their 
upper limb condition. The change from baseline per patient and for group means will be analyzed. A clinically significant change is determined as a 12% change.  
[20]  
 
The TEMPA scale is composed of nine  standardized tasks which represents 
activities of daily living. Four items are unilateral (pi[INVESTIGATOR_598226] a jar; pi[INVESTIGATOR_7049] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_598227] a glass; handle coins; pi[INVESTIGATOR_598228]) and five bilateral  tasks (open a jar and take a spoonful of coffee; unlock 
a lock and open a pi[INVESTIGATOR_598229]; write on an envelope and stick on a stamp; shuffle and deal playing cards; put a scarf around one ’s neck). The outc ome 
parameters used in this study are speed of execution (seconds) and the functional rating. The functional rating refers to the participant’s independence in 
each task measured on a four -level scale: (0) successfully completed without 
hesitation or diffi culty; ( -1) completed, but with some difficulty; ( -2) partially 
executed or some steps were performed with significant difficulty; and ( -3) not 
completed, even if any degree of assistance was offered.  A total score will be 
determined by [CONTACT_598239]. Individual analysis of the unilateral and bilateral scores will be conducted 
to evaluate for functional improvement in the affected UE. Scores typi[INVESTIGATOR_381599] 0 to -50, with higher scores representi ng better performance. [12 ] The UE 
function will be measured by a consistent rater that is trained and qualified (must be a MD or equivalent).   The 9HPT is  an objective measure of manual dexterity, which is  incorporated 
into the MSFC , is a widely used measure across most  clinical trials in multiple 
sclerosis populations. The time to completion is measured twice on both the 
dominant and non- dominant hand. For this study purpose will also record the 
“better” and “worse” limb so that the data can be cautiousl y compared to prior 
studies completed in multiple sclerosis patients. The task of the 9HPT is for the patient to pi[INVESTIGATOR_598230], one at a time, and place it in the board (that has the same number of peg holes for each peg). Once all the pegs are placed in the peg holes the patient then removes each peg, again one at a time, placing them back into the peg bowl from which they were originally located. Although this measure has been used in several multiple sclerosis trials due to its ease of admi nistration, there are many other factors of upper extremity 
function that are not being assessed that can be captured by [CONTACT_598240].   
3.3.1  Primary Outcome Measure  
No significant c hange in UE  function  over 24 months after initiation of Ocrevus™

significant change (within 20%) of TEMPA score from baseline to 24 months  
 
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
No signif icant c hange in UEFI,  or 9HPT from baseline to 24 months.  
Exploratory measures: correlations between change in TEMPA/UEFI/9HPT 
scores and  FSS, MUSIQOL and SDMT values from  baseline through 24months 
after treatment initiation with Ocrevus ™.  
3.4 SAFETY PLAN  
Patients will be evaluated at each study visit for the duration of their participation 
in the study  for any new adverse events  (AEs) , especially  for those that may 
interfere with the testing or commercial dosing schedule.  
3.5 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW S AND REGULATI ONS  
This study will be conducted in accordance with current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), and local ethical and legal requirements.  
4.0 MATERIALS AND METHOD S 
This is a 24 -month,  prospective,  observational study which w ill be conducted at 
the University of South [LOCATION_012] (USF) MS Center.  On average 80- [ADDRESS_791108] satisfy the approved therapeutic indication for Ocrevus™. 
Decision to treat with Ocrevus™ must precede enrollment.  We anticipate 
enrollment will be random and open to any patient that meets the criteria below which will aid in the evaluation of our results to the general MS population.  The 
targeted population are those patients that more often rely on their upper extremity function for activities  of daily living  due to impairment in other systems 
such as gait. ) 
 
Every effort  to maintain consistency (by [CONTACT_598242]) for the 
administration of the upper extremity assessments will be made. The same instructions for the patient questionnaires will be g iven at each time point.

Genentech Study Center, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_290222].  Reasons for terminating the study may include the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs  in thi s or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory

• Study protocol not followed 
 
4.[ADDRESS_791113] to compare the 24 month measurements to the baseline 
measurements.  
Mean within- patient changes from baseline through 24 months ( TEMPA).  One-
way repeated measures AN COVA for TEMPA  scores from baseline, 6 months, 
12 months, 18 months, 24 months  which will account  for baseline characteristics  
(baseline disability level) . A soft stratification will be applied so that recruitment 
will aim to in clude a spread of types of patients, those below overall EDSS of 6.0 
and those above 6.0. If more  than 2/[ADDRESS_791114] nor mal distribution, then other non- parametric analysis will 
be employed (such as sign test  for TEMPA functional score).  
 The threshold to determine a significant clinical change will be > 20% from 
baseline value. This clinically significant difference is esti mated based on data 
from the Oratorio trials that showed progression among both groups (placebo 
and Ocrevus
TM) but to a lesser extent in the OcrevusTM arm with an established 
clinically significant threshold of 20% (data will be requested from sponsor for 
use to review 9HPT results for the abnormal function at baseline group of 
patients ). Measures will be collected and analyzed as units of time (seconds)  
and as functional scores on an ordinal scale that range from 0 to - 3 (0 indicating 
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
13/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  no signs of dysfunctio n).Ad hoc analysis may occur that includes evaluation of 
patients with significant clinical changes versus those that did not have 
significant clinical change  based on any of the subscales within the TEMPA  or 
physical exam.  We will review   >15%, >20% and >25% [in better hand and in 
worse hand] change from baseline with increases in time implying clinical 
progression and stability or decrease in time implying stability or improvement in 
function  
 
b. Secondary Endpoints  
Pearson correlation coefficients will be calculated to evaluate correlations 
between UE function (measured by [CONTACT_598245] 9HPT) primarily at baseline b ut 
also at  each time point over the 24- month time period to  compare patient 
responses on the UEFI, FSS, and MUSIQOL . Correlations with the primar y 
endpoint scores and the SDMT  will also be analyzed for any indication of new 
cognitive impairment that may interfere with the interpretation of the results.

imputation will be used. If greater than two percent missing, multiple point 
imputation measures will be used.  
4.9.6  Determination of Sample Size  
It is expected that 30 patients will be eligible to enter this study during the 
proposed t imeframe. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799];  the TEMPA is a more comprehensive 
assessment of upper extremity function which we will use in the analysis of this  
group of patients to evaluate what percentage remain stable (within 20% 
variation from baseline) and analyze correlations with other measures of upper 
extremity function (9HPT and patient perception using the UEFI).  Therefore, this 
is not a calculated sample size as there is a lack of historical data available for 
this population  and the modalities of testing  we plan to utilize . We do not have 
historical data to gather estimates for an accurate power calculation.  We plan to 
gather data on 30 patients but will screen up to 35 in case of screen failures or early withdraw als. Even with the limited calculations we believe that we will be 
able to analyze for a clinically meaningful lack of change (stabilization).  
  
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
14/P Version 4.[ADDRESS_791116] of monitoring and reporting adverse events 
(AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  per protocol.   This includes  all events 
of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
Adverse Events 
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol -imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution.  
 
This includes the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -
specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with Multiple Sclerosis  that were not present prior to the AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol -mandated interventions (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment 
associated with medication washout, no treatment run- in, or other protocol -
mandated intervention.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_598246] -specified AE reporting period.  
Serious Adverse Events 
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother exposed to the IMP.  
• It is consider ed a significant medical event by [CONTACT_108976] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).

15/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020   
5.2   METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY 
VARIABLES  
 The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are 
observed or reported during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, 
appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND 
Safety Re ports).  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs  as described in section 5.[ADDRESS_791117] administration of 
study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
Assessment of Adverse Events 
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_45949], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE 
or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and end dates), regulatory 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to ocrelizumab (see 
following guidance), and actions taken.  
 To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causal ity assessments, investigators 
should apply the following general guideline:  
Yes 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of ocrelizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical stat e, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
AE follows a known pattern of response to ocrelizumab; and/or the AE abates or 
resolv es upon discontinuation of ocrelizumab  or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
No 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than ocrelizumab  (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to ocrelizumab administratio n (e.g., event  diagnosed [ADDRESS_791118] dose of 
ocrelizumab).  
 Expected AEs are those AEs  that are listed or characterized in the Package 
Insert  (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure (IB).  
 
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
16/P Version 4.[ADDRESS_791119] evaluation time points 
should be adopted. Examples of non- directive questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new  or changed health problems since you were last   
       here?”  
Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting 
AEs or SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a 
single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is acceptable  to report 
the information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see 
Section 5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that c aused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
17/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  c. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. 
Such conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be re- assessed throughout the trial and 
reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of  the 
condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_188215] (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).  
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38265]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598231]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15430]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598232]  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_38267].  
e. Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events 
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5 .0 Update 
current versions) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Below Table  should be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are not 
specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.

a. Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b. Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by [CONTACT_27947].  
c. If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event  
d. Grade [ADDRESS_791120] dose of ocrelizumab, a report should be completed and 
expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow -up to obtain the outcome 
of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spontaneous, s hould always be classified as serious, and expeditiously 
reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to the ocrelizumab should be reported as an 
SAE.  
 
Protocol:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
19/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  Additional information on any ocrelizumab- exposed pregnancy and infant will be 
requested by  [CONTACT_38310] (i.e. after having 
received the initial report, at the end of  the second trimester, 2 weeks after the 
expected date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the  infant’s life).  
 
g. Post -Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject 
has completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior ocrelizumab exposure. If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE  adequately to Genentech Drug Safety during the follow -up 
period.  
 
h. Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports  
The Sponsor agrees to conduct  the Case Transmission verification to ensure 
that all single case reports have been adequately received by [CONTACT_598247] a Quarterly line- listing documenting single 
case reports sent by [CONTACT_598248].  
The periodic line- listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the 
end of the agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be recei ved within 
the time period mutually agreed upon.  
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case- by-case basis until sati sfactory resolution.  The 
sponsor shall receive reconciliation guidance documents within the ‘Activation Package’.  
Following Case Transmission Verification, single case reports which have not been received by [CONTACT_598249] (5) calendar days from request by [CONTACT_8229].  
At the end of the study, a final cumulative Case Transmission Verification report will be sent to Genentech .  
 
i.  AEs of Special Interest (AESI)  
AESIs are a subset of Events to Monitor (Et Ms) of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the product, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_125478]. Such an event might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it . 
Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by [CONTACT_598250]:  (University of South [LOCATION_012]}  
20/P Version 4.1  10JAN2020  to other parties (e.g., Regulatory Authorities) may also be warranted . 
 
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:  
• Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical j aundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law: 
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 × ULN in combination with clinical 
jaundice  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below  
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non- pathogenic, 
is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that 
indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applie s only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected  
 
  
j. Adverse Event  Reporting

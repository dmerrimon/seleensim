DATE/NAME [CONTACT_214110]  
22April2020 
by [CONTACT_214071], Amendment 2:  
This protocol was amended to update exclusion criterion #9 in order to aid in 
recruitment . Cut--off values for hemoglobin entry levels is not required for this 
study’s  population (patients with end- stage renal disease) . Removal of this 
criterion will not affect patients safety upon drug administration  and will not 
interfere with study endpoints . 
Therefore , the last bullet in Section 11.2 Exclusion Criteria, criterion #  9, 
“Hemoglobin concentration < 10 g/dL at screening or  check -in on Day - 8” was 
removed.  
In addition, the protocol clarification dated February 12, [ADDRESS_257073]-dose blood collections were thus added.  
01May2019  
by [CONTACT_214072], Amendment 1:  
This protocol was amended at the Sponsor’s request to add sample timepoints 
for protein C in order to characterize protein C in all hemodialysis sessions . 
Additional  samples will be collected at the start and at the end of hemo dialysis 
on Days - 7, -5, -2, and 3. Thus the total number of time points for protein C 
analysis sample collection will increase from 8 to 16:  
In Section 6 –  Study Event Flow Chart , collection of blood samples for protein 
C analysis were added at the start and the end of hemo dialysis on Days - 7, -5, -2, 
and 3.  
In Section 13.8 -  Blood Volume for Study Assessments , Table 3 -  Blood

Page 9 5. SYNOPSIS  
Compound E-WE thrombin  (AB002)  
Active ingredient: E -WE thrombin (0.1 mg/mL)  
Buffer: 16.2  mM sodium citrate, 3.8  mM citric acid, 150  mM 
sodium chloride, 0.1% polysorbate 80, at pH 6  
Clinical Indication  Prevention of clot formation in hemodialyzer circuits during 
hemodialysis  (HD)   
Study Phase  Phase 2 
Study Objectives  The primary objective of this study is: 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of 
E-WE thrombin infused into the dialysis line during a 
4-hour HD procedure in patients with end stage renal 
disease ( ESRD ). 
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single dose of 
E-WE thrombin infused into the dialysis line during a 
4-hour HD procedure in patients with ESRD. A ctivated 
protein C/protein C inhibitor complex (APC -PCI) will be 
used as a surrogate biomar ker for drug exposure.  
• To assess the efficacy of a single dose of E -WE thrombin 
infused into the dialysis line during a 4- hour HD 
procedure in patients with ESRD. Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_214074] (evaluated by [CONTACT_31519]) and 
measurement of urea removed by 4 hours of dialysis  (ratio 
of volume of fluid completely cleared of urea [Kt/V] and 
urea reduction ratio [URR]) . 
Study Design This is a phase  2, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlle d, 
single -dose study of E-WE thrombin designed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy at [ADDRESS_257088] during HD conducted at one study center in the United 
States (US).   
Patients will be enrolled in Cohort 1 or Cohort  2; cohorts will be 
dosed sequentially. Dosing of Cohort  2 will commence following 
completion of all study events for all patients in Cohort  1. Within 
each cohort, patients will be randomized to receive active drug or 
matching placebo as summarized below:

3 µg/kg  2:1 12:6 
This study includes a screening period of 28 days prior to 
checking  in to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day  -8. From 
Day -8 (8 days prior to dosing on Day 1) through Day 3, all 
patients will undergo HD 5 times and will be assessed for all 
scheduled procedures and endpoints before and after each HD session as per the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6), using 
only one type of dialyzer cartridge for each patient.  
On Day 1, prior to dosing, patients will undergo baseline 
measurements followed by [CONTACT_214075] a regular HD procedure, consistently using only one type of dialyzer cartridge for each 
patient. A single dose of E-WE thrombin or matching placebo 
will be administered  into the dialysis line during the HD 
procedure . Patients will continue to undergo HD procedures and 
scheduled assessments from Day  1 through Day 3. 
Study assessments will include adverse events (AEs) , including 
HD vascular access site (arteriovenous [AV] fistula or AV graft)  
reactions , physical examinations, vital sign measurements , 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs), clinical laboratory tests , 
coagulation tests, immunogenicity assessments , and PD blood 
sampling for APC -PCI and measurement of urea removed by 
4 hours of dialysis to be performed throughout the study 
according to the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6). On 
Days  -7, -5, -2, 1, and 3, bleeding time from the HD vascular 
access sites on the AV fistula or AV graft (ladder or buttonhole 
technique) will be evaluated immediately at the end of the HD 
session. The dialyzer cartridge will be rinsed, visua lly inspected 
and graded against a standardized visual assessment scale at the 
end of the HD procedure , and photographed on 4 sides .  
Additionally, plasma and dialysate samples will be collected and sent to Sponsor along with the used and rinsed dialyzer cartri dges 
for potential internal  evaluation of plasma protein C, dialysate 
urea, and total protein accumulation with in the dialyzer cartridge.

Page 11 All patients who receive the study drug or matching placebo 
(including patients who terminate the study early) will return to  
the CRU on Day 14 (± 2 days) for coagulation tests , 
immunogenicity sample collection , and to determine if any AE 
has occurred since the last study visit . 
Number of Patients  A total of at least 36 adult male and female (of non -childbearing 
potential) patients will be enrolled; [ADDRESS_257089] 50% of 
females and at least 30% of a race /ethnic minority group. An 
attempt will also be made to approximately match key characteristics, including sex, average age, and weight between cohorts . 
Duration of 
Participation for 
Patient s The total planned duration of patient participation is 
approximately 50 days from screening to follow -up, with CRU 
confinement from check -in on Day  -8 to Day  3. Patients will 
return to the CRU on Day  14 (± 2 days) for follow -up procedures.  
Dosage, Dosage 
Form, Route, and 
Dose Regimen:  On Day 1, patients in each cohort will receive a single dose of 
E-WE thrombin or matching placebo as a bolus followed by [CONTACT_214076] a 4- hour HD procedure . 
Cohort  1 will be completed prior to initiation of Cohort 2.  
Planned doses will be as follows:  
Cohort 1: 0.5  µg/kg bolus  dose administered  into the dialysis line 
immediately followed by a 0.25 µg/kg/hour continuous infusion 
dose into the dialysis line  over 4 hours  of E-WE thrombin or 
matching placebo , for a total dose of 1.5 µ g/kg. 
Cohort 2: 1  µg/kg bolus dose administered  into the dialysis line 
immediately  followed by a 0.5 µg/kg/hour continuous  infusion 
dose into the dialysis line  over 4 hours  of E-WE thrombin or 
matching placebo , for a total dose of 3 µg/kg.  
Key Assessments  Safety  
Safety assessment s will include number and severity of AEs 
(including HD vascular access site reactions ), physical 
examinations, bleeding time  from the HD vascular access sites , 
vital sign  measurements , 12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory tests , 
and coagulation tests .  
Number  and severity of AE will be tabulated and summary 
statistics for the 12 -lead ECGs, vital  signs, clinical laboratory  and 
coagulation tests may be computed and provided, as deemed 
clinically appropriate.  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol  Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 12 Pharmacodynamics:  
Plasma APC -PCI will be meas ured as a surrogate biomarker of 
drug exposure . Efficacy of antithrombotic activity will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_214077] 
(evaluated by [CONTACT_31519]) . Efficiency of HD will be 
assessed using blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) levels before and after 
dialysis to determine urea removed by 4 hours of dialysis (Kt/V  
and URR) after E -WE thrombin active treatment versus 
pre-treatment and placebo .  
Change from baseline for all PD measurements will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (2  active dose levels and pooled 
placebo) and per timepoints using descriptive statistics.  
Immunogenicity:  
Development of antibodies to  E-WE thrombin or wild type (WT) 
thrombin will be monitored using a multi -tiered approach that 
will include screening, confirmatory, and if applicable, antibody 
titer and neutralizing antibody assays.

Page 19 8. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
8.1 Introduction  
E-WE thrombin (AB002) is a recombinant antithrombotic protein C activator enzyme analog 
of human alpha thrombin . Intravenously injected E -WE thrombin generates  endogenous 
activated protein C (APC) on intravascular cell surfaces  and does not  change  fibrinogen or 
platelet count in healthy adult subjects  while at its intended pharmacological doses . Due to 
avid binding of E -WE thrombin  to thrombin receptors , predominantly thrombomodulin and 
GPIb on cells, therapeutic doses of the free (unbound) active enzyme are likely cleared from 
the circulation in secon ds to minutes. Free E -WE thrombin, if any, that is not associated with 
a thrombin receptor after the minimum effective dose , is unlikely to exhibit measurable 
pharmacological activity.  
E-WE thrombin was developed by [CONTACT_214078], Inc. under the product identification  number 
AB002 and is intended for single dose administration into the blood circulation through a 
venous access . Proposed indications  for E -WE thrombin include  arterial thrombosis and 
thromboembolism, including those associated with acute cer ebrovascular accident s, acute 
coronary syndrome  and other severe acute thrombus formation -associated ischemic events.  
Additional indications may include peri -interventional and extracorporeal organ support -
associated thromboprophylaxis, and temporal antiinflammatory treatment.   
A brief overview of available information regarding AB002 follows below. Details can be 
found in the E-WE thrombin, AB002 Investigator’s Brochure of 25 February 2019 [1]. 
8.[ADDRESS_257094] that a ntithrombotic 
treatment with E -WE thrombin could utilize an endogenous targeting system via cell -surface 
associated thrombin receptors including, am ong others, thrombomodulin and glycoprotein Ib 
[2], which are variably expressed on the luminal surfaces of blood vessels, platelets, and 
other cel ls. One of the putative mechanisms of action, in vivo , is binding of E -WE thrombin 
to circulating platelets, which are expected to deliver and concentrate E -WE thrombin on the 
thrombus, which is the site of desired pharmacological activity. At the thrombus  interface, 
E-WE thrombin cleaves receptor -associated protein C, generating the potent endogenous 
antithrombotic and antiinflammatory enzyme APC . Unlike antithrombin, a direct inhibitor  of 
enzymatic coagulation factors , endogenous APC cleaves and inactivat es co-localized 
cofactors Va and VIIIa, thereby [CONTACT_214079] . Both endogenous and infused exogenous APC are capable of 
interrupting natural and experimental thrombogenesis , however , without the risk of 
paralyzing hemostasis . In fact, gene silencing or knockdown of factor V and/or VIII  results in 
viable, though hemophilic animals. Complete factor VIII deficiency in people or animals 
increases the risk of bleeding and causes a bleeding  disorder (hemophilia), but is generally 
compatible with life. Low levels of factor V and factor VIII also increase the risk of bleeding, 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_257095] that APC  (predominantly protein C receptor bound) 
exerts additional protective effects by [CONTACT_214080], such as protease activated receptors [ADDRESS_257096] notable antihemostatic activity. T he endogenous APC that escapes 
the surface at low E -WE thrombin doses does not increase clotting and bleeding times 
outside the normal range . The efficacy of E -WE thrombin has been established in several 
experimental models , including a mouse model of stroke  [3], a mouse model of myocardial 
ischemia and reperfusion, and a well -established model of vascular graft thrombosis in 
baboons  [4], alone and in combination with fibrinolysis . Importantly, while treatment with 
E-WE thrombin was efficacious in these experimental models  at its minimum effective 
doses, hemostasis markers (clotting times and b leeding times) remained within the “clinically 
insignificant” range . These data suggest that, in contrast to currently marketed 
antithrombotics, most of which target essential elements of the hemostatic coagulation 
cascade in the fluid phase , E-WE thrombin may preferentially target thrombi without notably 
increasing bleeding after injury . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics  
Limited  pharm acokinetic ( PK) studies with E -WE thrombin have  been performed  in 
cynomolgus monkeys and in baboons. The PK assay used to dete ct active E -WE thrombin 
was only sensitive enough to detect  plasma E -WE thrombin following high doses of E -WE 
thrombin (> 10 µg/kg). The observed PK profile in these animals closely mirrored the  drug 
exposure PD biomarker  assays (APC -PCI and activated partial thromboplastin time [ aPTT ]), 
which were able to detect  the magnitude and duration of action of E -WE thrombin . In blood, 
E-WE thrombin is inhibited by [CONTACT_214081], and 
some of these reaction s are accelerated by [CONTACT_6434]. Therefore, it has been technically 
challenging to develop an ultrasensitive assay for the residual or trace free E-WE thrombin 
molecules that may have avoided binding or inhibition and remain circulating in plasma.  Free 
E-WE thrombin  does not exert demonstrable pharmacological, procoagulant, or platelet 
activating effects  in the fluid phase.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamics  
Injection of E -WE thrombin results in the temporal and selective generation of endogenous 
APC and subsequent escape of some of t his endogenous APC into the blood circulation. In 
vitro , in the presence of phospholipid membranes, APC inactivates factor Va and factor 
VIIIa, resulting in a temporal prolongation of the aPTT  that is observed at higher dose s of 
E-WE thrombin . The activity of APC is regulated in part through its enzymatic interactions 
with serine protease inhibitors to form inactive enzyme inhibitor complexes, primarily 
APC -PCI and APC -antitrypsin complexes. The half -life of exogenous recombinant APC is 
[ADDRESS_257097] that the half -life of endogenous 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_257098] of an intravenous 
(IV) bolus of E -WE thrombin (0.75 to 10 µ g/kg) on APC -PCI complex formation and 
corresponding aPTT was evaluated over [ADDRESS_257099]  dose. The duration and 
magnitude of the aPTT elevation in response to E -WE thrombin correlated with plasma 
APC -PCI concentrations and the fold increase in aPTT prolongation significantly correlated 
with APC -PCI concentration :  
(R2 = 0.85, p ≤ 0.001 by [CONTACT_142031]).  
The APC -PCI profile of E -WE thrombin was also evaluated in a Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) single dose -acute study in cynom olgus monkeys. A dministration of E -WE thrombin to 
cynomolgus monkeys (12.5, 25, 50 µg/kg) caused a temporal increase in the concentration of 
APC -PCI complexes, in a dose -dependent manner. In addition, the anticipated minimal to 
modest temporal PD effect of aPTT prolongation occurred in all test article dose groups . 
APTT values were within the reference range 24 h ours later. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology 
The toxicity profile of E -WE thrombin was evaluated in two GLP single -dose acute toxicity 
studies in Sprague -Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In rats, a single dose of E -WE 
thrombin was administered at doses of 0, 30, 100, and 300 µ g/kg and animals were  evaluated 
for 3 days (main study) and 29 days (recovery group) after dosing. In cynomolgus monkeys, a single dose of E -WE thrombin was administered at doses of 0, 12.5, 25, and 50 µg/kg and 
animals were evaluated for 4  days (main study) and 15 days (recovery study) after dosing. 
E-WE thrombin was well tolerated in both species and no E -WE thrombin- related AE s, apart 
from the temporal aPTT prolongation outside the reference range (the anticipated systemic effect at high doses) , were observed. Based on these  results, the no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAEL) was determined to be 300 µg/kg/dose and 50 µg/kg/dose, for rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys, respectively.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_257100] -in-human (FIH) study (Study No. EWE -17-01 [Celerion Project No.: CA19169] ) was 
completed in the US  on 25 November  2018. This study was a single ascending dose study in 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 22 healthy adult male and female subjects with the purpose of collecting safety, tolerability, and 
PD information in order to support further development of E-WE th rombin . A total of 
21 male and female subjects were evaluated following IV bolus injection of one of four doses 
of E-WE thrombin (0.5, 1, 2, 4 µg/kg) . 
All 21 subjects  who entered the study received the study medication or placebo and 
completed the study per protocol. Below is a summary of the preliminary data from this FIH 
study as of 24 of January 2019 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Data  
There were no deaths or serious AEs ( SAEs ) experienced in  Study No. EWE -17-01 [Celerion 
Project No.: CA19169] . No subjects were discontinued due to AEs.  
Overall, 4 of 21 ( 19%) subjects experienced a total of 8  treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) in 
this study, with 3 of 16 ( 19%) subjects following active treatment a nd 1 of 5 subjects (20%) 
following placebo. The majority of the events ( 5) were mild (Grade 1) in severity and 3 were 
moderate (Grade 2). Of the 8 TEAEs  reported, only one was suspected to be possibly 
treatment related by [CONTACT_079] (PI).  
The most common TEAE was headache, experienced by 2 (13%) active -treatment subjects. 
One case of headache of moderate severity (Grade 2) was deemed to be possibly treatment 
related by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214051] a reported onset of approximately 10 minutes after dosing, 
resolv ing 36 hours later. The other case of headache (Grade 1) was deemed to be unrelated to 
treatment by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214052] [ADDRESS_257101].  
Temporal aPTT prolongation was not evaluated as an AE, because it was an expected 
response, indicating a natural response to activation of endogenous protein C and release of some APC into systemic circulation.  
A single IV dose of E -WE thrombin  up to 4 µg/kg appeared  to be safe and generally well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_214082].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacodynamic Data  
The APC -PCI was used as a surrogate biomarker for drug exposure.   
Mean plasma APC -PCI concentration results following single IV doses  of E-WE thrombin 
are presented in Figure 1. Plasma APC -PCI was detectable in all subjects at the first sampling 
time point of 0.08 hour  (5 min utes) post -injection and remained detectable throughout the 
entire sampling interval in all subjects up to 2 hours in the 0.5 µg/kg dose level group and up to 4 hours in the 1, 2 and 4 µg/kg dose level groups. Plasma concentrations of APC -PCI 
increased in a temporal and dose -dependent manner. All concentrations returned to baseline 
by 24 hours. Peak mean APC -PCI concentrations occurred at 0.5 hour (30 minutes ) in all 
dose level  groups. Ascending doses of E -WE thrombin increased the peak and overall

time (PT), platelets or fibrinogen levels ( Figure 2 ). In the figure, laboratory reference ranges 
are shown with  black dashed lines and clinically significant ranges are shown with  red

8.3 Rationale  
8.3.1 Purpose of the Study  Design  
A FIH study was conducted in healthy subjects and concluded that a single dose of E-WE 
thrombin up to 4 µg/kg, administered as a bolus,  was safe and generally well tolerated. This 
study will explore antithrombotic potential and utility of single doses of E -WE thrombin 
administered as a bolus followed by  [CONTACT_214083].  
Thromboembolic disease and bleeding are common comorbidities in patients with chronic 
kidney diseases  [5]. In most ESRD patients, heparin is routinely used during outpatient HD 
to reduce clotting in the dialyzer cartridge and to improve HD efficiency. However, 
administration of heparin during HD temporally increases the risk of bleeding. A safe 
alternative for patients with active bleeding, patients with previously documented or acquired 
heparin -induced thrombocytopenia, or that are at high risk for bleeding complications, is 
heparin -free dialysis [ 6-8] and the majority of HD patients that are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_214053].  

CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 25 In this study design, patients will be confined to the clinic for the majority of the trial and 
will not receive heparin du ring their HD sessions. While heparin- free HD can increase 
clotting within the dialyzer, resulting in the need for exchange of the dialyzer cartridge 
during HD in 5- 7% of the procedures  [9], there is no evidence that HD without heparin 
results in increased thromboembolic complications. Indeed, heparin anticoagulation during HD is not intended for systemic thromboprophylaxis and a recent retrospective analysis of 
data from the [LOCATION_002] Renal Data System and electronic medical records shows that 
heparin -free HD is not associated with increased risk of thromboembolic events in ESRD 
patients [10]. Therefore, the removal of standard of care heparin anticoagulation in either arm 
for the short duration of the study is not expected to be a clinically relevant safety risk, nor place the patients at an increased risk for development  of thromboembolic complications . 
Additionally , it enables the most rigorous assessment of safety and efficacy for E -WE 
thrombin that would not be possible if heparin anticoagulation during HD  was maintained.  
E-WE thrombin is expected to reduce thrombogenesis by [CONTACT_214084]’s hemostasis or promoting thrombosis . Both thromboembolism and 
bleeding are common comorbidities i n ESRD patients  on HD , and heparin for HD is not well 
tolerated in some patients, as about 4% of ESRD patients develop heparin- induced 
thrombocytopenia (HIT). Severe HIT is a life -threatening acute complication of heparin 
exposure. HIT antibodies have been detected in about 8% of HD patients who receive 
unfractionated heparin, and some of them are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a severe HIT event. T hus, 
an intrinsically  safe short -term and self -limiting anticoagulant  as an alternative to heparin is 
currently an unme t need for this patient population. As such, E-WE thrombin administration 
during HD may be an effective method to protect the hemodialyzer from clot development, 
and stands as a promising, short -acting  alternative to other anticoagulants in this population . 
It is therefore of interest to assess E -WE thrombin safety and effectiveness in ESRD patients 
on chronic HD.  
A placebo arm is included in this study design in order to robustly demonstrate the safety and efficacy of E-WE thrombin while not placing the pa tients at unnecessary risk, as mentioned 
above. The primary endpoint in this study is safety, measured as the number or frequency/rate of AEs that occur during the comparable observation periods . A heparin -free 
inpatient HD observation period ( from Day -8 to Day 1 prior to dosing) is included in the 
trial design to establish a baseline for the heparin -free procedure. Continuation of the 
heparin -free HD procedure during the subsequent trial period and inclusion of a placebo arm 
allows for the determination o f whether an AE  is drug -related or not and permits accurate 
assessment of the safety of the study drug. The addition of a placebo arm also removes potential bias from the interpretation of AEs by [CONTACT_214085] . The secondary endpoint for this study is efficacy of E -WE thrombin on  HD which 
may be more clearly observed with a placebo control instead of an active control (e.g., 
heparin). While the placebo arm may be at the same risk of clotting within the dialysis  circuit 
as during the pre -dosing period (Days - 8 to 1), data cited above suggests that these patients 
will not be at higher risk for either thromboembolic or bleeding complications. Should 
clotting occur within the dialyzer cartridge during a HD session t hat results in dialyzer 
failure, the dialyzer cartridge will be replaced, and the patient will be closely monitored by 
[CONTACT_214086]26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 26 the PI. It is important to note that replacement of the dialyzer cartridge during HD is safe for 
the patient and a  routine procedure in c ases of dialyzer failure .  
8.3.2 Dose Selection  
A FIH study was conducted in healthy subjects and concluded that a single bolus dose of 
E-WE thrombin up to 4 µg/kg was safe and generally well tolerated. Thus the 1. 5 and 
3 µg/kg doses were selected for this phase [ADDRESS_257102] to cover the entire HD procedure.  
8.3.3 Rationale for Pharmacodynamic  Markers  
The presumed half -life of active circulating E -WE thrombin in solution is very short 
(seconds to minutes) due to rapid binding to cell surface thrombin receptors. The active 
enzyme is not measurable in plasma using our enzyme capture assay at predicted hum an 
therapeutic doses. The Sponsor will use  a PD biomarker (circulating APC -PCI complexes) as 
a surrogate for drug exposure.  
8.4 Risk/Benefit  
ESRD patients are often ill and are prone to a variety of AEs  on or off HD, ranging, for 
example, from infections to hypertension to bleeding to thromboembolism to acute ischemic 
cardiovascular emergencies, even if they are apparently stable on chronic HD.  
E-WE thrombin is a purified protein produced by [CONTACT_94988] a 
bacterial (Escherichia coli) cell cult ure system . All drugs, including heparins or recombinant 
proteins  can occasionally and unpredictably evoke acute or chronic allergic reactions. Some 
ESRD patients develop chronic HD - and uremia -related moderate hemorrhagic diathesis or 
hemostasis impairmen t. The hemostatic safety of E-WE thrombin in the complex conditions 
of ESRD and chronic HD is not yet known. The safety monitoring practices employed by [CONTACT_3181] (i.e., AE  questioning [including HD vascular access site reaction] , physical 
examinations, bleed ing time from the HD vascular access sites , vital sign  measurement s, 
12-lead ECGs, clinical laboratory and coagulation tests) are adequate to protect the patients’ 
safety and should detect all expected and unexpected TEAEs. In addition, the cohorts will be 
dosed in a sequential manner, starting with the lower dose level, Cohort  1.  
There may be a higher risk of clots developi[INVESTIGATOR_214054]- free HD. 
Should this occur, the site standard operating procedures will be fo llowed to replace the 
clotted dialyzer and resume HD using a new cartridge under the supervision of the PI. It is 
important to note that replacement of the dialyzer cartridge is a safe procedure for the patient. 
While studies suggest that there is no risk of thromboembolic complications should this 
occur, complete clotting of the dialyzer circuit could result in up to ~228 mL of blood loss , 
and is usually prevented by [CONTACT_214087].  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_257103]. Subjects receiving E -WE 
thrombin may thus develop anti -drug antibodies ( ADA) , which may or may not neutralize the 
drug, or cross -react with and  inhibit endogenous thrombin functions . While development of 
immunity and appearance of ADA in the circulation is not an AE  as long as the A DA does 
not cross react with endogenous thrombin, the appearance of such antibodies will be 
monitored, as it may aff ect future tests and uses of the product, including future evaluation of 
repeat drug administration. D evelopment of ADA that cross -react with the host’s 
prothrombin/thrombin is a remote but existing possibility. All subjects will be assessed for 
the presen ce of antibodies to either E -WE thrombin or wildtype thrombin using validated  
assays.  
There may be direct health benefit s for study participants from receipt of study drug, some 
evaluated among the secondary outcome measures. E -WE thrombin  has shown 
antithrombotic effects in nonclinical studies. Reduced thrombus accumulation on the dialyzer 
surface may potentially improve the efficiency of HD as well. An indirect health benefit for 
study participants enrolled in this study is the free medical tests received at screening and during the study .

This study includes a screening period of 28 days prior to checking in to the CRU on Day -8. 
From Day  -8 (8 days prior to dosing on Day 1) through Day 3, all patients will undergo HD 
5 times and will be asses sed for all scheduled procedures and endpoints before and after each 
HD session as per the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 6 ), using only one type of dialyzer 
cartridge for each patient .  
On Day  1, prior to dosing, patients will undergo baseline measurements followed by 
[CONTACT_214075] a regular HD procedure, consistently using only one type of dialyzer cartridge 
for each patient. A single dose of E -WE thrombin or matching placebo will be adm inistered 
into the dialysis line during the HD procedure . Patients will continue to undergo HD 
procedures and scheduled assessments from Day 1 through Day  3. 
Study assessments will include AEs, including HD vascular access site (AV fistula or AV

Page 39 13. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
The Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6) summarizes the clinical procedures to be 
performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. 
Additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_50286]/or the 
Sponsor for reasons related to patient  safety.  
For this study, the primary assessment is safety and tolerability. Safety will be determined by 
[CONTACT_56620] A Es (including HD vascular access site reactions) , physical examinations, 
bleeding time from the HD vascular access sites, vital sign  measur ements , 12-lead ECGs, 
clinical laboratory parameters, including but not limited to, hematology, serum chemistry profile, coagulation, and urinalysis, as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6).  
Any nonscheduled procedures required for urgent evaluation of safety concerns take precedence over all routine scheduled procedures.  
13.1 Screening  
Within 28 days prior to check- in on Day - 8, medical history and demographic data, including 
name, sex, age, race, ethnic minor ity group, body weight  (kg), height  (cm), BMI  (kg/m
2) and 
history of tobacco use will be reported. Each patient will have a physical examination, vital sign measurements (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), 12 -lead 
ECG, and the laboratory tests of hematological, coagulation, hepatic and renal function and 
additional tests as noted in Section  13.2.7.  
13.2 Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
13.2.1  Body Weight  
Body weight (kg) will be measured daily up to Day 3 and before and after each HD session 
as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6). 
13.2.2  Physical Examination   
A full physical examination will be performed as per Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6) 
and will include, at a minimum, assessment of the following systems: skin, head, ears, eyes, nose and throat, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, neurological  condition, blood and lymphatic systems, and the musculoskeletal system.  
Abbreviated physical examinations will include at the minimum, examination of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems, with the option for further examination of 
additional systems as necessary based on reported symptoms/AEs.  
Symptom -driven physical examination may be performed at other times if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 40 13.2.3  Vital Signs  
Single measurements of body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressur e, and heart rate , 
will be measured as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section  6). Additional vital 
signs may be taken at any other times if deemed necessary.  
Vital signs will be performed with patients in a seated position following a [ADDRESS_257124] 
period, except when they are supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -reclined because of study procedures and/or AEs 
(e.g. nausea, dizziness) or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
When scheduled prior to HD, vital signs will be performed within [ADDRESS_257125] -dose, vital signs will be performed within approximately 
15 minutes of the scheduled time point .  
13.2.4  ECG  Monitoring  
Single 12-lead ECG s will be performed as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart 
(Section  6). Additional ECGs may be taken at any other times if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
ECGs will be performed with patients in a semi- recum bent position following a [ADDRESS_257126] -dose, ECGs will be performed within approximately 20 minutes of the 
scheduled time point.  
13.2.5  Vascular Access Site Reaction Assessment  
The monitoring of AEs will include assessment of  HD vascular access fistula (or AV graft) 
site reactions. The preferred vascular access is an established AV fistula (or AV graft). Well established and reaction -free AV graft is an alternative, bu t less preferred access option, as it 
is more prone to complications. Patients who are hemodialyzed through catheters are not included in the study. Therefore, inspection of the AV fistula (or AV graft) and surrounding 
area will be performed. Any new abnor mal findings inconsistent with past skin injuries as 
expected in patients on chronic HD will be reported as AEs. AV fistula (or AV graft) site reactions will be evaluated as outlined in the Study Events Flow Chart ( Section 6 ). Prior to 
HD, the AV fistula (or AV graft) site will be examined for inflammation, infection, or flow abnormalities  (including occlusion of the fistula or graft) . When scheduled post -dose, 
injection site examinations will be performed within appr oximately 20 minutes after 
completion of the HD session. Reactions will be rated according to the FDA Guidance for 
Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials [ 11] as follows:

13.2.6  Bleeding of Access Site  
Evaluation of bleeding and bleeding time from the HD vascular access sites on the AV fistula 
or AV graft  using the ladder or buttonhole technique will be performed as per Study Events 
Flow Chart ( Section 6 ).  
Following HD, the needle will be removed from the vascular access site and i mmediately 
followed by [CONTACT_214095] (i.e., gauze). Pressure will be applied manually by a clinical associate for 10  minutes before checking for evidence of bleeding around the 
dressing. If there is still some bleeding, pressure will be applied back at the site for 5 minutes. The site will then be checked again for evidence of bleeding; this procedure will 
be repeated every [ADDRESS_257128].  
The time to clot will be recorded.

Page 43 13.2.8  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Definition  
AE will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence during the study, associated or not 
with the use of E -WE thrombin in the study patients, whether or not considered drug- related. 
TEAE is an AE that occurs after administration of the study drug or  matching  placebo . 
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
An AE can , therefore , be any un favorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that is temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product  [12]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring  
Patients will be monitored for AEs from check- in through completion of the study. Patients 
will be asked how they are feeling once per day dur ing confinement and at each 
return/follow -up visit.  
AEs (whether serious or non- serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test 
value(s) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_214065]/or followed up until the 
symptoms or value(s) ret urn to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
Treatment of SAEs will be performed by a licensed medical provider, either at the CRU or at 
a nearby [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_9487]. Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) 
will be performed to document resolution of event(s). The o utcome may be classified as 
resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow up) . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  
All AEs that occurred during this clinical study (i.e., before, during, and after exposure of ESRD patients to E -WE thrombin) will be recorded. This design is to improve Sponsor 
ability to obtain reliable initial information about drug safety yet reducing the number of 
study patients needed to generate useful information .  
AEs and SAEs , including those  related to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
intervention) , will be recorded from the time of patient check -in until study completion.  
AEs will be coded using the most current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA)
® available at Celerion.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_214066] (likely, 
probably, possibly, unlikely, or unrelated) and severity. The date and time of onset, time 
relationship to drug dosing, duration, and outcome of each event will be noted .

Page 44 Relationship of AE:  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be assessed using the following 
definitions:  
Unrelated   The adverse event must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_2299] ’s 
clinical state, or the study procedure/conditions  
 Definitely not related to drug  
 Temporal sequence of an adverse event onset relative to 
administration of drug not reasonable  
 Another obvious cause of an adverse event  
Unlikely   Time sequence is unreasonable 
 There is another more likely cause for an adverse event  
Possibl y  Corresponds to what is known about the drug  
 Time sequence is reasonable 
 Could have been due to another equally, likely cause  
Probabl y  Is a known effect of the drug  
 Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable  
 Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478]  
 Cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_82977] ’s clinical state  
Likely   Is a known effect of the drug (e.g. listed in IB)  
 Time sequence from administering  drug is reasonable  
 Event stops upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_214067]:  
Severity rating used during the study will be based on the toxicity grading scale tables present in the FDA (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research) toxicity grading scale for healthy volunteers 4- point severity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3 and 4)  [11]. 
The following definitions for rating severity will be used for AEs not identified in the guidance:
 
Mild ( Grade 1 ) The AE does not interfere with daily activity . 
Moderate ( Grade 2 ) The AE interferes with daily activity, but no medical intervention is required.  
Severe ( Grade 3 )  The AE prevents daily activity and requires medical intervention.  
Potentially Life -
threatening ( Grade 4 ) Emergency room visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59029].  
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment 2 22April2020  
 
Page 45 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
If any AEs are serious, as defined by [CONTACT_58317] (CFR), 
Chapter  21, special procedures will be followed. All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor 
via fax or e -mail within one working day of becoming aware of the event, whether or not the 
serious events are deemed drug -related.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 
21 CFR 312.32 for Investigational New Drugs (IND) and to the Guidance for Industry and 
Investigators: Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE, dated December 2012  
[12]. The institutional review board ( IRB)  will be notified of the Alert Reports as per FDA 
regulations.  
An SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the PI (or 
desig nee) or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes:  Death, a life- threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to co nduct normal 
life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89401], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
above definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room o r at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of the PI 
(or designee) or  Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
Unexpected is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that is not listed in the IB or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application, as amen ded. 
If a SAE occurs to a patien t on this study, contact [CONTACT_78455]  3. 
13.3 Hemodialysis Procedure and Blood Clots in the Dialyzer Cartridge 
Patients will undergo HD 5 times from Day - 7 to Day  3 as delineated in the Study Events 
Flow Chart ( Section 6 ). For each patient, the HD will last approximately  [ADDRESS_257130] the clotted dialyzer and resume HD . It may be 
performed under the supervision of the PI, if appropriate. It is important to note that 
replacement of the dialyzer cartridge i s a safe procedure for the patient. While studies 
CONFIDENTIAL  CA26622 (EWE -19-02), Final Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_257131] that there is no risk of thromboembolic complications should this occur, clotting and 
complete occlusion of the dialyzer circuit could result in up to ~228 mL of blood loss.  This is 
preventable by t imely intervention and replacement.  
The hemoglobin levels will be followed more closely in patients that require replacement of 
the dialyzer during HD . 
If the patient clots the hemodialyzer or the dialysis circuit in the pre -treatment observation 
period ( from Day  -8 to Day 1 prior to dosing) at least twice during one HD session, they may 
be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the PI. If the patient repeatedly clots the 
hemodialyzer or dialysis circuit during each HD session, continuation of the  patient in the 
study will be at the PI’s discretion. However, available data obtained from such subjects will 
be included in the analyses .  
13.4 Immunogenicity

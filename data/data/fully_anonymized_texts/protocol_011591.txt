PRÉCIS 
Background:
•Ependymomas are glial based tumors arising from the ependymal lining of the ventricular 
system and central canal of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]
•These tumors affect both adults and children and represent approximately 1.2%-7.8% of all 
intracranial cancers
•Currently, the standard therapy for newly diagnosed low-grade ependymoma includes total 
surgical excision, when possible, followed by [CONTACT_69159]. Complete surgical resection 
is often not possible because of the location of the tumor and the concern for damage to 
surrounding eloquent brain during surgery.  The situation is even more critical for patients 
with anaplastic ependymomas because of the higher proliferative rate and greater propensity 
for tumor infiltration into surrounding normal brain, preventing any possibility of complete 
tumor removal by [CONTACT_44850]. 
•For patients with the more aggressive anaplastic ependymoma, chemotherapy is often 
administered either before or after the radiation in the hope that infiltrating tumor cells will 
be eliminated.
•Extensive experience has been gathered with the use of bevacizumab in other neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_816093]. Based on the interesting results observed in the reported 
small series of patients with recurrent ependymomas treated with bevacizumab, as well as on 
the evidence of VEGF-promoted angiogenesis in these tumors, we designed a phase II study 
to test the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with recurrent ependymoma. As results in 
most types of tumors have indicated that anti-angiogenesis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816094], in this study bevacizumab will be 
combined with carboplatin. The choice of carboplatin is justified by [CONTACT_49392], as detailed 
above, this remains the most effective agent in this disease, and extensive toxicity data is 
available for the combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin in a variety of tumor types, 
including GBMs. 
Objective:
•To evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent low 
grade or anaplastic ependymoma. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival 
(PFS) at one year.
Eligibility:
•Histologically proven intra-cranial or spi[INVESTIGATOR_816095].  There 
must be pathologic or imaging confirmation of tumor progression or regrowth. 
•Patients must be ≥18 years old.
•Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of ≥ 60.
•Patients must have adequate bone marrow function, adequate liver function and adequate 
renal function before starting therapy. 
•Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy: 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 4
•Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible
•Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy and must have an interval of greater than or 
equal to 42 days from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.
•Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented 
within 14 days prior to registration.
•Women of childbearing potential and male participants agree to practice adequate 
contraception.
•Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses or active infection
•Patients must not have history of any other cancer 
•Patients must not be pregnant/breast feeding. 
•Patients must not have received prior therapy with bevacizumab, or related drugs 
•No active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding 
•No major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days. 
Design:
•This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the 
treatment of recurrent low grade or anaplastic ependymoma. This trial is designed utilizing a 
Simon optimal two-stage design.
•Carboplatin will be given on day 1 of each cycle. Bevacizumab will be administered on days 
1 and 15 of each cycle. The total duration of treatment will be 6 cycles. After cycle 6, 
carboplatin should be discontinued, but bevacizumab may be continued at the discretion of 
the treating physician. 
•Patients will be monitored for hematologic or serologic evidence of myelosuppression, 
hepatic injury, renal injury, and electrolyte disturbances and for clinical evidence of other 
toxicity.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY O BJECTIVES
1.1.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the treatment of recurrent low grade or 
anaplastic ependymoma. The primary endpoint will be progression-free survival (PFS) at one year.
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate response rates to this chemotherapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate overall survival in this population.
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate toxicity profile of this combination.
[IP_ADDRESS] To longitudinally evaluate patient reported outcome measures using self-reported symptom 
severity and interference with daily activities using the MDASI-BT and/or MDASI-SP instrument.
1.1.3 Exploratory Objectives
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of this treatment in patients with recurrent 
Ependymomas according to anatomical location (supratentorial, posterior fossa and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]).
[IP_ADDRESS] To evaluate paraffin embedded tissue samples (and frozen samples, if available) utilizing gene 
expression profiling (Illumina technology), immunohistochemistry and/or RT-PCR. Analysis will focus 
on expression of genes involved in angiogenesis and hypoxia-related tissue factors. This component of 
the research will be overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kenneth Aldape. 
1.[ADDRESS_1129954] both adults and children and represent approximately 1.2%-
7.8% of all intracranial tumors. The WHO classifies ependymomas into low grade (WHO grade II) and 
the more malignant – anaplastic ependymomas (WHO grade III). Anaplastic ependymomas are more 
common in adults. 
Currently, the standard therapy for newly diagnosed low-grade ependymoma includes total surgical 
excision followed by [CONTACT_69159]. Complete surgical resection is often not possible because of the 
location of the tumor and the concern for damage to surrounding eloquent brain during surgery.  The 
situation is even more critical for patients with anaplastic ependymomas because of the higher 
proliferative rate and greater propensity for tumor infiltration into surrounding normal brain, preventing 
any possibility of complete tumor removal by [CONTACT_44850]. For patients with the more aggressive anaplastic 
ependymoma, chemotherapy is often administered either before or after the radiation in the hope that 
infiltrating tumor cells will be eliminated.  Unfortunately, even for patients with low-grade 
ependymoma, survival can be poor when the tumor is not totally surgically resected. There have only 
been a limited number of reports describing chemotherapy treatments for patients with recurrent 
ependymoma, either low grade or anaplastic. As a consequence, optimal therapy for this group remains 
unknown.  Most reported regimens are based on platinum compounds (carboplatin or cisplatin) and have 
been developed in children.[1, 2] Many of these regimens are associated with a high incidence of 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 8
moderate to severe toxicity, and applying such treatments to adults can be challenging.[3] The largest 
experience with chemotherapy in adult ependymoma patients was reported by [CONTACT_816120].[4]  That 
study included 28 adult patients who had recurrent ependymoma (n = 17) or anaplastic ependymoma (n 
= 11) after initial treatment with surgery and radiation.  One-half of the patients had undergone multiple 
tumor resections.  A wide variety of regimens were used ranging from single agent temozolomide to the 
“8 in 1” regimen that combines 8 different chemotherapy agents.  The overall objective response rate 
was 20% (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]).  The 12 month PFS rate was 44% (95% 
CI, 29%-68%).  The median time to progression was 9.9 months and the median overall survival (OS) 
was 40.4 months. Analysis of outcomes in patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy 
regimens (N=13) in comparison to patients treated with regimens without platinum (N=15) showed that 
platinum-containing regimens are associated with higher response rates (30.8% vs. 13.3%), confirming 
the activity of platinum agents in this disease. However, there were no significant differences in PFS or 
OS between the two groups, although interpretation of these results is limited by [CONTACT_816121]. 
1.2.2 Rationale for bevacizumab and anti-angiogenesis strategies in ependymomas
Bevacizumab (AvastinTM, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA) is a humanized monoclonal anti-
VEGF antibody with demonstrated efficacy in a variety of solid tumors. It was first approved by [CONTACT_139287] [ADDRESS_1129955] cancer and, more 
recently, progressive glioblastoma (GBM). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-clinical data
A number of studies have investigated angiogenic patterns in ependymomas. The largest study evaluated 
paraffin embedded tissue in a series of 100 patients with ependymoma, obtained at the time of 
diagnosis.[5] This included 73% of patients with WHO grade II tumors and 27% with grade III tumors. 
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_816096], microvascular proliferation could eventually be 
documented in 42% of patients in various patterns, whereas necrosis was present in 57% of patients. 
VEGF expression, as evaluated by [CONTACT_87368], was detected in 88% of patients. CA9 was 
expressed in 84% of patients, but HIF1-alpha was seen in only 42% of patients. This suggested that 
VEGF expression is frequent in ependymomas, and may not result from hypoxia (as in GBMs), but 
rather from oncogenic activation. In that same study, a high hypoxic score (defined as expression of 
more than two hypoxia-related tissue factors) was associated with worse prognosis on univariate, but not 
multivariate analysis, whereas elevated MIB-1 index remained a significant marker of poor prognosis in 
the multivariate setting. VEGF expression was associated with a trend in decreased OS (p= 0.06).[5]   In 
another study, VEGF expression in ependymomas was associated with tumor grade, and predicted 
shorter PFS (p=0.003).[6] In a smaller study, VEGF was found to be strongly expressed in 8/10 
ependymomas, all of them with extensive necrosis and vascular proliferation; VEGF expression was 
mainly observed around the necrotic areas, and most tumors also displayed strong expression of VEGFR 
(Flt-[ADDRESS_1129956]).[ 7] Taken together, these studies suggest that anti-VEGF treatments such as 
bevacizumab are an attractive strategy for the treatment of ependymomas, particularly in the recurrent 
setting where tumors are associated with a more aggressive behavior.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical data
Clinical experience with bevacizumab in ependymomas is limited. A single, small, retrospective study 
has been reported.[8] That study reported on eight adult patients with recurrent ependymoma treated at 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 9
several different institutions. In three patients, bevacizumab was given in combination with CPT-11, in 
two patients with carboplatin, in one patient with temozolomide and in two patients as a single agent. 
Patients tolerated treatment well. Six of the 8 patients achieved a partial response, disease was stable in 
one patient and one patient progressed. The median TTP in that heavily pre-treated population was 6.5 
months and the overall survival was 9.4 months. 
Conversely, extensive experience has been gathered with the use of bevacizumab in other 
neuroepi[INVESTIGATOR_816097]. After anecdotal experience 
suggested high response rates,[9] a phase II study was conducted in recurrent glioma.[10] Impressive 
response rates were confirmed, with 63% of the [ADDRESS_1129957] a PR. PFS, 
and to a lesser extent OS, were also increased in comparison to historical controls (GBM patients: 
median PFS- 20 weeks; median OS- 10 months; N=23). Preliminary results of a phase II randomized 
trial comparing single-agent bevacizumab versus the combination of bevacizumab with irinotecan 
indicate that both arms achieved superior outcomes in comparison to historical controls. The group 
receiving the combination of drugs achieved higher response rates (33% vs 20%) and 6 month-PFS 
(50% vs 35%), although OS was slightly longer in the single agent arm (8.9 vs 9.7 months).[11] Based 
on such results, bevacizumab was approved for the treatment of recurrent malignant gliomas. 
Importantly, such studies have demonstrated that bevacizumab can be safely given to patients with brain 
tumors, and that concerns of intracranial bleeding should not preclude their use, including in patients 
receiving anticoagulation.[12] 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1129958] effective agent in this disease, and extensive toxicity data is available for the 
combination of bevacizumab and carboplatin in a variety of tumor types, including GBMs.  The study 
will include a comprehensive translational component for the evaluation of treatment effects on 
advanced MRI imaging parameters (perfusion and spectroscopy) as well as serum levels of 
angiogenesis-related factors as potential biomarkers. 
A large number of manuscripts have been published outlining the toxicities associated with 
bevacizumab use in patients with cancer.  A recent publication by [CONTACT_816122], et al specifically describes 
the well-known toxicities and their incidence and management in the brain tumor patient population [24] 
These include hypertension which is refractory in a small percentage of patients, thromboembolic 
disease which occurs in the venous system in 8-10% of patients and arterial (mostly cerebral) in 1-2%, 
significant intracranial hemorrhage in less than 2%, renal dysfunction in less than 2% and wound 
dehiscence in less than 2% (partially dependent on time from craniotomy).  Intestinal perforation also 
occurs in less than 2%.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for the patient-reported outcomes:  
Although rare, ependymal tumors have a recognized impact on the patients physical and neurologic 
function [13, 14].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_816098], many ependymomas recur [15].  Currently, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/[ADDRESS_1129959] of chemotherapy at recurrence 
has been limited[15].  
This study seeks to establish effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816099].  
We hypothesize that using a combination of carboplatin and bevacizumab will result in improved 
survival.  However, given the intensive nature of this regimen, it will be important to determine whether 
if any determined survival benefit is associated with improvements in symptoms or does a worsening of 
these parameters offset the increase in survival. 
Precedence for measuring “non-therapeutic” endpoints exists in oncology research.  For example, 
Gemcitabine was approved by [CONTACT_264330] a consequence of the decrease in pain reported in 
pancreatic patients who were treated, not on the basis of survival improvement which was modest, at 
best [16].  There have been efforts in neuro-oncology to evaluate secondary endpoints using validated 
instruments as an additional indicator of benefit. 
The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module or M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_345028] (MDASI-BT or SP, respectively) allows the self-reporting of symptom severity 
and interference with daily activities.  The MDASI-BT or SP has demonstrated reliability and validity in 
the adult primary brain tumor patient population [17] [18]. This tool represents a modification of the 
widely used and validated MDASI, with particular attention to symptoms common in patients with brain 
tumors.   The availability of validated instruments provides an opportunity to prospectively assess the 
impact of treatment, both positive and negative, on patients.  This evaluation of symptom burden in this 
study will assist in finding the best possible treatment with the least toxicity.
1.2.4 Rationale for the correlative studies
Although bevacizumab has been extensively utilized for the treatment of GBM and several other types 
of cancer, to date, no predictive biomarker has been validated for selection of patients likely to benefit 
from treatment or that could be used for follow-up and to guide treatment decisions. In order to identify 
validate such potential biomarkers in this trial the following studies will be performed:
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline tumor expression of hypoxia-related factors
 In a recent retrospective study conducted by [CONTACT_816123][19] in GBM patients undergoing 
treatment with bevacizumab, the authors found that high VEGF expression levels in the tumor was 
associated with radiographic responses but not OS. This finding is in line with the normalization of 
vasculature and decreased permeability observed with anti-VEGF strategies, which translates into 
radiographic response, but that may or may not be associated with anti-tumor effect. In contrast, 
expression of hypoxia-related factors CA9 and HIF-2 expression was associated with poor survival, 
suggesting that such factors may be better predictive markers for anti-angiogenic strategies. However, 
such findings may not be applicable in ependymomas, as the VEGF expression may not be dependent on 
hypoxia, but rather to oncogenic activation, as detailed above. To investigate these aspects in this study 
paraffin embedded tissue or frozen tissue from all patients will be evaluated for the expression of 
hypoxia-related and angiogenesis factors such as VEGF, VEGFR-2/KDR, CD31, CA9, HIF-2α and 
others, utilizing immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and gene expression profiling (Illumina technology). 
This component of the study will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kenneth Aldape (Section 5.1) who has extensive 
experience in the molecular characterization of ependymomas in the setting of prior CERN studies.

2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
2.1.1 Inclusion Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Histologically proven intra-cranial or spi[INVESTIGATOR_816095].  There 
must be pathologic or imaging confirmation of tumor progression or regrowth. The patient’s histologic 
diagnosis must be confirmed on Central Pathology Review prior to registration Step 2.
*If a patient has already had central pathology review at MDACC (for example, from a previous 
enrollment to protocol CERN08-02), the central pathology does not need to be repeated.  
Previous pathology confirmation can be utilized for this study’s pathology eligibility testing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The patient must have at least 1 block of tissue or 15 unstained slides at a minimum available   
for central pathology review and molecular profiling of the tissue sample.
[IP_ADDRESS] All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the investigational 
nature of this study.  Patients must have signed an authorization for the release of their protected health 
information. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must be > 18 years old.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of > 60.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC > 3,000/µl, ANC > 1,500/mm3, 
platelet count of > 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin > 10 gm/dl), adequate liver function (SGOT [AST 
<92.5 Units/L] and bilirubin < 1.5 mg/dL), and adequate renal function (creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL and 
calculated creatinine clearance > 60 cc/min) before starting therapy.  Eligibility level for hemoglobin 
may be reached by [CONTACT_29470]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have shown unequivocal radiographic evidence for tumor progression by [CONTACT_816124] [IP_ADDRESS].  If an MRI is being obtained to verify eligibility, it is 
recommended that the MRI parameters follow the specifications detailed in Appendix 15.4 so that the 
patient will not require a repeat MRI prior to treatment start. 
[IP_ADDRESS] At the time of registration:  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior 
therapy: > 28 days from any investigational agent, >28 days from prior cytotoxic therapy, >14 days from 
vincristine, >42 days from nitrosoureas, >21 days from procarbazine administration, and >7 days for 
non-cytotoxic agents, e.g., interferon, tamoxifen, thalidomide, cis-retinoic acid, etc. (radiosensitizer does 
not count).  Any questions related to the definition of non-cytotoxic agents should be directed to the 
Principal Investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor will be eligible as 
long as all of the following conditions apply:
•They have recovered from the effects of surgery. 
•A minimum of [ADDRESS_1129960] elapsed prior to registration Step 
2.

Version Date: 07/22/[ADDRESS_1129961]-operatively, within 14 days prior to consent.  If the “within 96-hour after surgery” 
scan is more than 14 days before consent the scan needs to be repeated.  If the steroid dose is 
increased between the date of imaging and consent, a new baseline MRI/CT is required on a 
stable steroid dosage for at least 5 days.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients must have failed prior radiation therapy* and must have an interval of greater than or 
equal to 42 days from the completion of radiation therapy to study entry.
*Note: Patients with an indication for craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_816100] (i.e., extensive leptomeningeal disease) 
but have refused palliative craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_816101]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients with prior therapy that included interstitial brachytherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery 
must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather than radiation necrosis based upon either PET 
or Thallium scanning, MR spectroscopy, or surgical/pathological documentation of disease.
[IP_ADDRESS] Women of childbearing potential must have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented 
within 14 days prior to registration.

cycle 6, carboplatin should be discontinued, but bevacizumab 
may be continued at the discretion of the treating physician.
Stratifications
None.
Arm Assignment
Patients in cohort 1 will be directly assigned to arm 1.
2.4 BASELINE EVALUATION
2.4.1 Patients will complete a baseline MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor Module 
(MDASI-BT or MDASI-SP) (Appendix 13.2 or 13.3) within 14 days (+ 3 working days) after 
enrollment on the clinical trial. The MDASI-BT or MDASI-SP will be completed only by [CONTACT_4677], unless changes in vision or weakness make this difficult. If this occurs, then the 
caregiver or research assistant may read the questions to the patient or assist with marking the 
severity number or score as described by [CONTACT_102]. A patient caregiver may complete the 
questionnaires as a patient-preference proxy if the patient’s deficits preclude self-report.
2.4.[ADDRESS_1129970] be used throughout the period of protocol treatment for tumor measurement. 
2.4.3 Prior to treatment start, a baseline creatinine clearance should be obtained from a 24-hour urine 
collection or calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation (see section 3.2). The maximum 
CrCl used should be 125 ml/min. The creatinine to be used for this baseline calculation should be 
obtained on the day of treatment or within [ADDRESS_1129971] be obtained/repeated within 14 days prior to start of treatment, following the parameters 
established in Appendix 13.4. 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 17
Eligible patients will be treated as described below. One cycle will correspond to 4 weeks. A treatment 
window of +/- 3 days is acceptable for all treatments and procedures. Carboplatin will be given on day 1 
of each cycle. Bevacizumab will be administered on days 1 and 15 of each cycle. The total duration of 
treatment will be 6 cycles. After cycle 6, carboplatin should be discontinued, but bevacizumab may be 
continued at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will be monitored for hematologic or 
serologic evidence of myelosuppression, hepatic injury, renal injury, and electrolyte disturbances and for 
clinical evidence of other toxicity as is described in sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2, 11.1 and 11.2. 
3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
3.2.1 Carboplatin will be given on day 1 of each cycle. For cycle 1, the dose will be given at an 
AUC=5 mg/mL/min. If no toxicity higher than grade 1 is observed during cycle 1, the dose of 
carboplatin will be increased to AUC=6 mg/mL/min for cycle 2 and onwards.
The carboplatin dose should be calculated using the Calvert formula: Carboplatin dose (mg)  = target 
AUC x (CrCl + 25). 
The maximum CrCl used should be 125 ml/min. The creatinine to be used for calculation of AUC 
should be obtained on the day of treatment or within 3 days. 
The Cr Cl should be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation: 
Male : CrCl (ml/min) = (140-age) X (Actual weight in kg) / 72 x serum Creatinine (mg/dl). 
Female : CrCl (ml/min) = (140-age) X (Actual weight in kg) X 0.85 / 72 x serum Creatinine (mg/dL)
A measured CrCl from a 24 hour urine collection may also be used.
[IP_ADDRESS]  Special considerations with the use of the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) in estimating GFR:
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Adjustments for extremes of weight 
•Actual weight is to be used unless patient has BMI> 25 
•In patients with BMI > 25, using the adjusted body weight should be considered.
•If using other weight, please justify rationale.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serum creatinine details
•IDMS creatinine is preferred; back-calculating to a non-IDMS creatinine will not be permitted.
•Lower limits of reported serum creatinine: Recommendation is 0.7 mg/dL be the lower limit
If using lower serum creatinine value, please justify rationale.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Use of cappi[INVESTIGATOR_816103] (at 125) or Carboplatin dose or both.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adjustments for first cycles compared with subsequent cycles.
At the discretion of the treating physician, deviations to the rules described for carboplatin dose 
Calculation may be proposed and discussed with the study PI.
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 18
3.2.2 Bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg on days [ADDRESS_1129972] completed 
the maximum number of Carboplatin cycles will remain on-study and should be followed with MRI and 
correlative blood tests per protocol every 8 weeks (+/- 30 days), until withdrawal of consent or 
radiographic progression of disease. Patients who have completed the maximum number of Carboplatin 
cycles and are continuing on Bevacizumab should have CBC, pregnancy test (β-HCG), creatinine 
clearance, UPC or urinalysis at the discretion of the treating physician.  If carboplatin is discontinued 
prior to completion of [ADDRESS_1129973] year of treatment (the primary 
endpoint), treating physicians can decide to stop or modify the dose and or interval of bevacizumab as 
clinically indicated.  The protocol does not prescribe a schedule for this, but recognizes the common 
practice of tapering the dose/schedule to provide continued therapy once disease control is established 
but hopefully reducing the toxicity risk imposed by [CONTACT_816126].
[IP_ADDRESS] Bevacizumab Dose Modification and Toxicity Management
There are no reductions in the bevacizumab dose. If adverse events occur that require holding 
bevacizumab, the dose will remain the same once treatment resumes.
Any toxicity associated or possibly associated with bevacizumab treatment should be managed 
according to standard medical practice. Discontinuation of bevacizumab will have no immediate 
therapeutic effect. Bevacizumab has a terminal half-life of 21 days; therefore, its discontinuation results 
in slow elimination over several weeks. There is no available antidote for bevacizumab. 
Subjects should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after each infusion. If 
unmanageable toxicity occurs because of bevacizumab at any time during the study, treatment with 
bevacizumab should be discontinued. 
Infusion Reaction: Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for subjects who develop dyspnea or 
clinically significant hypotension. Subjects who experience a NCI CTCAE v 4.0 grade 3 or 4 allergic 
reaction / hypersensitivity, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or bronchospasm (regardless of grade) 
will be discontinued from bevacizumab treatment.
The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or interrupted for subjects who experience any infusion-
associated symptoms not specified above. When the subject’s symptoms have completely resolved, the 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 19
infusion may be continued at no more than 50% of the rate prior to the reaction and increased in 50% 
increments every 30 minutes if well tolerated. Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next 
cycle. 
Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab are listed in Table 1.  
Regardless of the reason for holding study drug treatment, the maximum allowable length of treatment 
interruption is 2 months.
If patients on treatment with bevacizumab require elective major surgery, it is recommended that 
bevacizumab be held for 4-8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical 
procedure should not begin/restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure (in the case of high 
risk procedures such as liver resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommended that 
chemotherapy be restarted no earlier than 6 wk and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 wk after surgery).

Venous Thrombosis
No dose modifications for grade 1 or 2 events
Grade 3 or 4 Hold study drug treatment.  If the planned duration of full-dose anticoagulation is 
<2 weeks, bevacizumab should be held until the full-dose anticoagulation period is 
over.  If the planned duration of full-dose anticoagulation is >2 weeks, bevacizumab 
may be resumed during the period of full-dose anticoagulation if all of the 
following criteria are met:
•The subject must have an in-range INR (usually between 2 and 3) if 
on warfarin; LMWH, warfarin, or other anticoagulant dosing must be 
stable prior to restarting bevacizumab treatment.
•The subject must not have had a Grade 3 or 4 hemorrhagic event while 
on anticoagulation.

[IP_ADDRESS] Carboplatin Dose Modification and Toxicity Management
Recommendation for the management of carboplatin-related toxicities and required dose reductions for 
hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities are detailed below. Because dose levels may be important 
for achieving adequate brain penetration, all efforts will be taken to avoid dose reductions. Whenever 
required, the following dose levels will be utilized for dose reductions: 
Dose level 1 AUC 6 mg/mL/min
Dose level 0 AUC 5 mg/mL/min
Dose level -1 AUC 4 mg/mL/min
Dose level -2 AUC 3 mg/mL/min
Dose level -3 Discontinue treatment

3.3 QUESTIONNAIRES
The MDASI-BT or SP (Appendix 13.2 or 13.3) will be utilized for this portion of the study. Full 
instruments are provided in the appendix.  In addition, information regarding demographics and 
treatment history will be collected as part of the larger study and used in this analysis.
The MDASI-BT or SP consists of 23 symptoms rated on an 11-point scale (0 to 10) to indicate the 
presence and severity of the symptom, with 0 being “not present” and 10 being “as bad as you can 
imagine.” Each symptom is rated at its worst in the last 24 hours. Symptoms included on the instrument 
include those commonly associated with cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], those associated with increased intracranial 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 23
pressure, and those related to focal deficits.  The questionnaire also includes ratings of how much 
symptoms interfered with different aspects of a patient’s life in the last 24 hours. These interference 
items include: general activity, mood, work (includes both work outside the home and housework), 
relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life. The interference items are also measured on 
0 - 10 scales. The average time to complete these instruments is 5 minutes. The MDASI-BT or SP has 
been translated into 18 languages [ 18, 20].

6.[ADDRESS_1129988] criteria:  Criteria permitting uni-dimensional response measurement have been adopted and 
published by [CONTACT_816128], Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 
Group (RECIST).  In order to ensure comparability of data from this trial with data from earlier trials, 
this trial will retain the traditional evaluation definition in Section 6.3.1.  However, RECIST criteria that 
can be collected will be used for secondary evaluation.  Concordance with the traditional approach will 
be summarized.
6.3.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response: Only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for objective response. These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below. However, all patients regardless of the presence or absence of 
measurable disease will be evaluated for the secondary endpoint of overall survival. (Note: Patients who 
exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable Disease: Bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins by [CONTACT_816129].
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Disease: Unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses with margins not clearly 
defined. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Evaluable Disease: Not Applicable for response evaluation
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Status, To Be Recorded at Each Evaluation: If there are too many measurable lesions 
to measure at each evaluation, choose the largest two to be followed before a patient is entered on study.  
The remaining lesions will be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  
Unless progression is observed, objective status can only be determined when ALL measurable and 
evaluable sites and lesions are assessed.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete Response (CR):  Complete disappearance of all measurable and evaluable disease.  
No new lesions.  No evidence of non-evaluable disease.  All measurable, evaluable and non-
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/[ADDRESS_1129989] not be on steroids.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Partial Response (PR):  Greater than or equal to 50% decrease under baseline in the sum of 
products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions.  No progression of evaluable 
disease.  No new lesions.  All measurable and evaluable lesions and sites must be assessed using 
the same techniques as baseline. The steroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be 
no greater than the maximum dose used in the first 8 weeks from initiation of therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Partial Response, Non-Measurable (PRNM): Not applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Stable/No Response: Does not qualify for CR, PR, or progression.  All measurable and 
evaluable sites must be assessed using the same techniques as baseline.  The steroid dose at the 
time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the maximum dose used in the first 8 
weeks from initiation of therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Progression: 25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over smallest sum 
observed (over baseline if no decrease) using the same techniques as baseline, OR clear 
worsening of any evaluable disease, OR appearance of any new lesion/site, OR clear clinical 
worsening or failure to return for evaluation due to death or deteriorating condition (unless 
clearly unrelated to this cancer).
[IP_ADDRESS].6 Unknown: Progression has not been documented and one or more measurable or evaluable sites 
have not been assessed.
6.3.[ADDRESS_1129990] Response: This will be calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.
For patients with all disease sites assessed at every evaluation period, the best response will be defined 
as the best objective status as measured according to Section [IP_ADDRESS].  If the response does not persist at 
the next regular scheduled MRI, the response will still be recorded based on the prior scan, but will be 
designated as a non-sustained response.  If the response is sustained, e. g., still present on the subsequent 
MRI, it will be recorded as a sustained response, lasting until the time of tumor progression.  Best 
response is unknown if the patient does not qualify for a best response or increasing disease and if all 
objective status determinations before progression are unknown.
6.3.3 Neurological Exam: Although not used for determining response, it is useful to evaluate 
improvement in the neurologic exam, (as compared to the baseline assessment), that should 
coincide with objective measurement of tumor size. 
+2 Definitely better
+1 Possibly better
  0 Unchanged
 -1 Possibly worse
 -2 Definitely worse
6.3.4 Performance Status: Patients will be graded according to Karnofsky Performance Status (see 
Appendix B).
6.3.5 Time to Treatment Failure: From date of registration step [ADDRESS_1129991] observation of 
progressive disease (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].5), non-reversible neurologic progression or 
permanently increased steroid requirement (applies to stable disease only), death due to any

8.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected 
adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug.
8.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in 
the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected” also refers to 
adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
8.1.4 Serious 
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.
8.1.5 Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the investigator or 
the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
•Death
•A life-threatening adverse drug experience
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions
•A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
•Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

8.1.9 Non-compliance (NIH Definition)
The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) policies, IRB 
requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research subjects.
8.1.10 Unanticipated Problem
Any incident, experience, or outcome that:
• Is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to 
(a) the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and
(b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND
•Is related or possibly related to participation in the research; AND
•Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.2 ASSESSING CA[LOCATION_003]LITY
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study agent/s caused 
or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used.
Yes: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s administration makes 
a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.
No: If the temporal relationship of the clinical event to the study agent/s administration makes 
a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

8.3 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING P LAN
8.3.1 Principal Investigator/Research Team 
The clinical research team will have a teleconference on a regular basis when patients are being actively 
treated on the trial to discuss each patient. Decisions about dose level enrollment and dose escalation if 
applicable will be made based on the toxicity data from prior patients. 
All data will be collected in a timely manner and reviewed by [CONTACT_1716][INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a lead 
associate investigator. Adverse events will be reported as required above. Any safety concerns, new 
information that might affect either the ethical and or scientific conduct of the trial, or protocol 
deviations will be immediately reported to the NIH Intramural IRB.

provide appropriate delegation of responsibilities to other members of the research staff. 
8.3.2 NCI Coordinating Center Monitoring Plan
As the CCR is the coordinating center for this multi-site study, the CCR will maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could affect 
the interpretation of primary study endpoints; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and SOPs; and 
human subjects protection. This is done through independent verification of study data with source 
documentation focusing on:
• Informed consent process
• Eligibility confirmation
• Drug administration and accountability
• Adverse events monitoring
• Response assessment.
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_264347]. Monitors are qualified by 
[CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this study will 
not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.
8.3.3 Safety Monitoring Committee
This protocol will require oversight from the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  Initial review will 
occur as soon as possible after the annual NIH Intramural IRB continuing review date.   Subsequently, 
each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the quarterly meeting schedule permits or more 
frequently as may be required by [CONTACT_4484].   For initial and subsequent reviews, protocols will not be 
reviewed if there is no accrual within the review period. Written outcome letters will be generated in 
response to the monitoring activities and submitted to the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_808124], CCR, NCI.
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
This is a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of carboplatin and bevacizumab for the treatment of 
recurrent low grade or anaplastic ependymoma. 
The primary endpoint of this study is PFS rate at one year.  A review of the MSKCC experience (N=12) 
has shown that the median PFS in this population is approximately 5 months after start of second line of 
chemotherapy, and the 1y- PFS was approximately 30% (Omuro et al, personal data). This was 
confirmed by [CONTACT_816130], which found a median PFS of 6 months (N=14) in patients 
at second recurrence (Armstrong et al, personal communication). 
In this trial, we will utilize a Simon optimal two-stage design in which a 30% one-year progression-free 
rate is considered not promising, a 50% one-year recurrence free rate is considered promising, and the 
probabilities of a type I error (falsely accepting a non-promising therapy) and type II error (falsely 
rejecting a promising therapy) are set at 0.[ADDRESS_1129998] 8 patients are progression-free at one year among these 22 patients, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/[ADDRESS_1129999] 50% 
and yields a 0.90 probability of a negative result if the true recurrence free rate is 30%.    At the interim 
time-point some patients will have been followed for less than 1 year.  We will implement the following 
strategy to deal with this situation: We will calculate the predictive probability of observing at least 8 
progression free patients by [CONTACT_5638] 1 year.  This predictive probability will be calculated based on a 
discrete time survival model (Albert and Chib, 2001).  If the predictive probability is greater than 60% 
we will continue to enroll patients and evaluate the 1st stage data once it is mature.  If it is less than 60% 
we will suspend accrual and wait for the first stage data to mature.  A schematic of these rules is 
presented below:
We do not expect patients to drop out of the trial once they initiate therapy.  If patients do dropout we 
will use appropriate methods to account for this fact.  Options will include: 1) treating these patients as 
failures; 2) Using a time to response model and treating the dropped out patients as censored 
observations. 3) A sensitivity analysis for patient withdrawals. In this approach, we will jointly model 
time to response and time to dropout to account for the possibility that dropouts are informative in the 
sense that patients with longer survival time may be more/less likely to drop out the study. We will 
compare the results of this approach to option 2, which treats dropout as independent censored events.Enroll 1st stage patients

9.1.1 Secondary objectives (not including patient-reported outcomes)
Secondary objectives include overall survival, response rates and toxicity profile. Kaplan Meier 
methodology will be utilized for calculation of overall survival estimates. The crude incidence rates of 
treatment responses (PR + CR) and toxicities will be calculated, and reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals. 
9.1.2 Patient-reported outcomes  
Received MDASI-BT or SP forms will be checked versus the timing schedule and considered as valid if 
they fall within ten days of the scheduled assessment.  Compliance rates will be calculated as the 
number of received valid forms over the number of expected forms. Differences between groups in 
compliance will be tested by [CONTACT_264348]’s exact test at every time point.
We will use descriptive statistics to describe how patients rate symptom severity and interference with 
function at each time point.  Error bar graphs for each of the symptoms will be constructed at each time 
point.  The proportion of patients rating their symptoms to be 7 or greater (on a 0-10 scale) will also be 
reported.  We will construct individual patient profiles for each of the selected symptoms to describe the 
individual patients’ patterns of change over time. We will calculate the mean core symptom severity, 
mean severity of the MDASI-BT or SP and mean symptom interference at the time of clinical 
evaluation. Estimates of differences in the mean symptom severity and mean symptom interference 
between responders and non-responders will be estimated in the intent to treat population.  All patients 
with at least one valid questionnaire will be included in the analyses.  Questionnaires completed at study 
registration will be considered baseline.  All questionnaire data received after randomization will be 
used in the primary analyses.
Differences of at least 2 points will be classified as the minimum clinically meaningful change in the 
symptom severity and symptom interference measures. For example, an increase of 2 points or more 
would mean a moderate improvement, whereas a decrease of 2 points or more would be interpreted as 
moderate worsening. For individual symptoms, a rise in a symptom score means deterioration, whereas 
a reduced score means improvement of the specific symptom.
9.1.3 Exploratory objectives will include
•Evaluation of PFS, overall survival, response rates and toxicities according to anatomical 
location (supratentorial, posterior fossa and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]).  Evaluate treatment effects of this 
combination on advanced MRI of the brain. Perfusion and diffusion-based MRI parameters 
including but not restricted to blood volume, mean and median ADC and structural volumes will 
be analyzed. Results will be summarized, and mean and median values at different time points 
will be tabulated. Changes in such parameters will be checked for statistical significance and 
correlated with the disease status. 
•Evaluation of plasma levels of angiogenesis-related factors. Percent changes in levels of each 
protein will be correlated with responses to treatment.  Additionally, means and medians of all 
patients together will be calculated and tabulated for each time point, with depi[INVESTIGATOR_816108]. A Wilcoxon test will be used to determine p value of changes in mean values of 
YKL-40 and HES1, with a p value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

11.4 EVALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
11.4.1 Potential Risks/ Discomforts
Carboplatin and Bevacizumab may each cause low blood cell counts (red blood cells, 
platelets, and/or white blood cells): A low red blood cell count (anemia) may cause 
difficulty breathing and/or fatigue. A low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding 
(such as nosebleeds, bruising, stroke, and/or digestive system bleeding). 
A low white blood cell count increases the risk of infection (such as pneumonia and/or 
severe blood infection). Infections may occur anywhere and become life-threatening. 
Symptoms of infection may include fever, pain, redness, and difficulty breathing. 
Using the study drugs together may cause side effects that are not seen when each is 
given alone.  The study drug combination may also increase the frequency and/or severity 
of the side effects listed above.
Blood draws may cause pain, bleeding, and/or bruising.  Fainting and/or development of 
an infection with redness and irritation of the vein at the site where blood is drawn may 
occur.  Frequent blood collection may cause anemia (low red blood cell count), which 
may create a need for blood transfusions.
Questionnaires may contain questions that are sensitive in nature. This study may involve 
unpredictable risks to the participants.
Taking part in this study can result in risks to an unborn or breastfeeding baby, and 
participants should not become pregnant, breastfeed a baby, or father a child while on this 
study.  Participants must use birth control during the study if sexually active and for [ADDRESS_1130003] dose of study drug(s).  Medically acceptable birth control types 
include approved hormonal birth control (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], Depo-Provera, or 
Lupron Depot), barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) with spermicide, or 
intrauterine device (IUD).  Talk to the study doctor about acceptable methods of birth 
control.
11.4.2 Potential Benefits
The study drugs may help to control the disease.  Future patients may benefit from what 
is learned.  There may be no benefits for participants in this study.
11.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
This study is for patients who have relapsed from standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816111].  Currently, no 
standard therapy at recurrence has been established, and the impact of chemotherapy at recurrence has 
been limited. Participants may obtain better response with the combination of carboplatin and 
bevacizumab. 
11.6 CONSENT AND ASSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The investigational nature and objectives of this trial, the procedures and treatments involved and their 
attendant risks and discomforts, and the potential benefits will be carefully explained to the patient or 
the patient’s advocate.  This process will include a general description of the disease process, as well as 
a description of the patient’s expected clinical course. Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_816112],

Our proposed acquisition protocol is described in the box, and consists of approximately 65 minutes of 
imaging time (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_1130012] is in the magnet, counting setup and 
scan delays). Each of these datasets will be analyzed using tools that are published and well known in 
the neuroradiologic community. A brief outline of our analysis techniques follows:
Dynamic Contrast Enhanced – Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI)
DCE-MRI will be used to monitor the effects on tumor vasculature through parameters reflecting both 
tumor perfusion and permeability. This sequence uses a bolus injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA. 
Data will be analyzed using the standard Tofts/Kermode model with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_816114] 
[21]. 
T2-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI or perfusion weighted imaging (PWI)
A second dose of Gd-DTPA (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg) is administered for first-pass T2/T2-weighted 
imaging. We use a combination gradient-echo/spin echo approach to allow estimation of tumor vascular 
size based on the equations in the box. As shown in our earlier work [22], this can be used to estimate 
average vessel diameter, which we believe may change with effective anti-angiogenic therapy. This 
approach also provides estimates of cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean 
transit time (MTT), and perfusion efficiency (1/MTT).
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
We will measure the full water self-diffusion tensor before and after treatment in this patient population. 
The tensor fractional anisotropy (FA) will be calculated and can be used to define white matter tract 
directions and tumor invasion. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps will also be calculated. 
Simultaneous Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) Imaging 
(Optional)
Combined BOLD/ASL imaging is a non-contrast approach to simultaneously measuring cerebral blood 
flow (ASL) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (BOLD) (Wong EC, NMR Biomed, 
Abbreviated Title: Ph II Ependymoma
Version Date: 07/22/2025 56
1997, 10:237). Our standard approach for this is to use a pulsed ASL sequence followed by a single-
shot, gradient echo (GE) echo planar imaging acquisition. Two echoes are acquired, short echo (TE = 11 
ms) for ASL (CBF maps) and longer echo (TE = 40 ms) for BOLD. Patients are administered room air 
and 100% oxygen at varying time points throughout the scan. The gas paradigm is as follows: baseline 
room air (8 min) – 100% O 2 (4 min) – washout room air (2 min) at a constant ~35 L/min flow rate. 
Blood oxygen levels are continuously monitored throughout the scan with a pulse oximeter. 
MRS (Magnetic resonance spectroscopy) - Optional Procedure
Chemical shift imaging (CSI) is performed to obtain spatial distribution of metabolites (NAA, choline, 
creatine, lactate, myoinositol, mobile lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]) in tumors and normal brain tissue. An adiabatic LASER 
sequence (Andronesi et al., 2009) with improved localization and excitation profile is used. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_816115] = 1.5 s, TE = 45 ms, weighted phase encoding, TA = 5 min, and a final voxel 
size of 5x5x15 mm3.  Optimization of shimming and water suppression is performed prior of CSI which 
needs 3 min, making the total time 8 min.  Metabolite maps are calculated using LCModel fitting 
software (Provencher et al., 1993).

portion of this joint research in accord with the terms and conditions of its OHRP-approved FWA.  
Institution B will conduct its portion of this joint research in accord with the terms and conditions of its 
OHRP-approved FWA.  This Agreement will be kept on file at both Institutions and will be available to 
OHRP upon request.
The NIH IRB retains responsibility for compliance with regulatory requirements under 45 C.F.R. Part 
46 and 21 C.F.R. 56 (as applicable) related to the administration and operation of the IRB.  These 
include, for example, following written procedures and maintaining records in accord with 45 C.F.R. 
parts 46.103 and 115, respectively.  Institution B agrees that the NIH IRB may suspend or terminate 
approval of research that is not conducted in accordance with the NIH IRB’s requirements or that is 
associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects pursuant to 45 C.F.R. 46.113.  The NIH IRB will 
notify Institution B of any non-compliance, or suspensions, or terminations of this research in a timely 
manner. 
Institution B will ensure that before implementing a change to an NIH IRB-approved protocol its 
investigator will obtain NIH IRB approval for the change (unless the change is designed to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to subjects), pursuant to 45 C.F.R. 46.103.  Institution B retains 
responsibility, pursuant to 45 C.F.R. Part 46, including subsections103 and 113, to promptly report to 
the NIH IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the HHS or NIH agency head any unanticipated 
risks to subjects or others, and any serious or continuing noncompliance with 45 C.F.R. Part 46 or the 
IRB’s requirements or determinations.  The NIH IRB may also make these reports, but doing so does 
not relieve Institution B of the obligation to report to institutional officials and HHS or NIH officials. 
This Agreement is effective on the date that the last official signs and may be terminated by [CONTACT_816140].  If the Agreement is terminated prior to the completion of the research, Institution B will 
need to obtain alternative IRB review.

The muscadine grape ( Vitis rotundifolia ), found in the warm, humid climate of southeast United 
States, has a distinct phytochemical composition as comp ared to other grape varieties.  The 
muscadine grape contains a high concentration of anthocyanin 3,[ADDRESS_516485] revealed  anti-tumor activity, including inhibition of tumor cell 
growth  and induction of apoptosis .4-7 Evidence from preclinical trials also suggests that muscadine 
grape products  may decrease systemic inflammation .8-11  Higher levels of inflammation may not 
only increase cancer recurrence risk,12 but also impair quality of life.  Higher levels of systemic 
inflammation are associated with increased fatigue13, reduced levels of physical activity,

muscadine  grape s could be a promising bioactive treatment  for bone metastatic cancer . 
Overview of p reliminary data from the investigative team : Preliminary studies from the 
investigative team (Gallagher/Tallant) demonstrate that muscadine grape seeds and skins 
reduced the proliferation of both human breast and prostate cancer cell  lines. The 
reduction in breast cancer cell growth was associated with a decrease in activate d mitogen 
activated protein (MAP) kinase, a critical enzyme involved in cell proliferation.  In addition, 
muscadine grape liquid extract  reduced the tumor burden in a transgenic model of 
spontaneous breast cancer with a concomitant attenuation in prolifera tion, tumor blood 
vessel formation, and tumor -associated 
fibrosis. These data are described below and 
provide additional rationale to assess the 
efficacy of Nature’s Pearl proprietary 
muscadine grape extract ( MGE ) on cancer  
outcomes in clinical studies .

equivalent of human breast cancer) by 6 - 8 
months of age.  Mice were treated with MG LE 
beginning at 3 weeks of age (at the time of 
weaning) a nd were sacrificed at 7½ months of 
age.  The dose of MG LE was approximately 1  
mg of phenolics for a 25 gram mouse (and is 
equivalent to approximately [ADDRESS_516501] per day for a 70 kg man and 
an average concentration of 20,000 mg of

Eighteen mice were treated for an average of 
220 days (beginning treatment at 21 days of age, at the time of weaning).  Ten (10) mice  
drank regular drinking water (c ontrol) and 8 mice drank water containing the MG LE.  
Although all of the mice developed tumors throughout their mammary tissue, there was a 
significant difference in the weight of the tumor mass, as shown in Figure 4 .

Protocol version date 10/5/2018              Page 12 of 31 Male C57 black mice (8 weeks of age) were randomized into groups to  receive drinking 
water alone (c ontrol) or MGE in the drinking water at four escalating doses of MGE as 
determined by [CONTACT_941] m easurement of total phenolics. Daily observations of the mice included 
evaluations f or weight loss, diarrhea, dehydration, edema, abdominal enlargement or 
ascites, progressive dermatitis, rough hair coat or unkempt appearance due to lack of 
grooming, hunched posture indicative of pain, lethargy or persistent  decumbency due to 
loss of appetite, coughing, labored breathing, nasal discharge, jaundice, cyanosis, 
pallor/anemia, neurological signs indicated by [CONTACT_409566], bleeding from any orifice, or any condition interferin g with daily activities. Prior 
to sacrifice, the mice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 hours, and food intake and 
fecal and urine output w ere measured to quantify markers of renal damage. During the 4th 
week of treatment, blood pressure was determined  by [CONTACT_409567], 
using the non -invasive, small animal VEVO ultrasound imaging system in the M and B 
modes, to measure or calculated ejection fraction, f ractional shortening, stroke volume, 
heart rate and cardiac output were determined.  The mice were sacrificed after one month 
of treatment; tissues (heart, kidney, lung, liver, spleen and brain) were weighed, fixed in 
4% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sec tioned at 5 microns and stained with Hematoxylin 
& Eosin (H & E) for analysis by a veterinary pathologist to assess any gross structural 
abnormalities.  
 
Four concentrations of the MGE were tested.  The range of concentrations to be tested 
was based upon pr evious studies in the Gallagher/Tallant laboratory reported above . In 
those studies, a daily concentration of 1 mg of total phenolics/mouse/day was effective at 
reducing tumor multiplicity.  For the toxicity studies in mice, the four doses of the MGE 
teste d were 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg total phenolics/mouse/day, administered to the mice 
in their drinking water. Total phenolic content was determined usin g the Folin -Ciocalteau 
reagent with gallic acid as the standard.  Since an average mouse of this age wei ghs 
approximately 25 g or 0.025 kg, this corresponds to a dose range of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg 
total phenolics/kg/day.  Based upon an average mass of 70 kg for a patient, this would 
correspond to 700, 1400, 2800, and 5600 mg phenolics/day. The proprietary Na ture’s 
Pearl muscadine grape extract capsule contains approximately 162 mg total 
phenolics/capsule, this would correspond to taking 5, 10, 21 and 42 capsules/day.   
 
Results  
During the [ADDRESS_516507] concentration of MGE had a small but 
significant decrease in total body weight (from 28.6 ± 1.2 grams to 25.0 ± 1.3 grams, which 
represents less than 15% of their total body weight).  However, there was no effect on food 
intake, fecal output or urine volume compared to the untreated mice, measured during the 
last week of treatment, suggesting little effect of the MGE on eating and drinking 
behaviors.

At the time of sacrifice, various organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen and brain) were 
removed and weighed and the organ weights of mice treated  with each dose of MGE were 
compared to the untreated control group. A portion of each organ was fixed in formalin, 
sectioned and stained with H & E, for assessment by a veterinary pathologist.  In addition, 
the heart and kidney were assessed  by [CONTACT_409568], respectively, as a further measure of heart and renal function.  There was 
no difference in the weight or structure of the hearts of mice treated with increasing doses 
of MGE . Cardiac parameters  including ejection fraction, fractional shortening, cardiac 
outpu t, stroke volume and heart rate were all similar in mice treated with MGE compared 
to untreated Control mice . There was no difference in the weight or structure of the lungs 
of mice treated with MGE compare d to the untreated c ontrol mice.  The weight of the livers 
of mice treated with the two lowest MGE (0.25 and 0.5 mg phenolics/mouse/day) and the 
highest MGE (2.0 mg phenolics/mouse/day) concentrations were no different than the 
weight of the  livers of the untreated mice.  However, the weight of the livers of mice in the 
1.0 mg phenolics/mouse/day) were slightly increased compared to the control. Spleen 
weight of mice treated with MGE was not significantly different than untreated control mice  
and the spleens of mice were generally within normal limits with one mouse in the highest 
MGE treatment group having some  extra medullary  hematopoiesis. The weight of the 
brains of mice treated with MGE was not significantly different than untreated mice.  The 
brains were subdivided into four regions —cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and 
brainstem . All brain regions examined were within normal limits .  
 
Conclusions from toxicity studies and corresponding clinical doses:  
Little toxicity was observed at any of  the doses tested . Therefore , the level of phenolics 
used to treat the mice suggests that this level of phenolics and corresponding numbers of 
capsules w ill likely be tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. However, based upon patient compliance, a 
recommended dose range f or patients would include 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10  capsules/day 
(corresponding to  approximately 5, 9, 14, 18 and 23  mg phenolics/kg/day) .

6.2.1 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as grade [ADDRESS_516530] s attributable to treatment or any grade 4 or 5 adverse event  
attributable  to treatment as per the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 criteria.  Any adverse event attributable to 
treatment and resulting in permanent discontinuation of MGE will be 
considered a DLT. Toxicity will be assessed at 4 weeks . Any DLTs that 
occur 1 day (day 29) after the [ADDRESS_516531] 4 weeks.  The w ashout per iod for this drug is 24 hours. Dose

In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
until one of the following criteria applie s: 
 
 Disease progression,  either by [CONTACT_409575],  
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the treating physician . 
 
6.5.1  Missed doses  
 
If a dose of MGE is missed, the patient will be instructed to take their next 
dose as scheduled. Missed doses should not be added to the next dose .  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Missed doses during first [ADDRESS_516537] will not be evaluable for the primary 
outcome and will be removed from the study. Participants who 
come off study prior to 28 days for reasons other than toxicity will 
be evaluated for DLT during the washout period (24 h ours, per 
section 6.2.1).  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Missed doses after first [ADDRESS_516538] be restarted within 
21 days  or the patient will be removed from the study.   
 
6.6 Duration of Follow Up  
 
Patients removed from the study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed 
until resolution or stab ilization of the adverse event.  Patients who are removed or 
withdraw from the study  for any reason other than  toxicity will be followed for vital 
status only  after the 24 hour w ashout period . Patients will be followed every 6 ± [ADDRESS_516539]  
 
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, patients with measurable disease will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_1963] , based on the clinical radiologic report  and clinical status ,

Evaluable for toxicity  (primary outcome) : All patients will be evaluable for toxicity 
from the time of their first treatment with MGE.  Per section 6.5.1, patients who miss 
[ADDRESS_516541] 28 days for reasons other than toxicity 
are not evaluable and will be removed from the study and replaced . 
 
Inevaluable for objective response : When no imaging/measurement is done at all 
at a particular time poin t, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.    
 
Measurable disease : Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be re corded) with a minimu m size of [ADDRESS_516542] X -ray. 
 
Non-measurable lesions : Non -measurable lesions include:  bony metastases,  
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast  disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses  or 
organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_409576].  
 
Progression -Free Survival  is defined  as the duration of time from the start of 
treatment to the time of progression  or death.  Patients will be followed until disease 
progression and death.  
 
Overall Survival  is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to 
date of death.  
 
7.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up 
whenever possible . Measurements will be obtained from u sual care imaging and 
assessed by [CONTACT_978](s) in confirmation with the physician of record.  
 
 CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. MRI  and PET/CT are al so acceptable . 
 Lesions on a ches t X-ray may be considered measurable lesions if they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥10 mm in diameter as assessed using calip ers. For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Tumor markers alone will not typi[INVESTIGATOR_409545]. If markers 
are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to 
be considered in complete response.  
 Cytology and histology can be used in rare cases (e.g., for evaluation of 
residual masses to differentiate between Partial Response and Complete 
Response or evaluation of new or enlarging effusions to differentiate between 
Progressive Disease and Response/Stable Disease).

The primary objective of determining the safety and MTD of MGE will be completed  
by [CONTACT_409577].   
 
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MGE in patients with 
metastatic cancer , we will use  a standard 3+3 Phase 1 dose escalation statistical 
design. All MGE dose esc alations conducted will be escalated according to the 
dose e scalation scheme (see Section 6.2 ). The number of pat ients in each cohort 
will be 3.  If no patients in any cohort develop a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), dose 
escalation will continue in cohorts of [ADDRESS_516551] cohort may be as few as 2.  Dose escalatio n is 
considered to be complete.  The dose level that induces a DLT in 2 or more patients 
is considered to be above MTD , and the dose level immediately below the dose 
level that induced a DLT in ≥2 patients is considered the MTD for MGE if ≤[ADDRESS_516552] been tested, the investigators will consider stopp ing additional dose 
escalation.  The decision will be based on the actual dose level tested, the extent 
of anti -tumor efficacy observed, and the type of toxicity observed, etc.  
 
12.2 Analysis of Secondary Objective  
 
12.2.1  To monitor toxicity at 4, 8, and every 4 weeks thereafter on MGE  
 
To analyze objective 2.1.1, we will summarize any expected toxicities, any 
laboratory based toxicities, and any grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal 
toxicities and any grade 4 or higher toxicities using frequency tables  overall 
and by [CONTACT_5875] . 
 
12.2.2  To evaluate change in phenolic levels (total and component, blood and 
urine)  from baseline to [ADDRESS_516553] ive 2.2.2, we will fit a mixed model ANOVA mo del with 
phenolic level as the outcome and time (baseline, 4, and 8 weeks) as a 
fixed effect and subject as a random effect. We will use contrasts to 
estimate the changes from baseline to week [ADDRESS_516554] (cytokine or growth factor) as the outcome and time 
(baseline, 4, and 8 weeks) as a fixed effect and subje ct as a random effect.

Protocol version date 10/5/[ADDRESS_516556] response at the end of 
treatment with MGE using a frequency table.  
 
12.2.5  To assess overall and progression -free survival in patients with metastatic 
cancer receiving MGE.  
 
To analyze objective 2. 2.5, we will summarize o verall survival and 
progression -free survival using the Kaplan -Meier method.  We will calculate 
median survival rates and associated 95% confidence intervals. Patients 
will be censored at date of last contact.  
 
12.2.6  To assess globa l quality of life and fatigue in cancer patients taking MGE.  
 
Quality of Life and fatigue will be monitored every 4 weeks until the end of 
the study. To analyze objective 2. 2.6, we will fit a mixed model ANOVA 
model with phenolic level as the outcome and t ime (baseline, every 4 
weeks) as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect. We will use 
contrasts to estimate the changes from baseline to each follow -up time 
period.  
 
12.2.7  To assess adherence to MGE treatment.  
 
To analyze objective 2. 2.7, we will summarize the percent of pi[INVESTIGATOR_409547] 4 week period i using the formula:  
 
𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡  𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑠  𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑒𝑛 𝑖= (𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙  ×7 ×4)𝑖−𝑃𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 𝑖
(𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝐿𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑙  ×7 ×4)𝑖. 
 
In the formula above, pi[INVESTIGATOR_409548]’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642]. The 
percent of pi[INVESTIGATOR_409549]

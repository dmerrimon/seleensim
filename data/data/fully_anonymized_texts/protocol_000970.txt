  1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
• To evaluate th e efficacy and safety of denosumab therapy for the treatment of bone loss in 
patients who have received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  
2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Bone Health in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant  
Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) is a curative treatment of hematologic 
malignancies but can have varying effects on quality of life due to complications. 1Amongst 
survivorship monitoring in these patients bone mineral density (BMD) by [CONTACT_751] -energy x -ray 
absorpt iometry (DXA) scan is commonly monitored due to accelerated bone loss from the effects 
of previous chemotherapy, the HSCT, and/or administration of steroids. Previous research has 
shown on average a patient undergoing HSCT can expect to have a decrease in BMD by 3.5% to 
8.5% correlating with [ADDRESS_509535]. 
2Furthermore, accelerated bone loss exponentially increases the risk of a fracture with 10% to 15% 
of bone loss correlated to a doubling of the fracture risk regardless of osteopenia/osteoporosis 
status. This is leadi ng to direct and indirect increases in treatment costs as well as a hindrance to 
the quality of life of post -HSCT patients. [ADDRESS_509536] patients but can be associated with 
adve rse effects, including infusion reactions associated with fevers and flu -like symptoms, which 
can lead to unsubstantiated evaluation and treatment of infection, decreased compliance, and 
even discontinuation. 4Denosumab is a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand 
(RANKL) inhibitor which is also currently approved for treatment of osteoporosis and is less 
likely to be associated with the same injection reactions as zoledronic acid 
(http://www.pi.amgen.com/~/media/amgen/repositorysites/pi -amgen -com/prolia/prolia_pi.ashx ). 
Currently, there has been minimal data produced on the efficacy and safety of  denosumab in 
HSCT patients. To address this lack of published data, Roswell Park and Cleveland Clinic are 
proposing a joint phase [ADDRESS_509537] 
patients.  
2.2 Denosumab  
Denosumab is a fully human monoclon al antibody with high affinity and specificity to RANK 
Ligand (RANKL) leading to decreased activation. Denosumab has high specificity to RANKL 
while being devoid of activity towards other members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family 
including TNFα, TN Fβ, TNF -related apoptosis -inducing ligand (TRAIL), or CD40 ligand. Down 
regulation of RANKL caused by [CONTACT_404160],  leading to an increase in bone mass and strength.  
Currently, denosumab  is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for treatment of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women as well as men at increased or high risk for fracture, bone loss due to

high risk for fracture.  
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of 
denosumab can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.2.1 Mechanism of Action  
Denosumab Binds to RANKL, a transmembrane or soluble protein esse ntial for the formation, 
function, and survival of osteoclasts, the cells responsible for bone resorption. Prolia prevents 
RANKL from activating its receptor, RANK, on the surface of osteoclasts and their precursors. 
Prevention of the RANKL/ RANK interacti on inhibits osteoclast formation, function, and survival, 
thereby [CONTACT_404161].  
2.2.2 Preclinical Pharmacology and Pharmacokinetics  
Onset of action : Decreases markers of bo ne resorption by ~85% within 3 days; maximal reduction 
observed within 1 month.  
Duration : Markers of bone resorption return to baseline within 12 months of discontinuing therapy2 
Bioavailability : SubQ: 62% 
Half-life elimination : ~25 to 28 days 
Time to peak : 10 days (range 3 to 21) 
Elimination : Clearance may occur via reticuloendothelial system; renal excretion not expected 
2.2.3 Toxicology/ Interactions  
No preclinical drug -drug interactions were studied using Denosumab.  
In ovariectomized monkeys, once -monthly tre atment with Denosumab suppressed bone turnover 
and increased bone mineral density and strength of cancellous and cortical bone at doses 50 -fold 
higher than the recommended human dose of 60  mg administered once every 6 months, based on 
body weight. Bone tis sue was normal with no evidence of mineralization defects, accumulation of 
osteoid or woven bone.  
Adolescent primates treated with Denosumab at doses >10 times higher than the recommended 
human dose of 60  mg administered once every 6 months, based on mg/ k g, had abnormal growth 
plates, considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of Denosumab.  
RANK/ RANKL knockout mice exhibited absence of lymph node formation, as well as an absence 
of lactation due to inhibition of mammary gland maturation . Neonatal RANK/ RANKL knockout 
mice exhibited reduced bone growth and lack of tooth eruption. A corroborative study in 2 -week -
old rats given the RANKL inhibitor also showed reduced bone growth, altered growth plates, and 
impaired tooth eruption.

  2.3 Clinical Studies with Denosumab  
2.3.1 Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Fracture  
A 3-year, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial enrolled postmenopausal women 
with baseline BMD T -scores between -2.5 and -4.0 at either the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_404146] : 
A total of 7808 woman were enrolled with a mean age of 72 years and either received denosumab 
60 mg (n=3902) or placebo (n=3906) every 6 months along with 1000 mg calcium and 400 IU 
vitamin D daily. The primary efficacy variable was incidence of vertebral fracture after 3 years. 
The incidence of new vertebral fractures was clinically significant (P < 0.0001) between the 
placebo group (7.2%) compared to the denosumab group (2.3%) over the 3 -year period. This 
produced an absolute risk reduction of 4.8% and a relative risk reduction of 68%. A secondary 
outcome of the study was incidence of hip fractures which was clinically significant (P=0.04) as 
well between the placebo group (1.2%) compared to the denosumab group (0.7%) after 3 years. 
This produced an absolu te risk reduction of 0.3% and a relative risk reduction of 40%.  
2.3.2 Osteoporosis in Men at High Risk for Fracture  
A 1-year, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial enrolled men with baseline BMD T -
scores between -2.0 and -3.5 as well as men with pr evious fractures with BMD T -scores between 
-1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_404147] : 
A total of 242 men were enrolled with a mean age of 65 years and either received denosumab 60 
mg (n=121) or placebo (n=121) every 6 months along with 1000 mg calc ium and 400 IU vitamin 
D daily. The primary efficacy variable was percentage change in the BMD of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
total hip, and femora neck from baseline to 1 year. The treatment differences were 4.8% [(+0.9% 
placebo, +5.7% denosumab (95% CI 4.0, 5.6), p< 0.0001)] at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 2% (+0.3% placebo, 
+2.4% denosumab) at the hip, and 2.2% (0.0% placebo, +2.1% denosumab) at femoral neck.  
2.3.3 Treatment of Bone Loss in Men with Prostate Cancer  
A 3-year, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multinational  study : 
The trial enrolled men < 70 years of age with baseline BMD T -scores between -1.0 and -4.0 at the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip or femoral neck, or had a history of osteoporotic fracture. A total of 1468 
men were enrolled with a median age of 76 years (Ra nge: 48 to 97 years) and either received 
denosumab 60 mg (n=734) or placebo (n=734) every 6 months for a total of 6 doses along with 
1000 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. The primary efficacy variable was percentage 
change in the BMD of the lumbar sp ine from baseline to 2 years. The treatment differences were 
6.7% ( -1.0% placebo, +5.6% denosumab; (95% CI 6.2, 7.1); p< 0.0001)  
2.3.[ADDRESS_509539] Cancer  
A 2-year, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multinational study : 
The trial enrolled women with baseline BMD T -scores between -1.0 and -2.5 at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
total hip or femoral neck, and had not experienced a fracture after age 25. A total of 252 women 
were enrolled with a median age of 59 years (Range: 35 to 84 ye ars) and either received denosumab 
60 mg (n=127) or placebo (n=125) every 6 months for a total of 4 doses along with 1000 mg 
calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. The primary efficacy variable was percentage change in the

[ADDRESS_509545] 2022 , with follow -up 
for 12 months from the start of investigational treatment. We will attempt to enroll 75 patients at 
Roswell Park and 75 patients at the Cleveland Clinic with a goal of 57 evaluable patients at each 
site for a total of 114 evaluable patient s. In the event that one site reaches that site’s expected 
accrual number goal before the other site’s goal is met, the site that has reached the site expected 
accrual may continue to enroll patients in order to contribute to the overall accrual goal.  
Patient’s participation in the study will be initiated with enrollment and last for approximately 365 
days with  completion of “Day 465” DXA Scan.  
Patients will be given a maximum of two (2) subcutaneous doses of denosumab [ADDRESS_509546] 2022 , and completion of data collection will take 
365 days from the final patient enrolled. We estimate preliminar y analyses will be completed 2 
years after the completion of the study accrual.  
8 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
8.1 Primary Endpoint(s)  
• The primary endpoint will be BMD on “Day 465” DXA Scans ( Appendix E) in 
comparison to “Day 100” DXA scans based on the percent change in BMD (g/cm2) in the 
Total hip  and/or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_404153]. Stabilization of BMD will be 
defined as a Least Significant Change (LSC) in BMD from “Day 100” DXA to “Day 465” 
DXA while improvement will be defined as any increase in BMD from “Day 100” DXA 
to “Day 465” DXA.

  8.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include:  
• Percent change in BMD between the pre -HSCT and the Day 465 DXA scans for Total hip 
and/or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) 
• Frequency of bone fractures  
• Frequency of adverse effects of denosumab (see section 17) including but not limited t o 
the following:  
o Injection/Hypersensitivity related reactions  
o Osteonecrosis of the jaw  
o Graft Versus Host Disease  
[ADDRESS_509547] and at the “Day +100” DXA scan must 
have decrease in BMD compared to the pre -transplant DXA scan, or have osteopenia, and/or 
osteoporosis on  either the pre -HSCT or Day +100 (up to 6 months) post-HSCT DXA scan.  
This is a Phase II multicenter, single -arm, open -label study where all patients who meet inclusion 
criteria will receive the study drug (denosumab). All patients will be followed for about [ADDRESS_509548] dose of denosumab and/or a minimum of [ADDRESS_509549] HS C infusion (Day 0). A 
total of 150 patients will be accrued. Assuming 80% complete the follow -up period, 114 patients 
should be evaluable for the primary endpoint. Patients with a Day +100 and Day +[ADDRESS_509550] one dose of denos umab, will be considered evaluable for 
response/efficacy. Response/Efficacy will be based on stabilization and/or improvement of BMD 
(defined in Section 8.1). Patients who received at least one dose of denosumab will be evaluable 
for safety.  
10 TREATMENT  
Reported adverse events (AEs) and potential risks are described in Section 13. Appropriate dose 
modifications are described in Section 10.2. 
Treatment is intended for an outpatient setting. Howeve r, at the investigator’s/physician’s 
discretion, the participant may receive treatment as an inpatient, if deemed necessary.

  17.1.1  Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs  and symptoms 
(e.g.,  record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow -up information.  
17.1.2  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring seco ndary to other events (e.g.,  cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.  
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be  recorded separately on 
the CRF.  
17.1.3  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant (Grade 3 -5)  laboratory abnormalities that do not predate the 1st infusion 
of the investigational agent,  that require active management will be recorded as AEs or SAEs  on 
the CRF (e.g.,  abnormalities that require study drug dose modification, discontinuation of study 
treatment, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.).  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin 5  x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g.,  cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory a bnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or 
SAE. F or example, an elevated blood potassium level of 7  mEq/L should be recorded as 
“hyperkalemia”.  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless th eir severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes.  
17.1.4  Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on 
an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g.,  “more frequent headaches”).

17.2.1  Grading and R elationship to Drug  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Version  5 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP 
Version  5 of the CTCAE is identified and located at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
AEs not covered by [CONTACT_404164]  5. 
The relationship of event to study drug will be documented by [CONTACT_73951]:  
• Unrelated:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.  
• Unlikely:  The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
• Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration and follows a known re sponse pattern to the study drug. The event cannot 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant drugs.  
• Definite:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time o f drug 
administration, follows a known response pattern to the study drug, cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s condition, therapeutic interventions or 
concomitant drugs; AND occurs immediately following study drug admi nistration, 
improves upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478], or reappears on re -exposure.

18.1 Data Collection  
Full build studies are managed by [CONTACT_404165]. All electronic case report form (eCRF) data are captured for these studies.  
Data management activities are performed using a CTMS system that enables the collection, 
cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS Data Management designs the study -specific 
database and facilitates development by [CONTACT_404166]. Once the database 
design is appr oved by [CONTACT_737], Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the 
database is put into production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by 
[CONTACT_356709].  
18.2 Maintenance of Study Documents  
Essential documents will be retained per Roswell Park’s policy for 6  years from the study 
termination date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by 
[CONTACT_404167] R oswell Park.  
18.3 Revisions to the Protocol  
Roswell Park may make such changes to the protocol as it deems necessary for safety reasons or 
as may be required by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA or other regulatory agencies. Revisions will be submitted to 
the IRB/ERC for written ap proval before implementation.  
18.[ADDRESS_509564] the site will be 
identified only by a participant identification number (Participant ID, PID) to maintain 
confidentiality. All records will be kept in a limited access environment. All computer entry and 
networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. Information will not be released without 
written authorization of the participant.  
19 STATISTICAL PLAN  
The primary objective is to show the effectiveness of denosumab on stabilization and/or 
improvement of BMD ( defined in Section 8.1) in allogeneic HSCT patients who have experienced 
either BMD loss between baseline (pre -HSCT) and Day +100 (up to 6 months) post-HSCT, or 
who have osteopenia or osteoporosis at either the pre -BMT or Day+100 (up to 6 months) post -
HSCT DXA scan. DXA scans will be obtained at baseline (pre - HSCT), at time of enrollment (Day

  +100 , (up to 6 months)  post- HSCT) and at Day +[ADDRESS_509565]. The primary endpoint will be 
the slope in bone mineral density (g/cm2) regressed on time from the time of enrollment to Day 
[ADDRESS_509566] in both Total Hip  and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (average of L1 -L4). 
The primary analysis for both the Total Hip and lumbar spin e will consist of a regression model 
of the percent change from enrollment to Day [ADDRESS_509567] Square (OLS) methods. 
A secondary model will include and expand upon a list of covariates to explore the effects of 
demographic, disease and treatment characteristics on BMD loss and effectiveness of denosumab 
using an a nalysis -of-covariance (ANCOVA) model. Examples of covariates to be tested are age, 
sex, corticosteroid exposure, and graft -versus -host disease. Given the assumed high degree of 
correlation between the Total Hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_404155], both models will be 
tested at alpha=0.05 (two -sided). Residual plots and other diagnostic methods will be used to 
evaluate compliance with model assumptions and goodness of fit.  
It is assumed under the null that the historical percent change in BMD from enrollm ent in the Total 
Hip is -6.3% and for the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] -2.3%, which translates to testing in our regression model 
about the hypotheses 𝐻0: 𝛽1=−0.063 vs 𝐻𝑎: 𝛽1≠−0.063 and 𝐻0: 𝛽1=−0.023 vs 𝐻𝑎: 𝛽1≠
−0.023 for the Total Hip and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], respectively.  
19.1 Sample Size Determination  
BMD will be reported in g/cm2. We are setting the sample size target to n= 114 evaluable subjects 
assuming a 20% drop -out rate between enrollment and Day [ADDRESS_509568] a  regression coefficient for the Total Hip different from 𝛽1=−0.[ADDRESS_509569] a regression coefficient for the lumber different from 
𝛽1=−0.[ADDRESS_509570] deviation for th e Total Hip 
BMD percent change of 5% and a standard deviation for the lumber BMD percent change of 2.5%.  
19.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive statistics (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demo graphic and baseline characteristics.  
19.[ADDRESS_509571] one dose of denosumab will be evaluable for 
toxicity.

  Appendix E X-Ray Bone Densitometer  
 
Intended Use  
 
The X -ray Bone Densitometer (DPX -Bravo, DPX -Duo, DPX -NT, Prodigy, iDXA) supports the 
following intended uses:  
 
Provides an estimate of bone mineral density at various anatomical sites (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Total Hip , Total 
Body, and Forearm). These values can then be compared to an Adult reference population at the 
sole discretion of the physician.  
 
Provides an assessment of relative fracture risk based on the patient’s T -score value using the 
categories of fracture risk defined by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO).  
 
Provides a standardized bone density report using data from each densitometer and p hysician - 
generated assessments based on the patient’s demographics, which can assist the physician in 
communicating scan results to the patient and the patient’s referring physician  
 
Device Description  
 
Structure  
 
The X -Ray Bone Densitometer is made up of a scan arm, X -ray source assembly, and exam 
table.  
 
Product Model  
 
DPX Bravo and Duo  
 
The DPX Bravo and Duo models use pencil beam technology with a single -crystal detector and 
have a compact table design to provi de space efficiency (see images below).  
The DPX Duo and the DPX Bravo come equipped with a scan arm that swings to the side of the 
table when not in use when not in use as a densitometer and to facilitate patient loading. X -ray 
scanning is not possible un til the scan arm is locked into the scan position. A handle releases the 
scan arm interlock and allows operator to move the scan arm for patient loading. Once the 
patient is loaded on the table, the operator moves the scan arm back to scanning position and  the 
arm locks into scan position.  
 
Measurement/Reporting  
 
Bone Mineral Density (BMD) is measured using Dual -Energy X -Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA).  
 
The bone mineral density of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], L1 -L4, and the Total Hip total mean is measured 
in g/cm2 as well  as standard deviations within the young adult population and within the age -
matched mean. These are also compared to baseline data as a percentage change.

wishing to participate, prior to any procedures or treatment . 
• An informed consent template is provided  by [CONTACT_404172].  
• All consent changes must  be reviewed by [CONTACT_404173].  
• The informed consent must be IRB approved.  
• Always check that the most  up to date version of the IRB approved consent is being used.  
• Within 5 business days, notify the Roswell Park CRS QA Network Office of all participant 
withdrawals or consent to limited study participation and appropriately document the 
discontinuation and  the reason(s) why.  
3. PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION  
The participant completes the Gender, Race, and Ethnicity Form and this is placed in the study 
binder.  
Roswell Park does not grant exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
Phase  [ADDRESS_509584] be emailed 
([EMAIL_7725] ) to the Roswell Park CRS QA Network Office 
within [ADDRESS_509585] and email it to the Roswell Park 
Network QA Coordinator at CRSNetwo [EMAIL_7726] . 
4. STUDY DEVIATIONS

• Use only black ink for documentation on the accountability form and any other study 
forms.  
• It is the responsibility of Roswell Park to inform the  Investigator/ institution as to when 
these documents no longer need to be retained. If, for any reason, the Investigator desires 
to no longer maintain the study records, they may be transferred to another institution, 
another investigator, or to Roswell P ark upon written agreement between the Investigator 
and Roswell Park.  
6. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
Drug accountability must be strictly maintained.  
• Responsibility rests solely with the Investigator but can be delegated as appropriate (e.g.,  to 
pharmacy personnel).

1 Remote glucose monitoring using the Dexcom G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549133] (DKA)  
Study Purpose and Rationale:  
We propose to study use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM )for glucose monitoring in patients 
with DKA which would enable the treatment of hemodynamically stable DKA patients outside of 
intensive care units (ICU) thereby [CONTACT_549146] a precious resource which have become extremely 
scarce resourc e during COVID -19 pandemic (1). In most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], protocols for treatment of patients 
with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) require capi[INVESTIGATOR_549134] (POC) glucose testing every 1 -2 hours (2) . 
Often, patients need to be transferred to the intensive care  units (ICU) for frequent fingerstick glucose 
monitoring in order to safely administer intravenous insulin to treat the DKA. During the COVID -19 
pandemic, this need to transfer patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) for treatment of DKA and the 
requirem ent for nurses to enter the room every 1 -2 hours has contributed to scarcity of critical care unit 
beds and shortage personal protective equipment (PPE) Additionally, COVID -[ADDRESS_718782] been 
prone to develop DKA which has further increased the need for  ICU beds (3, 4). Therefore, methods to 
safely and effective treat patients with DKA outside of ICU setting represent a common and pressing 
need.    
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in the outpatient setting but its use is still 
investigat ional in the inpatient setting. Several studies showed improvement in detection of 
hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_549135] (POC) glucose testing in both the ICU and non -ICU setting (5 -8). The F DA has allowed use of 
DEXCOM G6 CGM in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549136] -19 pandemic (9). In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_549137] -19 pandemic done in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549138], 
DEXCOM G6 CGM showed a mean absolute re lative difference (MARD) of 9.4% compared to point of 
care (POC) glucose measurements (10). Use of continuous glucose monitoring has not been reported in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549139]. The DEXCOM G6 CGM (https://www.DEXCOM G6.com/) provides 
glucose levels  in real time, as well as glucose trends, and alarms if glucose levels are in hypoglycemic or 
hyperglycemic range. These safety features can decrease the risk of hypoglycemia when patients with 
DKA are being treated with insulin infusion. Furthermore, the DEXCOM G6 CGM is labeled as an 
“integrated continuous glucose monitoring system” which can reliably and securely transmit glucose 
data to digital devices allowing remote monitoring of glucose levels by [CONTACT_549147]’s room and thus reducing the number of healthcare contact [CONTACT_549148] (PPE). If CGM is shown to be non -inferior to fingerstick glucose 
monitoring (measured by [CONTACT_549149], incidence of hypoglycemia) in patients with DKA, then 
hemodynamically stable non -intubated DKA patients would not have to be transferred to the ICU for 
frequent fingerstick glucose testing as is now being done. Instead, these patients could be treated and 
monitored with CGM on the stepdown unit. This wou ld help reallocate critical care unit beds, save time 
and effort for the nurses and help conserve PPE.

2 Study Design:  
Retrospective Quality Improvement Data  
In January [ADDRESS_718783] with goal to 
treat  non-critically ill  DKA patients outside of ICU setting in order to reallocate  ICU beds  for critically ill 
patients  at [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] /Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Before this 
quality improvement project, DKA patients we re treated in the ICU setting because the DKA protocol 
requires hourly fingerstick glucose monitoring, which is considered higher level of care and not 
appropriate for stepdown unit or medical/surgical wards.  During this quality improvement project, we 
monitored glucose levels remotely with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device DEXCOM G6 thus 
eliminating the need for hourly fingerstick glucose testing.  Therefore, patients with DKA whose glucose 
levels have been monitored via DEXCOM G6 CGM have been t reated in the stepdown unit instead of the 
ICU setting where glucose levels are monitoring hourly via fingerstick point of care glucose testing. We 
enrolled 48 patients (with additional 2 patients who had glucose levels monitored with CGM but were 
treated  in the ICU setting therefore will not be used for this analysis).  
Study participants were not being recruited and asked for their participation; non-critically ill DKA 
patients who presented  in DKA had glucose levels monitored via CGM. Given that the rec ommended 
hourly fingerstick checks needed for treatment could not be performed on the stepdown unit and only 
in the ICU, the Dexcom  G6 CGM  device eliminated the need for hourly fingerstick checks and thus 
removed the barrier for patients being admitted to stepdown.  Once the number of COVID cases 
decreased and ICU beds were more readily available, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549140] -COVID 
standard of care, which was admitting DKA  patient to the ICU for hourly glucose monitoring  and we 
stopped enrolli ng patients for this retrospective quality improvement project  
We propose to study outcomes of DKA patients who had glucose levels monitored with DEXCOM G6 
CGM  treated in the stepdown unit. The primary outcome is time to resolution of metabolic acidosis. 
Secondary outcomes are length of ICU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], frequency of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_549141] <70 mg/dl and cost savings   
Prospective Study 
The prospective  part of this study  will involve recruiting patients in the E mergency Department  and 
offering them the opportunity to use DEXCOM G6 CGM instead of hourly  fingerstick  point of care 
glucose testing . We will enroll additional [ADDRESS_718784] gl ucose levels 
monitored via DEXCOM CGM and be treated in the stepdown unit.  The primary outcome is time to 
resolution of metabolic acidosis. Secondary outcomes are length of ICU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
frequency of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_549142] g lucose level <70 mg/dl and cost savings . 
Inclusion Criteria: 
age >18,  AG >20 (normal is 5 -17) with bicarbonate <1 9 (normal is 19 -27), positive urine ketones or beta 
hydroxybutyrate  >0.3 (normal is <0.27)  
glucose level >250 mg/dl on presentation to the ED  
02/1 7/2023  
3 Exclusion criteria: 
hypotension (BP below 80/60), require pressor therapy , or have any contraindication for utilizing 
Dexcom CGM ,, altered mental status, lack of decision making capacity, mechanical ventilation or non -
invasive ventilation, chronic kidney disease with GFR <30 in cluding patie nts with hemodialysis,  
pregnancy, other clinical reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) , are excluded from study 
participation  
Provider Survey /nurses satisfaction  
We will study nurses’ satisfaction evaluating remote glucose monitoring in D KA patients using DEXCOM 
G6 CGM  by [CONTACT_549150]. We will evaluate nurses ’ satisfaction only for the 
prospective part of the study.  
Statistical Procedures:  
The primary outcome for this study is the time to resolution of DKA. We will compare time to resolution 
of the DKA of patients who had glucose levels monitored via DEXCOM G6 CGM and treated in the 
stepdown unit (both those enrolled in the retrospective stu dy and those who will be enrolled in the 
prospective study) to DKA patients who had glucose levels monitored hourly via fingerstick (and not 
CGM ) and treated in the ICU setting.  
We will perform a non -inferiority trial  to study whether monitoring glucose l evels via CGM in DKA 
patients treated in the stepdown unit is not inferior to DKA treated patients in the ICU setting with 
hourly fingerstick glucose monitoring.  
For a noninferiority trial, based on what we have previously observed for the time to resolut ion of DKA, 
and a noninferiority margin of 1/[ADDRESS_718785] a 90% power to determine noninferiority at an alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_718786] 90% power and a noninferiority at an alpha level of 0.05. We plan a conservative 
approach where we will enroll additional [ADDRESS_718787] glucose leve ls monitored via 
CGM. We will compare with the historical control using 1:[ADDRESS_718788] historical control 
data which include DKA patients treated for DKA in the ICU setting with hourly fingerstick glucose 
monitoring.  
We will perform line ar regression (for patients enrolled in both retrospective and prospective part of the 
study) to learn what clinical factors are associated with length of time to the DKA resolution. Then we 
will use propensity matching for historical control group (DKA pa tients treated in the ICU setting with 
glucose levels monitored via hourly fingerstick glucose levels) . 
02/1 7/2023  
4 To study the frequency of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (<70 mg/dl)  in patients from both prospective and 
retrospective study;  we will use CGM glucose data  stored  manufacture’s web based software : Clarity.  
We will also evaluate frequency of hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (glucose level <70%) in historical control 
patients who wer e treated for DKA in the ICU and had hourly glucose level monitoring.  
We will evaluate potential cost savings comparing treatment of DKA patients in the stepdown unit using 
DEXCOM G6 CGM  (both retrospective quality improvement project and prospective stu dy vs treatment 
of DKA patients in the ICU setting using hourly point of care glucose testing  (historical controls) . We will 
include variables such as daily cost of ICU stay vs stepdown unit, cost of DEXCOM CGM.  
We will calculate satisfaction scores from nursing surveys for the prospective part of the study.  
There are no validate d surveys assessing provider satisfaction as use of CGM in the inpatient setting is 
still a novel approach. We will use a modified CGM survey used for patient/caregivers (11)  
Study Procedures : 
Retrospective  Quality Improvement Project  
We will search electronic medical records  (EMR)  for laboratory data and clinical notes to estimate time 
to resolution of the DKA. Laboratory data  and p atient’s  character istics which can contribute to time to 
resolution of DKA  will be needed to match historical controls (DKA patients treated in the ICU setting 
with and glucose levels monitored via hourly fingerstick) .  All relevant data will be gathered from chart 
review and stored in Excel format on a secure Department of Surgery server. All statistical analysis will 
be conducted in cooperation with Center for Innovation and Outcomes Research of the Department of 
Surgery.  
Prospective Study  
Patients who have glucose levels monitored by [CONTACT_549151] (ICU) setting.  Glucose levels from the CGM will be transmitted to the smartphones 
devices which will be provided to the provider and nurse taking care of the patient by [CONTACT_3476].  
We provided extensive training for the ED staff and Stepdown Unit staff regarding the use of CGM in 
patients with DKA. Additionally, we will provide information sheet describing provider and nurses ’ role 
when DKA patients are monitored via CGM.  
02/1 7/2023  
5 Once provider and the nurse  in the ED  give verbal consent for the study, and patient gives a written 
consent, a research coordinator will attach CGM DEXCOM G6 device  (which consists of sensor and 
transmitter) on patient’s arm  and set up smartphone devices (study patient smartphone, study provider 
smartphone and study nurse smartphone) to receive glucose levels from the CGM device.  
Description of the remote glucose monitoring via CGM device and workflow: 
1.A research  coordinator will apply sensor (which senses glucose levels just below the skin from
the interstitial fluid) and transmitter (which gets glucose information from the sensor and send
glucose information to the DEXCOM G6 app via Bluetooth to the smart p hone provided by [CONTACT_549152]) on the patient. The D excom  CGM will be attached to the upper arm or lower
abdomen. The patient  will be asked  for their preference. The Dexcom CGM should not be place d
where  the patient is lying down or sleeps.  CGM  will not be placed on  scars, hair, tattoos, irrita ted
areas , areas where the sensor can be rubbed (waist band, seat belt), and insulin injection sites.
The patient may already be wearing their own  personal  CGM , which should not be removed.  If
the patient’s personal  CGM is on the arm, the stu dy Dexcom CGM  will be attached to the lower
abdomen. I f the patient’s personal CGM is on the lower abdomen, the study Dexcom CGM will be
attached  to the patient’s upper arm.  The study patient smartphone receiving glucose level  data
needs to be placed on the  patient’s  IV pole next to the insulin bag.
In order to have glucose levels sent from the transmitter to the DEXCOM app , each patient  needs to 
have a user name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a password. A user name [CONTACT_549155] [CONTACT_5055] . Patient’s information is coded when transmitted to these phones, meaning that instead 
of referencing any PHI such as MRN to id entify the patient, the patient is labeled via a unique study -
specific identifier (“study participate 001”). If the phones were to get lost, there will be no concern for 
improper release of PHI. The “ study smartphone for the patient ” is placed on the IV pole next to insulin 
infusion  bag.  
2.A study coordinator will set app DEXCOM follow apps  (which are necessary for glucose to be
sent from the patient study phone)  on the  study  smartphones given to the nurse and provider for
remote glucose monitoring.
There is a 2 hour “warm up” period until glucose levels are transmitted the  study patient  
smartphone and during that time glucose levels should be checked via hourly fingerstick as per 
the DKA protocol.  

02/1 7/2023  
6 3.Once glucose levels are transmitted to the  study  smartphone devices, glucose levels from the
CGM to guide insulin adjustments. Check fingerstick glucose if CGM glucose levels are  <100
mg/dl and >350 mg/dl to guide treatment decisions. Note that CGM device will have audible alerts
if glucose level  are < 100  mg/dl and >350 mg/dl. If there are NO glucose levels transmitted to the
phone please check q [ADDRESS_718789] Magdalena Bogun (347 831 28
41). If CGM glucose data cannot restored and patient needs q 1 hour fingerstick  glucose testing,
patient will be transferred to the ICU. If patient is moved to the ICU the  CGM will be removed.
Although CGM data will be transmitted to the  study  smartphone devices continuously, please
monitor  CGM  glucose levels every 1 hour and make tr eatment decisions based on q 1 -hour CGM
readings or more frequently  when glucose levels are <70 mg/dl (confirmed with a fingerstick
glucose).  If patient’s glucose levels are <100 mg/dl on the CGM , fingerstick glucose testing will be
performed to ensure tha t fingerstick glucose level is not in hypoglycemic range (<70 mg/dl).   If
patient’s glucose levels are  in hypoglycemic range ( <70 mg/dl ) , fingerstick glucose levels testing
will be performed as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549143]. Once hypoglycemia
resolves, then glucose levels from the CGM can be used for further insulin adjustments. In the
Emergency Department, document gluc ose levels q [ADDRESS_718790], sensor and transmitter will be removed prior to
the imaging.
5.Smartphones which are receiving glucose data (study provide r smart phone, study nurse smart
phone and the  study patient smart  phone which receives glucose level from the sensor and is
next to the IV insulin bag) should be transferred to the Stepdown Unit nurse when patient is
arrives at the Stepdown Unit.
6.Sensors and transmitters are removed on the day of transfer to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549144] 10 days from insertion (whichever comes first). The reason the sensors are not
be removed at the resolution of DKA is that in case anion gap ( AG) reopens  (which indicates that
patient is in DKA)  then we can continue to monitor glucose levels using the sensor in place . Both
sensors and transmitters will be removed by [CONTACT_549153] .  The study smart phones are be
returned to the research team  (research coordinator)  once DKA resolves.
The same process of abstracting data and demographic information  described for the retrospective 
study  from the patient’s medical records for analysis will be used.  
Provider Survey  
02/1 7/2023  
7 We will identify nurses via EMR who took care of DKA patients who had glucose levels monitored via 
DEXCOM G6 CGM. We will then send them e -mail asking to voluntarily participate in the survey. The link 
to the anonymous QUALITRIC survey will be included in the e -mail.  
Potential Risks:  
The potential risks of this prospective study include a breach in confidentiality given information will be  
shared across technology platforms. This breach of confidentiality is highly unlikely as all PHI will be 
stored in encrypted devices and on encrypted endpoints to which only the study investigators and those 
directly involved in patient care will have acc ess 
Risks associated with use of the system may include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia 
(high blood sugar) in cases where information provided by [CONTACT_549154] -up issu es disable alarms and alerts.  
There may be slight pain or bruising in the insertion site of the sensor . There is also a small risk of 
infection at the insertion site . We will use only skilled individuals to insert the device . 
Patients may also experience skin irritation or redness around the device’s adhesive patch  
Potential Benefits:  
Subjects will likely not directly benefit from the study  
Alternatives:  
  If patients decide not to take part of in this study, they will have glucose levels monitored hourl y via 
fingerstick glucose testing.  
Data and Safety Monitoring:  
PHI will be stored in encrypted devices and on encrypted systems  to which only the study investigators 
will have access.

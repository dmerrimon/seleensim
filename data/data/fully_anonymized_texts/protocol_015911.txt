Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 6 of 66 1 Summary  
1.1 Background  
Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for the development of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC).  BE is defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the 
distal esophagus, and is associated with a 25- 30 times increased risk of 
EAC.1    Unfortunately, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is poor, with 5- year survival 
rates  of 16.5%  in the US.2 
The development of BE is thought to be caused in part by [CONTACT_581103].  The change in esophageal lining presumably develops as a result of chronic exposure to refluxed stomach acid and bile, leading to recurrent m ucosal inju ry.
3 
Current management of BE patients consists of endoscopic surveillance and acid suppression.
4  In theory, gastric acid suppression reduce s chronic inflammation within 
the BE segment, which in turn may reduce the risk of progression to EAC.  
By [CONTACT_914877], proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at therapeutic doses can cause secondary hypergastrinemia.  Gastrin exerts trophic effects in BE via cholecystokinin- 2 receptor ( CCK2R)  activation
5, and there is 
some evidence that hypergastrinemia is  associated with an increased risk of progression 
to high grade dysplasia and cancer .[ADDRESS_1285922] of CCK2  
receptors.7  The primary hypothesis for this study i s that administration of YF476 to  
patients with BE will r esult in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation in the 
Barrett’s mucosa.  
1.2 Trial medication  
YF476 (25 mg)  or matching placebo : one capsule to be taken by [CONTACT_96488] [ADDRESS_1285923] overnight and take study medication after completion of study 
procedures.  
1.3 Objectives 
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of YF476 (a CCK2R antagonist) to patients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) decreases tissue Ki67

2.1 Primary objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine if administration of YF476 (a 
CCK2R antagonist) to patients with Barrett’s esophagus (BE) decreases tissue Ki67 
expression, a marker of cellular proliferation. 
2.2 Secondary objectives  
The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of YF476 on:  
• biomarkers potentially associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma, in particular, 
cyclooxygease -2 (COX -2), p53, CCK2R and DCAMKL1; and  
• fasting serum gastrin, a marker of gastric acid suppression, and plasma chromogranin A (CgA), a marker of ECL cell hyperplasia.  
We also aim to determine whether YF476 is safe in patients with BE.  
3 Backgr ound  
3.1 Barrett’s e sophagus  
Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for the development of esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC).  BE is defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the 
distal esophagus, and is associated with a 25 –[ADDRESS_1285941] three decades in the [LOCATION_002]  
(US), with similar patterns of incidence observed in most developed western countries.8  
Unfortunately, the prognosis of esophageal cancer is poor, with 5- year survival rates  of 
16% in the U S.2 
The development of BE  is thought  to be caused in part by [CONTACT_581103].  The change in 
esophageal lining presumably develops as a result of c hronic exposure to refluxed acid 
and bile  from the stomach  leading to recurrent mucosal injury.3  The esophageal injury is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_581106], ultimately, a cellular change (metaplasia) to a specialized columnar epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  BE -associated intestinal metaplasia can ultimately 
progress to low grade (LGD) and high grade d ysplasia (HGD), sta tes that ar e associated 
with elevated risk  of progressing to EAC.  
Current management of BE patients consists of endoscopic surveillance and acid 
suppression.
4  For example, current American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 
guidelines recommend periodic upper endoscopy with random biopsies of the Barrett’s 
segmen t in o rder to assess for the presence of LGD, HGD, or EAC.  The purpose of 
surveillance is to allow for early detection, which may lead to improved patient 
outcomes.  ACG guidelines for the management of BE also recommend gastric acid 
suppression with proton pum p inhibitors (PPIs).  In theory, gastric acid suppression 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 20 of 66 reduces chronic inflammation within the BE segment, which in turn may reduce the risk 
of progression to EAC.   
3.2 YF476 
Details of  YF476 are in the Investigator ’s Brochure  (Trio Medicines Ltd)7, so only a 
summary is provided here. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_1285942] of gastrin receptors in vitro  and in vivo .9-11 
Toxico logy studies of YF476 consisted of: single - and/or repeat -dose toxicity studies in 
rats and dogs; toxicokinetics in rats and dogs; and embryo -foetal tox icity studies in rats 
and rabbits.  Other non -clinical studies consisted of: safety pharmacology studies  in rats, 
mice and dogs; genotoxicity studies in vivo  and in vitro;  studies of metabolism by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 in human liver microsomes  in vitro ; a study  to determine the extent of 
YF476 protein binding in normal human serum in vitro ; a study of the effect of YF476 
on the hERG ion channel in human embryonic kidney cells in vitro : and a study to 
compare the metabolism of 14C-YF476 in rat, dog and human cells in vitro . 
In acute toxicity studies in beagle dogs, 100 and 500 mg/kg/day resulted in similar plasma concentrations of YF476, and caused no adverse effects.  Therefore, 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg/day were tested in a 13- week t oxicity study.  Changes in pancreas weight and 
histopathology were observed in some animals, and serum amylase was elevated in one low-dose male.  Although the histological findings resemble nesidioblastosis, a 
spontaneous finding in laboratory beagles, an effect of YF476 cannot be excluded, so  the 
study did not clearly establish a NOAEL.  
A 13 -week toxicity study of YF476 doses 100, 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day was done in 
rats.  At 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day, some animals had minor, reversible changes in 
enzyme activities and heart weight, and discoloured urine and pale faeces.  Also, there 
were min or histopathological lesions in the heart and pancreas of four treated animals 
and one control animal.  The NOAEL was deemed 100 mg/kg/day.

∼84% of YF476 is bound to serum protein in vivo , that represents 25 -fold safety cover.   
Embryo -foetal studies were don e in the rat and rabbit, using YF476 doses of 100, 300 
and 1000 mg/kg/day.  YF476 had no effect on embryo- foetal survival, growth or 
development in rabbits.  There was slight delay in foetal development in rats given 1000 mg/kg/day, so the NOAEL was deemed  300 mg/kg/day.  
The metabolism of parent 
14C-YF476 was  most efficiently catalysed by [CONTACT_74934] > dog > 
rat hepatocytes  in vitro .  Phase I and II metabolites were formed.  There was no evidence

Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 21 of 66 for formation of unique major human metabolites, although the main metabolite was 
different from that formed by [CONTACT_581107].  Thus, the rat and dog are appropriate species 
to assess the potential toxicity of YF476 in humans. 
YF476 caused some reversible inhibition of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 in vitro .  The 
likelihood of a drug -drug interaction via those enzymes in trials in patients is remote or 
possible , respectively,  at the proposed doses of YF476. 
Non-clinical studies support administration of YF476 to humans for up to 13 weeks.  
The treatment  period for this clinical trial will be 12 weeks . 
3.2.2  Phase 1 studies  
Trio has completed 11 studies of YF476 in healthy men and women.7  184 subjects 
received YF476: single doses up to 400 mg; up to 25 mg daily for 14 days; 100 mg 
twice daily for 7 days; 100 mg YF476 daily, either alone or with 20 mg rabeprazole, for 
6 weeks; and 25 mg YF476 daily for 14 days either alone or with 40 mg esomeprazole.  
The outcome measures were: safety; tolerability; pharmacokinetics; and pharmacodynamics (24 -h gastric pH; pentagastrin -induced gastric acid secretion; serum 
gastrin; and markers of ECL -cell hype rplasia).  The comparators were placebo, 
ranitidine, omeprazole and rabeprazole. 
Safety and tolerability  
In all studies, YF476 was well tolerated.  Adverse events were minor, transient, occurred 
in subjects given placebo or comparators as well as YF476, and were not YF476- dose 
dependent.  YF476 affected neither vital signs, ECG, nor safety tests of blood and urine.   
Pharmacodynamics   
Single doses caused dose -dependent increases in 24- h gastric pH.  The effect lasted 
much longer than that of a single dose of ranitidine.  However, the effect of YF476 on 
24-h gastric pH was mostly lost after repeated doses, whereas that of omeprazole 
persisted.  Single doses of YF476 also caused dose -dependent inhibition of pentagastrin-
induced falls in gastric pH and increases in gastric volume and H
+ output.  Again, the 
effect on gastric pH was mostly lost after repeated doses of YF476.  But, the effects on 
volume and H+ output persisted.  So, gastrin receptors must st ill be blocked after 
repeated doses of YF476.  In a study of YF476 and rabeprazole, alone and in 
combination for 6 weeks, YF476:  
• was as effective as the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581069] H+ activity;  
• was as effective as the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_914851];  
• did not increase plasma chromogranin A (CgA), a biomarker for ECL -cell 
activity, whereas the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581071];  
• abolished the PPI -induced increase in CgA;  
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 22 of 66 • augmented gastric acid suppression by [CONTACT_246407] [INVESTIGATOR_914852]; and  
• prevented the rebound increase in H+ activity induced by [CONTACT_246407].   
In conclusion, the combination was more effective than either the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_581073]476 alone in suppressing gastric acid production.  YF476 prevented stimulation of ECL cells and 
rebound hyperacidity, both of which are caused by [CONTACT_67164] -induced hypergastrinaemia.  
Overall, the effects of YF476 are consistent with antagonism of gastrin rece ptors. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetic profile of YF476 varied among the 1996, 2001, [ADDRESS_1285944] 
favourable profile.  In a single -dose study of 50–400 mg of the current  (2009)  
formulation of YF476, absorption was rapid, T
max was 1.5–2 h, T ½ varied with dose, and 
Cmax and AUC 0-24 were not proportional to dose.  T ½ after 100 mg YF476 was about 7 
h.  Food increased C max and AUC 0–24 by 1.9 and 1.6- fold, respectively.  The absolute 
bioavailability was about 16% in a study of 100 mg ‘cold’ YF476 by [CONTACT_914879] 15 µg 14C-YF476 intravenously.  Protein binding in human serum was about 84%.  
In a [ADDRESS_1285945] that PPIs may be associated with an 
increased  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_836417],14 and Feagins et al reported anti -proliferative effects 
of acid exposure in non- dysplastic BE cells.15 
By [CONTACT_581109], PPIs at therapeutic doses can cause secondary 
hypergastrinemia.  Gastrin exerts trophic effects in BE via CCK2R activation.5 There is 
increased expression of CCK2R in BE compared t o squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and gastrin 
can stimulate p roliferation, anti -apoptosis, COX -2 expression, and loss of cell -cell 
adhesion in BE cells.5, 16  The chief investigator’s  group rece ntly reported that BE 
patients w ith high serum gastrin levels had significantly increased odds of a history of 
high grade dysplasia (HGD) or EAC.6  In that cross -sectional study, they  enrolled 95 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 23 of 66 patients with BE (with and without dysplasia or EAC ) and GERD controls on chronic 
PPI [CONTACT_48831].  Subjects in the highest serum gastrin quartile had significantly inc reased 
odds of a history of advanced neoplasi a (adjusted OR 5.46, 95%  CI 1.20–24.8).  The  
group also analyzed 19 samples from non- dysplastic Barrett’s epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and found 
marked elevations in Ki67 expression, with a mean Ki67 index of 48.3% (SD 16.0%).  
They  also found a moderate correlati on between serum gastrin and tissue Ki67 index 
(r=0.64, p=0.05)  in a subset of ten patients  17. 
Those studies support the notion that gastrin may promote carcinogenesis in BE, and that these potentially pro -neoplastic effects occur via activation of the CCK2 receptor.  
We therefore propose the following clinical trial to analyze the effects of a CCK2 
receptor antagon ist in patients with BE.  The primary hypothesis is that administration of 
YF476, a CCK2 receptor antagonist, in patients with BE will result  in a significant 
decrease in cellular proliferation in the Barrett’s mucosa.  
[ADDRESS_1285946], in patients with Barre tt’s esophagus without 
dysplasia.   Patients  will take YF476 or placebo for 12 weeks.   
There are 2 research sites, Columbia University and the University of Cambridge.  We 
aim for 20  patients to complete  the study .  Patients  will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to 
treatment with YF476 or placebo.   
Patients will make up to 5 visits to the research site (Visits 1 and 2 may be  combined, or 
up to 2 weeks apart .  See schedule of events  in Section 8.1.) : 
• Registration (Visit 1)  
• Baseline (Visit 2 – start of treatment phase)  
• Study treatment  (6 weeks after the start of the treatment phase).  
• End of study treatment  (after 12 weeks’ treatment)  
• Follow-up (4 weeks after the end of treatment).  
After  giving informed consent (Visit 1) and after  the initial endoscopy  (Visit 2) , patients  
will be given one bottle of YF476 or placebo. They  will be g iven a study bottle again at 
the Week  6 visit.   
The primary endpoint  of the study (Ki67 expression) will be assessed using  endoscopic 
biopsies t aken at baseline and at 12 weeks .  
Esophageal tiss ue from endoscopic biopsies will be evaluated for Ki67 expression 
(primary endpoint ) and expression of additional markers potentially associated with 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 24 of 66 esophageal neoplasia (secondary endpoints ).   Expression of these markers will be 
assessed by  [CONTACT_914880] (RNA -Seq), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse 
transcriptase -PCR (RT -PCR), as appropriate.  
Blood samples will be taken at Visit 2, the Week  6 visit and the Week 12 visit for 
measurement of serum gastrin and plasma CgA, and at the Week  6 and Week 12 visits  
for trough and peak YF476 concentrations . 
Safety tests and pregnancy tests (pre -menopausal women only) will be done  at each 
visit.  Patients will complete a diary card daily to record study drug, concomitant 
medication and adverse events .  Adverse events will be assessed [ADDRESS_1285947] of care for patients with high grade dysplasia  (HGD)  at the 
study institutions consists of endoscopic ablative therapy and not continued endoscopic 
surveil lance. The diagnosis of low grade dysplasia  (LGD)  is confounded by [CONTACT_914881], even among expert pathologists.  Additionally, ablative 
therapy is also frequently recommended for LGD patients. Therefore, BE patients with 
LGD an d HGD are not ideal candidates for chemoprevention studies in BE.  
Dose regimen  
The dose regimen of 25 mg YF476 or matching placebo once daily has been chosen based on a previous study of YF476 (T -013), which showed that  a dose as low as [ADDRESS_1285948] had 
prolonged hypergastrinaemia, so a dose of 25 mg YF476 is appropriate.  A placebo-controlled desig n is appropriate for this study as there is no alternative treatment known 
to reduce the levels of Ki67 expression in patients with BE.  
Efficacy tests  
We will use Ki67 index  as the primary endpoint, as it  is a reliable and reproducible 
marker of ongoing cellular proliferation.  Quantitative assessment of the number of

gastrin and plasma CgA, and trough and peak YF476 concentrations. 
4.3 Risk -benefit analysis 
What are the potential risks of harm to the trials patients from YF476 and from the trial 
procedures, and how might they be mitigated?  
Reported adverse events and potential risks  
In all studies in healthy volunteers , YF476 was well tolerated.  Adverse events were 
minor, transient, occurred in subjects given placebo or comparators as well as YF476, and were not YF476 -dose dependent.  YF476 did not affect:  vital signs; ECG; or safety 
tests of blood and urine .  There was no evidence of effect on QT interval  in human 
studies, but in vitro  studies showed that YF476 has a low potential for prolonging QT 
interval  (See Section 3.2.1) .  So, until we have more information about YF476, pati ents 
with prolonged QT interval are excluded from clinical trials.  
The adverse effects that occurred at a frequency of 10% or greater were:  abdominal distention, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and headache.  None of these adverse 
effects were observed  with greater frequency as compared to placebo or comparators.  
Because of the pancreatic findings in the 13- week toxicology study of dogs  (Section 
3.2.1) , serum amylase and lipase will be monitored at each visit.  Also, any patient  who 
complains of abdominal discomfort at any time during the study will be seen 
immediately by [CONTACT_914882], physical 
examination, and laboratory tes ts, including serum amylase and lipase, and other 
appropriate tests , including radiological investigations. 
Risk from concomitant medications  
In vitro  studies have shown that the likelihood of a drug -drug interaction in patients  in 
vivo is: 
• CYP2C8:  possible for 50–400 mg YF476  
• CYP3A4 (testosterone):  remote for 50 & 100 mg YF476, and possible for 200 & 
400 mg  
• CYP3A4 (midazolam):  remote for 50 mg YF476, and possible for 100–400 mg.  
Although YF476 caused some irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4, the degree of inhibition makes a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  unlikely .  And, a clinical 
study (T -007) of YF476 and midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4)  alone and in 
combination showed that neither medicine affects the pharmacokinetics of the other  (see 
YF476 Investigator’s brochure for further details) . 
Many medicines are metabolised via CYP3A4/5. Very few are metabolised via 
CYP2C8.  Examples of the mai n types of medicine that are metabolised by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 26 of 66 and CYP2C8 are listed in Appendix B.  Guidance about assessing the risk and managing 
drug- drug interactions is also provided in Appendix B.  All medications (prescription 
and over -the-counter), vitamin a nd mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken by [CONTACT_914883], and the patient will record any new concomitant medications in the diary card, which will be checked at each visit.  
Risk from study procedures: endoscopy  
Patients who take part in the trial must undergo endoscopy at baseline and at the 
Week  [ADDRESS_1285949] infection after 
endoscopy.  Rarely, the endoscope damages the esophagus, causing bleeding or 
infection.  Patients will be given information on how to prepare for their endoscopy  
according to local procedures . 
Overall, the potential benefits to the trial patient s of taking part in the trial greatly 
outweigh the risks of any harm.

CYP 450 enzymes  
Studies were done to assess the potential of YF476 to inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes  
in vitro .  For details, see Appendi x B – drug interactions , and the YF476 Investigator’s 
Brochure.  The likelihood of a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  is: 
• CYP2C8:  possible for 50–400 mg YF476  
• CYP3A4 (testosterone):  remote for 50 & 100 mg YF476, and possible for 200 & 
400 mg  
• CYP3A4 (midazolam):  remote for 50 mg YF476, and possible for 100–400 mg.  
Although YF476 caused some irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4  in vitro , the degree of 
inhibition makes a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  unlikely.  And, a clinical 
study (T -007) of YF476 and midazolam (a substrate of CYP3A4) alone and in 
combination showed that neither medicine affects the pharmacokinetics of the other.  For details, see the Netazepi [INVESTIGATOR_5328] (YF476)  Investigator’s Brochure . 
Many medicines are metabolised via CYP3A4/5. Very few are metabolised via 
CYP2C8.  Examples of the main types of medicine that are metabolised by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5 and CYP2C8 are listed in Appendix B.  Guidance about assessing th e risk and managing 
drug- drug interactions is also provided in Appendix B. 
Drugs that are substrates for, or inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_1285956] be 
inform ed of any new concomitant medication s via the patient’s diary card.  Midazolam 
may be used during endoscopy.  It was used safely before gastroscopy in a study of 
YF476 in healthy subjects.

7.6 Registration and r andomization 
• A member of the HMR Statistics and Data Management Department will generate 
a randomization list for each site.  Patient numbers will be allocated to eligible patients immediately before the EGD and biopsy at Visit 2 (Baseline) .  Patients 
enrolled at CUMC  will be allocated patient number s 01–24.  Patients enrolled at 
NIHR CIW  will be allocated patient numbers 1001–1024.  The  lists are 
independent of each other.  At both sites, patients on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_914855], and patients on PPI [INVESTIGATOR_914856].   
• At each site, t he site  coordinator s will maintain a site -specific list of participants, 
including patient  codes, start date, and duration of treatment.  Every time a patient 
is recruited at one of the sites, t he coordinator  for that site  will inform the chief 
investigator  (if applicable) and  the coordinator for the other site .  It is the chief 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the total number of study patients does  
not exceed the target.  
The randomization list will specify whether the patient receiv es a dose of YF476 or 
placebo.  Fixed allocation randomization will be performed, with equal allocation (1:1) between the [ADDRESS_1285961].  The study investigators and the study patient s will remain  blinded.  
7.7 Blinding and unblinding m ethods  
• Bottles containing study medication for individual patients  will not be lab elled 
with any information to indicate whether the capsules  are YF476 or placebo. 
• Patients  will be blinded to study treatment.  
• One member of the HMR Statistics and Data Management Department  will not be 
blinded.  That person will generate the randomi zation  code.  The Columbia 
University biostatistician will be blinded.  
• All Investigators will be blinded to study treatment .  
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 35 of 66 • For each site, t here will be a blinded monitor and an unblinded monitor.  The 
unblinded monitor will review dispensing records at the site  Pharmacy.  
• Pharmacy staff will not be blinded. 
• The Data and Safety Monitoring Board  will not be blinded. 
• The blind will be broken by [CONTACT_581121]:  
o If unblinding is required in the interest of the safety of a subject, an 
investigator will discuss the matter with the sponsor before opening the individual code -break envelope for that subject.  In a medical emergency, the 
principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_914857] -break 
envelope for that subject without prior consultation with the sponsor.  In that event, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_914858] r andomisation code ha s been broken for the subject. 
o The blind will be broken for the entire study population at the completion of the study, after the statistical analysis plan (SAP) has been signed and the 
database has been locked.

10 Methods  
10.1 Methods for clinical procedures  
Upper endoscopy with biopsies will be performed at baseline (Visit 2) and at  the 
Week  12 visit,  after 12 weeks ’ treatment with  study medication.  Patients will fast before 
the endoscopy, and will need to come accompanied to the site endoscopy suite, 
according to  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581089].  Upon arrival at  the endoscopy suite, a 
peripheral  intravenous line will be inserted.  Informed consent will be obtained for the 
endoscopy prior to starting the procedure.  In the procedure room, a local anaesthetic 
(xylocaine) will be sprayed in the back of the mouth to diminish the gag reflex.  
Subsequently, intravenous medication (specifically, midazolam, fentanyl, and/or propofol) will be administ ered in order to achieve moderate sedation.  Once the patient 
has been sedated, the upper endoscope will be inserted into the esophagus and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum.  The following represents standard clinical care for Barrett’s esoph agus: 1) the area of Barrett’s esophagus will be carefully inspected for 
any focal nodules or mucosal irregularities that could represent the presence of dysplasia; 2) if any such abnormalities are noted, then targeted biopsies of these areas will be taken ; 3) irrespective of the presence of such abnormalities, random 4- quadrant 
biopsies will be taken every 1 –2 cm along the length of BE.  For study purposes, 6 
additional biopsies will be taken and snap frozen for  RNA- Seq and  qRT -PCR analyses: 
GE junction (t op of the gastric folds; 2 biopsies); mid- Barrett’s segment (2 biopsies); 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 42 of 66 normal -appearing esophageal mucosa (2 cm above the maximal extent of BE; 2 
biopsies).  
10.2 Rationale for laboratory methods  
In general, it is desirable to perform quantitative analyses o f biomarkers, as achieved by 
[CONTACT_581122] -time PCR (qRT -PCR), in contrast to qualitative or 
semi -quantitative immunhistochemical analyses (IHC).  Quantitative analysis allows for 
detection of small differences between different tissue samples.  However, qRT -PCR 
does not discriminate between different cell types within a particular tissue sample, 
whereas IHC allows for visual assessment of the type and location of cells that express a 
biomarker of interest. We will also employ RNA -Seq (RNA sequencing) to identify 
changes in gene expression caused by [CONTACT_914889][INVESTIGATOR_914860]’s esophagus 
tissue.   
• IHC for Ki67 is a robust marker of ongoing proliferation, and has been reliably 
and reproducibly used to evaluate cell type -specific evaluation .  Quantitative 
assessment of the number of proliferating (Ki67+) epi[INVESTIGATOR_914861].  
• For the assessment of CCK2R expression in human esophageal tissue, qRT -PCR 
seems to be the best method, as IHC with various antibodies has proven to be unreliable and non -specific.  
• Biologically relevant COX -2 expression can be quantitatively assessed using 
qRT-PCR, but cannot be detected by [CONTACT_4658].  
• DCAMKL -1 is a putative marker of intestinal stem cells.  In order to analyze 
expansion of the se putative stem cells in the development of Barrett’s esophagus, 
it is important to get an impression of the precise location of these cells.  Therefore, both qRT -PCR and IHC will be used to analyze DCAMKL -1 
expression. 
• Changes in the levels of p53 protein expression can be detected best with IHC, as mRNA levels of p53 do not differ very much despi[INVESTIGATOR_914862].  
The function of p53 is more likely determined by [CONTACT_581123].  
• RNA- Seq is an untargeted approach to studying changes in gene expression; this is 
particularly valuable in the current study, as the effects of gastrin receptor antagonism in Barrett’s esophagus tissue with regard to esophageal adenocarcinoma prevention are unknown.   
In order to identify other key pathways impacted by [CONTACT_914890], we will do RNA- Seq to assess the difference in gene expression between the netazepi[INVESTIGATOR_914863].  In addition to the original focus aimed at assessing expression of a 
very limited number of genes, this analysis will serve to identify affected pathways in 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 43 of 66 the progression from Barrett’s esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, potential 
prognostic markers, and possible new chemopreventive targets.  
All the above described methods have been performed in prev iously published studies 
(by [CONTACT_581124]’s  group and others) as well as in Dr . Timothy Wang’s  
laboratory  in a new mouse model of Barrett’s esophagus an d adenocarcinoma.  
Therefore, the investigators  will be able to c ompare the achieved data with previous ly 
published and unpublished results from the chief investigator’s  laboratory  and other 
groups.

and urine specimens will be performed locally.  
 Collection and h andling procedures  10.3.2
• Collection and analysis of tissue for RNA- Seq, IHC and qRT -PCR 
RNA- Seq and qRT -PCR.  Routine endoscopic biopsies  (4 quadrant biopsies every 2 cm 
along the length of BE)  will be taken for clinical purposes and placed in formalin .  The 
formalin -fixed biops ies taken at  CUMC will be submitted to the Columbia University 
Department of Pathology  (CUDP).   The formalin -fixed biops ies taken at NIHR CIW  will 
be stored there; slides of t he biopsies  will be sent by [CONTACT_914891] , or as agreed between the investigators and sponsor .  The respective Departments of 
Pathology will store the paraffin -embedded samples as per usual practice. Histologic 
analysis of biopsie s from both study sites will be done at CUDP.  As per clinical practice, 
these biopsies will be reviewed to assess the presence of dysplasia.   Six additional 
biopsies  (from each endoscopy ; 2 biopsies each from GE junction, mid- Barrett’s segment, 
and normal  esophagus ) will be taken for study purposes , placed in Qiagen Allprotect™ 
tissue reagent , and then stored at –80°C for future  RNA- Seq and  qRT -PCR analysis. The 
freezers for storing these samples are located in the laboratory of [CONTACT_581147] at 
Columbi a University.   Samples taken at Cambridge University will be stored in freezers 
in [CONTACT_581146]’s laboratory  at the MRC Cancer Unit, University of 
Cambridge,  until dispatch to Columbia University. 
IHC analyses .  Additional sections will be cut from paraffin -embedded endoscopic 
biopsies  for study purposes .  Slides from NIHR CIW will be sent by [CONTACT_914892] , or as agreed between the investigators and sponsor . 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 44 of 66 Ki67 expression will be assessed by [CONTACT_914893]’s 
esophagus.  Paraffin- embedded biopsies from the most distal esophageal biopsies 
containing intestinal metaplasia will be immunostained for Ki67.  Ki67 index will be 
calculated as:  (# crypt epi[INVESTIGATOR_914864]67) / (# BE crypt cells counted).  Five representative crypts with goblet cells will be evaluated from 
five separate fields at 100x magnification.  ∆Ki67 for YF476 and placebo arms  will be 
compared .  The pathologist evaluating Ki67 staining will be blinded to both treatment arm 
and timing of endoscopy (ie pre - or post -treatment).  
• Collection and processing of blood samples for laboratory safety tests:  
20 mL of blood will be collected.  10 mL (one purple top, one gold top tube) will be 
used for routine measurements.  The other 10 mL (one purple top, one gold top tube) 
will be processed for separate stor age of  serum, plasma, and Buffy coats at –80°C.  
o Safety tests:  
 haematology:  Hb, RBC, haematocrit, WBC and differential, and 
platelets;   
 biochemistry: creatinine,  total bilirubin,  BUN, LDH,  total protein, 
albumin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, glucose, potassium, sodium, 
calcium,  magnesium,  chloride, amylase and lipase.  
Blood specimens will be collected when the patient  is fasting.  If the blood collection 
occurs on the day of the endoscopy, the blood will be collected prior to the endoscop y.   
• Collection of urine for laboratory safety tests  
A routine urine sample will be collected for standard urinalysis: dipstick test:  protein, 
blood, ketones, glucose, specific gravity, pH; microscopy if the result of the dipstick test 
for protein  or blood is abnormal ; and pregnancy test (pre -menopausal women only) .  
• Collection and processing of blood samples for  serum gastrin and stored serum  
Venous blood for serum gastrin assay and stored serum (2 ×  2.5 mL) will be collected 
into polypropylene tubes and will be allowed to clot at room temperature for at least 
20 min.  After clotting, the tubes will be centrifuged at about 1500 G for 10 min at 4 °C, 
and the serum transferred to smaller tubes in equal aliquots then stored at –80°C before 
shipment to the HMR Analytical Laboratory, Cumberland Avenue, Park Royal, London, 
NW10 7EW.  Shipment of s erum samples for gastrin assay and storage will be agreed 
between the investigator and sponsor .  Serum will be stored by [CONTACT_914894] t rial-related markers only, which will be decided on at a later date.    
• Collection and proc essing of plasma for CgA assays  
4 mL venous blood will be collected into an EDTA tube and centrifuged at about 
1500 G for 10 minutes at 4°C.  2 equal aliquots  of plasma will be transferred to  
polypropylene tubes, and stored at –80°C, before shipment to the HMR Analytical 
Laboratory, Cumberland Avenue, Park Royal, London, N W10 7EW.  Shipment of 
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 45 of 66 plasma samples for CgA assay will be agreed between the investigator and sponsor .  All 
sample handling materials will be provided by [CONTACT_581129].  
• Gastrin  and CgA assay s   
Serum gastrin and plasma CgA will be measured  by [CONTACT_914895].   The analytical laboratory may  not analyse samples 
collected from patients with HIV.   
• Collection and processing of blood samples for YF476 PK  
YF476 is light sensitive, so blood samples  (4 mL)  will be taken into foil- wrapped or 
amber lithium heparin tubes and immediately placed on ice.  Samples will be 
centrifuged at about 1500 G for 10 minutes at 4°C.  Plasma will be transferred to foil -
wrapped or amber polypropylene storage tubes.  Pla sma samples will be stored at –80°C 
within [ADDRESS_1285969] George’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914865]476 by [CONTACT_914896]  2002.

11 Reporting adverse events  
Definition:   an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study 
participant.  An AE does not neces sarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or 
study participa nt.  An AE can therefore be any u nfavourable  and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with participation in a  study, whether or not related to that participation.  This includes 
any deaths th at occur while a participant is on a study.  
A list of adverse events th at have occurred or might occur can be found in Se ction 4.3, 
and i n the Investigator Brochure.   
11.1 Adverse events  (AEs) 
• Reportable adverse events  
All adverse events that occur after the informed consent is signed will be recorded on the adverse event CRF whether or not related to study medication .

• Severity of AEs  
Adverse events will be identified using  the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.  The CTCAE provides descripti ve 
terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the 
CTCAE can be found 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc

YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 48 of 66 • Is life threatening (Note: the term life -threatening refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] .  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .  
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect .  
• Events that may not meet these criteria, but which the investigator finds very 
unus ual and/or potentially serious, will also be reported in the same manner. 
  Reporting SAEs  11.2.2
• The investigators  will report SAEs on the SAE form.  
• The Sponsor representative and the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) representative will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 24  hours of knowledge of the event.

Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 49 of 66 12 Data management and quality assurance 
Patient data will be collected using protocol- specific case report forms (CRF).  These 
will be designed and produced by [CONTACT_212197].  The final ve rsion will be approved by [CONTACT_103].  All data will be entered legibly in black or blue  ink with a ball -point pen.  If an 
error is made, the error will be crossed through with a single line in such a way that the 
original entry can still be read.  The co rrect entry will then be clearly inserted and the 
alterations will be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_581133].  Overwriting or use of correction fluid is  not permitted.  
To preserve confidentiality, the CRFs will not bear the subject’s name .  The subject’s 
initials, date of birth, and subject number will be used for identification. 
It will be the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the accuracy of all data entered 
in the CRFs. 
The data will be securely stored by [CONTACT_093].  A fter the CRFs have been signed 
off by [CONTACT_458], the original NCR copi[INVESTIGATOR_914866], where they will be securely stored  on behalf of the 
sponsor . 
Data will be double -entered into a clinical database management system (ClinPlus 
Version 3.3), which is based on SAS
® Version 9.2.  Edit checks and generation of 
queries will be done in ClinPlus.  Tabulations and listings will be produced using 
validated, trial- specific SAS® programs.  
Data will be checked  by [CONTACT_581134] (QA) Department.  In addition, the 
HMR QA Department will audit the trial report; that audit will include checks to ensure that statistical output is correctly reproduced in the report.  
Source documents .  Before the start of t he study, the sponsor and investigator (s) will 
sign an agreement listing the source documents to be used in this trial.  The CRF will be source for the following datapoints: heart rate and blood pressure.  
12.[ADDRESS_1285971] (DSM B) will review all SAE forms  as well as all 
AEs.  If additional information is required, the DSM B will request that information from 
the PI.  The DSM B will review reported AEs  at regular meetings and provide written 
reports to the PI.  The reports will contain written information regarding findings for the 
trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant 
recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
Members of the DSM B are as follows : 
Benjamin Lebwohl (Columbia University, Division of Digestive & Liver Diseases)

Trio Medicines, Ltd. (or their designee) or the relevant regulatory authorities  may 
monitor/audit various aspects of the study. These monitors will be given access to 
facilities, databases, supplies and records t o review and verify data pertinent to the 
study.  
12.[ADDRESS_1285972] retention  
The sponsor  and both principal investigators  will keep the following  in a trial master 
file. 
• All the essential documents required by [CONTACT_27727]  
• All data generated during the study  
All documents wi ll be stored such that they are readily available for inspection at the 
request of the sponsor or a regulatory authority.  Any transfer of ownership of the 
investigator’s data or documents will be documented, and the sponsor will be informed.  
For at least [ADDRESS_1285973] elapsed 
since th e formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study medication:  
• HMR will ensure that the sponsor’s master file and original copi[INVESTIGATOR_581096] a secure place; and  
• the investigator s will ensure that the investigator’s master file, and original source 
documents (other than CRFs)  will be archived in  a secure place.   
12.4 Clinical Trial Agreement  
The sponsor and the investigators will sign an agreement outlining each party’s 
obligations with respect to the trial.  
Each party will allow the  other [ADDRESS_1285974] one plasma concentration for YF476.  
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 51 of 66 The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis set wil l include all randomized patient s who receive 
at least one dose of study medication and ha ve at least one post -baseline assessment.  In 
this population, treatment will be assigned based upon the treatment to wh ich patient s 
were randomized regardless of which treatment they actually received.  
A per -protocol analysis will also be completed.  
13.2 General Statistical Considerations  
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between YF476 and placebo in the 
treatm ent of patients with Barrett’s esophagus, the alternative hypothesis is that there is 
a difference between the treatments.  Statistical significance will be defined as p≤0.05. 
Statistical analysis will be done by [CONTACT_212197].  The statistical package SAS (version 9.2) will 
be used to produce all summary tables and data listings. 
For the data analysis, missing or dropout data will not be imputed; analyses will be 
performed only on observed data.  In this study, there will be no significance level 
adjustment for multiplicity.  
Quantitative data will be tabulated with descriptive summary statistics: arithmetic mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values, and number of 
observations.  Geometric mean and geometric CV% will be provided for C max and 
Ctrough.   For categorical data, frequency tables will be provided. 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing the methodology to be used in the final analysis will be prepared by [CONTACT_914897].  Any deviations from the planned statistical 
analyses in the protocol will be fully described in the SAP. 
13.3 Study Population Data  
The safety population will be summarized for demographic characteristics, and will be presented.  Continuous de mographic variables (age, weight, height, and BMI) will be 
summarised with descriptive statistics.  Categorical demographic variables (gender, race, and ethnicity) will be summarised with frequency counts and corresponding percentages.  
13.4 Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses, summaries and listings will be generated using the efficacy 
analysis set.  
Primary efficacy variables are:  
• Change in Ki67 expression (∆Ki67)  
Secondary efficacy variables are:  
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 52 of 66 • Changes in gene expression in BE tissue (measured by [CONTACT_16638] -Seq).  
• Change in CCK2R mRNA levels (measured by q RT-PCR)  
• Change in DCAMKL1 expression (measured by [CONTACT_4658])  
• Change in DCAMKL1 mRNA levels (measured by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR)  
• Change in COX -2 mRNA levels (measured by q RT-PCR)  
• Change in p53 expression (measured by [CONTACT_4658])  
• Change in serum gastrin and plasma CgA between baseline and Visit 5  
For all efficacy variables listed above, individual val ues will be presented by [CONTACT_914898].   
The primary endpoint (Change from baseline (Visit 2) in Ki67 expression (∆Ki67)) wi ll 
be summarised using descriptive statistics.  The primary analysis for the primary 
endpoint will use two sample t -tests comparing between treatment groups.  Nominal 
p-value and 95% confidence intervals for treatment difference will be reported.   
To eval uate the robustness of the primary analysis, the following sensitivity analysis will 
also be performed:  
Baseline Adjusted Analysis: t his sensitivity analysis will use an analysis of covariance 
model with the primary endpoint as the dependent variable, treatment group as a factor 
and baseline (Visit 2) as a covariate.  Adjusted least square means and corresponding 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Serum gastrin and chromogranin A (CgA) will be measured at baseline (Visit 2) and at Weeks 6 and 12.  Analyses will be performed to determine whether there is a correlation between baseline gastrin and subsequent ∆Ki67.  YF476 assays will be performed at 
Weeks 6 and 12.  
Analysis of the secondary endpoints will be similar to the primary analysis. No 
sensi tivity analysis is planned for these endpoints.  
13.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
The statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters will be done by [CONTACT_914899].  
All pharmacokinetic analyses, summaries, and listings will b e generated using the 
pharmacokinetic analysis set.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters will be listed in tables of individual values and aggregated in summary tables.  Descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of variation [%CV ], standard error of the mean, minimum, 
maximum, and median) will be calculated at each evaluation timepoint for plasma 
concentrations of YF476.  
YF476 in Barrett’s esophagus   Trial code: 10 -505 (T -016)  
Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 53 of 66 Individual, mean and median plasma concentration -time data will be presented 
graphically.  
The relationship betw een PK concentrations and plasma CgA concentration or serum 
gastrin concentration will be examined using a graphical approach.  
13.6 Safety Analyses 
Summaries and listings of safety data will be generated using the safety analysis set.  
 Adverse Event Analyses  13.6.1
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) that is current when the database is locked.  All AEs 
including serious AEs will be mapped to system organ class and preferred term, and will 
be listed in the data listing.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatment, having been absent pre -treatment, or that worsens relative to the pre -treatment 
state.   
The number and percentage of patient s reporting TEAEs will be tabulated for the safety 
analysis set by [CONTACT_167500], and further by 
[CONTACT_914900].   
Listings of deaths, SAEs, and AEs that lead to discontinuation of a patient  will be 
presented.  
 Analyses of Clinical Laboratory Tests 13.6.[ADDRESS_1285975] -baseline assessment, will be summarized.    
 Electrocardiogram Analys es 13.6.3
The ECG variables (PR, RR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF) and heart rate (HR) at each planned assessment will be summarised.  The QT intervals will be corrected for heart 
rate by [CONTACT_581139]’s and Fridericia’s formula (QTcB = QT/[RR]
1/2 and QTcF = 
QT/[RR]1/3).  The incidence of outliers in absolute QT, QTcF and QTcB intervals (>450, 
>480, and >500 msec), and the change from time -matched baseline in QT, QTcF and 
QTcB intervals (>30 and >60 msec) will be summarised.  
13.7 Determination of sample size  
Based on our preli minary data, we estimate a mean baseline Ki67 index of  45–50%, 
with a common SD of 14–18%. Assuming a two -sided type I error rate of 0.05, a sample 
size of 20 ( 10 per arm) has 98% power to detect a 30% absolute difference in ΔKi67 
between the two arms if t he common SD is 16%, and 97% power for a 25% difference 
with a 14% common SD (see Table 1).

Protocol Version  24 26 April 2018  Page 61 of 66 Appendix  B – drug interactions  
Non-clinical studies support administration of the study medication (YF476) to humans for up to 
13 weeks.  In vitro  studies showed that YF476 inhibited CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5.  Specific 
notation will be made of any regular concomitant medications metabolized via CYP2C8 or 
CYP3A4/5.  These medications do not need to be discontinued, although specific monitoring for side ef fects and toxicities will be performed during the study period.  
CYP 450 enzymes  
In tests for reversible inhibition of CYP 450 enzymes, the IC
50 of YF476 was 3.52, 8.37 and 12.1 
µM for CYP2C8, CYP3A4 (midazolam) and CYP3A4 (testosterone), respectively.  But , YF476 
did not inhibit CYP2C9 at doses up to 25 µM.  In tests for irreversible inhibition, 0.5 µM YF476 did not cause significant inhibition of CYP3A4 (midazolam).  However, 5  µM YF476 caused 
43.9% irreversible inhibition of CYP3A4 (midazolam), which was reduced to 30.2% when 
corrected for vehicle control.  Neither CYP3A4 (testosterone) nor CYP2C9 was inhibited by 5 µM YF476. For further details of the in vitro  studies, see the YF476 Investigator’s Brochure.  
To assess the likelihood of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inhibition in patients in vivo , [I]/Ki ratios 
(where Ki = IC
50/2, and I = C max for YF476) were calculated from IC 50 values for reversible 
inhibition by [CONTACT_185669]476 and C max for total (bound and unbound) plasma concentrations of YF476 
from a study of single doses of 50, 100, [ADDRESS_1285981] s (Table 2 .  T–011; see 
Investigators’ Brochure).  FDA guidelines (2006) state that an interaction is likely if the ratio is greater than 1, possible if between 1 and 0.1, and remote if less than 0.1.   
Table  2: [I]/Ki ratios calculated with total (bound plus unbound) plasma concentrations of 
YF476.  
 Isoform  IC50 (µM)  Ki [I1]/K i [I2]/K i [I3]/K i [I4]/K i 
CYP2C8  3.52 1.76 0.184  0.302  0.584  0.803  
CYP3A4 
(testosterone)  12.1 6.05 0.054  0.088  0.170  0.233  
CYP3A4 (midazolam)  8.37 4.185  0.077  0.127  0.246  0.338  
Where K i = IC 50/2, and I 1, I2, I3 and I 4 = C max for 50, 100, 200 & 400 mg  YF476, respectively, in fasting subjects.  
Therefore, the likelihood of a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  is: 
• CYP2C8:  possible for 50–400 mg YF476  
• CYP3A4 (testosterone):  remote for 50 & 100 mg YF476, and possible for 200 & 
400 mg  
• CYP3A4 (midazolam):  remote for 50 mg YF476, and possible for 100–400 mg.  
Although YF476 caused some irreversible inhibition of CYP3A 4, the degree of inhibition makes 
a drug -drug interaction in patients  in vivo  unlikely.

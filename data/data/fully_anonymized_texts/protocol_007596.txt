        STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS) Title:  BHV3500-201: Phase II/III: Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Dose-ranging Trial of BHV-3500 for the Acute Treatment of Migraine Rationale: BHV-3500 is being developed for the treatment of migraine by [CONTACT_634637] (IN) route.  Nonclinical evidence suggests that BHV-3500, a CGRP receptor antagonist, possesses pharmacological properties suitable for the acute treatment of migraine. Intranasal administration of BHV-3500 in the single ascending dose study BHV3500-101 produced plasma levels predicted to be within the therapeutic range for compounds of this class.  This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different intranasal dose levels (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg) of BHV-3500, relative to placebo, in the acute treatment of moderate to severe migraine.   This study was designed to identify at least one dose of BHV-[ADDRESS_847232] bothersome symptom (MBS) associated with migraine at [ADDRESS_847233]-dose.  This information will be used in future trials to further define the safety and efficacy of the selected dose or doses.  Target Population: The study will recruit male and female subjects [ADDRESS_847234] a one-year history of migraines (with or without aura), consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition,[ADDRESS_847235] 3 months and not less than 2 attacks per month. Number of Subjects: Approximately 1900 subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 1600 subjects (approximately 400 per arm).  The subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to the BHV-3500 or matching placebo treatment groups.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_634638] (yes or no).  Objectives:  Primary:  To evaluate the efficacy of BHV-[ADDRESS_847236] bothersome symptom (MBS), associated with migraine, at two hours post dose, while identifying an optimal dose for evaluation in the Phase 3 clinical trials.

        4.3.1 Screening Phase (3-28 days) Approximately 1900 subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 1600 subjects to study mediation (BHV-3500 or matching placebo).  Before any study procedures are performed, subjects must sign informed consent. After informed consent is signed, subjects will be enrolled in the IWRS system. The subject’s migraine history and medical history will be collected at the Screening Visit.  Subjects will also undergo all screening procedures as detailed in Table 1. Within 3-28 days from the Screening Visits, subjects will return to the site for the Baseline/ Randomization Visit; if the subject does not meet all eligibility criteria, the subject will be considered a Screen Failure. Subjects in this study may be screened only once. Rescreening is not permitted. 4.3.2 Randomization Phase (45 days) Subjects will return to the study site for the Baseline (Randomization) Visit. Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria they may be randomized at the Baseline Visit.  Randomization will occur in the IWRS. The subjects will be provided with an eCOA Handheld device. The study personnel will instruct the subject on the proper use of the handheld to ensure proper understanding and use of the tool, prior to the subject leaving the office. After randomization is completed in the IWRS, study medication will be dispensed to subjects to take home for up to [ADDRESS_847286].  This study medication is to be taken when a migraine attack reaches moderate or severe intensity on the numeric rating scale (NRS) as indicated in the handheld. The subject will be instructed to take their study medication, as an outpatient, when (if) they have a migraine headache which reaches moderate or severe intensity after they have answered questions about their current pain and symptoms and identified their currently most bothersome, migraine associated, symptom (phonophobia, photophobia or nausea) in the handheld. The subject will complete assessments for forty-eight hours after taking study medication to record efficacy and other quality of life measures.  Subjects in this study may be randomized only once. Under no circumstances may a subject be re-randomized.

The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_634638] (yes or no). It is important to correctly enter subjects who are using prophylactic migraine medication in the IWRS system. Once a patient is stratified in the IWRS, this cannot be changed and will be considered a significant deviation. Randomization schedules will be generated and kept by [CONTACT_634648] a secure network folder with access limited to only unblinded team members. Each subject who is qualified for treatment will be randomized via the IWRS randomization option. Subjects will maintain their subject number assigned at screening throughout the trial. The IWRS will provide the double-blind treatment assignments. The randomization will trigger a kit number for the randomized treatment type. The drug will be dispensed at the time of randomization.  7.2.2 Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration Study medication (Aptar UDS containing BHV-3500 or matching placebo) will be packaged in a carton. There are no dose adjustments in this study and subjects will receive study medication sufficient to treat one migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity within 45 days of randomization (Baseline Visit). Subjects will be dispensed the study medication at randomization (Baseline Visit) and will take the Aptar UDS from the carton at the time of moderate or severe migraine headache onset ONLY after answering questions regarding their migraine symptoms in the handheld device.  Subjects will administer a single spray of the medication from the device.  Subjects must inform the study staff if they sneeze, if the device malfunctions or if the device does not dispense a complete spray. 7.2.[ADDRESS_847327]’s management, the blind for that subject may be broken by [CONTACT_1963].  Before breaking the blind of an individual subject’s treatment, the Investigator should have determined that the information is necessary, (i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate management).   In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not investigational 
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847328]’s study records.   Subjects have to be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed when a migraine occurs and reaches moderate or severe intensity.  If the subject does not have a qualifying migraine or take their study medication within 45 days of the Baseline Visit, they should return to the clinic for their End of Treatment Visit and return their study medication.  7.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug If the study drug is to be destroyed on site, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been established according to the applicable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the disposal have been documented.  The unused study drug can only be destroyed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_222465]’s designee unless this is against institutional policy.  All unused and/or partially used study drug may be destroyed on site providing the site has an applicable standard operating procedure on file.

        8 ADVERSE EVENTS An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject.  In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.  Subjects should be instructed to notify the Investigator when a Serious Adverse Event occurs.  There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs).  8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT 8.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria at any dose: • Death • Life-threatening • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received BHV-3500 • Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not limited to): o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse o Potential drug-induced liver injury  
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.0 Page 51 of 67  
        Definition of Terms Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more severe form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening even though drug induced hepatitis can be fatal. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310085] (e.g., elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything, untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non-serious' according to the usual criteria. In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222433] (but may be considered non-serious AEs): 1. A visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours that does not result in an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life threatening); 2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent; 3. Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure; 4. Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routine colonoscopy); 5. Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health and requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care-giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances). Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions. 8.1.[ADDRESS_847329]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol-specific procedures.  All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and throughout the course of the study up to and including the End of Treatment Visit. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specific procedures.

BHV -3500 / Version 4 .0 Page 52 of 67 
 
 
   
   
 All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status of 
seriousness.   
If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the study drug but is potentially related 
to the conditions of the study (such as a withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication related 
to study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, overdose (see Section 8.1.3), potential drug 
induced liver injury (see Section 8.1.5) and pregnancies (see Section 8.1.4) must be reported 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. For this study we will be 
capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC) and on the  SAE form. 
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs and all Other Important Medical Events to 
 within [ADDRESS_847330] (IRB) as per the IRB’s 
reporting requirements.  Additionally, the Investigator, or designated staff, is responsible for 
entering the SAE information in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system (i.e.: event term, 
start stop dates, causality, severity). 
Any serious adverse event must be reported immediately or no later than [ADDRESS_847331] be sent to  PVG by [CONTACT_6972] (fax) within 24 hours after 
awareness of the event:  
•  
If a form is unable to be submitted within 24 hours, the SAE may be reported by [CONTACT_634649]:

 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. If an ongoing 
SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information becomes 
available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming 
aware of the updated information using the same procedure used for the transmission of the 
initial SAE and the same event term shou ld be used. 
The minimum information required for an initial SAE report is:  
• Sender of report (Site number, Investigator name)  
• Subject identification (subject number)  
• Protocol number 
• SAE term (if an SAE is being reported) 
8.1.[ADDRESS_847332] 
that is considered excessive and medically important as determined by [CONTACT_737].  All 
occurrences of overdose (suspected or confirmed and irrespective of whether or not it involved 
BHV-3500 or placebo) must be communicated to Biohaven or a specified designee within 24 
hours and be fully documented as an SAE. Details of any signs or symptoms and their 
management should be recorded including details of any  antidote(s) administered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose misadministration and Aptar UDS malfunction  
All occurrences of dose misadministration or Aptar UDS malfunction should be communicated 
to Biohaven or a specified designee as soon as possible.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_847333] will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate 
manner (i.e., dose tapering if necessary for subject's safety).  Protocol-required procedures for 
the study discontinued and the follow -up must be performed on the subject unless 
contraindicated by [CONTACT_634650] (i.e., x -ray studies).  Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up 
procedures should be considered if indicated.   
Sites should instruct subjects to contact [CONTACT_634651]. The Investigator must immediately notify the Biohaven Medical 
Monitor (or designee) of the event and complete and forward the Pregnancy Report Form to  
PVG immediately via telephone within 24 hours and in accordance with SAE reporting 
procedures as described in Section 8.1.2.  
CCI
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847334] should be reported to the sponsor.  Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Report Form, as appropriate.    8.1.5 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Wherever possible, timely confirmation of the initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs as per Section 8.1.2.  Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  1. Aminotransferases (AT) (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  AND 2. Total bilirubin (TBL) > [ADDRESS_847335], without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase)  AND 3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  If any potential DILI is identified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical Monitor (or designee) should immediately be contact[CONTACT_634652].  8.[ADDRESS_847336].  Non-serious adverse events should be followed until conclusion or stabilization or reported as SAEs if they become serious.   Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug or those that are present at the end of treatment visit.  
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847337] abnormalities should be captured on the non-serious AE CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate: 1. Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE; 2. Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have the study drug discontinued or interrupted; 3. Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.

        9 STATISTICS 9.1 General Procedures Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and maximum).   For the calculation of descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value to be evaluable for endpoints based on changes from baseline over time. Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: protocol deviations; interruptions of study therapy; non-study medications; adverse events; and laboratory abnormalities. Thus, for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject. 9.2 Sample Size If 95% of the 400 subjects randomized to each arm treat a migraine on study, there will be roughly 380 mITT subjects in each arm. If the true response rates for pain freedom at 2 hours are 22% and 12% in the BHV-[ADDRESS_847338], at alpha=0.0167, will have 90% power. Similarly, if the true response rates for MBS freedom at 2 hours are 45% and 32% in the BHV-[ADDRESS_847339], at alpha=0.0167, will have 90% power.  Under the assumption that the endpoints are independent, the power for both endpoints jointly is roughly 80%. 9.3 Populations for Analysis • Enrolled subjects: Subjects who sign an informed consent form and are assigned a subject identification number.  • Randomized subjects: Enrolled subjects who receive a randomization treatment assignment from the IWRS (BHV-3500 or placebo). • Treated subjects: Enrolled subjects who take study therapy (BHV-3500 or placebo). • Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) subjects: randomized subjects that take study therapy, have a migraine of moderate or severe baseline pain intensity, and provide at least one  post-baseline, efficacy data point.  
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.0 Page 57 of 67  
        9.4 Statistical Methods 9.4.1 Primary Endpoint(s) Each of the three doses of BHV-[ADDRESS_847340] placebo, at a Bonferroni corrected  alpha=0.[ADDRESS_847341]-dose. Both endpoints are evaluated using Cochran-Mantel Haenszel methodology to estimate the common risk difference, and are stratified by [CONTACT_634653] (yes or no). These tests are conducted using the mITT subjects, with missing data at two hours imputed to be failure (i.e., Non-Completers = Failure;  NC=F). Sensitivity analyses are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   9.4.2 Secondary Endpoint(s) If the primary endpoint tests are both significant for a dose, then the secondary endpoints are evaluated for that dose using a hierarchical gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], with each test in the hierarchy conducted at alpha=0.0167.  These secondary endpoints will be tested in the order shown in the Study Objectives section of this protocol.  9.4.3 Analysis of Safety The Investigators determine the intensity of AEs and the relationship of AEs to study therapy. The Investigators’ terms are coded and grouped by [CONTACT_222467] (MedDRA) available. AEs are presented by [CONTACT_6657], ordered by [CONTACT_634654].  If a subject had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity is reported. AEs are tabulated in all treated subjects. SAEs occurring in subjects enrolled but not treated are listed. Deaths are listed for enrolled subjects without regard to onset. The frequencies of the following safety events are summarized by [CONTACT_71397], and overall, for treated subjects:  SAEs; all AEs, non-serious AEs, AEs by [CONTACT_2236]; and AEs by [CONTACT_182811]. Further safety analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.   9.4.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics are made for: subjects randomized but not treated; subjects randomized and treated; and overall. A separate set of tabulations are made for subjects enrolled but not randomized. 9.5 Interim Analysis There is a final analysis after the  database is locked.  No interim analyses are anticipated.

        10 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  10.1 Good Clinical Practice This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IRB/IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with the recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the exception that registration of such Phase [ADDRESS_847342]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_52194].    All serious breaches must be reported to Biohaven (or designee) immediately.  A Serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the stud or protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the study.  Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform their respective task(s).  This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment).  10.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee This study will not make use of a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  Safety will be closely monitored via the sites and procedures for unblinding in cases of emergency will be followed.  10.[ADDRESS_847343]/Independent Ethics Committee The Investigators agree to provide the IRB/IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure and any other written information provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the Investigators have obtained the IRB/IEC favorable written approvals for the above-mentioned study documents. A properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_634655]. The original signed and dated ICF will be kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.  In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC prior to its implementation, unless the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, prior to subsequently obtaining each subject’s consent.  
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.0 Page 59 of 67  
        The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s representative must sign the protocol and its amendments (if any) before initiating the study.  It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.  10.[ADDRESS_847344] ensure that subjects, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by [CONTACT_1766], their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they volunteer to participate.  Biohaven (or designee) will provide the Investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) sample informed consent form which will include all elements required by  [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  The sample informed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Before the potential subject has undergone any study-related screening procedures, the nature of the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are answered, but before proceeding further, the subject must read and sign a written informed consent form. This signed informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, revisions to the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, a copy retained in the Study Master File, and the date and time the subject signed the form will be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.   If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legal guardian or legally acceptable representative, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating their informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.  The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its representatives and regulatory authorities may have direct access to subject records.  The rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects are the most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  10.[ADDRESS_847345] be explained. Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collections fields when EDC is being used.    
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847346] be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  The Investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of changes and corrections.   If EDC is being used, signatures will be obtained electronically and a copy of the electronic CRFs will be provided (or the data from the CRFs) for future reference.  10.[ADDRESS_847347] the Sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with this study.  Biohaven will notify the Investigators when the study files for this study are no longer needed.  If the Investigator withdraws from the study (i.e., retirement, relocation), the records shall be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be given in writing to Biohaven.  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the current disposition record of investigational product (those supplied by [CONTACT_456]) is maintained at each study site where the study drug is inventoried and dispensed.  Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include: 1. amount of study drug received and placed in storage area 2. label ID number or batch number or Kit number as specified for the protocol 3. amount dispensed to and returned from each subject 4. amount transferred to another area or site for dispensing or storage if applicable 5. amount of drug lost or wasted 6. amount destroyed at the site if applicable 7. amount returned to sponsor, if applicable 8. retain sampled for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if applicable 9. record of dates and initials of personnel responsible for IM dispensing and accountability   
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847348] Retention The CRO will maintain adequate study records after completion or termination of study. After that period, the Sponsor will be contact[CONTACT_513627], destroyed or kept at CRO or at another facility for a longer period of time at the Sponsor's expense.  
  Study BHV3500-201 Clinical Protocol Confidential BHV-3500 / Version 4.[ADDRESS_847349] to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within [ADDRESS_847350] be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before implementing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate regulatory authorities for approval. If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the Investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to the protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation. 12 STUDY REPORT AND PUBLICATIONS Biohaven is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities with clinical study reports according to the applicable regulatory requirements. The publication policy of Biohaven is discussed in the Investigator's Clinical Research Agreement. 13 STUDY DISCONTINUATION  Both Biohaven and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_634634]’s site at any time. Should this be necessary, Biohaven or a specified designee will inform the appropriate regulatory authorities of the termination of the study if needed and the reasons for its termination, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34616]/IEC of the same. In terminating the study, Biohaven and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_208683]’ interests.

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background  
Obes ity in the [LOCATION_002] has been increasingly cited as a major health issue in recent 
decades. Like the U.S., many industrialized countries have experienced similar increases, 
underscoring the severity of the problem. The [LOCATION_002] had the highest rat e of obesity for 
large countries (> 32%), until obesity rates in Mexico surpassed that of the [LOCATION_002] in 
2013[ 1].  Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents 
in the pa st 30 years [ 1]. 
The American Heart Association (AHA) notes that 60 -70% of the US population is either 
overweight or obese, putting them at risk for heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and 
diabetes. Accord ing to the AHA, obesity affects nearly 78 million adults and 13 million 
children in the US today. The CDC found there was no decrease in obesity rate from the 2009 -
2010 survey to the 2011 -2012 survey [ 3]. 
Among A mericans age 20 and older, 154.7 million are overweight or obese (BMI of 25.0 
kg/m2 and higher): - 79.9 million men and 74.8 million women. Of these 154.7 M, 78.4 
million are obese (BMI of 30.0 kg/m2 and higher): 36.8 million men and 41.6 million women. 
If current trends in the growth of obesity continue, total healthcare costs attributable to obesity 
could reach $861 to $957 billion by 2030, which would account for 16% to 18% of US health 
expenditures (AHA) [ 3]. 
To date, treatment options for the US obese population include weight loss management 
programs, pharmaceuticals, and bariatric surgeries (gastric by[CONTACT_6476], sleeve gastrectomy and 
gastric banding accounting for 99% of the bariatric surgeries) [ 4].  FDA has also recently 
approved the Enteromedics vagal nerve stimulator and the Orbera intragastric balloon and the 
Reshape Duo intragastric balloon, but it is too soon to assess the potential impact of these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
2.2. Current Treatment O ptions  
Unfortunately, the results of most weight loss management programs are rather dismal. 
Efficacy of behavioral changes is dependent on both a highly motivated subject and a dedicated 
counselor willing to maintain long -term follow -up. O n average, the best weight loss programs 
achieve approximately 10% body weight loss, with patients compliant to diet only 20% of the 
time [ 5]. 
Belviq, a serotonin enhancing drug, is available in the US market and  has 3 -3.7% weight loss 
in one year. Side effects of paresthesias, fatigue, headache and dizziness have been reported. 
Qsymia is a combination drug containing the appetite suppressant phentermine and the seizure 
medicine Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052].  38% of users have repo rted weight loss of 105 or greater. Long term 
follow up studies to evaluate weight loss maintenance are not available in either drug [ 6]. 
Previously approved drugs include, Orlistat, which inhibits fat absorption  in the intestine; 
Phentermine, Methamphetamine, Benzphetamine, Diethylpropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and Phendimetrazine, which 
are appetite suppressants and DEA scheduled drugs [ 7].  
Surgical therapy for obesity (bariatric surgery) is the only available therapeutic modality in the 
US associated with significant and sustained weight loss in the setting of subjects with morbid 
obesity associated with co -morbidities. Evidence is available to show that well -performed 
bariatric surgery in  the setting of carefully selected patients and a good multidisciplinary 
                          Confidential                           
 
Page 10 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
support team significantly ameliorates the morbidities associated with  severe obesity. While 
bariatric surgery is the only therapeutic method associated with consistently demonstrable  
sustained weight loss, it is expensive, highly procedure -specific and surgeon -specific, and 
certainly not the only solution for the burgeoning obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].  
Among the standard bariatric procedures are roux -en-Y gastric by[CONTACT_6476], sleeve gastrectomy and 
gastric banding surgeries. Gastric by[CONTACT_235111], but reported mortality rates of 0.5% [ 8] have left a 0.6% 
penetration into the eligible popula tion [ 9]. Reports in 16,000 Medicare beneficiaries who 
received roux -en-y gastric by[CONTACT_235112] 1997 -2002, revealed mortalities of 2% at 30 
days and 4.6% at one -year post operatively [ 10]. An 8 -20% post -operative infection rate has 
led to a 25% re -operation rate within [ADDRESS_284127]-op compared with the 3 -year pre -op (not including the cost of surgery) [ 11].  
Gastric banding consists of a silicone elastomer band that is placed around the upper part of the 
stomach to create a small stomach pouch, which can hold only a small amount of food. The 
diameter of the band out let is adjustable to meet individual needs, which can change as one 
loses weight. Disadvantages of gastric banding include balloon leakage, band 
erosion/migration, band slippage, and reservoir leakage [ 12]. The n egative impact of mortality 
figures and economic figures, have led the medical community to seek non -surgical bariatric 
solutions.  
Intragastric Balloons  
Intragastric Balloons (IGB s) were introduced decades ago as a minimally invasive treatment 
for morbid o besity. Gastric balloons fill the stomach to induce a feeling of satiety and are 
effective in achieving weight reduction [ 14 - 40]. In the 1980’s the Garren -Edwards bub ble for 
weight loss was removed from the US market due to life threatening complications of bowel 
obstruction from deflated bubbles (balloons). This prompted the Tarpon Springs 
comprehensive workshop in 1987 that delineated new standards for intragastric b alloons: 
smooth, seamless balloons, fluid filled, adjustable, and with radio -opaque markers [13]. The 
next generation of IGBs, led by [CONTACT_235113] (Bioenterics intragastric balloon) meets most 
of those requirements, with the exception of adjustability, and have been used OUS for the last 
25 years. In the summer of 2015 both the Orbera and Reshape balloons were granted PMA 
approval by [CONTACT_1622]. These intragastric balloons are indicated for adults > 18 yrs old (or > 21 
yrs old for Reshape Duo) as an adjunct  to weight loss for those with BMI ≥30 and < [ADDRESS_284128] failed conventional weight loss therapy.  
IGBs are silicone spheres filled with saline that sit in the stomach for 6 months taking up 
stomach volume, delaying stomach emptying and ther eby [CONTACT_235114]. The deployment requires a routine endoscopy under conscious sedation which is 
done to be certain there are no lesions that would preclude use of the balloon. The Orbera and 
Re-Shape balloons are inflated a t the implantation procedure and this volume remains stagnant 
until extraction. After 6 months, the IGBs are removed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_235073], and 
the balloon is then removed by a snare or graspi[INVESTIGATOR_204232]. Behavior modification therapy 
prior, duri ng and after balloon deployment as well as an exercise program is an essential part of 
the treatment.

Page 11 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
The literature is filled with publications of the successful use of intragastric balloons outside of 
the US with wide ranging reports of 12 -21 kg weight loss and 20 -38 % EWL over 6 months, 
and with complication rates of up to 5 % [14 - 38].  Due to the wide range of published results, 
two comprehensive reviews of the BIB literature have been published in 2008 that 
meticulously scrutinized publications and chose studies based on multiple criteria such as 
controlled trials, randomization, low dropout rate, consecutive patients in series, etc [39, 39]. 
Both review articles concluded that intragastric balloons are a “v aluable” or “effective” non -
surgical therapy for weight loss. Weight losses of approximately 8 to 16 kg, with 12% to 15 % 
weight loss and 20 -30% EWL were noted in these “approved” studies. The reviewers reported 
4.2% to 6.7% early balloon removals and an 8 .1% deflation rate with 5 cases requiring surgery 
(4.1%).  Studies have shown that a greater than 10% weight loss can prevent and reduce 
cardiovascular risks and other obesity -related diseases [41, 41]. In the rec ently published FDA 
trials, the Reshape and Orbera reached their endpoints with ≥ 25% EWL in over 35% of 
treatment subjects with a superiority margin of > 7.5% compared with control arm subjects 
(sham control in the Reshape trial and diet/exercise control in the Orbera trial). In the Reshape 
Duo balloon SSED published by [CONTACT_235115] 14.3 lbs/6 months with 
25.1% EWL and 6.8% TBL compared with 11.3% EWL; 3.3% TBL and 7.2 lb weight loss in 
the control arm. Adverse events included nausea an d vomiting in 85% of patients in the first [ADDRESS_284129] implantation. There were 7.5% serious adverse events requiring early device 
removal.   39.6% ulcerations were reported, however, following design change the ulceration 
rate fell to 10.3%. There was one  epi[INVESTIGATOR_235074] a gastric ulcer. The 
extraction procedure caused one contained esophageal perforation and one esophageal tear that 
was closed with endoscopic clips.  
In the Orbera balloon SSED published by [CONTACT_235115] 1 6 lbs/6 months 
with 29 % EWL and 7.6 % TBL compared with 11.1% EWL; 3.1 % TBL and 6 lb weight loss 
in the control arm. Adverse events included nausea and vomiting in 85% of patients in the first 
[ADDRESS_284130] implantation. There were 5.6 % serious adverse ev ents requiring early device 
removal including a gastric perforation leading to sepsis and surgery.  
In 1987 the Tarpon Springs comprehensive workshop on endoscopic therapy for weight loss 
delineated standards for IGBs:  a) smooth balloon s urface,  b) fluid filled, c) adjustable, and d) 
with radio -opaque markers [13].  Unlike any other IGBs that are currently commercially 
available in the world, including the BIB (Orbera), Reshape Duo, Medsil, Silimed, and 
Medicone balloons, the Spatz 3 device is the only intr agastric balloon that meets all of those 
requirements.

3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Study Hypothesis  
Patients who receive the Spatz 3 balloon for 8 months will lose significantly more weight than 
those treated with diet and exercise alone . 
3.2. Endpoints  
3.2.1.  Effectiveness  
There a re two co -primary effectiveness endpoints:  
 Percent change in total body weight (%TBL) at 32 weeks; and  
 Clinical response, where a responder is defined as a subject with at least a 5% loss in 
total body weight at 32 weeks  
There are two secondary endpoints:  
 Maintenance of 40% of the total body weight loss with the balloon six months after the 
balloon is removed   
 Clinical response, where a responder is defined as a subject with at least a 25% loss in 
excess body weight at 32 weeks  
3.2.2.  Safety  
The incidence, freque ncy, and severity of adverse events related to treatment with the device 
will be reported.  
3.3. Design  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness  of the Spatz3 in subjects 
with a BMI ≥ 30 and < [ADDRESS_284131] failed to achieve and maintain weight -loss with a weight 
control program.  
Subjects will be studied in a randomized, controlled, multi -center study. The control group will 
receive dietary/exercise counseling fo r 32 weeks. The treatment group will receive 
dietary/exercise counseling plus the Spatz3 balloon for 32 weeks.  
The study will run 32 weeks for the control grou p and 32 weeks followed by a 24 -week follow 
up period for the treatment group.  
282 eligible subj ects will be randomized to treatment (188 subjects) or control (94 subjects) 
arms. All treatment group subjects will undergo endoscopy and those without endoscopic 
contraindications will be implanted with the Spatz3 balloon for 32 weeks . All subjects will 
follow a 1000 -1200 kcal/day -deficit diet during their participation in the study.  
At 18 weeks ± 4 weeks, treatment arm subjects will be evaluated, and those that meet the 
criteria described below in section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_284132] a 24 -week follow up.

computer generated randomization schedule using variable block ra ndomization using the 
following stratification factors: treatment center and then by [CONTACT_44207] (<35 kg/m2 vs. ≥ 35 kg/m2). 
The randomization schedule will be created by [CONTACT_4305], and will remain 
confidential.  
Subjects will not be informed of their randomization status until the day of implantation. 
Subjects rando mized to the treatment group will proceed to implantation, and subjects 
randomized to the control group will proceed to an appointment with a dietician.   
4.3.3.  Trial Intervention  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Control G roup  
The control group will be provided with dietary counselling monthly d uring the 32-week  study. 
The first dietician visit will commence on the day of randomization. A diet plan will be 
reviewed with each subject and will be adjusted according  to the needs of each subject 
(Appendix C: Diet and Exercise Plan ). In addition, exer cise counselling will be given by [CONTACT_235120] c exercises detailed ( Appendix D: Physical Exercise Program ). The 
progressive exercise plan will have 3 phases that ar e gradually phased in over the 32 -week 
follow -up period.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Group  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Impla ntation  
The Spatz3 balloon is implanted in an outpatient setting via upper endoscopy under conscious 
sedation. The subject fasts from midnight the night prior to the procedure. Conscious sedation 
will utilize a combination of Propofol, Midazolam, and a nar cotic such as Fentanyl.  A standard 
upper endoscopy is performed to rule out contraindicating findings such as a large hiatal hernia 
>2 cm), esophagitis of any degree, erosive gastritis or ulceration of the stomach or duodenum .  
Prior to implantation the ba lloon is prepared as follows: the bands are removed using “band -
off” pull strings; the valve is secured to the white catheter using “valve -hold”, the Spatz3 
balloon is secured to the endoscope by [CONTACT_235121] . The scope with balloon secured to its side is passed into the throat and 
continues into the esophagus and stomach.  Upon arrival in the stomach a retroflex maneuver 
confirms the presence of the balloon in the stomach and below the ga stro-esophageal junction. 
The scope is then straightened and the balloon is inflated by [CONTACT_235122] [ADDRESS_284137] stopcock at 
the proximal end of the extension tube to the provided 60 ml syringe and a 500 ml bag of 
Normal Saline .  The 500 ml bag of Normal Salin e will be injected with 2 cc of 1% Methylene 
Blue .  
The balloon is initially inflated according to the following criteria:  
 Initial balloon volume for subjects with height < 64 inches;  
                          - 450 ml  (without history of GE reflux)  
                          Confidential

                          - 400 ml  (with history of GE reflux)  
 Initial balloon volume for subjects with height ≥  64 inches;  
                          - 550 ml  (without history of GE reflux)  
                         -  500 ml  (with history of GE reflux)             
After final balloon volume is achieved, the extension tube is pulled out of th e mouth and the 
valve is disconnected from it and replaced with a cap. The capped valve is released and 
allowed to return to its position behind the balloon. The endoscope pushes the valve and 
catheter below the GE junction and the endoscope is then remove d. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Diet and E xercise  
The Treatment and control group will be provided with dietary counseling monthly during the 
32-week study and the [ADDRESS_284138] (Appendix C: Diet and Exercise Plan). In addition, exercise 
counseling will be given by [CONTACT_235123] (Appendix D: 
Physical Exercise Program). The pr ogressive exercise plan will have 3 phases that are 
gradually phased in over the 32 -week follow -up period.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Medications  
All treatment arm subjects will receive the following oral medications for the implantation and 
upward adjustment procedures:  
 Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  (Emend) [implantation procedure only] 125 mg immediately prior to or 1 
hour after the procedure, 80 mg the morning after the procedure and another 80 mg two 
mornings after the procedure.  
 Ondansetron  8 mg  will be taken every 6 hours starting 1 hour after t he procedure for 12 
tablets (3 -4 days);  
 Hyoscyamine 0.125 mg  prn for abdominal pain or spasm 1 -2 tablets every 4 hours 
sublingually (maximum 12 tablets/ 24 hours)  
 Percocet [ADDRESS_284139] abdominal pain that is not 
relieved by  [CONTACT_235124].   
 A PPI (proton pump inhibitor such as Nexium 20 mg, Protonix 40 mg or Prevacid 30 
mg) will be taken daily for the entire 8 months to reduce acid in the stomach. This helps 
preserve the silicone and also controls acid reflux symptoms, should t hey arise.  
 Probiotic , Acidophilus,  8-[ADDRESS_284140] treatments such as a teaspoon of 
mineral oil daily, Milk of Magnesia, or Miralax (OTC med) 17 gram+ 8 oz water twice daily.

Nausea and/or vomiting or bloating or abdominal pressure can be treated with metoclopramide  
– 10 mg orally up to 4 times in 24 hours.  
Heartburn can be treated by  [CONTACT_235125] [INVESTIGATOR_235077]; addition of antacids 
such as Maalox, Mylanta, Gaviscon – 30 ml or 2 tablets every 3 -4 hours; or addition of 
Sucralfate suspension 1,000 mg 4 times daily  
Diarrhea is expected in about 20 -25% of patients and is due to a mild case of bacterial 
overgrowth in the stomach and small intestine. Should diarrhea develop, the probiotic  
Acidophilus  will be increased to [ADDRESS_284141] recurrence and require repeat 
treatment.   
Foul-smelling belches ma y occur in 20% of subjects as a result of continuous administration of 
daily PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235078]. At the 
discretion of the investigator, these subjects may benefit from a 3 -day holiday from the daily  
dose of PPI. No more than two such PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235079]. Gastro -
esophageal reflux symptoms can be managed by [CONTACT_235126] a dose of 30 ml PO QID prn 
during the 3 -day holiday.  
For subjects intolerant to PPI [CONTACT_6589] (head ache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, 
vomiting), the investigator will have the option of discontinuing the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235080] 
H2 Blocker    medication at a twice daily dosing (Ranitidine 150 PO BID; Famotodine 20 mg 
PO BID ; Nizatidine 150 mg PO B ID). 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Gastric Ulcers  and H. Pylori treatment  
For the purposes of this study, a gastric ulcer  is defined as a gastric lesion ≥ 5mm in diameter 
with unequivocal depth by [CONTACT_235127].  
A gastric ulcer is defined as endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_235081] ≥ 3cm in le ngth and ≥ 1cm in 
width. Dimensions should be confirmed by [CONTACT_235128].  
Gastric ulcers/gastritis require biopsy for H.pylori (urease test) and treatment with “triple” 
regimen for 14 days i f positive.  
 PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235082]  
 Amoxicillin 1 gram PO BID

conservative symptomatic treatment.  
For intolerance that continues more than [ADDRESS_284143] 5 days after implantation or 
that occurs at any time during the 8 months, the investigator should:  
- remove 150 ml from ballo on (when initial volume is 450 -550ml) 
- remove 100 ml from balloon (when initial volume is 400 ml) 
The final volume should not be reduced below 300ml.  If medications and balloon volume 
down adjustment do not alleviate the intolerance, the balloon should  be extracted.  
 
2. Unscheduled e ndoscopy  
An unscheduled endoscopy may be performed at any time at the discretion of the investigator.   
The following procedures will be applied to  subjects who present with endoscopic findings  
based on an unscheduled endoscopy . 
Gastric Ulceration  
Subjects who present with an endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_235084]:  
 Ulcers whose smallest dimension (S) is ≥ 2cm, or if there are any stigmata of 
increased risk of bleeding, such as visible vessels or clots  
The balloon should be extracted. Biopsy for H.pylori will be performed and treatment 
prescribed if positive.  
These su bjects should be treated with the following regimen: with sucralfate 1,000 mg 
PO Qid, and PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235085] 3 months, followed by [CONTACT_235129] 3 months to confirm healing.  
 Ulcers whose  smallest dimension  (S) is ≥ 1 cm and < 2 c m  
The balloon volume should be decreased by 150 ml (or 100 ml if starting volume is 400 
ml) and  subjects should be treated with the following regimen: sucralfate 1,000 mg PO 
Qid and increasing PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235086] 2 months. A biopsy for H. pylori 
will be taken and tr eatment prescribed if positive .  
Endoscopic foll ow up will be performed at 8 weeks and if not healed at 8 weeks, an 
additional endoscopy at 16 weeks to confirm healing.  
o At the 8 -week follow -up, if signs of healing defined by a 25% reduction in 
either length or width are not observed , then the balloon should be extracted.  
o At the 16 -week follow -up, if signs of healing defined by a 50 % reduction from 
baseline in either length or width are not observed, the n the balloon should be 
extrac ted, and healing confirmed at follow up endoscopy  2-3 months after 
extraction .   
These subjects will not undergo adjustment at 18± 4 weeks.  
 Ulcers whose largest dimension is  ≥ [ADDRESS_284144] dimension (S) is < 1 
cm.

Page 22 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
The balloon volume should be decreased by 150 ml (or 100 ml if starting volume is 400  
ml) and subjects should be treated with the following regimen: sucralfate 1,000 mg PO 
Qid and increasing PPI [INVESTIGATOR_235086] 3 months. A biopsy for H.pylori 
will be taken and treatment prescribed if positive.  
Endoscopic follow up will be performed at 12 weeks and if not healed at 12 weeks, an 
additional endoscopy at 2 0 weeks to confirm healing.  
o At the 12 -week follow -up, if signs of healing defined by a 25% reduction in 
either length or width are not observed, then the balloon should be extracted.  
o At the 20 -week follow -up, if signs of healing defined by a 50% reduction from  
baseline in either length or width are not observed, then the balloon should be 
extracted.   
These subjects will not undergo adjustment at 18± 4 weeks.

5. Adjustment procedure  
The balloon adjustment procedure is done with an endoscopy procedure under the same 
sedation as the implantation procedure .  
The adjustment procedure requires the patient to be  on the following dietary restrictions:  
 72 hours prior to the procedure: Soft food only, no meat or vegetables in any form.  
 48 hours prior to the procedure: Full liquids only.  
 24 hours prior to the procedure: Clear liquids only.  
 12 hours prior to the proce dure: No food or liquids by [CONTACT_1966].  
                          Confidential                           
 
Page 27 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
The adjustment procedure is performed under conscious sedation by [CONTACT_235131]. The endoscope is introduced in the usual manner .  The capped 
valve is identified and the suture loop  is grasped  with a standard rat tooth graspi[INVESTIGATOR_204232]. The 
scope and cap are pulled out of the mouth,  (the inflation tube stretches and reaches the mouth – 
see section 5.1)  wherein the cap is twisted off and replaced with the extension tube (provided). 
The extension tube is lowered down the throat into the esophagus followed by [CONTACT_94874]. The 
adjustment commences by [CONTACT_235132] [ADDRESS_284156] stopcock on the proximal end of the extension 
tube. Following completion of the adjustment, the extension tube is pulled o ut of the mouth 
and is replaced by [CONTACT_235133]. The cap is lowered back into the throat and allowed to pull itself 
back to its position touching the white catheter. The scope then pushes it down into the 
stomach.  
6. Follow -up Endoscopy  
All study subjects whose fi nal adjusted volume is >900 ml will receive a follow -up endoscopic 
mucosal evaluation  4 weeks following the adjustment . 
[IP_ADDRESS].6.  Extraction  
The extraction procedure requires the patient to be on the following dietary restrictions:  
 72 hours prior to the procedure: S oft food only, no meat or vegetables in any form.  
 48 hours prior to the procedure: Full liquids only.  
 24 hours prior to the procedure: Clear liquids only.  
 12 hours prior to the procedure: No food or liquids by [CONTACT_1966].  
The extraction procedure is performed u nder conscious sedation by [CONTACT_235131]. The endoscope is  introduced in the usual manner. T he capped 
valve is identified and the suture loop is grasped  with a standard rat tooth graspi[INVESTIGATOR_204232]. The 
scope and cap a re pulled out of the mouth, wherein the cap is twisted off. A large polypectomy 
snare i s inserted into the biopsy channel  of the scope and the snare is opened and placed on the 
valve. Then the extension tube (provided) is connected to the valve. The scope (with snare 
closed on the valve) and the extension tube are lowered down the throat into the esophagus. 
The balloon deflation commences by [CONTACT_235132] [ADDRESS_284157] stopcock on the proximal end of the 
extension tube. Following completion of the deflation,  the sc ope is pushed down to the gastro -
esophageal junction to confirm complete deflation of the balloon. The snare is opened as the 
extension tube is pulled until the valve exits the mouth - this will bring the distal white catheter 
and deflated balloon edge into  the open snare. The snare is closed. The scope (with snare 
secured around balloon/white catheter) and the stretched inflation tube are pulled out together 
with the balloon in tow.  The scope is then reinserted to inspect for any mucosal damage.   
Following the extraction procedure, all treatment subjects will be followed for an additional 24 
weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7.  Device Failures  
If a balloon deflation or other device failure due to device malfunction or operator error occurs 
during the implantation or adjustment procedure s or follow -up period, the investigator will 
replace the failed device  with a new device unless doing so is not in the best interest of the 
patient. All device failures will be reported to the Data Monitoring Committee. The number of

5.1. Device Description  
5.1.1.  Spatz 3 
The Spatz3 device ( Figure  2) consists of a balloon positioned around a curved catheter inside 
the balloon, and whose catheter continues and exits outside of the balloon. The external 
catheter houses the stretchable inflation tubing.

Figure  3: Spatz3 during  Implantation  
 
The Spatz3 balloon is wrapped by 6 silicone bands during shelf life, which give s it a tapered 
profile. The band s are removed using the “band -off” silicone pull strings prior to implantation.  
         Pull both silicone strings to the left to remove all bands  
   
 
The valve is secured to the white catheter with “valve -hold.”

The stretchable inflation tube design of the Spatz3 device permits balloon volume adjustment 
at the t ime of placement, and at a later time. Initial b alloon volumes range from 400 cc to 550 
ml. The minimum and maximum balloon volumes will range from 300 ml (an initial balloon 
volume of 400 or 450 ml that has been adjusted down to 300 ml due to intolerance)  to 900 ml 
(an initial balloon volume of [ADDRESS_284164] 2 weeks after implantation).

A retractable/stretchable silicone inflation tube allows the balloon to have its volume adjusted 
after initial insertion, while the balloon remains in the stomach ( Figure  4 and Figure  5). The 
inflation tube is a [ADDRESS_284165] behind the balloon and is 
accessible for future adjustments. The inflation tube travels within the soft catheter outside of 
the balloon and exits where it  is attached to a luer -lock valve. The valve is closed with a cap. 
The valve has within it a silicone pi[INVESTIGATOR_235096]. The 
balloon is filled with saline and methylene blue (in the event of a balloon deflation the u rine 
turns blue).  
5.1.2.  Additional Components and Adjunct Devices  
The following additional items are not supplied by [CONTACT_235134], but are used during the 
implantation, adjustment, and extraction procedures.  
Sterile Saline Solution  
Sterile saline solution is used to fill the balloon to the desired volume.  
Methylene Blue  
USP 1% methylene blue (Akorn 1% Methylene Blue Injection, NDC [ZIP_CODE] -504-01) is added 
to the saline to provide a visual indicator to the patient (i.e., blue -green urine) when saline 
solution is relea sed from a deflated balloon.  
Endoscopic Rat Tooth Graspi[INVESTIGATOR_235097] 35 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
Rat tooth graspi[INVESTIGATOR_235098] s to grab the suture loop at the top of the cap.  
Large Polypectomy Snare  
A large polype ctomy snare is used during the balloon removal procedure to grab the valve.  
5.2. Device Labeling  
All components of the Spatz 3 device  will be labeled “ CAUTION  Investigational device. 
Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to investigational use ”. Labeling will also include  
the Sponsor name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_8972].   
5.3. Device Accountability  
The study site coordinator will maintain a log for tracking study devices, and a final 
reconciliation of study devices will be performed at the study end. Unused devices wi ll be 
returned to the sponsor.  The lot number for each device will be recorded on the case report 
forms (CRFs).

6. DATA MONITORING AND SAFETY R EPORTING  
6.1. Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will serve as an aut onomous advisory 
group for Spatz  FGIA, Inc., the sponsor of this trial.  The DMC will be responsible for 
safeguarding the interests of trial participants, assessing the safety and efficacy of the 
interventions during the trial, adjudication of Adverse Events, and for monito ring the overall 
conduct of the clinical trial.  The DMC may also provide recommendations about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_73908]. To contribute to enhancing the integrity of the trial, the DMC may also 
formulate recommendations relating to the selection/re cruitment/retention of participants, their 
management, improving adherence to protocol -specified regimens and retention of 
participants, and the procedures for data management and quality control.  
The DMC members appointed for this trial consist of individ uals who collectively have 
experience and expertise in the management of patients with obesity, experience in randomized 
clinical trials with experimental agents/devices, experience in safety monitoring and absence of 
significant conflicts of interest.  
The first DMC meeting will occur once [ADDRESS_284166] 2 months plus all 
subjects implanted less than 2 months but had experienced a gastric ulcer  event . A 
gastric ulcer is defined as a g astric lesion ≥ 5mm in diameter with unequivocal depth by 
[CONTACT_235127] . The date of the event will be the date of the confirmatory endoscopy.  If this 
rate exceeds 10% then a Kaplan -Meier curve will be calculated that includes all 
implanted subjects.  Subjects  who are ongoing at this time without having experienced 
a gastric ulcer event will be censored at the data cutoff date, and subjects who 
terminated from the trial due to any reason other than a gastric ulcer event will be 
censored at the time of explant.  Rates at each monthly interval for which a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_284167] 4 months then rates will be 
calculated for 1, 2, and  3 months only.  
 If all of the monthly rates of gastric ulcers are below 10%, the DMC will meet every two 
months. If any of the monthly rates of gastric ulcers exceeds 10%, the DMC will meet every 
month.  
A separate DMC charter will contain full details of  the committee and its roles and reporting 
structure.

The investigator will document the clinical sig nificance of all abnormal laboratory findings in 
the source documents throughout the study.  The investigator will exercise his/her medical 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant. H owever, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the frequency or severity 
of the event is greater than would be expected then it must be reported  as an AE . 
6.2.3.  Procedures for recording  adverse events  
It is the responsibility of the local investigator to ensure that all adverse events (AEs , ADEs , 
and device deficiencies) occurring during  the course of the study are recorded. This may 
include but not be limited to:  
 A description of the event  
 The dates of the onset and resolution  
 Action taken  
 Outcome  
 Initial a ssess ment of relatedness  to the device  (final adjudication  will be made by [CONTACT_109393] ) 
a. Whether the AE is serious or not  
b. Whether the AE arises from device deficiency  
c. Whether the AE arises from user error  
Adverse events that occur during the course of the study sho uld be treated by [CONTACT_235136]. In addition,  each subject should 
be questioned about adverse events at each visit.  Adverse events should be recorded on 
provided serious adverse event data collection forms.  
6.2.4.  Reporting Procedures for  Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the local investigator to ensure that all adverse events which fall i nto 
the categories of SAEs, DRAEs, SDRAE s and any device deficiencies are  reported to the 
sponsor as soon as possible after becoming aware of the event but no l ater than 24 hours , via e-
mail to the sponsor at [EMAIL_4575]  (cc to [EMAIL_4576] ) using the 
provided SAE form.  
A sponsor who conducts an evalua tion of an unanticipated adverse device effect under 
812.46(b) shall report the results of such evaluation to FDA and to all reviewing IRB's and 
participating investigators within [ADDRESS_284169] as FDA 
requests.

6.3. Study Suspension or Early T ermination  
6.3.1.  General  
The DMC  or sponsor may recommend suspension or termination of the study either at an 
individual investigation site o r the entire study for signi ficant and documented reasons. An 
investigator, IRB or FDA  may suspend or prematurely terminate participation in the study at 
the investigation sites for which they are responsible. If suspi[INVESTIGATOR_235102], or when so instructed by [CONTACT_100958], the 
sponsor shall suspend the study while the risk is assessed. The sponsor shall terminate the 
study if an unacceptable risk is confirmed.  
6.3.2.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235103], the crude rate of gastric ulcers will be calculated using as its 
denominator only subjects who have been implanted for at least 2 months plus all subjects 
implanted less than 2 months but had experienced a gastric ulcer  event . A ga stric ulcer event is 
defined as a gastric lesion ≥ 5mm in diameter with unequivocal depth by [CONTACT_235127] . The date 
of the event will be the date of the confirmatory endoscopy.  
If the crude gastric ulcer rate  exceeds 10% then a Kaplan -Meier curve will be calc ulated that 
includes all implanted subjects.  Subjects who are ongoing at this time without having 
experienced a gastric ulcer event will be censored at the data cutoff date, and subjects who 
terminated from the trial due to any reason other than a gastric  ulcer event will be censored at 
the time of explant.  Rates at each monthly interval for which a minimum of [ADDRESS_284170] 
3 months, but only 20 for at leas t 4 months then rates will be calculated for 1, 2, and 3 months 
only. If the monthly Kaplan -Meier rate exceeds 20% for any month, then the study will be 
suspended and the IRB and FDA will be notified.

7. STATISTICS  
7.1. Description of Statistical M ethods  
7.1.1.  Study cohorts for analyses  
The primary analysis will be based on the intent -to-treat dataset, which will include all 
randomized subjects according to their randomized treatment.  However , any subject with an 
absolute contraindication to balloon implantation which was only revealed at the endoscopy 
procedure, and who therefor e did not receive a balloon, will not be considered in analysis of 
efficacy.  
7.1.2.  Primary E ndpoints  
The co -primary hypotheses are as follows:  
1. The mean %TBL in the Spatz3 group exceeds that in the control group by 4.5%.  In 
formal terms, this is:  
 
HO: µS – µC ≤ 4.5%  
vs. 
HA: µS – µC > 4.5%,  
 
where µ S and µ C are the population mean %TBL for the Spatz3 and control groups, 
respectively.  
 
2. The response rate in the Spatz3 group is superior to  a performance goal of 50%, where 
a responder is defined as a ≥5% loss in total  body weight at 32 weeks.  In formal terms, 
this is:  
 
HO: π ≤ 50% 
vs. 
HA: π > 50%, 
 
where π is the population response rate in the Spatz3 group.  
All m issing body weight data will first be imputed as follows.  Initially, all interim missing 
data (missing da ta for which there is at least one subsequent non -missing body weight) will be 
linearly interpolated based on the last and subsequent non -missing body weight.  If a subject in 
the Spatz3 group has the balloon explanted, the body weight immediately precedin g the 
explant will be used and the subject will be treated as a dropout from that time forward, even 
though the subject will be followed for another [ADDRESS_284171]’s gender, study center, 
treatment group, and all non -missing body weight measurements through Week [ADDRESS_284172] 
primary endpoint , %TBL at 32 weeks, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_235137], study center, baseline BMI group (<35 kg/m2 vs. ≥ 35 
kg/m2) and subject’s gender as covariates.  The parameter estimates from the five imputations 
                          Confidential                           
 
Page 42 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
will be used to estimate a one -sided lower 9 7.5% confidence bound on the difference in mean 
%TBL (Spatz3 mean minus control mean).  If this lower confid ence bound exceeds the super -
superiority margin of 4.5% the Spatz3 will be deemed to have super -superiority over the 
control group in %TBL.   
The second primary endpoint will be analyzed using the same five imputed datasets created for 
testing the first pr imary endpoint, but only the data from subjects in the active treatment group.  
The estimated proportion of subjects with a ≥5%  weight loss at Week 32, along with their 
associated variance, from each dataset will then be combined using Rubin’s method to estimate 
the overall proportion and its variance.  This proportion and its variance will then be used to 
estimate the one -sided lower 97.5% confidence bound on the  proportion of subjects with a 
≥5%  weight loss at Week 32.  If this lower confidence bound exceeds 0.[ADDRESS_284173] non -missing value.  
Secondary analyses of the primary endpoints will be per protocol a nd will include subjects 
according to the actual treatment received and will exclude subjects who did not meet the 
inclusion criterion of baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and < 40 kg/m2.  
7.1.3.  Secondary endpoints  
The observed rate of subjects who maintain 40% of the wei ght loss with the balloon at six 
months will be compared to a performance goal of 50%.   
Percent change in excess weight loss (%EWL) will be calculated by [CONTACT_235138] a BMI of 25 kg/m2.  This endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_235139] 
32-week changes in body weight for each subject across the five imputations described for the 
primary endpoint to determine which subjects had a clinical response of a ≥25% loss in excess 
body weight.  This response rate will be compared t o a performance goal of 35%.   
7.1.4.  Subgroup Analyses  
The following subgroup analyses will be performed:  
o Study site  
o Gender  
o Baseline BMI (<35 kg/m2 vs. ≥ 35 kg/m2) 
o Age (<45 years vs. ≥45 years)  
o Race (white vs. all others)  
Subgroup analyses of the first primary e ndpoint will be performed on the average of the five 
imputed datasets.  For each subgroup, the subgroup and its interaction with treatment group 
will be added to the primary analysis model.  A significant interaction with treatment group 
(p<0.05) will indi cate that the mean %TBL differences between the Spatz3 and the control 
were not comparable between (among) the levels of the subgroup.   If a significant interaction is 
found for any subgroup, additional analyses will be performed in an attempt to determine  the 
cause of the interaction.

Page 43 – Spatz3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235066] v1.4e  
 
It should be noted that a formal subgroup analysis to compare subjects who did and did not 
receive a change in balloon volume must be assessed with caution.  This is because the 
decision to have the change is optional and a m eaningful comparison of its effect could only be 
done if subjects were randomized to volume addition or not.  However, to characterize the risk 
profile of the Spatz3 and on its effect on weight loss, sub-group analyses by [CONTACT_235140]-group s:   
• 400-600 cc - includes mostly study subjects with initial filling volume only  
• 601-800 cc – includes subjects who have had one additional adjustment  
• 801-1000cc – includes subj ects who have had at least [ADDRESS_284174] primary endpoint and on adverse events.  
7.1.5.  Missing data  
Missing data will be imputed as  described above in Section  7.1.2 .  
7.2. Sample size  
The true population mean %TBL in the control group is assumed to be 3.3% based on the 
Orbera and ReShape PMA studies.  The standard deviation of %TBL is assumed to be 
approximately 6.6%, based on 6 -month data from the Orbera PMA study.  Based on these two 
assumptions, and a true population mean % TBL in the Spatz3 group of 10.34 %, a total sample 
size of 240 subjects randomized 2:1 (160 in the Spatz3 group and 80 in the control group) will 
provide 80% power to demonstrate super -superiority of 4.5% TBL over the control at a one -
sided significance of 2.5%.  To account for a potential dropout rate of 15%, the final total 
sample size is 282 subjects randomized 2:1 (188 in the Spatz3 group and 94 in the control 
group).  
7.3. Safety  
All adverse events and all serious adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_235141].  These adverse events will also be presented by [CONTACT_2235].  In 
addition, the number and percent of subjects with balloon deflation will be  summarized.

Data collection will be electronic using a commercially available and validated EDC system 
that is compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 pertaining to the use of electronic records and 
signatures.   The investigator  will be authorized to review and sign each eCRF with an 
electronic signature.  Data will be input by [CONTACT_235142]/ coordinators  trained in the 
use of the EDC system prior to receiving log -in details.   
The database will reside on a ser ver hosted by  [CONTACT_68707].  The CRO, Clinical Development 
Associates Inc.  (CDA ), will subcontract the data management to Technical Resources 
International Inc. of Rockville, Maryland . All changes made to the data will be captured in an 
electronic audit trail and available for review.  Database backups are performed regularly.  
Access to the database will be  controlled by [CONTACT_125698].  The Database 
Administrator  will be responsible for assigning usernames and passwords to individuals 
requiring ac cess to the EDC database.  The Database Administrator will revoke access for the 
users who are no longer required to use the database.   At regular intervals passwords will be 
changed.  
8.2. Source Data  
Source documents include all information obtained in the stu dy to verify all data collected in 
the EDC system. This includes patient reported documents ( i.e. diaries), medical records, 
surgical procedural information, all clinic visits and any supporting information related to a 
device malfunction or adverse eve nt.   Source documents are where data are first recorded, and 
from which participants’ eCRF data are obtained. eCRF entries will be considered source data 
if the eCRF is the site of original recording (e.g. there is no other written or electronic record of  
the data).  All documents will be stored safely in confidential conditions.  On all trial -specific 
documents, other than the signed consent, the participant will be referred to by [CONTACT_235143]/code, not by [CONTACT_2300].  
The standardized case repor t form s are provided in Appendix E  of this protocol . Information 
regarding the relevant patient history and physical examination will be obtained from the 
medical chart and recorded.  Completed CRFs will be su bmitted to the data center withi n10 
days of the patient visit. Instructions and on -line training will be provided via WebEx by [CONTACT_235144].   EDC training of all staff responsible for data collection 
using  an EDC system that is compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 will be docu mented and filed in 
the Investigator Site File (ISF).  
Study data will be stored and analyzed in an anonymous fashion (no patient identifiers).  Data 
will be stored at the data center in accordance with ICH/GCP and all local and federal 
regulations.  Study  data (paper and electronic) will be archived by [CONTACT_127026] a minimum 
of 5 years following completion of the study.

 SYNOPSIS 
 
Protocol Title: 
Evaluation of Long-term Buprenor phine Plasma Exposure in Subjec ts Who Received at Least 
2 Subcutaneous Injections of Extended-release Buprenorphine (SU BLOCADE™) in Phase III 
Studies  
Protocol Number:  INDV-6000-402 
Rationale: Data indicate that after discont inuing SUBLOCADE™ (extended-release buprenorphine 
subcutaneous [SC] injection), patients may have detectable conc entrations of buprenorphine in 
plasma and urine for 12 months or  longer. The correlation betwe en buprenorphine 
concentrations in plasma and i n urine is currently unknown.   
Since previous Phase II/III studies did not evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
buprenorphine beyond [ADDRESS_1030699] injection of SUBLOCADE.  
This study will also assess relationships between plasma drug c oncentrations, free drug 
concentrations in urine, and urine drug screen (UDS) results fo r buprenorphine from a 
diagnostic laboratory. The intent  of the study is to provide re fined guidance to patients and 
physicians with respect to long- term exposure to buprenorphine after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_752827]. 
Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to assess long-term plasma exposure to buprenorphine 
after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_752828].  
Exploratory objectives of th is study are the following: 
 to refine PK model predictions f or long-term plasma exposure to buprenorphine after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_752828], by [CONTACT_752848][INVESTIGATOR_007] a more robust population PK model 
for SUBLOCADE; and 
 to assess relationships between drug plasma concentrations, free drug concentrations in 
urine, and UDS results for buprenorphine from a diagnostic laboratory. 
Target Population: 
Inclusion Criteria 
Each individual must meet all of  the following criteria to be e nroled in this study: 
1. The subject participated in Study RB-US-13-[ADDRESS_1030700] SUBLOCADE 
injection at the time of  the Screening visit.

 3. Female individuals of childbeari ng potential (defined as all wo men who were not 
surgically sterile or postmenopaus al for at least 1 year prior to informed consent) must 
agree to have a pregnancy test ad ministered prior to enrolment and throughout the 
study. Pregnancy will not prohibit them from participation in t he study. 
4. The subject must be willing to a dhere to study procedures and p rovide written 
informed consent prior to the start of any study procedures. 
Exclusion Criteria 
A subject will not be eligible  for inclusion in this study if either of the followi ng criteria apply: 
1. The subject received SUBLOCADE  or any other long-acting bupreno rphine product at 
any time after ending their part icipation in Study RB-US-13-[ADDRESS_1030701] has taken any bupre norphine (prescribed or illicit)  within 3 weeks prior to 
the Screening visit. 
This study is divided into 2 part s, Part A and Part B. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria 
and meet none of the exclusion criteria will be considered elig ible to enrol in Part A. See 
Study Design section below for crite ria for continuation into P art B. 
Number of Subjects:   
Approximately 60 male or female su bjects shall be enroled in Part A.  
A maximum of 30 Part A subjects will proceed into Part B (conti nuation part of the study).  
Study Design:   
This multicentre investigation w ill enrol subjects who participated in Study RB-US-13-[ADDRESS_1030702] 2 SC 
injections of SUBLOCADE.  Part A will include all subjects who meet inclusion criteria an d do not meet exclusion criteria. 
Data from subjects in Part A will be used to ensure a fully representative dataset for the 
distribution of plasma and urin e data in the overall population within the time frame 
investigated (i.e., [ADDRESS_1030703] SUBLOCADE inj ection). Buprenorphine 
plasma concentration data will be used to refine the existing p opulation PK model for 
SUBLOCADE developed from Phase II/III study data, to provide accurate predictions for 
long-term plasma exposure to bupr enorphine after discontinuatio n of SUBLOCADE 
treatment.  
Part B will include subjects from  Part A who meet continuation criteria as detailed below until 
a maximum of 30 subjects are enro led. Data from subjects in Par t B will inform the 
consistency of the PK profile s over time, the stability of urin e-to-plasma ratios and 
norbuprenorphine-to-buprenorphine ratios in urine. Part A 
Following Screening, eligible subje cts who meet inclusion crite ria and do not meet exclusion 
criteria will undergo V isit 1 assessments (sa me day as Screenin g) as follows:  
 Collection of a urine sample f or determination of free buprenor phine and free 
norbuprenorphine concentrations;  qualitative UDS for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], i ncluding

 buprenorphine; quantitative UDS  for buprenorphine, norbuprenorp hine and naloxone; 
and determination of crea tinine concentration. 
 Collection of a blood sample for the determination of buprenorp hine and 
norbuprenorphine plasma  concentrations. 
 
Part B 
Results on the quantitative UDS pe rformed at Visit 1 will deter mine enrolment in Part B: 
subjects who provide a quantifia ble (i.e., positiv e) result for  buprenorphine and/or 
norbuprenorphine and a non-quantif iable (i.e., negative) result for naloxone will meet 
continuation criteria to move on to Part B if Part B is still open to enrolment. Part B will 
consist of 2 visits with 30 days ( ±7 days) between the visits. 
At each visit, the same assessments as in Part A will be perfor med. In addition, the subject will 
answer a question regarding his  or her illicit use of buprenorphine within the last [ADDRESS_1030704] will continue the study until he or she meets one o f the following criteria: 
 the subject completes bo th visits in Part B; 
 the subject discontinues study participation for any reason or misses the [ADDRESS_1030705]’s participation or modifies the duration of the 
study. 
If subjects initiate treatment with SUBLOCADE or any other long -acting buprenorphine 
product during the study, they wil l be discontinued from the study and no further samples will 
be collected. Subjects who sta rt any non-buprenorphine medicati on-assisted treatment or trans-
mucosal buprenorphine treatment w ill not be discontinued from the study.  
Part B may meet enrolment and be  considered closed to new subjects while Part A is still open 
to enrolment.  
Duration of Treatment:  
This is an observational st udy with no drug intervention. 
Primary Endpoint: 
The primary endpoint will consist  of a plot representing indivi dual plasma concentrations of 
buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine  over time using the time ela psed from the last 
SUBLOCADE dose.

 Exploratory Endpoints: 
Exploratory endpoints will include the following: 
 the parameter estimates of the  refined population PK model for buprenorphine; 
 a plot representing individual  urine concentrations of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine over time using the  time elapsed from the last  SUBLOCADE dose; 
 norbuprenorphine-to-buprenorphine concentration ratios in plasm a and urine over time; 
 plasma-to-urine concentration ratios for buprenorphine and norb uprenorphine over 
time. 
Other exploratory endpoints will be derived from the PK model; for example, the distribution 
of times for which buprenorphine p lasma concentration are above  the lower limit of 
quantification for the [ADDRESS_1030706]:   
The following PK assessments will be performed at each visit of  Part A or Part B: 
 Collection of a blood sample for the determination of buprenorp hine and 
norbuprenorphine concentrations in plasma;  
 Collection of a urine sample: 
‐ Aliquots (primary and back-up) wi ll be sent to the bioanalytica l laboratory for the 
determination of free buprenor phine and free norbuprenorphine c oncentrations in 
urine. 
‐ Additional aliquots will be prep ared and sent to the diagnostic  laboratory who will 
perform 3 analyses: 1) qualita tive UDS for buprenorphine; 2) qu antitative UDS for 
buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine an d naloxone (quantifiable conc entrations of 
buprenorphine and/or norbuprenorphine on this assessment will i ndicate a positive 
result); and 3) determination of  creatinine concentration in ur ine. 
 
Clinical assessments will incl ude a qualitative UDS for opi[INVESTIGATOR_752829]-reported use of illicit 
buprenorphine. Safety will be assessed based on adverse events (including seri ous adverse events) associated 
with study assessments and/or study conduct. Concomitant medica tions will also be collected.

 1 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) is a ch ronic, relapsing, neurobehavio ral syndrome characterised by 
[CONTACT_491], compulsive seeking or us e of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_752831] e social psychological and 
physical consequences ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2004 ). 
Medication-assisted treatment (MA T), which combines counselling /behavioural therapy with 
medications to provide a whole-pati ent approach, is recommended  by [CONTACT_752849] ( Kampman 2015). 
SUBLOCADE™ (extended-release bupr enorphine subcutaneous [SC] in jection) is an extended-
release formulation of buprenorphi ne, a mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_752832]. SUBLOCADE is 
currently indicated for the tre atment of moderate to severe OUD  in patients who have initiated 
treatment with a transmucosal  buprenorphine-containing product to suppress opi[INVESTIGATOR_2600]. SUBLOCADE s hould be used as a part of a com plete treatment program 
that includes counselling and psychosocial support. 
SUBLOCADE is administered once monthly and provides sustained p lasma concentrations of 
buprenorphine over the dosing interval. SUBLOCADE uses buprenor phine and the ATRIGEL® 
Delivery System, which consists of a biodegradable polymer poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) with 
a carboxylic acid end group, dissolv ed in a biocompatible solve nt, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. 
SUBLOCADE is injected as a so lution, and subsequent precipi[INVESTIGATOR_752833] a 
solid depot containing the buprenorphine. After initial formati on of the depot, buprenorphine is 
slowly released via diffusion f rom, and the biodegradation of, the depot. 
1.[ADDRESS_1030712]-dose. The  initial peak was followed by a decline in plasma 
concentrations to a plateau throughout the monthly dosing interval, consistent with the slow release of buprenorphine from th e SC depot. The apparent termin al plasma half‐life of 
buprenorphine following SC injection of SUBLOCADE ranged between 43 to 60 days. Steady‐state was achieved at 4 to 6 m onths following repeated monthly SC injections.  
Buprenorphine is metabolized to i ts major metabolite, norbupren orphine, primarily by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4 and, to a lesser extent, by [CONTACT_9058] P450  2C8. Norbuprenorphine can 
further undergo glucuronidation. N orbuprenorphine has been foun d to bind to mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_752834]; however, norbuprenorphine is expected to ha ve negligible contribution to 
brain mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_752835] y given its limited ability to  cross the blood-brain barrier 
(Ohtani 2007) and has not been studied clinic ally for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]‐ like activity.  Norbuprenorphine 
steady‐state plasma concentrations  in humans after SC injection  of SUBLOCADE were low 
compared with buprenorphine. The  ratio of norbuprenorphine/buprenorphine areas under the 
plasma concentration-time curve  (AUC) in a repeat-dose study (R B-US-12-0005) was 0.2 to 0.4, 
i.e., much lower than for transmu cosal buprenorphine (ratio of 1.3-3.2 in the same study) due to 
the lack of first-pass effect.

 1.3 Study Rationale 
Data from population pharmacoki netic (PK) modelling and individ ual case studies indicate that 
patients may have detectable conc entrations of buprenorphine in  plasma and urine for 12 months 
or longer after discontinuation of  SUBLOCADE treatment. The correlation between plasma 
concentrations of buprenorphine and those detectable in urine i s currently unknown.   
Since previous Phase II/III studies did not evaluate the PK of buprenorphine beyond [ADDRESS_1030713] SUBLOCADE 
injection.  
The study will be organised into 2 parts: Part A and Part B.  
 Part A (See Section 4.1): Collect single plasma and urine sampl es in [ADDRESS_1030714] 2 SUBLOCADE i njections in the Phase III studi es. This number of 
subjects is expected to provide  a reasonable description of the  distribution of plasma and 
urine concentration data in the overall populatio n over the timeframe investigated (i.e., 
[ADDRESS_1030715] SUBLOCADE injection), given the l ow-moderate 
interindividual variability (~30 %) observed for SUBLOCADE PK in previous studies. 
The number of subjects to be enroled in Part A is limited by [CONTACT_3433] e availability of patients 
who received at least [ADDRESS_1030716] 
SUBLOCADE injection as well as the percentage of urine samples negative and positive 
for buprenorphine over that time period.  
 Part B: Collect additional plasma and urine samples from 30 sub jects who participated in 
Part A and who provided positive results for buprenorphine and/ or norbuprenorphine on 
the quantitative urine drug screen  (UDS) performed at Visit 1. These data will inform the 
consistency of the plasma and urine PK data over time. It is an ticipated that 
approximately 30 subjects will be sufficient for this purpose. The final number of 
subjects will depend on results from quantitative buprenorphine UDS in Part A.  
The totality of the data collected in Parts A and B will be use d to refine the existing population 
PK model developed from Phase II/III study data, and to provide accurate model predictions for 
long-term plasma exposure to bupr enorphine after discontinuatio n of SUBLOCADE treatment. 
Additionally, data will be used to e xplore the relationships be tween plasma drug concentrations, 
free drug concentrations in urine , and UDS results for buprenor phine from a diagnostic 
laboratory. Norbuprenorphine-to-bu prenorphine ratios will be as sessed both in plasma and urine, 
as well as plasma-to-urine ratios for both analytes. The intent of the study is to provide refined guidance to patie nts and physicians with respect to 
long-term exposure to buprenorphine  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_752836].

Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1030717] udy with no drug intervention. The r isks in this study are minimal, 
given that assessments are base d on a single blood sample and a  single urine sample for subjects 
in Part A. Subjects progressing to Part B will provide a maximu m of 2 additional blood samples 
and 2 additional urine samples taken at 2 subsequent monthly vi sits. The risks involved in 
collecting venous blood samples may include possible bruising, redness and swelling around the 
site of blood withdraw; bleeding at the site; feeling of light-headedness when the blood is drawn; 
and rarely, an infection at the s ite. Results of urine assessments relative to buprenorphine and 
other opi[INVESTIGATOR_752837].  
The study does not provide direct  benefit to the study subjects ; however the results of the study 
will inform patients and physicians on how long buprenorphine r emains at quantifiable 
concentrations in plasma after t he last dose of SUBLOCADE, as w ell as clarifying the 
relationship with positiv e UDS for buprenorphine. 
Based on ongoing review of the data, t he Sponsor reserves the r ight to modify the duration of the 
study at any time. The study will be carried out in accordance to the protocol and  with local legal and regulatory 
requirements, International C ouncil for Harmonisation E6 / Good  Clinical Practice (ICH/GCP) 
guidelines and all applicable subject privacy requirements.

SUBLOCADE dose. 
Exploratory endpoints will include the following: 
 the parameter estimates of the  refined population PK model for buprenorphine; 
 a plot representing individual  urine concentrations of buprenorphine and 
norbuprenorphine over time using the  time elapsed from the last  SUBLOCADE dose; 
 norbuprenorphine-to-buprenorphine concentration ratios in plasm a and urine over time; 
 plasma-to-urine concentration ratios for buprenorphine and norb uprenorphine over time. 
Other exploratory endpoints will be derived from the PK model, for example, the distribution of 
times for which buprenorphine plas ma concentrations are above t he lower limit of quantification 
for the [ADDRESS_1030719] 2 SC injections of 
SUBLOCADE. This study is divide d into 2 parts, Part A and Part B.

Part B 
Results on the quantitative UDS pe rformed at Visit 1 will deter mine enrolment in Part B: 
subjects who provide a quantifia ble (i.e., positiv e) result for  buprenorphine and/or 
norbuprenorphine and a non-quantif iable (i.e., negative) result for naloxone will meet 
continuation criteria to move on to Part B if Part B is still open to enrolment. Part B will consist of 2 visits, with 30 days (
±7 days) between the visits. 
At each visit, the same assessments as in Part A will be perfor med. In addition, the subject will 
answer a question regarding his  or her illicit use of buprenorphine within the last 14 days.  
Part B may meet enrolment and be  considered closed to new subje cts while Part A is still open to 
enrolment.

Clinical Assessments 
Clinical assessments will incl ude UDS for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (described in  Section 8.2) and self-reported 
use of illicit buprenorphi ne within the last 14 days. 
8.4 Safety Assessments 
All adverse events (AE) associ ated with study assessments and/o r study conduct will be 
collected using the Adverse Even t eCRF. All serious AEs (SAEs) associated with the study 
assessments and/or study conduct will be collected using the Sa fety Information Collection 
Form. 
Concomitant medications will be  collected, including any prescribed MAT (inclusive of any 
MATs that lead to study discontinuation, such as long-acting bu prenorphine treatment).  
Illicit use of buprenorphine will be captured separately outside of the Concomitant Medication 
eCRF. 
See Section [ADDRESS_1030738] udies. Together with plasma conce ntration data, urine results will be 
used to evaluate the relations hips between drug plasma concentr ations, free drug concentrations

 8.6 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any noncom pliance with the clinical study protocol or ICH/GCP 
requirements. The noncompliance may be on the part of the subje ct, the Investigator, or the study 
site staff. As a result of deviat ions, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_752853] E6. It is the r esponsibility of the Investigator 
and study site staff to use continuous vigilance to identify an d report deviations to Indivior or 
specified designee and the IRB. A ll deviations must be addressed in the study source documents. 
Protocol deviations must be sent to the central IRB in accordan ce with the central IRB’s 
requirements. The Investigator and study site staff are responsible for knowing and adhering to 
the IRB’s requirements.

10 ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator or designee is  responsible for identifying, do cumenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE.  
deat In addition, any AE or SAE of which the Investigator becomes aw are that pertains to 
SUBLOCADE or SUBOXONE use, or r elated to participation in a pre vious SUBLOCADE 
clinical study, will be reported via completion of the Safety I nformation Collection Form and 
that form will be sent to the following email address: [EMAIL_7992] . 
Events meeting the definition of an AE associated with study as sessments and/or study conduct 
include the following: 
 new condition detected after study assessment and/or associated  with study conduct even 
though the AE may have been present  prior to the study assessme nt or study 
participation; 
 exacerbation of a pre-existing cond ition (including intensifica tion of a condition and/or 
an increase in frequency) res ulting from a study assessment and /or study conduct; 
 any safety assessments resulting from a study assessment and/or  study conduct felt to be 
clinically significant in the opi [INVESTIGATOR_689] (incl uding those that worsen from 
baseline);  
 symptoms and/or clinical seque lae resulting from a study assess ment and/or study 
conduct that resulte d in intervention.

at a site visit. If an event requires intervention, or if in th e opi[INVESTIGATOR_752842], then it will be reported as an AE (usin g the Adverse Event eCRF).  
All AEs are to be assessed and reco rded in a timely manner and followed to resolution or until 
the Investigator determines tha t there is not an anticipated re solution. Each AE is to be 
documented with reference to s everity, date of oc currence, dura tion, treatment and outcome.  
Furthermore, each AE is to be cla ssified as being serious or no n-serious.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1030741]’s last visit.  
Subjects with SAEs related to s tudy procedures ongoing at the end of the study or after early 
termination will be followed by [CONTACT_752854]. If a subject 
experiences the onset of an SAE  assessed by [CONTACT_752855] a period of [ADDRESS_1030742] awal, the Investigator will 
follow the procedures defined in Section 10 and Section 11 for assessing, documenting, and 
reporting these events. 
10.1.2 Assessment of Intensity 
The term “severe” is used to desc ribe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate or severe); the even t itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical significance 
(such as a severe headache). Thi s is not the same as “serious,”  which is based on subject/event 
outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations.

Mild: Causes transient or m ild discomfort; no limitation of usu al activities; no 
medical intervention required. 
Moderate: Causes mild to moderate  limitation in activity; some limitation of usual 
activities; no or minimal medical  intervention or therapy is required. 
Severe: Causes marked limitation in activity; some assistance is usuall y required; 
medical intervention or therapy is required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277717].   
Adverse events with changes in s everity should be documented as  separate events. 
 
10.1.3 Assessment of Causality 
The Investigator or a medicall y qualified sub-Investigator, tra ined on this study protocol and 
listed on the delegation of authority log, is responsible for determining the AE relationship to 
study assessments and/or study conduct. 
The following categories will be  used to define the relationship of an AE to study 
assessments/conduct: 
Not Related: Data are available to identify a clear alternative  cause for the AE other than 
assessments/conduct. 
Related: The cause of the AE is related to assessments/conduct,  and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_39785] f actors (e.g., the subject’s clin ical state, 
concomitant therapy, and/or  other interventions). 
 A “reasonable possibility” is m eant to convey that there are fa cts/evidence or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship, rat her than that a relationship cannot be ruled out. The Investigator 
will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural 
history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors and the temporal relationship of the event to study assessments will be consider ed and investigated. The 
Investigator will also consult Product Information in the deter mination of his/her assessment. For 
each AE/SAE reported, the Investigator must document in the med ical notes that he or she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the Inves tigator has minimal 
information to include in the in itial report to Indivior or designated representative. However, it is 
imperative that the Investigator always make an assessment of c ausality for every event prior to 
the initial transmission of the S AE data to Indivior or designa ted representative.  The Investigator 
may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up i nformation and amend the SAE 
data collection tool accordingly. The causality assessment is o ne of the criteria used when 
determining regulatory reporting requirements.

 11 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator or designee is  responsible for identifying, do cumenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an SAE. 
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
 death; 
 life-threatening; 
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005]; 
 persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect  in the offspring of a subject who underwent study procedures 
in the current study; 
 other: Important medical events that may not result in death, b e life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are: 
o intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm 
o blood dyscrasias or convulsions t hat do not result in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752843] “life-threat ening” if the subject was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that  if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For  example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic 
failure would not be considered life-threatening even though he patitis can be fatal. 
AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752844] d be considered SAEs. Hospit alization for elective surgery or 
routine clinical proce dures that are not the result of AE (e.g. , elective surgery f or a pre-existing 
condition that has not worsened ) should not be considered AEs o r SAEs. If anything untoward is 
reported during the procedure, tha t occurrence must be reported as an AE (either “serious” or 
“non-serious”) according to the usual criteria. In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_752845] (usually involving at least 
an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the  physician's office or other ou tpatient setting. Complications that 
occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_232160]. If a complication prolong s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5185], the e vent is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.

 An AE is incapacitating or disab ling if the experience results in a substantial and/or permanent 
disruption of the subject's ab ility to carry out normal life fu nctions.  
11.[ADDRESS_1030743] udy assessments and/or study conduct will be collected using the 
Safety Information Collection Form..  
When an SAE occurs, it is the res ponsibility of the Investigato r to review all documentation 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory and diagnostic repor ts) pertaining t o the event. The 
Investigator will then record all relevant information regardin g an SAE on the appropriate 
form(s). The Investigator should not send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s m edical records to I ndivior in lieu 
of completion of the Safety Information Collection Form. Howeve r, there may be cases where 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_329546]. In this instance, 
all subject identifiers, with the exception of subject number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_752846]. 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the e vent based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis  will be documented as an AE or 
SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. 
11.2 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
11.2.1 Investigator Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
Once the Investigator determine s that an event meets the protoc ol definition of an SAE, the SAE 
will be reported to Indivior (or  designated representative) by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) 
within [ADDRESS_1030744] being a ware of the event by [CONTACT_752856](s) and the   Safety Information Collection F orm. Any follow-up information on a 
previously reported SAE will also be reported to Indivior withi n 24 hours by [CONTACT_752857](s) or Safety I nformation Collection Form. 
Where additional information is  needed or expected, the Investi gator will not wait to receive all 
information before reporting the e vent to Indivior. The Investi gator must provide an assessment 
of causality at the time of the i nitial report as described in Section 10.1.3 of the protocol.

 13 DATA MANAGEMENT 
13.1 Data Collection and Management 
Data will be entered into the eCRF and will be combined with ot her data captured centrally 
outside of the eCRF into a validat ed system. Clinical data will be managed in accordance with 
the data management plan to ensure that the integrity of the da ta is maintained. Adverse events, 
medical history and indication for  concomitant medications will  be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activ ities (MedDRA). Concomitant medi cations will be coded using 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. The eCRFs (including queries and 
audit trails) will be retained by [CONTACT_752859]. An electronic copy of the eCRF will be sent to the 
Investigator to maintain for the ir records. Per Indivior standa rds and procedures, subject 
identifiers will not be coll ected or transmitted to Indivior. D ata collection will be completed 
according to the study plans.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_1030746]’s record collected during the 
study.  
Study data are not to be gathered di rectly onto the eCRF but mu st be gathered onto primary 
source documents at the clinical  site. Completion of source doc uments will precede the 
completion of the eCRF. Source docum ents may be electronic, hard copy, or a combination of 
both and are defined as the result s of original observations an d activities of a clinical 
investigation. Source documents will include, but are not limit ed to, progress notes, electronic 
data, Screening logs, and recorded d ata from automated instrume nts. All source documents 
pertaining to this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_752860].

deviation, median, minimum, and maxi mum. Categorical variables will be reported as frequency 
counts (including number missing) and the percentage of subject s in corresponding categories. 
Individual subject d ata will be present ed by [CONTACT_277756]. Data listings  will include all 
data collected from the initi al Screening visit to the end of the study for all subjects enroled. A 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared after the prot ocol is approved and before 
database lock occurs. The SAP w ill provide further details rega rding analysis. Additional 
unplanned analyses may be required after all planned analyses h ave been completed. Any 
deviations from the analyses described below will be outlined i n the SAP. Any unplanned 
analyses will be clearly i dentified in the CSR. 
No formal statistical testing (p- values, confiden ce intervals) will be computed due to small 
sample size.  Part A 
Data listings for individual plas ma and urine results will be p rovided once all subjects have 
completed Part A. Individual plas ma/urine conce ntration data wi ll be plotted over time using 
time elapsed from the last SUBLOCADE dose. Part B  
As for Part A, individual data  listings for plasma and urine re sults and graphical representation of 
the data will be provided. 
14.2 Sample Size 
The sample size is based on pr actical considerations and no sta tistical power is calculated. 
Approximately 60 subjects will be e nroled in Part A. This numbe r of subjects is expected to 
provide a reasonable descrip tion of the distribution of plasma and urine concentration data in the 
overall population over the timefra me investigated (i.e., [ADDRESS_1030748] 
SUBLOCADE injection), given the low-moderate interindividual va riability (~30%) observed 
for SUBLOCADE PK in previous st udies. The number of subjects to  be enroled in Part A is also 
limited by [CONTACT_752861] 2  SC injections of SUBLOCADE in 
Phase III studies and who remai n in the time window targeted fo r enrolment in the current study.  
A maximum of 30 Part A subjects will proceed to Part B; it is a nticipated that approximately 
30 subjects will be sufficient to address the objectives for Part B. The final number of subjects 
will depend on results from qua ntitative buprenorphine UDS in Part A. Data will be reviewed on 
an ongoing basis.

 14.3 Analysis Populations 
All subjects enroled in Part A wi ll be included in the Full Ana lysis Set – Part A and all subjects 
enroled in Part B will be incl uded in the Full Analysis Set – P art B. The Full Analysis Set 
consists of all subjects who rece ived at least 2 SC doses of SUBLOCADE in Study 
RB-US-13-0003 or both Studies RB-US-13-0003 and INDV-6000-301 a nd was enroled in the 
current study. This will be the  analysis population for all ana lyses.   
14.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline chara cteristics, (e.g., sex, race, age , weight and height) will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_2070]. Qualitative variables, (e.g., sex and race) will be summarised using frequencies; quantitative variab les, (e.g., age, weight and height) 
will be summarised using descriptive st atistics. 
14.5 
Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data 
A descriptive representation of PK data (plasma, urine) over time will be provided. Individual plasma/ urine concentration data  will be plotted over time usin g the time elapsed from the last 
SUBLOCADE dose. Concentratio ns of buprenorphine and norbuprenor phine in urine (from 
quantitative UDS or free drug conc entration assessments) will b e presented with and without 
correction by [CONTACT_752862] i n urine. The purpose of  the correction by [CONTACT_752863]. 
Norbuprenorphine-to-bu prenorphine ratios wi ll be calculated fro m plasma drug concentrations, 
free drug concentrations in urine, and quantitative UDS results  from the diagnostic laboratory. 
Relationships between plasma and urine drug concentrations will  also be explored. Plots will be 
constructed to assess the consis tency of those ratios over time .  
Furthermore, the sparse plasma  samples collected during Parts A  and B will be used to refine the 
existing population PK model for SUBLOCADE developed from the c ombined analysis of the 
multiple-ascending-dose study ( RB-US-12-0005) and the 2 Phase I II studies (RB-US-13-0001 
and RB-US-13-0003) (modelling r eport, IND-6000-M05). The purpose is to characterise the 
long-term decrease in buprenorphine plasma concentration follow ing discontinuation of 
SUBLOCADE treatment. Buprenorphin e plasma concentrations below the lower limit of 
quantification will be handled usi ng appropriate likelihood-based methodology. The final model 
will be used to derive populati on predictions for the 2 dosing regimens of SUBLOCADE and 
derive endpoints such as the di stribution of times for which bu prenorphine plasma concentrations 
are above the lower lim it of quantification.   
Further details regarding descri ptive analyses  of PK data and p opulation PK modelling will be 
provided in the SAP.

The protocol, informed consen t form(s) (ICF) and any other writ ten information and/or materials 
to be provided to subjects will be reviewed by [CONTACT_10981] a nd appropriately constituted IRB. 
If required by [CONTACT_427] , the protocol should be re-approved by [CONTACT_44251]. The 
IRB must be constituted and operate in accordance with the prin ciples and requirements of 
ICH/GCP.  
15.3 Informed Consent 
The Investigator or a person de signated by [CONTACT_737] (if  allowed by [CONTACT_427]) is to 
obtain written informed consent from each subject prior to entering the study. All written 
informed consent documents are required to have been reviewed and received a favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval from an IRB prior to presenting them to a potential participant.  
Any changes to the ICF must be  reviewed by [CONTACT_277762]. 
The written informed consent process will include the review of  oral and written information 
regarding the purpose, methods, a nticipated duration and risks involved in study participation. 
The Investigator is to ensure that each subject is given the op portunity to ask questions and 
allowed time to consider the information provided. The Investig ator or a person designated by 
[CONTACT_752864], and that consent 
can be withdrawn at any time a nd without reason.  Subjects will  receive a signed and dated copy 
of the signed ICF before any study-specific procedures are conducted.   In the event that new safety information emerges that represent s a significant change in the 
risk/benefit assessment, the signed ICF should be updated accor dingly. All subjects should be 
informed of the new informati on, provide their consent to continue in the study, and be provided 
with a signed and dated copy of the revised signed ICF. If the subject is unable to rea d, an impartial witness must be present during the entire informed 
consent discussion. After the s ubject has provided oral consent  for the subject to participate in 
the study, the witness’ signature [CONTACT_752872].

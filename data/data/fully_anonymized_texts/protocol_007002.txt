A Randomized Controlled Study Comparing a DPP4 Inhibitor (Linagliptin) and Basal 
Insulin (Glargine) in Long- Term Care Residents with Type 2 Diabetes  
I. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
Diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in the elderly, afflicting >25% of older adults aged 65- 75 
years and 40% of adults >[ADDRESS_347668] prevalence of any age group 3 . Between 2001 
and 2010, the percentage of people with diabetes increased by 127% (9.1% to 20.7%) for tho se 
aged 65–74 years, and 126% (8.9% to 20.1%) for those aged 75 years and older 3. The 
prevalence of diabetes in long -term care facilities (LTC) has been reported between 15% and 
32% 4-7. Elderly patients with diabetes have increased risk of complications compared to 
nondiabetic subjects 8-11.  Several observational studies have reported benefits of improved 
glucose control on the rate of metabolic complications and quality of life in elderly patients with 
diabetes 8-10; however, no randomized clinical trials have determined best treatment strategies 
(insulin vs. oral agents) or what are the benefits of glucose control in clinical outcome and 
resource utilization in LTC residents.  
 In a recent observational study in LTC facilities 
12 we reported i) a diabetes prevalence of 32.5% 
with most pat ients treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) alone or in combination with sliding 
scale regular insulin, ii) high frequency (44%) of hypoglycemic events, and iii) residents with hypoglycemia have a longer length of stay, emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788], and higher 
mortality compared to those without hypoglycemia (see preliminary results). In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_284713], we randomized 100 patients with diabetes to receive low -dose basal 
(glargine) insulin  and rapid- acting insulin before meals or to continue OADs (metformin and/or 
sulfonylurea) plus regular insulin before meals for BG > 200 mg/dl. We observed similar improvement in HbA1c  at 3 and 6 months and in the frequency of hypoglycemia (basal 28% vs. 
control 31%; please see preliminary results). The results of our preliminary studies indicate the need for safe and effective protocols to achieve glucose control with a low rate of hypoglycemia. 
We propose two strategies that have been shown to improve glucose control with low rates  of 
hypoglycemia in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], which could be easily implemented in LTC facilities 
13,14.  The ‘basal 
plus’ approach with a daily dose of glargine plus correction doses of rapid- acting insulin was 
shown to be as effective as basal bolus regimen in improving glucose control in general medicine 
and surgery patients with type 2 di abetes  (T2D) 13. The  sitagliptin inpatient trial [ADDRESS_347669] 
determined the safety and efficacy of basal insulin (standard of care) and DPP4 inhibitors in LTC 
facilities. Accordingly, we propose a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing treatment 
with a DPP4 inhibitor (linagliptin) to a basal plus (glargine) regimen (± metformin for both 
treatments)  in LTC residents with T2D . 
 
Specific Aim and Hypothesis:  
Aim 1.  To determine whether glycemic control, as measured by [CONTACT_284742],  
HbA1c and frequency of hypoglycemia, is different between treatment with l inagliptin 
(Tradjenta®) and basal insulin in LTC residents with T2D.  Patients with poorly controlled 
diabetes (HbA1c >7.5%) will be randomized to a 6- month intervention with linagliptin or glargine 
insulin (± metformin for both treatments) .   
Hypothesis:   Treatment with linagliptin, a once daily DPP4- inhibitor, will result  in similar 
improvement in glucose control but in a lower rate of hypoglycemia than insulin treatment in LTC 
residents with T2D.  
Aim 2.  To determine differences in clinical outcome, resource utilization, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284714] h T2D treated with l inagliptin and basal 
plus insulin .  We will compare differences in complications (infectious and non- infectious, 
neurological and cardiovascular events), emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284715] 6 months of i ntervention.  
Hypothesis:   Treatment with linagliptin will result in similar number of complications and resource 
utilization compared to insulin treatment in LTC residents with T2D diabetes.  
II. BACKGROUND AND CURRENT STATUS OF WORK IN THE FIELD.  
Prevalence of diabetes in the elderly and long- term care facilities.   The prevalence of 
diabetes mellitus increases with age, and it is estimated that more than 20% of older adults aged 
65-75 years and 40% of adults >80years of age have diabetes 
1,2.  The prevalence of diabetes in 
the elderly is expected to increase due to longer life expectancy and improve care of the population 
2,15. The estimated prevalence of diabetes in LTC facilities is reported to be ~ 15% to 
32% 4, and in parallel to the increasing geriatric population, the number of LT C facilities is 
expected to rise 15.  
Management of diabetes in the elderly and long- term care facilities.  The goals of diabetes 
care in older adults, as in younger persons, include control of hyperglycemia and its symptoms, prevention and treatment of macrovascular and microvascular complications, and maintenance 
or improvement of general health status. Studies in adult patients with diabetes have clearly shown that improvement in glucose control results in reduction in long -term microvascular 
complications and in significant cost savings 
9,10,16; however, there are no prospective studies to 
determine the impact of improving glucose control on clinical outcome and health care cost in the 
elderly and LTC population. The management of diabetes in LTC residents is similar to that recommended  for ambulatory patients with diabetes 
17,18; however, several factors complicate the 
management of hyperglycemia in this population 19. Elderly people tend to have higher rates of 
comorbidities associated with aging such as premature death, functional disability, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular events, depression, cognitive impairment, urinary 
incontinence, falls, and pain.   In addition,  elderly patients with diabetes often experience changes 
in their nutritional intake and organ dysfunction, which increase the risk of complications and 
hypoglycemia 
16,19- 21. Thus, benefits of improving glucos e control must be balanced against the 
significant risks of side effects and hypoglycemia.  
Current guidelines and position statements on diabetes management in LTC setting 11,22- [ADDRESS_347670] significant life expectancy should receive diabetes care with goals similar to those developed for younger adults 
23.  In these subjects, a 
HbA1c level <7.0 %, a fasting glucose between 90- 130 mg/dl, and a random glucose <180 mg/dl 
is recommended. Less intensive goals are recommended for patients with advanced diabetes 
complications, life -limiting comorbid illness, or substantial cognitive or functional impairment.  
Similarly, the American Geriatric Society recommends a goal HbA1c ≤7.5% in healthy adults with 
intact cognitive and functional status; however, a higher HbA1c, ranging from 8% to 8.5% is more appropriate in the presence of comorbidities, frailty, impaired cognitive and functional status and 
increased risk of hypoglycemia 
11,24.  The European Diabetes Working Party for Older People 
guidelines recommend a target HbA1c of 7- 7.5% for patients wit hout major co- morbidities while 
a higher target of 7.6- 8.5% is proposed for frail patients with high risk of hypoglycemia 22,25. More 
recently, the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics, the European Diabetes 
Working Party for Older People, and the International Task Force of Experts in Diabetes 
recommended an HbA1c target of 7% –7.5% but emphasized the need to individualize glucose 
goals based on comorbidities, cognitive and functional status  22.  All of these guidelines highlight 
the importance of avoiding hypoglycemia, as it has been associated with increased risk of complications and mortality in patients with diabetes 
12,[ADDRESS_347671] addressed the safety and efficacy of DPP4 inhibitors in elderly patients 35,36.  DPP4 -
inhibitors; however, are promising agents in the elderly because they stimulate insulin secretion 
in a glucose- dependent fashion, thus not causing hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy or in 
combination with metformin therapy 37-39. In addition, they have a low rate of side effects and can 
lower cardiovascular risks by [CONTACT_284743], and by [CONTACT_284744] 39-41.  Among FDA approved DPP4 inhibitors, linagliptin has unique PK and 
PD profile in the treatment of elderly LTC residents including a rapid -onset of action and efficacy 
in reducing fasting and postprandial glucose levels with low risk of hypoglycemia 42-44.  Linagliptin 
is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_89385], with a maximum plasma concentration occurring 
after ~ 90 minutes, a long terminal half -life (>100 hours), and a short accumulation half -life of ~ 
10 hours. It is eliminated primarily in feces, with only around 5% of the oral therapeutic dose excreted in the urine 
45,46. There are no clinically relevant alterations in linagliptin 
pharmacokinetics resulting from renal impairment or hepatic impairment 46-48.  
Insulin therapy is widely recommended for diabetes management in LTC resident s 49,50.  Clinical 
guidelines recommend initiating insulin when lifestyle modifications and oral agents fail or are 
contraindicated, and when random blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL 49,50. These practice 
guidelin es favor the use of physiologic (basal and nutritional -correction dose) insulin regimens 
over sliding scale regular insulin 51-53.  Basal insulin (glargine, detemir, NPH) is used alone or in 
combination with rapid- acting prandial analogs (lispro, aspart, gluli sine) or regular insulin. The 
use of basal bolus insulin has been shown to improve glycemic control 54-56 and to reduce 
complications in general medicine and surgery patients in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 56; however, the use of a 
basal bolus approach is difficult to implement during periods of poor oral intake or in elderly LTC patients at risk of hypoglycemia.  In our preliminary studies in LTC facilities, treatment with basal 
bolus improved glucose control but was associated with ~30% risk of hypoglycemia (see 
preliminary results). New insulin regimens such as basal plus approach 
[ADDRESS_347672] LTC residents are treated with OADs alone or in combination with regular sliding scale or basal bolus insulin.  More than 30% of LTC patients 
with diabetes experienced hypoglycemia during a 6- month period, and those with hypoglycemia 
had more emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788], and higher mortality compared to 
residents without hypoglycemia.  Thus, clinical trials aiming for improved glucose control and 
low rate of hypoglycemia are needed in this vulnerable population. This proposal aims to test 
the safety and efficacy of two novel treatment approaches in LTC facilities – the basal plus 
insulin regimen and DPP4 inhibitors. Both of these regimens were recently reported to be 
effective in improving glucose control with low rate of hypoglycemia in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] 13,[ADDRESS_347673] of care for elderly LTC residents with type 2 diabetes.  
III. PRELIMINARY RESULTS:  
Basal Bolus insulin trials in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284716].   We have reported several 
prospective, randomized multi -center trials that show that treatment with basal or basal plus 
prandial insulin regimens are superior to sliding scale alone for the treatment of general medicine 
and surgery patients with T2D 10,54. In addition, the Rabbit Surgery trial 57, reported similar 
improvement in glucose control and lower rate of a composite of complications including wound 
infection, pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], renal fai lure, and bacteremia in general surgery patients.  
In these studies, the rate of hypoglycemia with the use of basal bolus approach in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284717] 3% and 32% 
54-56.     
Basal Plus approach in general patients with T2D.   The 
recently reported Basal Plus trial 58 recruited 375 patients with 
T2D treated with diet, oral antidiabetic agents or low -dose 
insulin (≤ 0.4 unit/kg/day)  to receive a ‘Basal Bolus’ regimen 
with glargine once daily and glulisine before meals, a ‘Basal 
Plus’ regimen with glargine once daily and supplemental 
doses of glulisine, and sliding scale regular insulin (SSI).  This 
trial reported that treatment with basal plus corrections 
resulted in similar improvement in glycemic control and in the 
frequency of hypoglycemia compared to a standard basal 
bolus regimen. In addition, treatment with basal bolus and 
basal plus resulted in less treatment failures than trea tment 
with SSI. A BG <70 mg/dL occurred in 16% of patients in basal bolus and 12% in basal.  We concluded that the use of a basal plus regimen is an effective alternative to basal bolus 
in general patients with T2D.  
Sitagliptin Inpatient Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 
14.  In a two- center open -
label randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_284718] T2D (Figure 3).  In this 
study, 90 patients with a BG between 140- 400 mg/dl treated 
with diet, OAD or low -dose insulin (≤ 0.4 U/kg/day) were 
randomized to sitagliptin once daily (n=30), sitagliptin and basal insulin (n=30) and to a basal bolus (n=30) regimen. 
Treatment with sitagliptin alone or in combination to glargine 
resulted in similar glycemic control compared to basal bolus. 
There were no differences in hypogly cemia, frequency of 
treatment failures, length of stay or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77085]. 
These results indicate that treatment with a DPP -[ADDRESS_347674] analysis of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284719] (SSI) ($23.8±11 vs. $29.4±19 K USD, p=0.03). Subgroup analysis on each complication revealed that the total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284720] 2 times higher than those without them ($45.5±33 vs. $26±15 K USD, p=0.02), 
and that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284721] 3 times higher than those 
without complications ($71.5±41 vs. $26±14 K USD, p=0.001, and $67.5±47 vs. $26±14 K USD, 
Fig 2- Sitagliptin Inpatient trial  
p= NS 

p=0.006 respectively). These results indicate that improvement of BG control reduces hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284722], perioperative complications and resource utilization, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284723].  
Diabetes and Clinical Outcome in Long-term Care Residents 12. This observational study 
analyzed the quality of diabetes care, glycemic control, and clinical outcome in 1,409 subjects 
admitted to 3 community LTC facilities in Atlanta.  The prevalence of diabetes was 34.2%. On admission, patients with diabetes were either on no pharmacological agents (10%) or were 
treated with,  sliding scale regular insulin (SSI, 25%), OADs (5%), insulin (34%), or with 
combination of OADs and insulin (26%). Patients with diabetes had higher number of complications (p<0.001) and required more emergency room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788] (p=0.013).  
A Co x proportional hazards model revealed that a history of diabetes is associated with a higher 
risk of mortality (HR: 1.44, p=0.027).  A total of 42% of patients had ≥ 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_284724] <70 
mg/dl and 7% had a BG <40 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia was reported in 45% on O ADs (mostly 
sulfonylurea plus SSI), 53% on glargine, 67% on NPH or premixed insulin, 20% patients on SSI alone. Patients with hypoglycemia had a longer length of stay (p<0.001), higher emergency 
room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788] (44% vs. 30%; p= 0.004) and higher  mortality (18% vs. 10%, 
p=0.015).  These results indicate that diabetes is common in LTC and is associated with higher resource utilization and complications, and that hypoglycemia is associated with increased rates of emergency room care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], length of stay, and mortality 
12.  
Randomized Controlled Pi[INVESTIGATOR_284725] -Term Care Residents.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], prospective, RCT randomized patients from 
2 LTC university -affiliated facilities with A1C >7.5%, treated with diet and/or with stable dose of 
OADs to glargine (starting at 0.1 U/kg/day) plus correction doses of glulisine before meals for BG 
> 200 mg/dl, n=46) or to continue OAD and sliding scale insulin before meals (n=54) for 26 weeks. 
Primary  endpoints were differences in mean fasting and daily BG, change in A1C, and 
hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl).   There were no differences in daily glucose or with the A1C at 3 
months (149±28 vs 136±26 mg/dl and 7.5±0.7% vs 7.2±0.8%, p= NS) or at 6 months (172±19 vs 148±27 mg/dl and 6.7±0.1% vs 6.6±0.9%, p NS) or in the number of patients with hypoglycemia (basal 28% vs. control 31%, p=0.37). The results of this study suggest that patients in LTC 
facilities can achieve similar improvement in glycemic control, without differences in mean daily 
BG, hypoglycemia with basal insulin or with OADs and SSI supplements.

Summary:   These preliminary studies highlight our experience in conducting RCT and cost 
analysis studies in patients with diabetes in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284726]. Our preliminary studies 
indicate that diabetes is common in LCT residents and is associated with higher resource 
utilization, and that treatment -related hypoglycemia is associated with increased rates of 
emergency room care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and mortality.  In our cross -sectional study, we 
observed that 44% patients with diabetes had ≥ 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_284727] <70 mg/dl.  Patients with 
hypoglycemia had a longer length of stay, higher emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788], and 
higher mortality compared to those without hypoglycemia. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], basal bolus insulin 
and OAD plus sliding scale regular insulin resulted in similar in glucose control, complications and 
in ~30% rate of hypoglycemia indicating the need for effective treatment regimens with lower rates of hypoglycemia. The proposed RCT will provide clinically important and novel information on 
glucose control, clinical outcome, resource utilization and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284728] 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin and DPP4 inhibitor.   
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
Aim 1.  To determine whether glycemic control, as measured by [CONTACT_284745], 
HbA1c and frequency of hypoglycemia, is different between treatment with l inagliptin 
(Tradjenta®) and basal insulin in LTC residents with T2D.   
IV.a. Rationale.  Diabetes affects one -third of elderly patients in LTC facilities 4-7. Management 
of hyperglycemia in LTC residents is challenging because of the high prevalence of comorbidities, 
organ dysfunction, and changes in nutritional intake that could increase the risk of hypoglycemia 
19.  Most patients in LTC facilities are managed with OADs alone or in combination with insulin 
with a reported ~30% incidence of hypoglycemia 49,50. LTC r esidents with hypoglycemia require 
more emergency room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788], as well as higher mortality compared to those without hypoglycemia 
12. Our recent ‘basal plus’ approach with a daily dose of glargine plus 
correction doses with rapid- acting insulin is as effective as basal bolus regimen in patients with 
T2D, with low rates of hypoglycemia 13. Similarly, the  recent Sitagliptin Inpati ent Trial 14, reported 
that treatment with sitagliptin alone or in combination with low -dose glargine result in similar 
glucose control compared to basal bolus regimen in medicine and surgery patients. The efficacy of basal plus regimen and DPP4 inhibitors in lowering blood glucose with a low -risk of 
hypoglycemia make these treatment ideal for the management of elderly; however, no clinical studies have determined their efficacy and safety in LTC facilities. Accordingly, we propose a 
prospective randomized controlled study to test the efficacy and safety of a DPP4 inhibitor and 
basal insulin for the management of LTC residents with type 2 diabetes.  
 
IV.b. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
A total of 150 male or female LTC residents with type 2 diabetes with an 
fasting or random BG >/= 
180 mg/dL and/or an  A1c > 7.5% while receiving treatment with diet (no pharmacological therapy), 
OADs (metformin, secretagogues, thiazolidinediones), low dose insulin of 0.1U/kg/day or sliding 
scale regular insulin will be randomized to receive linagliptin or glargine insulin therapy.  
This study will be performed at Crestview, a community LTC institution affiliated with Grady Health 
System; Budd Terrace on the Wesley Woods campus of Emory University; and the Community 
Living Center at the Atlanta VA Medical Center, Atlanta.  
 
IV.c. Primary and Secondary Research Outcomes:  
The primary endpoint  of the study is change in mean BG  over a 6 -month treatment period between 
treatment with basal plus insulin regimen and aDDP4 inhibitor in LTC residents with poorly 
controlled diabetes.    
Secondary outcomes  include differences between treatment groups in any of the following 
measur es:  
1. Percentage of HbA1c ≤ 7.5% at 3 or 6 month independent  of the occurrence of hypoglycemia. 
2. Occurrence rate and total number of hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dl) and severe 
hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dl).  
3. Total daily dose of insulin, metformin and linagliptin.  
4. Change in hemoglobin A1c over a 6 -month treatment period  
5. Changes in cognitive function assessed by [CONTACT_170885] -mental examination.  
6. Prevalence of acute complications (urinary tract infections, pneumonia), bedsores, diabetic 
foot infection.  
7. Need for emergency room  visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284729]. 
8. Cardiac complications are defined as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure.  
9. Acute renal failure defined as a clinical diagnosis of acute renal failure with documented new -
onset abnormal renal function (increment > 0.5 mg/dL from baseline).

dose by 20% every 3 days  
• Mean fasting and pre -meal BG between <100 mg/dl: decrease glargine dose by 10% 
every day  
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 20%.   
• If a patient develops hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dL), decrease glargine dose by 30- 40%.   
 
 
• Blood glucose monitoring.   Blood glucose will be measured before each meal (or every 6 
hours if a patient is not eating) using a glucose meter.  In addition, blood glucose will be 
measured at any time if a patient experiences symp toms of hypoglycemia or if requested by 
[CONTACT_1963].   
 
 
 
IV.f. Investigational drugs.  
1. Linagliptin (Tradjenta®) 5 mg tablets for oral administration. Linagliptin is not a formulary drug 
at Grady Health System and VAMC and will be provided by [CONTACT_173622], Inc (see letter of support, page 76)  
2. Glargine insulin:  U-100/mL, provided in 10 mL vials. Glargine (Lantus®) is available in all 
institutions.  
 
IV.g. Withdrawal Criteria  
1. The subject may withdraw at any time during the study by [CONTACT_284746].  
2. The subject may be withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion due to a safety concern or if 
judged non- compliant with trial procedures or for contravention to the inclusion and/or 
exclusion criteria.  
3. Subject diagnosed with acute pancreatitis by [CONTACT_284747]/or radiographic criteria.  
4. Patients with severe hyperglycemia defined as 3 consecutive BG levels > 280 mg/dl or 2 
consecutive days with an average BG > 280 mg/dL will be considered as failure and discontinued 
from the study. Patients receiving linagliptin therapy will be switched to basal plus insulin and those 
on basal insulin will be switched to basal bolus insulin regimen.   
 
IV.h. Subject Replacement  
There will be no replacement of subjects in this trial.  
 
IV.i. During follow up we will collect the following information  
1. Glycem ic control:  
a. Mean daily fasting and premeal blood glucose levels.  
b. HbA1c at baseline, 3 and 6 months of discharge  
c. Number of hypoglycemic events  
2. Diabetes treatment:  
a. Number of patients receiving supplements and dosage as well as metformin 
therapy.  
b. Protocol adherence by [CONTACT_284748]  
3. Clinical Outcome (see Aim 2): 
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], emergency room visits, infectious and non- infectious 
complications  
 
V. Aim 2.  To determine differences in clinical outcome and resource utilization between 
treatment with l inagliptin and basal insulin in LTC residents with T2D.   
Rationale. Benefits of improved glucose control on clinical outcomes and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284730]. This study will 
compare differences in complications (infections and non -infection, neurological and 
cardiovascular ), resource utilization and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284731] . We expect that patients treated with basal insulin may have lower daily glucose 
and HbA1c levels, but higher number of hypoglycemic events.  It is not clear if the lower glucose 
and HbA1c levels will reduce complications, resource utilization and costs compared to patients 
treated with DPP4 inhibitors who may experience less glucose control but lower hypoglycemic 
events.   
V.a.  Data collection and data entry.  Baseline and daily information will be entered by [CONTACT_284749] (RedCap) provided 
by [CONTACT_3433] e Emory Research Information Technology Department.  Baseline data will include 
demographics/history form (subject gender, age, ethnicity, type of treatment and comorbid 
conditions, body weight, BMI, laboratory results.  Daily information will be collected on treatment, 
nutrition, blood glucose and laboratory values, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284732] (hypoglycemia).  
 
V.b.  Resource utilization.   We will prospectively collect information on emergency room visits 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], laboratory, pharmacy, consultation services and radiology services, as well 
as presence of complications including pneumonia, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, 
acute renal failure, wound infections and bedsores, cerebrovascular events, and other 
complications.  
 
V.c.  Financial assessment .  The Analytic Information Warehouse (AIW) infrastructure program 
will be utilized to support extraction, mappi[INVESTIGATOR_284733].  The AIW infrastructure is designed to 
allow analysts to transform heterogeneous sets of variables into systematically defined core set of data elements. Data will be collected prospectively and also extracted for each patient using 
ICD-[ADDRESS_347675] Report publish by [CONTACT_284750] (CMS) 
(https://wwws.gov/CostReports/02 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284734].asp
).  Based on CMS review of Emory 
Long Term Care facilit ies [ADDRESS_347676] to charge ratio will be 0.421 for 
patients admitted in 2013. Data set will be queried to allow analysis of complications, laboratory, 
pharmacy, consultation services and radiology costs.   
 
V.d.  Assessment and Monitoring of Nosocomial Infections.   Nosocomial infections will be 
diagnosed based on standardized CDC criteria 59.  New infections will not be diagnosed until 48 
hr after study initiation to minimize the chance that the infection was actually present prior to study 
initiation.  
 
V.e.  Monitoring of renal function.  Acute renal failure is defined as an increment > 0.5 mg/dl  
from baseline. 
 
V.f.  Cerebrovascular accident.   Defined as neurologic deficit persisting >  72 hr, transient 
ischemic attack, deficit resolving within 24 hours, or deficit lasting > 24 - < 72 h (reversible 
ischemic neurologic deficit).  
 
V.g.  Major Cardiovascular Events (MACE).   All outcome data will be defined per standard 
American College of C ardiology –American Heart Association definitions:  
• Acute myocardial infarction: (1) inc rease in troponin and creatine kinase (MB) markers with at 
least one of the following: (a) ischemic symptoms, (b) development of pathologic Q waves on 
EKG, (c) electrocardiographic changes indicative of ischemia (ST- segment elevation or 
depression), or (d) coronary artery intervention (e.g., coronary angioplasty) 60.   
• Congestive heart failure on chest radiograph and with appropriate clinical symptoms/signs 60. 
• Cardiac arrhythmias:  malignant arrhythmia [asystole, ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation] 60 
.

or 1 amp of glucagon IM or SC  
• Check finger stick BG q 15 minutes and repeat above treatment until BG > 100 mg/dL.  
o If BG < 70 mg/dL, call MD and repeat hypoglycemia orders (above) 
VIII. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
VIII.a.  Sample Size and Power Calculations:  This study is randomized, open- label controlled 
trial. The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control measured change determined by [CONTACT_284752]1c at 3 and 6 months of intervention.  The median 
stay at all facilities was 48.9±[ADDRESS_347679] power to determine a 
statistical change in glycated hemoglobin at 6 months. The primary endpoint of the study was modified to evaluate the difference between treatment with basal insulin and linagliptin on 
glycemic control determined by [CONTACT_284753], as 
previously reported (
62). Main secondary endpoints included differences in the frequency of 
hypoglycemia, fasting glucose, HbA1c at 3 and 6 months of intervention, complications, emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. We made the comparisons using non- parametric 
Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests (or Fisher’s exact test) for discrete variables. We summarize demographics, baseline clinical characteristics, and clinical outcomes by [CONTACT_273442]. Data is presented as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables and 
present count (percentage) for categorical variables. Glycemic variability was calculated by [CONTACT_157516] (SD) of glucose values during entire study and by [CONTACT_284754] (Δ) 
daily range of blood glucose (daily max – daily mini- mum)(20, 24).The data were presented as 
mean (SD) for continuous variables and count (percentage) for discrete variables unless specified otherwise. We performed statistical analyses with SAS version 9.3. 
VIII.b. Analysis of Primary Endpoint:   
To compare differences between treatment groups on glycemic control determined by [CONTACT_284755]. We defined non -inferiority for the primary endpoint of mean blood 
glucose as a difference < 18 mg/dl (1 mmol/L) with linagliptin versus basal insulin. A blood glucose difference of such a magnitude has been reported as non- clinically significant in the hosp ital 
setting, and is smaller than significant treatment effects in other superiority trials [
58,63,64] Based 
on our preliminary data in LTC [62, we assumed a standard deviation of 40 mg/dl change is 
bounded above by 1%. With a one- sided two- sample t -test, alpha=0.05, with Bonferroni correction  
applied to adjust for multiple comparisons across different days on therapy, and after adjusting for 10– 15% attrition, a total of 64 patients were required for both the linagliptin and the basal group 
to ensure 80% power to reject the non - inferiority hyp othesis. This leads to a final total sample 
size estimate of 140 participants.  
VIII.c. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  Secondary endpoints include outcomes on 
hypoglycemia, complications,  HbA1c,  resource utilization and costs. For hypoglycemia outcomes, 
we will first conduct nonparametric comparisons of the rate of hypoglycemia based on a two- sided 
Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test in the presence of low incidence rates), followed by [CONTACT_284756]- Mantel -Haenszel test, which adjusts for the potential center effect. Univariate Poisson 
regression (or Negative Binomial regression) will be performed to assess whether there is any 
difference in the number of hypoglycemia events between the two treatment groups. We will 
further conduct multivariate Logistic regression, Poisson regression (or negative binomial 
regression) to estimate the difference in the rate and frequency of hypoglycemia while adjusting 
for relevant covariates. Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted 
to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model 
checking procedures, such as deviance residual plot and Hosmer -Lemeshow test, will be applied 
to examine the fit of the developed models.  
 
The primary cost outcome is the overall resource utilization converted to cost figures based on  
cost- to-charge ratio. We will first compare the overall cost between groups using two- sample t -
tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon tests. We will perform multivariate linear regression to evaluate 
the group difference while accounting other possible confounders. To address the potential 
skewness of cost distribution, we may adopt Log or other appropriate transformations. We will 
also consider multivariate median regression, which is expected to be more robust in the 
presence of outliers compared to linear regression. Model selection and model checking will be performed in multivariate analyses.  
For other secondary endpoints such as  itemized resources utilization, complications, need for 
emergency room and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284735], and the approach proposed for the hypoglycemia outcome  to analyze other discrete secondary outcomes.   A p-value less than 0.05 
will be considered significant. Statistical analysis will be performed using the SAS (version 9.2; 
SAS Institute, Cary, NC).   
 IX. Potential  Risks to the Subject:  
Hypoglycemia.  Hypog lycemia is defined as capi[INVESTIGATOR_124054]/or laboratory glucose <70 mg/dL and 
severe hypoglycemia is defined as glucose < 40 mg/dL. We expect that ~20% of subjects treated with basal insulin will experience hypoglycemia and < 5% in patients treated with linagliptin.  
Hyperglycemia.   In the Basal Plus Trial and Sitagliptin trial, 12- 18%% of patients had glucose 
readings >200 mg/dL. We expect that < 20% of BG readings in subjects treated with basal plus 
regimen or with linagliptin plus rapid- acting insulin analogs will have a glucose > 200 mg/dl. In 
this analysis, severe hyperglycemia is defined as a capi[INVESTIGATOR_124054]/or laboratory BG >300 mg/dL.   
X. Protection against Risks:   
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor capi[INVESTIGATOR_284736]- held glucose meters, b) only experienced nurses/or phlebotomist will 
draw blood samples, and c) no patients with significant liver and renal impairment will be recruited 
in this study.    
Hypoglycemia:   We expect that approximately 12% of subjects treated with basal plus and < 5% of 
linagliptin group will experience one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221].  Hypoglycemia will be treated with standard treatment protocols available at each institution.   
Hyperglycemia:   supplemental insulin will be given before meals to cover for BG >200 mg/dl. 
Patients with persistent hyperglycemia defined as 3 consecutive BG levels > 280 mg/dl or 2 
consecutive daily average >15.5 mmol/L (280 mg/dL) will be considered as fail ure and will be 
discontinued from the study. Patients receiving linagliptin will be switched to basal and those on basal 
will be switched to basal bolus regimen.   
Acute renal failure:  patients with GFR <45 ml/min will not be treated with metformin.  
XI.  Data handling and record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Data collection records with personal identifiers will be 
stored in locked file cabinets. No blood samples will be stored in this study. Access to research 
will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators,  and the IRB at Emory University.  
XII. Storage and Drug Accountability of Study Medication(s).  Linagliptin will be stored and 
dispensed by [CONTACT_284757]. Glargine insulin is standard of care and 
is available at the three participating institutions and will be dispensed by [CONTACT_284758].  
XIII. Randomization and Blinding.  This is an open label randomized controlled trial.  Patients 
will be randomized consecutively using a computer generated randomization table provided by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Limin Peng at the Emory School of Public Health.  The randomization table will be mailed to 
the research pharmacist at each institution who will be in charge of the randomization and group 
assignment.  
XIV.   Informed Consent.  .  Informed consent will be obtained before any trial related 
procedures including screening procedures . The consent form will follow the IRB guidelines of 
Emory University.  A signed copy of the consent will be provided to the participant and a copy of 
the consent will be placed in the study office.   
XV. Inclusion of women:  We anticipate that ~50% of the study subjects will be female.  
XVI. Inclusion of minorities:  Patients will not be excluded based on race or ethnic origin.  We 
anticipate that half of patients will be African Americans, 10% Hispanics, and the rest Caucasians.   
XVII. Inclusion of children:  No patients under the age of [ADDRESS_347680] or Safety Officer has been designated for this study.

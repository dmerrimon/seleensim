CONFIDENTIAL  9 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Crohn's Disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  that is serious, debilitating, and 
potentially life -threatening. The disease is termed a “ disease of the young” because it usually 
strikes children, teens, and young adults. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_177300] 15 to 25 years . Its 
inflammation can cause severe pain, diarrhea, and other intestinal problems. CD affects men and 
women equally and appears to show a familial predisposition. Approximately 20-30% of people 
with CD have a direct blood relative with some form of IBD. World-wide, an estimated 1.4 
million people suffer from CD (700,000 US) and the number of sufferers is growing at a rate of at 
least 1% each year. The disease is now considered to be the second most common chronic 
inflammatory disorder after rheumatoid arthritis. 
One of the potential causes of CD is thought to be gastrointestinal infection with Mycobacterium 
avium subspecies paratuberculosis  (MAP) and mycobacterial molecules have been shown to 
dysregulate immune signaling pathways as part of the organism’s evolved survival strategy. MAP has been difficult to isolate from CD patients and it is postulated that it asserts its pathological 
effect either as an infectious agent or by [CONTACT_177308].  
One of the hindrances to testing for MAP infection in CD patients is that MAP is a very slow  
growing mycobacterium. MAP shed their cell walls when they infect humans, a tactic that enables them to escape identification and attack by [CONTACT_177309].  
Studies conducted to demonstrate the presence of MAP noted it in 55.4% (range 16-92%) of CD 
subjects vs. 8.2% (range of 0-49%) of control groups across multiple diagnostic specimens e.g. 
blood, tissue and culture. Recent work in Israel, Japan, and Ireland has shown that human tissue 
and white cells can be infected with MAP an d this infection results in cytokine production, 
especially TNF -α and therefore indicate s that MAP plays a role in CD.  
Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177301]. In addition, the cost of a 
number of these available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_177302], thereby [CONTACT_177310]. As a result, there continues to be a significant unmet need for more effective disease 
management of CD.  
Several studies evaluating antimicrobial treatment directed at MAP to treat patients with CD have 
been reported. Given their slow growth and periods of latency, treatment of mycobacterial 
diseases require multiple antibiotics including triple therapy to avoid the development of resistance.  
RHB -[ADDRESS_986863] mycobacteria, i.e., 
clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine. The rationale for the development of RHB-104 is to 
demonstrate the efficacy o f an antimicrobial therapy consisting of clarithromycin: 95mg, 
rifabutin: 45mg, and clofazimine: 10mg in the treatment of CD patients. These active ingredients and doses were selected to maximize therapeutic effectiveness against MAP. The dosing rationale 
of each active ingredient is supported by [CONTACT_716]: 
•  prescriber information for each active ingredient  
•  the study by [CONTACT_177311]. utilizing a sub- optimal treatment regimen  
•  a long- term, retrospective Australian study where [ADDRESS_986864] a 
higher probability of being in a state of remission (C DAI score <150) at week [ADDRESS_986865] a higher probability of being 
in a state of durable ( long- term) remission  in assessments from week  [ADDRESS_986866] be maintained off steroids for 3 weeks in order to be determined to be in steroi d free remission e.g. by [CONTACT_5875] 23.

CONFIDENTIAL  11 2.1.4 Other Exploratory Efficacy Objectives  
 
1.    To characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of each of the active agents (and active 
metabolites for clarithromycin and rifabutin) using a population PK approach. 
2.  To assess the efficacy outcome measures for interaction with the baseline assay results for 
MAP infection (positive versus negative) to use in development of MAP blood PCR testing . 
3.  To compare the arm -specific changes in MAP PCR status (positive to negative) from pre - to 
post- treatment at week 26 and week 52 . 
4.    To compare arm -specific 26 -week change from baseline in the endoscop ic index (ΔCDEIS 
and ΔSES- CD) and the clinical index (ΔCDAI)  
5.    To compare the arm -specific changes in MAP culture status (positive to negative) from pre- 
to post- treatment at week [ADDRESS_986867] of treatment with RHB -104. 
 
2.2 Outcomes/ Endpoints  
 
The efficacy endpoints for statistical comparison between the RH -104 treatment and Placebo are 
grouped into 4 families for statistical analysis: (i) Primary efficacy endpoint; (ii) Key Secondary 
efficacy endpoints ; (iii) Other Supportive Secondary efficacy endpoints; and (iv) Other  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints.  The endpoints in families (i) and (ii) that are for potential 
treatment efficacy labeling claim will have multiplicity adjustment to control type 1 error rate.  
  
2.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint/ Variable : Remission  
 
In general use of rescue medication is considered as treatment failure (not achieve remission or 
response) if there are any new use of rescue medication to treat CD or increased rescue 
medication dose from baseline prior to any remission or response assessment.  Please refer to 
section 6.1.[ADDRESS_986868] having a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 
<150.  Subjects who have a Week 26 CDAI measurement ≥ [ADDRESS_986869] a CDAI 
measurement at Week 26 will be cla ssified as not achiev ed remission.  
 
The CDAI is used to assess the activity of CD; higher scores indicate more active disease.  
 
2.2.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints/Variables 
 
 Key Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following :

5. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
All screened subjects who signed informed consent will be included in the disposition table 
counts.  
The following populations will be used for data analysis. 
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the IT T 
population, which is defined as all subjects randomized. Subjects will be analyzed according to 
the treatment group to which they were  randomized.  
 
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : The Modified Intent- to-treat population is 
defined as pat ients who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The sensitivity analyses will be 
performed using the mITT population. Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. 
 
The Safety Population  (SAF) : The safety pop ulation includes subjects who are randomized and 
receive at least one dose of study medication. The primary safety analyses will be based on the 
SAF population.  Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment which they  actually 
received . 
 
Per-Protoc ol Population (PP):  The PP Population includes all randomized subj ects who receive 
at least one dose of RHB-[ADDRESS_986892] study drug bioavailability , 
poor compliance (< 80% compliant over study duration ), and s ubjects lost to follow-up. Protocol 
deviations will be reviewed and the list of major deviations warranting exclusion from the PP 
Population will be finalized prior to study unblinding. Subjects will be  analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which th ey were randomized.  
 The primary and key secondary efficacy sensitivity analyses may be repeated on the PP 
Population. 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
 6.[ADDRESS_986893] deviations, medians, and ranges.  
Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages.  
 The primary hypothesis testing will be t wo-sided statistical significance testing (alpha level = 
0.05) c omparing active treatment to placebo and  mainly dedicated to assessing  the primary 
endpoint and the key secondary endpoints. Point and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals) will be calculated and presented by [CONTACT_624482]. Com puted 
p-values will be rounded to four decimal places; p -values less than 0. 0001 will be presented as '< 
0.0001' and p- values greater than 0. 9999 will be presented as ‘>  0.9999’ in the  tables.  
 All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistic al software (Version 9.[ADDRESS_986894] higher version available at the time of analysis ).  Adverse events will be coded 
using the most recent MedDRA version available at the time of analysis and the version used will be footnoted in the respective summary tables. Concomitant medications will be coded using the 
most recent version of Worl d Health Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary. 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_986895] of the Type I error 
probability (α) because of the formal planned interim analysis to be conducted needs to be 
understood.  
 The protocol specified α -spending for the pla nned  interim analysis is 0.003. Hypotheses tests at 
the final analysis will be conducted at significance level of α = 0.049. The multiple efficacy tests  
for the study final analysis will employ a serial sequential gatekeeper strategy to maintain the 
Type 1  error rate at α  = 0.[ADDRESS_986896] rank ( 1) and will  be tested first followed by [CONTACT_722548] 26  (rank 2), followed by [CONTACT_722549] 52 (rank 3), Durable Remission  week 26 through 
week 52  (rank 4), followed by [CONTACT_722549] 16 (rank 5),  and followed by [CONTACT_722550] 52 (rank 6).   Again it is important to note that once one hypothesis is tested and 
found not to be significant at α = 0.049, all subsequent tests will not be performed. T he 
multiplicity adjustment following hierarchal testing procedure comparing RHB -104 with Placebo  
will only be performed on the following key clinical efficacy endpoints listed in order of clinical 
importance :  
 1. Remission  (CDAI score < 150) week 26  - Primary Efficacy Endpoint . 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 2. Response ( reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score)  week 26 . 
3. Remission (CDAI score < 150) week 52 
4. Durable Remission  (CDAI score < 150) from week 26 through week 52 in remission.

6.1.5 Missing Data and Handling of Drop outs 
 
All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations. All patients 
who prematurely discontinue for any reason will be considered failures for the different 
proportion based endpoints.  
 
CDAI Missing Data: 

 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S PLAN  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd.  
RHB -104-[ADDRESS_986899] 
will be categorized as a non -responder and the CDAI score will be considered missing. As 
specified in the protocol, subjects with missing week 26 assessment will be assumed to not be in a 
state of remission at week 26 (i.e., non-responders).  Similarly, for subjects with missing week 52 
assessments will be assumed not to be in state of remission  at week 52. Sensitivity analyses may 
be performed on Observed Case ( completer analysis) only . 
 
Handling of missing date information for AEs:  
The term missing date refers to a completely missing date or to partial date where month or/and 
day or/and year is/are missing , e.g. missing month/day/year. Missing start and end dates will be 
imputed conservatively, i.e. missing values will be imputed in such a way that the duration of the 
AE is considered with the longest possible duration. The missing start date and end date of AE 
will be imputed for the purpose of defining treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and for 
assigning events to treatment periods using the following definitions :  
 
(i)  Adverse E vent Start Date:  
Event Missing D ay: If Adverse event day is missing but month and year present , then i mpute the 
1st of the month unless month and year are the same as  first dose of study drug then impute day first day of dose. 
Event Missing day and month – If adverse event day and month both are missing but year is 
present then impute [ADDRESS_986900] dose day and month. Completely missing – imp ute first dose date unless the end date suggests it could have started 
prior to this in which case impute the 1st January of the same year as the end date.   
 
(ii)  Adverse Event End Date: 
Missing day – If AE day is missing but month and year is present then i mpute the last day of the 
month. 
Missing day and month – If AE has missing day and month but year is present then impute 31st 
December.  
Completely Missing – Required to look at whether the AE is still ongoing before imputing a date 
and also when it started in relation to study drug. If the ongoing flag is missing then assume that 
AE is still present (i.e. do not impute a date). If the AE has stopped and start date is prior to first 
dose date then impute the 1st dose date, if it started on or after first dose date then impute a date 
that is after the last dose date.  
 
(iii) TEAE definition with missing start and stop dates : If the start date of an adverse event is 
incomplete or missing, the event will be assumed to be a treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE ), unless the incomplete start date (month and/or year) or the stop date (complete or 
incomplete) clearly indicates that the event started prior to dosing. Missing/incomplete 
information will be reported as missing/incomplete in the subject listings.

CONFIDENTIAL  22 (iv) Adv erse event relationship : If the relationship for an adverse event is not recorded, it will be 
assumed to be treatment related in the presentation of the statistical summary of incidence results.  
Missing information will be reported as missing in the subje ct listings.  
 
(v) Adverse event severity : If the severity of an adverse event is missing, the severity will be 
assumed to be severe when summarizing data. Missing information will be reported as missing in 
the subject listings.  
 
(vi) Non -study medication (concomitant medications, steroids) start and stop dates:  If the start 
and/or stop dates of non- study medication use are incomplete or missing, the use will be assumed 
to be concomitant, unless the incomplete date information clearly indicates that the use stopped 
prior to study medication dosing. Missing/incomplete information will be reported as 
missing/incomplete in the subject listings.  
 
6.1.6 Conversion of time interval  
 
In case time interval was calculated in days and need to be converted into weeks, months or years 
the following conversion factors need to be used:  
1 week  = 7 days 1 month = 30.4 days 
1 year    = 365.25 days 
 
6.1.7 Pooling of Investigator Sites 
 
The primary analysis will use data pooled across all investigative sites.  The Region s ([LOCATION_006], US, 
Canada,  New Zealand , Israel, Slovakia, etc. ) and site differences may be explored in preliminary 
analyses depending on how many subjects randomized by [CONTACT_25733]/region. Preliminary exploratory analyses may be conducted to determine potential influence of treatmen t-by-
investigative  site/region  interaction on the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints by 
[CONTACT_722553], using statistical models 
incorporating treatment, site, and treatment -by-site interac tion. A significance level of 0.10 will 
be used in any of the analyses in identifying potential treatment-by-site interactions. The 
exploratory results indicating non- significant interaction will be indicative that pooled data across 
sites/regions was free of the impact of any extreme investigative sites/regions. It is recognized 
that the power to detect an interaction will be limited due to some sites with limited enrollments.   
 
6.1.8 Efficacy Data with High Doses of Steroids Use and Rescue Medications Use  
 Corticosteroids Use:  
A subject may use corticosteroids or increased dose levels of corticosteroids for reasons other 
than CD, and may start corticosteroid tapering at [ADDRESS_986901] experiences a worsening 
of disease activity during the taper, and/or  the oral corticosteroid dose temporarily increased, in 
these circumstances the subject will be considered a treatment failure in the steroid free remission 
analysis but will continue to remain on the study and complete all scheduled visits.  
Use of Rescue Medications:

CONFIDENTIAL  23 Subjects rescued with the following treatments or whose baseline doses/regimens are increased to 
treat new or unresolved CD symptoms may remain on the study drug at the discretion of the 
investigator and continue to be assessed at all schedul ed study visits: 
•  Oral or rectal 5 -ASA compounds 
• Azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine (6 -MP) or methotrexat e 
• Antibiotics as treatment of C D 
• Total parenteral nutrition as treatment of C D 
• Systemic or rectal corticosteroid therap y 
• Anti-TNF or other biologic agen t 
 In the ITT efficacy analyses, subjects who initiate or modify dose/regimens to treat CD symptoms 
will be considered as treatment failures. 
 
6.1.9 Determination of Sample  Size 
 
The sample size justification is provided in the protocol and was based on the review of published   
literature in similar patient population (Sandborn et al., 2013). A total sample size of 410 subjects 
(205 per treatment arm) was computed to be sufficient with one stratification anti- TNF agent use 
(yes/no) to detect a minimum difference of 15 percentage points between RHB-10 4 treatment 
(36% Remission) and Placebo (21% Remission) with 90% Power at two -sided significance level, 
α=0.05. The test statistic used for this analysis was a two -sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) 
test controlling f or the stratification variable (anti -TNF agents (yes/no) under the ITT principle. 
These calculations were made to allow for two sequential tests to be made using the O'Brien-
Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries. The interim analysis ( first sequential 
test) will occur when 50% of the patients have their outcome data measured (i.e., reach 26 weeks of follow- up). The 2- sided alpha level for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_722543] 
0.003. If this criterion is not met the trial will be continued and the final analysis (second 
sequential test) will be performed using a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.049 for testing the primary 
outcome ( Elashoff , 2007) . In all analyses, subjects with missing [ADDRESS_986902] used in the sample size derivation for the study is  
15% improvement in 26 week remission success, however a clinically meaningful difference in 
this measure (26 week remission success proportion) is 9% (in absolute percent) based on clinical 
expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Therefore, any statistically significant difference between groups that has an 
observed percent difference of 9% or larger would indicate that treatment is effective.  
 
Protocol Version 11.0 curtails the number of expected enrolled patients to 324 (162 
per group). Final analysis of the data is to be carried out when approximately [ADDRESS_986903] completed the Week 26 primary endpoint assessment. This sample size 
curtailment reflects the study’s current accrual trends. The anticipated power will be at  
least 80% given the study design stage assumptions regarding the treatment groups  
primary efficacy endpoint (36% RHB-104 vs. 21% Placebo).

• Violation of inclusion/exclusion crite ria 
• Non-compliance with study procedures 
• Inappropriate intake of prohibited medications 
• Poor compliance with study medications 
• Lost to follow -up

concomitant:   
The medication will be assumed to be prior medication if it cannot be definitively shown that the 
medication did not start or continue during the treatment period. 
If the start date or stop date of a medic ation is partially missing, the date will be compared as far 
as possible with the date of the start of administration of study drug. The following approach will 
be taken:  
• If the start date of medication is complete and occurs on or after the day of the fir st dose, 
the medication will be assumed concomitant.  If the start date occurs prior to the first dose date but the end date is on or after the first dose date or the medication is recorded 
as ongoing, the medication will be considered concomitant. 
• If the start day is missing but the start month and year are complete, a medication will 
only be excluded as being concomitant if the start month/year is before the month/year of 
study drug administration and if the stop date (either full date, month and year if missing 
day, or year if missing month and day) is before study drug administration. 
• If the start day and month are missing but the start year is complete, a medication will only be excluded as concomitant if the start year is before the year of study drug administration and if the stop date (either  full date, month and year if missing day, or year 
if missing month and day) is before study drug administration. 
• If the start date is completely missing and the stop date is prior to first dose or completely 
missing, the medication will be assumed to be a prior medication. 
 
All p rior and concomitant medications recorded on CRF will be mapped to standardized terms 
using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary coding system (WHO DD ). The 
Anatomical –Therapeutic–Chemical (ATC) Classification level [ADDRESS_986908] having the same medication more than once will be counted only once in the incidence table for that medication. For each ATC classifi cation 
and Preferred Term the number and percentage of subjects will be displayed .  Summary tables 
will be presented on SAF population separately for prior medications and concomitant medications by [CONTACT_1570].

CONFIDENTIAL  28 6.3 Efficacy Analysis 
 
The e fficacy primary analyses will be based  on the ITT population as the primary population. 
Any Supportive/sensitivity analyses may be  assessed on subgroup populations of subjects that 
will be defined for each endpoint as needed for implementing specific sensitivity analysis.  
Additional analyses as defined in SAP addendum will be perfo rmed accordingly as specified.  
 
 
6.3.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on ITT population. Sensitivity analyses may be 
performed on Observed Case (completers only), on subjects with no violation of key 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (mITT population) , and on PP population.   
 The primary efficacy v ariable  is the proportion of subjects experienced  remission week 26, where 
remission is defined as a subject having a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of < 150.  
Subje cts who have a w eek 26 CDAI measurement ≥ [ADDRESS_986909] a CDAI 
measurement w eek 26 will be classified as not achieved  remission . The primary analysis will 
compare the RHB -104 treated group to Placebo treated group on ITT population using Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH)  chi-square test controlling for the stratification variable  anti-TNF  agents 
use (yes/no).  The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows, where π
R and π P are the 
proportion of subjects with remission in the RHB -104 and placebo treated groups, respectively.  
 
Null hypothesis                                  H o: πR = π P  
 “Proportion (%)  of subjects in Remission in RHB -104 Treatment is equal to Proportion (%)  of 
subjects in Remission in  Placebo Treatment at week 26 ” 
 Alternative hypothesis                     H
1: πR ≠ πP  
 “Proportion of subjects in Remission for RHB -104 Treatment is not equal to Proportion of 
subjects in Remission for  Placebo treatment at week 26 ” 
 For each treatment group, descriptive statistics will be presented including the numbe r of 
observations, proportion (%) of subjects in remission.  
The primary analysis will compare RHB -[ADDRESS_986910] at 
the α  = 0.[ADDRESS_986911]  p-
value comparing the RHB -104 arm with the placebo  arm (Higher proportion in RHB-104 than 
placebo) is  less than  0.[ADDRESS_986912]  taking into account the pre -specified protocol 
alpha spent at interim equal to 0.003. 
 
 For each treatment group, parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval will be presented including the number of observations and proportion (%) of subjects in remission.

CONFIDENTIAL  29 To assess the robustness of the primary results, s ensitivity analysis will be performed on mITT 
and on observed case ( only completers with 2 6 weeks of data). The observed case population will 
include only subjects that have [ADDRESS_986913] of prognostic baseline characteristics identified prospectively as clinically 
important baseline factor s/variables on the remission outcome in both treatment groups at week 
26. This will model a categorical response variab le Remission (< 150 CDAI score) at week 26 
(yes/no) as a function of treatment, stratification an ti-TNF agents (yes/no)  use, and treatment -by- 
baseline clinical factor interaction. The aim  is to assess consistence/inconsistence of the treatment 
differences across each of the pre -defined clinically important baseline characteristic s (one -
variable- at-a-time) . Each prognostic factor will be fitted separately  (one- variable -at-a-time)  in the 
model and output results including 95% confidence inter vals presented in forest plots  showing 
consistence/inconsistence by [CONTACT_1570] . The following baseline factors are considered 
prospectively to be potentially clinically important:   
• Baseline serum inflammation marker: C- reactive protein  (Normal/High )  
• Baseline stool inflammation marker: Fecal calprotectin  (Normal/High)  
• Baseline CDEIS score  (0-3; >3 score) 
• Baseline SES- CD score (0-2; >2 score)  
• Baseline IBDQ  Score  
• Duration of  CD  
• Prior surgical treatment for CD  (yes/no) 
• MAP -Test PCR Blood assay (Posi tive/Negative) Basel ine 
• MAP-Test Blood culture (Positive/Negative) Baseline  
• Gender (male/female)  
• Age at first Diagnosis of CD  
• Smoking  (yes/no) 
• Alcohol consumption (yes/no) 
• Use of Immunomodulators (yes/no)   
• Use of steroids (yes/no)  
 
The continuous variables may be categorized into different classification categories depending on 
the number of observations and final decisions on categories for each variable will be determined 
at the time of analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL  30 [IP_ADDRESS] Response week 26  
 
The Response week 26 is defined as the proportion (%) of subjects that experienced reduction 
from baseline of ≥ 100 in CDAI score. The same statistical analysis strategy as described for the 
primary endpoint including sensitivity and exploratory analyses will be repeated for the 
proportion responders (%) at 26 weeks comparing the two treatment groups. Summary para meter 
estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving response along with the model estimated 
odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p-value compari ng RHB -104 treatment to 
placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as for primary endpoint analysis may be 
conducted and summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Remission week 52  
 Remission at week 52 will be derived following similar strategy as for the primary  endpoint.  The 
subjects in remission will include subjects experienced remission (CDAI < 150 score) at week 26 and also at week 52 , and subjects that were non -responders at week 26 but are responders at week 
52 (Late responders).  
 The same statistical met hods as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The 
proportion of subjects experienced remission at 52 weeks will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between the two treatments using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi-
square test. Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving response along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confide nce interval) and p -
value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as 
for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted and summarized. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Durable (or Sustained) Remission  
 This analysis is intended to compare the tw o treatment groups considering only the subjects that 
experienced remission  (CDAI < 150 score) week 26 through week 52 (Sustained Remission). 
Subjects who are not in remission at any visit point assessment between 26 and 52 weeks will be considered as non- responders for this analysis. The same statistical method as used for the 
primary endpoint will be used for this analysis.  The proportion (%) of subjects experienced 
sustained remission will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between the two 
treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test. Summary parameter estimates 
generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the

Early Remission week 16 will be derived following similar strategy as for the primary endpoint.  
The summary results will show the number and proportion (%) of subjects experienced early remission (CDAI < 150 score) week 16. 
 
The same statistical approach as for the p rimary analysis will be employed to compare proportion 
(%) of subjects experienced Early Remission for the RHB -104 treated group versus Placebo 
treated group on ITT population using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test 
controlling for the stratifi cation variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no) . Summary parameter 
estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the number and proportion of subjects in remission  along with the model estimated odds 
ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p- value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. 
The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted

[IP_ADDRESS] Steroid free remission week  52 
 This analysis is to compare the proportion (%) of subjects that achieved steroid free  remission 
week [ADDRESS_986916] 
has to be in remission (CDAI score < 150) week [ADDRESS_986917] 3 weeks. 
The 3 weeks steroid free  period is by [CONTACT_5875] 49.   
 The statistical analysis strategy, the statistical tests comparing the two treatment groups, summary 
and presentation of the results will be similar to the primary endpoint analysis based on CMH chi -
square tests. Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the number and proportion of subjects in steroid 
free remission  along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and 
p-value compari ng RHB -104 treatment to placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses 
as for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted and summarized.  
6.3.3 Supportive Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 
This group of seco ndary efficacy endpoints is considered to be supportive of the efficacy for the 
primary and the key secondary endpoints. Therefore, there will be no multiplicity adjustments for 
this group of endpoints. Summary statistics and tests of hypotheses will be considered 
descriptive/supportive.

modeling will be used  to compare the time to event in both treatments while simultaneously  
adjusting for stratification  variable  anti-TNF agents use (yes/no) . The explanatory variables in the 
model will include treatment, and the stratification  variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no).  Patients 
who do not achieve the outcome event at the end of the study will be censored on the last visit date recorded. Patients who discontinued early will be censored on the last date of contact. Censored observations and confidence intervals for the estimated median times will be presented.  
 The null hypothesis that is tested is that of equal time to event  distribution between the two 
treatments. Equality of the distributio ns of event times implies that there are similar response 
event rates between the two treatments not only for the entire treatment period, but also for any 
visit time point assessed post -baseline during the study. Rejection of the null hypothesis indicates 
that the event rates significantly differ between the two treatments at one or more visit time points  
assessed post -baseline. Kaplan Meier survival curves and parameters showing time- to-first 
observed response outcome will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. S umm ary statistics that will be 
presented will include minimum, maximum, the 25th and 75th percentiles, 95% confidence intervals on the median (using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley), and proportion of  the 
events and censored data.  The log -rank test will be used to test for differences between RHB -[ADDRESS_986919] s will be presented.  Kaplan -Meier plot s with 
descriptive summary statistics will be presented.

 This analysis i s intended to compare the two treatment groups based on the proportion (%) of 
subjects achieved Sustained Remission defied as maintaining CDAI score < 150 from week 16 through week 52.  Subjects who are not in remission at any visit point assessment betwee n week 
16 and week 52  will be considered as non -responders for this analysis. The same statistical 
method as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The proportion (%)  of 
subjects experienced sustained remission will be summarized for  each treatment group and 
compared between the two treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test. 
Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by [CONTACT_1570], and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving sustained 
remission along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p-
value comparing RHB -[ADDRESS_986920] 5 out of the 6 visits assessed (i.e. ≥ 83% of the 
visits in remission) week 16 through week 52. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Response at Week 52  
 The Response is defined as reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score  week 52 .  The 
responders will include subjects who were  responders  week 26 through week 52 and the subjects 
that were non- responders at week 26 but were  responders week 52 (Late Responders).  
 The same statistical method s as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The 
proportion of subjec ts experienc ed response at 52 weeks will be summarized for each treatment

[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopic Assessment Based on CDEIS  and SES -CD at Week 26  
 
The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) is a validated quantitative measure of disease severity upon endoscopy. The score ranges from 0-44 based upon the extent and 
severity of inflammation and ulcers seen during endoscopy of the colony. A response is a drop in 
score from baseline.  
 The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES -CD) is a validated quantitative measure 
of disease severity upon endoscopy that is based on four  endoscopic variables (presence and size 
of ulcers, proportion of surface covered by [CONTACT_722561], proportion of surface affected by [CONTACT_4623], and presence and severity of stenosis). Each variable is assessed in each of the five ileocolic 
segments: Rectum, sigmoid and left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Each of the 
four SES- CD variables is scored from 0 to 3, with the sum of the scores for each variable ranging 
from 0 to 15, except for the presence and extent of stenosis, which ranges from 0 to 11 (T otal 
SES- CD score range 0–56). 
 
The CDEIS  and SES -CD mean score s at baseline  and week 26, and change from baseline score s 
to week 26 will be summarized by [CONTACT_722562]. The change from baseline CDEIS  and SES -CD scores comparing the two treatment 
groups based on each of the two scoring systems will be analyzed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model s with treatment group, stratification variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no) as 
classification factors,  and baseline CDEIS score or SES -CD as covariate.  The treatment 
parameter estimates from the analysis model s including means, 95% confidence intervals and 
associated 2 -sided p- values will be presented.    
 In addition, the CDEIS and SES- CD scores will be classified into two categories: “Remission 
(CDEIS 0 -3 score; SES- CD 0 -2 score)” and “No Remission (CDEIS > 3; SES- CD > 2 score )”.  
Summary results will show number of patients and proportion (%) in  “Remission ” based on 
CDEIS  and also based on SES-CD by [CONTACT_722563] -
points with data collected post- baseline.  The same statistical method and modeling as used for the 
primary endpoint will be used for this analysis.  
 
The proportion of subjects  at baseline and each visit  in “Remission  post- baseline will be 
compared between the two treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH)  chi-square test 
controlling for the stratification variable anti- TNF agents use (yes/no ). The same statistical 
summary will be repeated  comparing the two treatment groups on proportion of responders based 
on CDEIS and SES -CD scores defined as 50% reduction from baseline score and 25% reduction 
from baseline score to week 26.  
 Supplementary shift tables will be presented showing proportion of subject s at baseline that were 
in “No Remission” category and shifted to “Remission” category or vice versa or remained in the same category at the different post -baseline visits.

hematology parameters (which are continuous in nature) will use the classifications of low, 
normal, and high relative to normal ranges, whereas appropriate categories will be selected for 
urinalysis parameters (which are categorical in nature), for example, normal and abnormal. 
 
Subjects missing a value at any time point will be excluded from the summary statistics for that time point. If a subject has more than one  value at any time point, then the latest non missing 
value will be used  for summarization. All values will be presented in the data listings.  
 
Listings of all individual laboratory data, indicating any values out of the normal range will be 
produced. A listing of lab parameter values flagged as abnormal will also be provided.    
 
6.5.3  Vital Signs     
 
Vital sig ns include the following:  
• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_9219] (SBP)

• Supi[INVESTIGATOR_177305]   
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  
• Temperature 
• Height  
• Weight  
• BMI  
 
Vital signs are recorded at baseline and at different visits post -baseline. Actual a nd change from 
baseline values will be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_3232]. The 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be used to summarize the data. For each 
subject, vi tal signs data will be presented in a data listing.

In order to ensure the safety of study participants, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis. The committee will meet periodically to 
review  interim safety data. Following their review, the DSMB wi ll recommend whether the study 
should continue  as is  or be modified to improve safety. The DSMB will consist of at least one 
clinician with  experience in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and at least one 
statistician.  The DSMB charter w ill describe the membership, responsibilities , meeting 
procedures related to the DSMB, output to be reviewed, and interim analysis rules to be applied. The DSMB at regular intervals will review  the following, at each of the safety analyses meetings:  
• Demogr aphic and baseline characteristics  
• Physical exam, vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, ECG findings  
• Summaries of SAE, AEs and deaths 
• Summaries of subject withdrawals  
• Summaries of subject accrual and retention  
• Summaries of protocol violations 
 The DSM B will carefully consider safety results and then provide a recommendation for 
continuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_722544]. There 
are three planned DSMB meetings for the study. The first meeting is planned for when 25% of 
patients reach [ADDRESS_986933] meetings are to occur after 50% and 75% of patients have completed [ADDRESS_986934] 6  months. 
 
In addition, it is anticipated that during the sec ond DSMB meeting, an interim efficacy (or 
inefficacy) and futility analys es will be performed and the results of this analysis evaluated by [CONTACT_40746] . 
 
It is prospectively planned as specified in the protocol that the second DSMB meeting at 50% 
randomized s ubjects will comprise a formal interim of safety and efficacy (or inefficacy) and 
futility analyses will be performed and the results of this analysis evaluated by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
6.7 Interim Analysis  
 
One prospectively planned interim analysis for safety and futil ity is planned after 50% (205) 
patients have completed week 26 of treatment. The DSMB will evaluate the results from this 
analysis to assess RHB -104 safety, efficacy (or inefficacy), and the feasibility of continuing or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. The planned interim analysis is designed to have an alpha level of 0.003 as the 
criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_722545] O’Brein -Fleming 
spending function to determine the test boundaries.  For the interim analysis, the Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare treatment groups controlling for the

CONFIDENTIAL  42 stratification variable (anti -TNF agents (yes/no). The interim test is a [ADDRESS_986935] (P=0.003), 
meaning that the trial can be stopped if there is overwhelming evidence of efficacy or 
overwhelming evidence of inefficacy.  Further details are provided in the DSMB charter  for this 
study.   
 
The protocol specified α -spending for the prospectively plan interim analysis is 0.003. A ll tests at 
the final analysis will be conducted at significance level of α = 0.049.  The interim analyses will 
consider subjects with missing 26 week assessments to not be in a state of remission at 26 weeks.  
 
Regarding the interim efficacy (or inefficacy) of the data, recommendations for early termination 
will be guided by [CONTACT_69853]- DeMets alpha-spending implementation of O’Brien- Fleming spending 
function to determine the test boundaries . The efficacy boundary preserves the overall [ADDRESS_986936] & second sequential test is 0.003 & 0.049, respectively.  
 
The DSMB will carefully consider the safety and efficacy interim results and then pr ovide a 
recommendation for continuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. The sponsor and all personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to the treatment assigned to each subject.
 The DSMB 
will disseminate interim results in a manner that will p rotect the scientific and ethical aspects of 
the study. The responsibility of the DSMB, the scope of the data to be reviewed, the organization 
of the review process, dissemination requirements and procedures are described in DSMB 
charter.  
 
6.8 Changes to Stat istical Analysis Methods Planned in the Protocol  
 
Changes to planned analyses from the protocol will be  incorporated in the SAP, if they occur 
before the unblinding of the database.  
7. ADDITIONAL OTHER EXPLOATORY ANALYSES  
 
Other exploratory subgroup analyses to characterize safety and efficacy activities of HRB -104 
versus placebo may be conducted. These additional exploratory analyses will be decided at the time of final data analysis.

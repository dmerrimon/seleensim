Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245596] Cancer 
 Hormone receptor positive (estrogen receptor (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor (PR+)) breast cancers account for nearly 80% of breast cancer diagnoses. Endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_205925]. A meta-analysis by [CONTACT_205974]’ Collaborative Group showed that these agents substan tially reduce the relapse 
rate and mortality in the adjuvant setting for early stage brea st cancers that were ER+ or 
PR+ (1).  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_205926], a considerable clini cal challenge remains in the 
form of many women presenting with systemic relapse of breast c ancer either during or 
after completion of adjuvant hormone therapy. In aromatase inhi bitor (AI) resistant setting, 
hormonal therapy such as a different AI, tamoxifen or the selec tive estrogen-receptor down 
regulator fulvestrant, as single agents have shown limited clinical benefit (2-4). Although the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown to improve PFS in the A I resistant setting, its 
activity is modest and is associated with significant toxicity including mucositis and 
hyperglycemia (5).   Cyclin D1–CDK4–CDK6 (CDK - Cyclin dependent kinase) complex is a  key downstream 
effector in ER+ and PR+ breast cancer and retains its function even after development of 
resistance to endocrine therapy (6,7). Targeting CDK4 and CDK6 is an attractive strategy 
to overcome this resistance. 
 
1.2 Palbociclib (Ibrance) 
 Palbociclib (Ibrance, [COMPANY_007]) is a highly selective small-molec ule inhibitor of CDK4 and 
CDK6, which can be administered orally. It results in loss of R B1 phosphorylation in vitro 
and leads to cell cycle arrest at the G1-S phase in ER+ breast cancer (8). While initial phase 
[ADDRESS_245597] cancer (9), 
subsequent studies have reported synergistic activity with endo crine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_205927]+/PR+ 
breast cancer. In preclinical studies, palbociclib was effectiv e in both tamoxifen sensitive 
and resistant ER+ breast cancer cell lines (7).   
 An open-label randomized phase 2 study involving postmenopausal  patients with newly 
diagnosed metastatic ER+ and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_205928] (Her-2/neu) 
negative breast cancer (PALOMA1 ), showed that palbociclib in co mbination with letrozole 
was associated with significantly prolonged PFS when compared w ith letrozole alone (10). 
This resulted in an accelerated FDA approval of palbociclib for  use in this specific patient 
population (11). In this trial, 27 patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group (33%) had 
dose interruptions because of adverse events, compared with only three (4%) patients in the letrozole group. In the combination group, 37 (45%) patient s required a delay in the 
start of a subsequent treatment cycle because of an adverse eve nt and 33 (40%) patients 
had a dose reduction. In this study, 11 (13%) patients in the p albociclib plus letrozole group 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 9 of 68  and two (2%) patients in the letro zole group discontinued the s tudy because of an adverse 
event. Of these discontinuations, six (7%) patients in palbocic lib plus letrozole group and 
two (2%) patients in the letro zole group discontinued because of treatment-related adverse 
events. 
 A randomized phase 3 study to confirm the efficacy of palbocicl ib in combination with 
letrozole in this setting (PALOMA2) was recently reported at AS CO 2016 annual meeting 
and again demonstrated a signi ficant improvement in progression  free survival (PFS): 24.8 
(22.1-NR) months in the palbocic lib/letrozole arm vs 14.5 (12.9 -17.1) months in the 
placebo/letrozole arm, HR 0.58; p<0.000001 (12). Among the 444 patients treated with 
palbociclib and letrozole, neutr openia (any grade) occurred in 80% of patients vs. 6% in 
the placebo/letrozole arm.  The incidence of grade 3 and 4 neut ropenia in the 
palbociclib/letrozole arm was 56% and 10%, respectively.  Grade  3 or 4 non-hematological 
AEs were uncommon. 9.7% of patients in the palbociclib/letrozol e arm vs 5.9% in the 
placebo/letrozole arm discontinued treatment due to AEs (12).   Most recently, a randomized phase 3 study (PALOMA3) assessed th e safety and efficacy 
of the combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant vs placebo an d fulvestrant after disease 
progression after prior endocri ne therapy in premenopausal and postmenopausal women 
with hormone receptor positive and Her-2/neu negative advanced breast cancer. In this 
study, premenopausal females also received goserelin for ovaria n suppression. A 
significantly prolonged PFS was noted with the combination of p albociclib and fulvestrant 
compared with fulvestrant and placebo. The dosing schedule of p albociclib was 125 mg po 
daily for 3 weeks followe d by [CONTACT_205975] (13).   
 
Similar to PALOMA2, most common hematologic adverse events repo rted for the 
palbociclib–fulvestrant group in P ALOMA3 were neutropenia and l eukopenia. 
Neutropenia (any grade) occurred in 78.8% of the patients receiving palbociclib–
fulvestrant versus 3.5% in the placebo–fulvestrant group, leuko penia in 45.5% versus 
4.1%, anemia in 26.1% versus 9.9%, and thrombocytopenia in 19.4% versus 0%. Grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia occurred in 62.0% of the patients receiving palbociclib–fulvestrant versus 0.6% of the patients receiving pl acebo–fulvestrant, leukopenia in 25.2% versus 0.6%, 
anemia in 2.6% versus 1.7%, and thrombocytopenia in 2.3% versus  0 % .    T h e  m o s t  
common nonhematologic adverse events were fatigue, nausea (29.0% vs. 26.2%), and headache, all of which were more common in the palbociclib-fulv estrant group. A higher 
incidence of infections was als o reported in the palbociclib–fu lvestrant group (13).  
 Palbociclib dose was reduced in 109 of 345 patients (31.6%), wh ereas the placebo dose 
was reduced in 3 of 172 patients (1.7%). Discontinuation of palbociclib or matching placebo owing to adverse events occurred in 9 patients (2.6%) r eceiving palbociclib and 3 
patients (1.7%) receiving placebo (13).  
  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 10 of 68   
1.3 Study Rationale 
 
The current dose modification guid elines for palbociclib are as  follows: 
 
CTCAE*  grade Dose modifications 
Grade 1 or 2  No adjustment required 
Grade 3 No dose adjustment is required. Consider repeating comp lete 
blood count monitoring one week l ater. Withhold initiation of 
next cycle until recovery to Grade ≤2 
Grade 3 ANC 
(<1000 to 500/mm3) 
+ Fever > 38.5C 
and/or infection Withhold Palbociclib and initiation of next cycle until recovery to Grade ≤2 (≥1000/mm
3). Resume at next lower 
dose 
Grade 4 Withhold Palbociclib and i nitiation of next cycle until  
recovery to Grade ≤2. Resume at next lower dose 
*Common terminology criteria for adverse events  We propose to conduct a study to test an alternative dosing sch edule of palbociclib. With 
the current three-week on and one week off schedule, a signific ant number of patients 
develop grade [ADDRESS_245598] 3 weeks on and 1 week 
off dosing schedule could potentially lead to recovery of Rb phosphorylation during the off week.  Hence, we propose a 5 days on and 2 days off schedul e each week without any 
weeks off drug.  Although the cumulative doses each 28-day cycl e is roughly the same 
with this schedule compared to conventional dosing, the bone ma rrow is not exposed to 
the drug continuously for 21 days and rather gets frequent breaks from therapy.  We hypothesize that the 5 days on and 2 days off schedule is more tolerable with less frequent 
high grade neutropenia and dose interruption/reduction.  In add ition, this schedule also 
provides for a more continuous drug delivery to the patient sin ce there is not a week’s break 
in therapy, which could ultimately prove to be more efficacious . 
 
1.4 Correlative Studies Background 
 
Serum TK1 activity 
Thymidine kinase-1 (TK1) is an enzyme which plays a critical ro le in the synthesis of 
DNA.  All human cells express this enzyme during normal cell division through E2F-
dependent transcription with only small amounts of the enzyme r eleased into the serum 
(14,15).  Due to higher rates of replication compared to normal  tissues, tumors are capable 
of secreting pathologic levels of TK1  which can be detected via an ELISA assay.  In 
patients with metastatic breast cancer, TK1 expression and acti vity in human serum, was 
predictive for therapy response and correlated with PFS and OS (16). Given that TK1 
expression is E2F-dependent, we hypothesize that CDK4 inhibitors, if active in a particular tumor, would result in reduced serum TK1 activity and can be us ed as a potential biomarker 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245599]  of CDK4/6 inhibition.  We will also evaluate changes in 
serum TK1 activity in relation to tumor response as an explorat ory endpoint in this study. 
 
Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing 
Plasma samples from cancer patients often carry small amounts o f fragmented cell-free 
DNA of 160-180 base pairs, which are originated from the necrosis or apoptotic process of cancer cells.  Advances in the ne xt generation sequencing (NGS)  technology and digital 
genomic techniques support the clinical validity of cell-free c irculating DNA (ctDNA) 
sequencing analysis to non-invasi vely identify actionable genom ic alterations, monitor 
treatment response, and investig ate resistance mechanisms (17).   To investigate whether 
ctDNA sequencing could serve as an early predictor of response and provide clues of 
resistance mechanisms, blood for cell free tumor DNA sequencing will be collected before, during and at the time of progression to assess changes in the mutation profile including 
PIK3CA, RB1, ESR1, TP53  and others.  These genes are chosen as PIK3CA, TP53 and 
ESR1 are among the most common mutations in AI resistant ER+ breast  cancer (18,19) 
and palbociclib has shown to be effective in ER pos breast canc ers that carry these 
mutations (20,21).  However, there is limited data on whether t hese mutations could be 
used to monitor treatment response and whether mutations in the se genes could be acquired 
or enriched during or at progression on palbocic lib.  It is of particular impor tance whether 
ESR1 mutation could develop at the time of acquired treatment resis tance. The results may 
have implications on the development of subsequent treatment strategies.  RB1 mutation has been implicated as a de novo and acquired treatment resista nce mechanism to CDK4/6 
inhibition (21-23), however, the incidence of RB1 mutation afte r progression on 
palbociclib combination regimen is unknown.  This trial will pr ovide this valuable data for 
future studies of targeted agents  aimed to treat RB1 mutant tum ors.  
 Tumor analysis 
In addition to archival tumor sp ecimens, in consented patients who have accessible tumors, 
tumor biopsies will be obtained b e f o r e  a n d / o r  a f t e r  d i s e a s e  p r o gression to examine 
mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms, by [CONTACT_205976], immunohistochemistry of pRB, RNA expression 
profiling and targeted or whole exome sequencing studies depend ing on funding 
availabilities.     Patient derived xenograft (PDX)  
PDX models allow the opportunity for in-depth molecular charact erization of the tumor 
and investigation of mechanisms o f response/resistance to treat ments, therefore whenever 
possible, we will try to engraft biopsy samples to immunocompro mised mice from 
consented patients as described  in our previous publications (2 4).  
 Circulating tumor cells (CTC) 
CTCs are rare events in the bloodstream, but may provide an acc essible source of material 
for detection, characterization and monitoring of non-hematolog ic malignancies.  Current 
estimates suggest that these cells are present in numbers as lo w as [ADDRESS_245600] cancer, 
utilized the FDA-cleared CellSea rch System for CTC enumeration,  and showed the 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 12 of 68  prognostic value of CTC count i n both progression free survival and overall survival (25).  
With the advances of technologies, we and others have developed  new methods of CTC 
isolation that may allow for more accurate enumeration and even  biochemical 
characterization of these cells (26,27). Recent studies have al so demonstrated success in 
genomic, transcriptomic, and prot eomic analyses in breast cance r CTCs (28,29). These 
data support the use of CTCs as valuable information source to non-invasively identify 
actionable genomic alterations, monitor treatment response, and investigate resistance 
mechanisms.  To investigate whether CTC-based gene expression p rofiling could serve as 
an early predictor of response a nd provide clues of resistance mechanisms, blood will be 
collected before, during and at the time of progression to asse ss changes in the gene 
expression profile, including PAM50 molecular classifiers (30-3 2) and cell cycle genes and 
regulators. Very limited data exist regarding the molecular markers for predicting or monitoring treatment response an d resistance to palbociclib, it  h a s  b e e n  r e p o r t e d  t h a t  
CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment shifted ER+/HER2- models from a high  risk (luminal B) to a 
low risk (luminal A) molecular-phenotype (33). We will associat e the baseline and shift of 
CTC-based molecular subtype wit h patients’ clinical response.  This trial will provide this 
valuable data for the development of non-invasive companion dia gnostics or monitoring 
tools for patients to receive palbociclib.

5.1 Agent Administration 
 
Agent Dose Route Schedule Cycle Length 
Palbociclib 125 mg PO 5 days  on and 2 days off, starting 
C1D1 
28 days 
(4 weeks) Letrozole* 2.5 mg PO Daily 
Fulvestrant* [ADDRESS_245612] 3 doses 
followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 28 days 
Goserelin** 3.6 mg SC Every 28 days 
(Day 1 of each cycle) 
* Letrozole OR fulvestrant will  be administered with palbocicli b per physician choice. 
** Only if pre- or peri-menopausal  
 
Patients will be instructed to make use of medication diaries ( Appendices B and C) to act 
as records of administration for palbociclib and letrozole (if applicable). 
 Palbociclib at a dose of 125 mg s hould be taken by [CONTACT_78141] f ood on a 5 days on/2 days 
off schedule (meaning: on Days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 of each 28-day cycle).  If a patient misses a day’s dose entirely, she must be instructed no t to make it up the next day 
but just take her regular dose at the next assigned time.  If a  patient vomits any time after 
taking a dose, she must be instructed not to retake the dose bu t resume subsequent dosing 
at the next assigned time.  If a patient inadvertently takes an  extra dose during a day, she 
must be instructed to not take the next day’s dose.  Patients who have been on stable doses of palboclib for [ADDRESS_245613] 
meet retreatment criteria (as described in Section 6.4) and wil l have labs drawn for 
retreatment (CBC with differential and CMP) and correlative stu dies (serum, plasma, cell-
free DNA, and circulating tumor cells) to correspond with imagi ng studies that take place 
every 2-3 cycles.  This allows patients on stable doses of palbociclib to return to clinic for retreatment at greater intervals.     
Patients who are receiving letrozole will take it daily by [CONTACT_104743] h, every day of each 28-day 
cycle, at a dose of 2.5 mg.  If a patient misses a day’s dose e ntirely, she must be instructed 
not to make it up the next day but  just take her regular dose o n the next day.  If a patient 
vomits any time after taking a dose, she must be instructed not to retake the dose but resume 
subsequent dosing on the next day.  If a patient inadvertently takes an extra dose during a 
day, she must be instructed to not  take the next day’s dose. 
 Patients who are receiving fulvestrant will receive it at a dos e of 500 mg as two 5 mL 
intramuscular injections (one i nto each buttock) on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and then on 
Day 1 of each cycle thereafter.

Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 19 of 68  5.5 Duration of Therapy 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patie nt no longer wishes to continu e protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be disco ntinued and the reason(s) for d iscontinuation documented 
in the case report forms. 
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treat ment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
 Documented and confirme d disease progression 
 Death 
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may  cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rul e out continuation of study drug 
 General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render t he patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the  judgment of the investigator 
 Suspected pregnancy 
 Serious non-compliance with the study protocol

6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
6.1 Hormone Therapy Dose Modifications 
 
No dose adjustments are permitted for fulvestrant or letrozole,  but interruptions are allowed 
at the discretion of the treating physician.  Hormonal therapy should continue while holding 
palbociclib due to palb ociclib related AEs.  
 
6.2 Ovarian Suppression Dose Modifications 
 
No dose adjustments are permitted for goserelin. 
 
  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 20 of 68  6.3 Dose Modifications for Palbociclib 
 
Patients will be monitored for toxicity and the dose of palboci clib may be adjusted as 
indicated in the dose modification table below. 
 
Dose Level Palbociclib 5 Days On / 2 Days Off 
1 (starting dose) 125 mg/day 
-1 100 mg/day 
-2 75 mg/day 
Note that palbociclib dose reduc tion below 75 mg/day is not allowed 
 Dose reduction by 1 and, if needed, 2 dose levels will be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity encount ered.  Patients requiring more than 2 dose reductions will 
be discontinued from the study.  Recommended dose reductions for palbociclib are detailed in the  table below. Doses may 
be held as needed for toxicity resolution during a cycle. Doses omitted for toxicity are not 
replaced or restored within the same cycle (meaning that the cycle remains 28 days regardless of the number of doses of taken).  Treatment with palbociclib should be permanently discontinued i f toxicity has not 
recovered to grade ≤ [ADDRESS_245618] Toxicity During Previo us Cycle New Dose Level 
Grade 4 neutropenia Decrease by [CONTACT_205981] 4 thrombocytopenia Decrease by [CONTACT_205981] 3 neutropenia associated with a 
documented infection or fever ≥ 38.5 ºC Decrease by [CONTACT_205981] ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity (includes nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_205931]) Decrease by [CONTACT_205982] > [ADDRESS_245619] 80% of the planned dose of PD 0332991 due to adverse events possibly related to study treatment Decrease by [CONTACT_205983]: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245620] the EC G repeated 
immediately for confirmation. 
 
Grade 2: no adjustments; continue at same dose level 
Grade 3 (reversible cause ident ified and corrected): withhold treatment until QTc 
≤ 470 msec, then resume treatment at the same dose level 
Grade 3 (no reversible cause identified): withhold treatment un til QTc ≤ 470 msec, 
then decrease palbociclib by [CONTACT_205984] 4: permanently discontinue palbociclib 
 
6.4 Re-Treatment Criteria 
 
A new cycle of treatment wit h palbociclib may begin only if: 
 ANC ≥1,000/mcL. 
 Platelet count ≥50,000/mcL. 
 Non-hematologic toxicities have returned to baseline or Grade ≤ 1 severity (or, at 
the investigator’s discretion, Grade ≤2 if not considered a saf ety risk for the 
patient). 
 Criteria for dose inte rruption within cycle: 
 ANC <500/mcL. 
 Platelet count <50,000/mcL. 
 Re-treatment within the cycle may only be started when ANC ≥500 /mcL and platelet count 
≥50,000/mcL. 
 
Doses omitted for toxicity within a cycle are not replaced or restored within the same cycle (meaning that the cycle remains  28 days regardless of the numbe r of doses of taken). 
 If these conditions are not met, hormone therapy may be continu ed  b u t tr eatm en t w it h  
palbociclib must be delayed by [CONTACT_185883]. If, after a one-week d elay, all toxicities have 
recovered within the limits desc ribed above, treatment with palbociclib can be resumed. 
 If the patient has not recovered after [ADDRESS_245621] dose level, treatment with palbocic lib will be permanently discontin ued.

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION 
 
8.1 Palbociclib (Ibrance) 
 
8.1.1 Palbociclib Description 
 
Molecular Weight: 447.5 
Molecular Formula: C
24H29H7O2 
 
 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 26 of 68  Formulation: Capsules that use common compendial excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (co rn starch, 
microcrystalline cellulose, sodium  starch glycolate, magnesium stearate 
(nonbovine)) will be used in clinical programs.  The capsule sh ells are 
manufactured from gelatin NF. 
 
8.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
 
Palbociclib is a highly selec tive inhibitor of Cdk4/cyclinD 1 kinase activity (IC 50 = 
11 nM; K i = 2 nM). Palbociclib has selectiv ity for Cdk4/6, with little or n o activity 
against a large panel of 34 othe r protein kinases including oth er Cdks and a wide 
variety of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Cdk6, another  enzyme that also 
complexes with cyclin-D subunits, is also commonly expressed in mammalian cells 
and tumors. Cdk6 is highly homologous to Cdk4 and can perform t he same function 
by [CONTACT_205986], thus potentially creating a redundant me chanism to 
promote cell cycle progression. Consequently, inhibition of bot h enzymes is 
necessary to ensure complete suppression of Rb phosphorylation and the greatest 
possible spectrum of antitumor activity. Results indicate that palbociclib inhibits 
Cdk6 with equivalent potency to Cdk4.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_245625] been reported for four studie s (A5481001, 
A5481002, A5481003 and A5481004). Final PK data are available f rom studies 
A5481001 and A5481002.  Pharmacokinetic parameters are availabl e from all 74 
patients enrolled in Protoco l A5481001 following a single-dose (Day 1 of Cycle 1), 
and from 51 patients following mu ltiple-dose admi nistration (Day 8 of Cycle 1) of 
daily doses ranging from [ADDRESS_245626] me asured time point (1 
hour) following oral administration. The exposure (AUC (0-10) and C max) increased 
in a dose-proportional manner over the dose range of 25-225 mg QD following 
palbociclib administration on Days 1 and 8 of Cycle 1, although  some variability 
(low to moderate) around these dos es was observed particularly at the 150 mg QD 
dose level. 
 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 27 of 68   
 
Steady-state PK parameters are available for nine patients on D ay 14 of Cycle 1 
(receiving 200 mg SC 0332991 QD for 2 weeks) and four patients on Day 21 of Cycle 1 (receiving 125 mg QD for 3 weeks).  Palbociclib was abs orbed with a 
median Tmax of ~4 hours. The mean palbociclib Vz/F was 3103 L, which is 
significantly greater than total body water (42 L), indicating that palbociclib 
extensively penetrates into peripheral tissues. Palbociclib was  eliminated slowly; 
the mean elimination half-life (t½) was 26.5 hours and the mean  CL/F was 86.1 
L/hour. Palbociclib accumulated fo llowing repeated dosing with a median Rac of 
2.4, which is consistent with the elimination half-life.   
  

Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5  Page 28 of 68   
 
 
Renal excretion of palbociclib was a minor route of elimination  with ~1.7% of the 
drug excreted unchanged in urine  over the 10-hour collection pe riod in the 125 mg 
and 200 mg dose group, combined. The mean renal clearance (CLR)  w a s  6 . 5 9  
L/hour.   
 
An exploratory evaluation of the circulating metabolites for pa lbociclib was 
conducted in plasma samples obtained from patients treated with  palbociclib [ADDRESS_245627]  study (“A5481021, 
a Phase 1, open-label 4 sequence 4 period crossover study of pa lbociclib (PD-
0332991) in healthy volunteers to estimate the effect of food o n the bioavailability 
of palbociclib”) has provided evidence that when a single 125 m g dose of 
palbociclib was administered under fed conditions (including hi gh fat or low fat 
meal given together with palbociclib, or moderate fat meal give n 1 hour before and 
2 hours after palbociclib) as a freebase formulation the palboc iclib exposure levels 
were more uniform across the popu lation than when taken in the fasting condition.   
   Drug-drug interaction between palbociclib and letrozole was eva luated during the 
Phase [ADDRESS_245628] cancer study (A5481003). The prelim inary data indicate 
a lack of a potential for drug-drug interaction between palboci clib and letrozole 
when administered in combination.

8.1.4 Supplier(s) 
 
[COMPANY_007] will supply the study agent.  The study agent will be free of charge to the 
patient.   
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_245629] until their next study vis it. Unused drug and/or 
empty bottles should be returned to the site at the next study visit. Palbociclib is an 
agent that must be handled and administered with care. Patients  should be instructed 
to keep their medication in the bottles provided and not transf er it to any other 
container. Due to possible unknown hazards associated with topi [INVESTIGATOR_205938], capsules must no t be opened 
and/or emptied into any vehicle f or oral ingestion; capsules must be swallowed 
intact. 
 
8.1.6 Storage and Stability 
 
Palbociclib capsules should be stored at controlled room temper ature (15-25°C, 59-
77°F) in their original containe r. Medication should be kept in  a secured locked 
area at the study site in accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Returned medication should be stored separately from medication  that needs to be 
dispensed.   To ensure adequate records, palbociclib capsules will be accoun ted for as instructed 
by [CONTACT_4618]. Unless otherwise authorized by [CONTACT_4618], at the end of  the clinical trial all 
drug supplies unallocated or unused by [CONTACT_205987]. All containers of palbociclib that were sent to t he investigator 
throughout the study must be returned to the sponsor or designe e, whether they are 
used or unused, and whether they are empty or contain capsules.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_245630]. Patients should take palbociclib with food and shou ld be encouraged to 
take their dose at approximately the same time each day.

8.1.10 QT Interval 
 
The patients enrolled in clinical studies should be closely mon itored for potential 
cardiovascular symptoms. Appropr iate monitoring should include clinical 
examinations, vital signs, rou tine ECGs, and AEs monitoring. In  case of QTc 
prolongation, concomitant condition s such as electrolyte unbalances or use of 
medications affecting the QT int erval should be ruled out or co rrected. In case of 
clinically significant toxici ties, PD 0332991 administration sh ould be interrupted 
and the dose reduced as indicat ed in clinical protocols. 
 In Study A5481001 using QTcF, 46 of 73 patients had a maximum i ncrease from 
baseline of <30 msec and no patient had a maximum on treatment value of  ≥500 
msec. Notably, one female pati ent who had re ceived PD 0332991 at 75 mg QD on 
Schedule 3/1, had a maximum QTcF increase of 67 msec from basel ine to Cycle 1. 
Additionally, QTcF increases ranging from 39 to 51 msec compare d to baseline 
persisted throughout her ECG collection period of 5 subsequent cycles. After 7 cycles, the dose was increased to 100 mg QD. The patient remain ed on treatment 
for a total of 39 cycles with no cardiac related adverse events . QT data analysis for 
study A5481002 indicated no clinically significant mean changes  w i t h  E C G s .  
Using Fridericia's correction in the A5481002 study, all 17 sub jects in the analysis

8.4 Goserelin 
 
8.4.1 Goserelin Description 
 
Synthetic decapeptide analogue of GnRH. 
 
Chemical Name [CONTACT_6822]: [D-Ser(Bu
t)6,Azgly10].  Its chemical 
structure is pyro-Glu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Ser(But)-Leu-Arg-Pro-Azgly-NH 2 
acetate. 
Other Names: Zoladex 
Classification : GnRH agonist 
Molecular Formula: [C59H84N18O14•(C 2H4O2)x where x = 1 to 2.4]   
M.W.:  1269  
Approximate Solubility:  Goserelin is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid. It is 
soluble in water, 0.1M hydrochl oric acid, 0.1M sodium hydroxide , 
dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide. Goserelin acetate is practically 
insoluble in acetone, chloroform and ether [[COMPANY_008], Package Insert]. 
 
8.4.2 Mode of Action 
 Goserelin has actions similar to t hose of naturally occurring GnRH (also known as 
LHRH). Normally, GnRH is released  in a pulsatile manner to main tain levels of 
gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. Goserelin, in contrast, is continuously administered, which leads to down-regulation of the GnRH receptor on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_205939].

Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245652] – Solid Tumors 
 
For the purposes of this study, pa tients should be re-evaluated for response every 12 weeks.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 
weeks following initial documentation of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_205989] d Response Evaluation Criteria i n Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) (34).  C hanges in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph 
nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
12.2 Disease Parameters 
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_245653] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_245654] scan, or >[ADDRESS_245655] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fracti ons of centimeters). 
 
  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5   Page 44 of 68  Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_245656] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesi ons 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 t o <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followe d by [CONTACT_462]), are considere d as non-measurable. 
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined  simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (n either measurable nor non-measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described  above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are prefe rred for selection as target 
lesions.  Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should  be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should b e selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representati ve of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducibl e repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does n ot lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A  sum of the diameters (longe st for non-nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be ca lculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters.  If lym ph nodes are to be included in t he sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The  baseline sum diameters will be  used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable d imension of the disease. 
 Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurabl e lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions ar e not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as poss ible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of t he treatment. 
 
  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5   Page 45 of 68  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during foll ow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148] u nless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they  a r e  
superficial (e.g., skin nodules a nd palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to e stimate the size of the lesi on, is recommended.  
 Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions w hen they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by a erated lung.  However, CT is  preferable.  
 Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_245657] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain s ituations (e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimiz ed for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be m easured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guid elines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and  diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition p rotocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior  scans.  Body scans should be pe rformed with breath-hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  PET-CT:   At present, the low dose or a ttenuation correction CT portion  of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use w ith RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic qua lity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then 
the CT portion of the PET-CT can b e used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring ca ncer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additi onal data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not rou tinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in a ssessment of lesion size and sho uld not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because th ey are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_205990]: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245658] in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be use ful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biops ies are obtained or to determin e relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete re sponse (CR) or surgical resecti on is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If ma rkers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for  a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response.    Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial  
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors , where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any ef fusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met crit eria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differe ntiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may 
be a side effect of the treat ment) and progressive disease. 
 FDG-PET:   While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use  of FDG-PET scanning to comple ment CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease) .  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following  algorithm:  
 
 Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
 No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If  the positive 
FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds t o a new site of disease confi rmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed a s a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to det ermine if there is 
truly progression occurring at t hat site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not  progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner s imilar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is th ought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the p rotocol and supported by [CONTACT_205991] e-specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledge d that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion mean s one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenua tion corrected image.  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5   Page 47 of 68  12.4 Response Criteria 
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all targ et lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study ( this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to  the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered pr ogressions). 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage t o qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m diameters while on 
study. 
 
12.4.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be n on-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non-PD:   Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  A p p e a r a n c e  o f  o n e  o r  m o r e  n e w  l e s i o n s  a n d / o r  unequivocal progression of exis ting non-target lesions.  Unequi vocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be rep resentative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesi on increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “ non-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_205948], and the 
progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_941] r eview panel (or 
Principal Investigator). 
  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #[ADDRESS_245659] response recorded from th e start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as refer ence for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achieveme nt of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note: Patients with a global dete rioration of health status req uiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to  document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

12.4.4 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever i s first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is o bjectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measu rements recorded 
since the treatment started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measuremen t criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is obj ectively documented.  
 Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria fo r progression are met, taking as  reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.

15.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
15.1 Study Description 
 
This is a single arm phase II clinical trial with metastatic HR + HER2- breast cancer patients 
treated by [CONTACT_205994] a 5 days  on/2 days off schedule.  
 The primary endpoint of the trial is the rate of grade 3 or hig her adverse events (AE rate) 
within the first 29 days (equivalently, 1-AE rate, i.e., the pr oportion of patients not 
suffering grade 3 or 4 AEs) The secondary endpoints include AE rate in all cycles, rate of 
palbociclib dose reduction or i nterruption or discontinuation, AE profiles, PFS, ORR, and 
clinical benefit rate.   
15.2 Sample Size Calculations 
 
The rate of grade 3 or higher neutropenia in PALOMA -1 and PALOMA – 3 was 54% and 62% respectively. We anticipate the new schedule to have less t oxicity leading to around 
40%-50% AE rate. The sample size was calculated to test the one -sided null hypothesis 
that 1-AE (adverse event) rate ≤ 0.38 (i.e., AE rate>0.62) vers us the alternative that 1-AE 
rate ≥ 0.6 (i.e., AE rate<0.4). Enrollment of 47 patients will be required to achieve 90% power (actual power=91.8%) base d on one-sample binomial exact t est at a 5% level (actual 
alpha=4.7%). If no grade [ADDRESS_245663] schedule.  
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5   Page 52 of 68   
The CBR was estimated as 84.3% (80%~88%) in 1st line and 67% from PALOMA-3 in 
2nd line patients. With an estimati on that 70% of the enrolled pat ients are 2nd line, we 
expect approximately [ADDRESS_245664] line patients and thus ~22 2nd line 
patients with ~[ADDRESS_245665] line patients with clinical benefit. With 33 2nd line patients, the CBR 
can be estimated with a 95% two-sided Clopper-Pearson exact CI of 48.5~82.3% given 
the true CBR is 67% as in PALOMA-[ADDRESS_245666] line patients can be 
estimated with a 95% CI of 55.5%~97.7% given the true CBR is 84 .3%.  
 
15.3 Data Analysis Plan 
 
Patient characteristics and adverse events profiles will be sum marized by [CONTACT_84814]. AE rate, ORR, CBR will each be estimated accompanie d with 95% confidence 
interval (CI).  PFS will be analyzed by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier method and  1-year PFS rate will be 
estimated with 95% CI. All analyses will be conducted among all  patients, as well as by 
[CONTACT_205995] (e.g., line of therapy).  
 TK1 serum marker will be correlated with absolute neutrophil co unt along measured time 
points and tumor response by [CONTACT_205996]. 
  
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
 
Washington University requires that each participating site sen ds its informed consent document 
to be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_205997] (or designee) 
prior to IRB/IEC submission.     Site activation is defined as when the secondary site has recei ved official written documentation 
from the coordinating center tha t the site has been approved to  begin enrollment.  At a minimum, 
each participating institution must have the following document s on file at Washington University 
prior to study activation: 
 Documentation of IRB approval of  the study in the form of a let ter or other official 
document from the participating institution’s IRB.  This docume ntation must show 
which version of the protocol was approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
 Documentation of IRB approval of an informed consent form. The consent must 
include a statement that data w ill be shared with Washington University, including the 
Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC), the DSMC (if 
applicable), and the Washington University study team. 
 Documentation of FWA, signed FDA Form 1572 (if applicable), and  the CVs of all 
participating investigators. 
 Protocol signature [CONTACT_144904] [CONTACT_205998]. 
 The coordinating center Principal Investigator (or designee) is  responsible for disseminating to the 
participating sites all study upda tes, amendments, reportable a dverse events, etc.  Protocol/consent

weeks of obtaining Washington University I RB approval.  Activat ed secondary sites are expected 
Protocol Version: 04/12/2019 Amendment #5   Page 53 of 68  to submit protocol/consent/IB modifications to their local IRBs  within 4 weeks of receipt unless 
otherwise noted.  Upon the secondary sites obtaining local IRB approval, documentation of such 
shall be sent to the Washingt on University study team within 2 weeks of receipt of approval. 
 
Documentation of participating sites’ IRB approval of annual co ntinuing reviews, protocol 
amendments or revisions, all SAE reports, and all protocol viol ations/deviations/exceptions must 
be kept on file at Washington University.  The investigator or a designee from each institution must parti cipate in a regular conference call 
to update and inform regarding the progress of the trial.

 Page 5 of 27 10-123   1.0 BACKGROUND  
 
1.1 Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas  
Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of death f rom cancer of both men and women in the United 
States.  There are expected to be 37,680 new cases and 34,290 deaths in the [LOCATION_002] in 2008.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_595764], surgical resection remains 
the only tr eatment option associated with long -term survival.  Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer is 
rarely resectable upon diagnosis, with approximately 40% presenting with locally -advanced but 
unresectable disease and an additional 40% presenting with metastatic dise ase.  Within the United 
States, the 5 -year survivals for local, locally -advanced and distant disease are 20%, 8% and 2% 
respectively, resulting in an overall 5 -year survival f or pancreatic cancer of only 5% (1).   These 
values represent all pancreatic cance rs.  Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, representing more than 
90% of all cases, is believed to be the most aggressive malignanc y with an even worse prognosis.  
For patients that are able to undergo surgical resection, the choice of adjuvant therapy remains 
controversial with data available for anything ranging from observation to chemoradiation.  
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_786490] of care after patients underwent  
resection of pancreatic carcinoma.  This was mainly based on a small phase III randomized control 
trial by [CONTACT_389833] (GITSG) (2).  This trial randomized 43 patients to 
surgery with or without adjuvant 5 -FU based chemoradiation .  The radiation was delivered using 
outdated techniques (AP/PA and in a split course) to a total dose of 40 Gy.  The patients in the 
experimental arm also received 2 years of adjuvant 5 -FU.  The experimental arm had a median OS 
of 20 months compared to 11  months in the control arm.  Regardless, 50% of patients in both arms 
still developed local recurrence.  There are also two large retrospective series from Johns Hopkins 
and the Mayo clinic.  The JHU series contains over 600 patients, with 44% having recei ved 5 -FU 
based CRT to a median dose of 50 Gy.  The other 44% did not receive adjuvant therapy.  The CRT 
group had a median OS of 21.2 months compared to 14.4 months in the observation group (3).  The 
Mayo series had [ADDRESS_786491] all patients received 5 -FU.  The median OS again favored CRT with a median OS of 25.2 
months compared to 19.2 months in patients who were observed (4).   
 
A few other studies have examined other adjuvant CRT regim ens utilizing non -5-FU-based 
chemotherapy.  RTOG 9704 compared gemcitabine to 5 -FU before and after 5 -FU based CRT.  The 
study included 451 patients with gross total resection.  The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy delivered 
using modern methods.  There was a tr end towards improved 3 year OS (31% vs. 22%) with the use 
of gemcitabine.  Local recurrence remained a significant source of failure, but was lower compared 
to older studies at approximately 25%.  Distant metastasis remained the most significant site of 
failure at greater than 70%, highlighting the importance of systemic therapy ( 5).  The ACOSOG also 
published a small phase II trial of 89 patients  with R0/1 resection of pancreatic head 
adenocarcinoma treated to 50.4 Gy along with chemotherapy.  The chemothe rapy was relatively 
intense, consisting of 5 -FU, cisplatin, and alpha interferon and 96% of patients had grade 3 toxicity 
or greater.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_595765] 50%, but systemic 
therapy only made up 35% of failure s (6).   
 
1.3 Chemotherapy alone as adjuvant therapy  
There are a few key studies supporting the adjuvant use of chemotherapy alone after resection of 
pancreatic cancer.  ESPAC -1 was a complex 2x2 factorial designed study with over 500 patients.  
The arms w ere 5 -FU based CRT (split course technique), adjuvant 5 -FU/leucovorin alone, both 
 Page 6 of 27 10-123  CRT followed by [CONTACT_147807], or observation.  For all patients, chemotherapy improved median survival 
from 14 months to 19.7 months.  For patients that received chemotherapy the 5 year OS was 21% 
compared to 8%.  When analyzing the effect of CRT, it appeared to have a detriment, with a 5 year 
OS of 10% compared to 20% when chemoradiation was not given.  Drawbacks of this study include 
its complex design, use of outdated radiation te chniques, lack of RT quality assurance, and the 
ability of treating physicians to give “background” therapy ( 7).  The CONKO -001 study 
randomized 368 patients with a R0/R1 resection to observation of gemcitabine alone for 6 cycles.  
The use of adjuvant gemc itabine improved disease free survival from 7 months to 14 months, but 
not OS (22 months vs. 20 months) ( 8).  There was also a metaanalysis published in 2005 examining 
outcomes of patients in randomized adjuvant trials.  This study included 875 patients fr om 6 trials.  
The investigators found that chemotherapy improved median OS from 14 months to 19 months.  
Chemoradiation did not provide a statistically significant benefit (15.2 months to 15.8 months).  Of 
interest, on subgroup analysis it was determined t hat CRT was more effective for patients wit h a 
positive margin resection ( 9).   
 
 
1.3 Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)  
SBRT is technique that combines highly conformal radiotherapy with real -time imaging to deliver 
high doses of radiation in a small n umber of fractions.  Modeled after intracranial stereotactic 
radiosurgery, SBRT has now been studied in a variety of extracranial locations including the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
lung, liver, pancreas, and head and neck cancers.  Because of the precise targeting, SBRT has t he 
potential to improve upon the local control achieved with conventional EBRT while minimizing the 
dose to normal tissue.  Most prospective randomized trials of conventionally fractionated EBRT for 
the treatment of locally -advanced pancreatic cancer have reported  local control rates of 35% -55%  
(2-5).  Koong, et al established the feasibility of using SBRT for locally -advanced pancreatic cancer 
in a phase I dose escalation study which achieved 100% local control with no treatment limiting 
toxicities at 25 Gy in a single fraction  (10). A follow -up study combined conventionally fractionated 
5-FU chemoradiotherapy with an SBRT boost resulting in 94% local control but no improvement in 
overall survival and an increase in toxicity compared to SBRT alone  (11). A recent study combining 
full dose gemcitabine with single fraction SBRT reported 81% local control and 100% [ADDRESS_786492] s (47%) experienced Grade 2 or greater la te toxicities, primarily duodenal ulcers  (12).  It is 
possible that these late toxicities may be reduced by [CONTACT_595769], as studies comparing conventionally 
fractio nated RT with hypofractionated RT have found an increase d incidence of late GI toxicities in 
the hypofractionated group  (13). 
 
Another advantage to SBRT is the fractionation schedule.  First, the entire course of treatment is 
often completed over [ADDRESS_786493] likely to benefit from the local control 
provided by [CONTACT_595770]  
(14-15).  
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_786494] 
pancreatic cancer treate d with SBRT  (16).  With a median follow -up of 12.7 months the freedom 
from local progression at 6 months and 1 year was 72% and 49%, respectively.   Median overall 
survival for the entire group was 10.3 months .  Treatment -related toxicity was minimal with only 3 
patients experiencing acute grade 3 toxicity (4%).  There was no recorded late toxicity.  We have 
been treating patients with close or positive margins with SBRT as well.  We recently  examined 
outcomes in [ADDRESS_786495] -operatively with SBRT  (17).  Sixty -six percent of the patients 
had positive margins and the remainder had close margins of 1 -2.5mm.  The median follow -up was 
1 year.  The freedom from local progression at 6 months and 1 year was 95% and 66%.  There was 
no acute or late grade 3 -4 toxicity, and two patients (8% ) had late grade [ADDRESS_786496] of SBRT followin g resection with a close 
or positive margin .  We hope to improve local control, and through the use of a shortened treatment 
schedule, allow patients to begin systemic therapy earlier.

intravenous con trast starting [ADDRESS_786500] images, fiducial 
marker placement, review of the pathology report, and a detailed discussion with the operating 
surgeon, contours will be drawn of the clinical target volume (CTV), which is def ined as the area at 
risk for microscopic disease.  The planning target volume (PTV) will be equivalent to the CTV 
unless motion is detected on the 4D motion study.  If there is motion, the amount of motion in the 
superior -inferior, lateral, and anterior -posterior directions will be the margin given.   Surrounding 
normal and critical structures  will also be contoured by [CONTACT_595771], liver, small bowel, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and stomach if necessary.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_786501] encompassing the PTV : 
 
12 Gy x 3 fractions (36 Gy total)  
 
In deter mining the radiation dose and fractionation scheme for this protocol, we used the 
linear -quadratic formalism for radiation cell killing to “equate” schemes that vary the dose/fraction 
and number of fractions. This concept of biologically equivalent dose (B ED) states that the total 
effect is given by:   
  
[CONTACT_268014] x (1 + d/
  ()) 
  
where n is the # of fractions and d is the dose/fraction. The “alpha -beta ratio” characterizes the 
radiation response of a particular tissue; a higher value is indicative of a tissue that responds acutely 
to the effects of radiation. Due to their highly proliferative nature, most tumors fall into this 
category.  
This dose scheme (36 Gy in 3 fractions) is biologically equivalent to the previously studied doses in 
the literature (24 Gy in 1 fraction).  We would favor treating in three fr actions, as opposed to one, to 
 Page [ADDRESS_786502] encompassing the planning target volume (PTV) depending on the volume of 
tumor.  
 
Careful evaluation of each plan will be conducted by [CONTACT_595772].  
 
 
The maximum dose (in Gy) within the treatment volume (MD), prescriptions dose (PD), and the 
ratio of MD/PD (as a measure of heterogeneity within the target volume), prescription isodose 
volume (PIV in mm3), tumor volume (TV in mm3), and the ratio of PIV/TV (as a measure of dose 
conformity of the treatment relative to the target) will be r ecorded.  This concept is illustrated in 
Figure 2 . 
 
3.4 Quality of Life Assessment

disease (PD) in the target lesion. Death or development of distant disease is not regarded as an 
event.   For patients that undergo surgical resection, local progression will be defined as disease 
recurrence detected on foll ow-up imaging (CT or FDG -PET/CT) that is located within the SBRT 
target volume.   
6.4.[ADDRESS_786517] e Size and Accrual Rate  
7.2.1 Sample Size  
 
From the Investigators’ treatment experience, the [ADDRESS_786518] of care is 40%.  This phase II study aims to improve it to 60% with SBRT . We plan to have 
[ADDRESS_786519] patient enrolled on study. Under 
assumption of exponential survival, a total of 50 patients will provide 94% power to detect a 
statistically significant improvement in survival by [CONTACT_31806] -sided log -rank test  at significance level 0.05. 
Assuming that there will be no loss to follow up and no ineligible case, a total of 50 patients will be 
accrued  for this trial.  
 
7.2.2 Rate of Accrual  
 
We anticipate that 2 to 4 study -eligible patients will be enrolled per mon th. Thus, our planned study 
size of 50 patients to be enrolled within 24 months is well within our capacity.  
 
7.3. Statistical Analyses  
 
7.3.1. Analysis Set  
 
The data from all evaluable patients will be used in the analyses of survival, safety, tumor respo nse, 
and health related QOL. Evaluable patients are those meeting all of the protocol inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and receiving at least one fraction of SBRT . 
 
7.3.2. Baseline Characteristics  
 
Baseline descriptive statistics on all evaluable patients will  be provided on demographic variables 
(age, sex, race/ethnicity), ECOG performance status, laboratory parameters, the chemotherapy 
regimens that were previously used, the number of treatment cycles and irradiation fractions 
involved, and disease characteri stics, including tumor size and stage.   
 
7.3.3 Analysis of Study Endpoints  
 
Survival (LPFS, OS, TTP) will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method for all evaluable patients 
and the corresponding median survival times (with 95% confidence interval) reporte d. The 2 -year 
LPFS will also be estimated along with its 95% confidence interval. The effect of variables listed in 
Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_786520] time, from baseline through the end of patient follow -up. Generalized linear models (such as 
cumulative logit models18) for repeated meas ures will be used to explore if there are significant 
changes in HRQOL over time.  
 
Using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0), the number of 
patients experiencing adverse events over their course of treatment will be characterize d by [CONTACT_595775], by [CONTACT_584446], and whether the 
event is clinically significant. Attribution of adverse events to treatment (unrelated, unlikely, 
possibly, probably, or definitely) will al so be summarized for any serious adverse events (SAEs), 
CTCAE grade 3 or higher. The percentage of patients experiencing SAEs that are considered to be 
treatment -related (probable or definite) will be determined. The percentage of patients experiencing 
the acute and late toxicities associated with SBRT (as defined in Section 6.4) will also be estimated 
along with its 95% confidence interval.  
 
7.4. Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_595768], with protocol amendment being made as nee ded. For 
safety, we will consider that regimen to be excessively toxic and stop accrual if, at any time, the 
observed rate of grade 3 -5 acute or late toxicity as defined above in Section 6.4 .5  ≥ 33% and at least 
[ADDRESS_786521]  data will be collected by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_21823]’s Protocol Office.  
All data will be secured in a password protected file with observance of all applicable HIPAA 
regulation.  A data safety monitoring board will meet monthly to evaluate toxicity for this trial. 
Subject s/adverse events will be discussed at these monthly disease center meetings. Unexpecte d 
serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and DSMC, and minutes of the monthly disease 
center meetings will be reviewed at the DSMC meetings.

8.2   Safety Reporting  
 
8.2.1   Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
CTCAE term (AE  description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_786523] access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation subject 
administ ered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with t he use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
 
It may include worsening or increase in severity  of signs or symptoms of the illness, increase in 
frequency of signs and symptoms of an int ermittent illness, or the appearance of a new 
manifestation/complication . 
 
Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness should be considered when a subject requires new or 
additional concomitant drug or non -drug therapy for the treatment of that illness during t he study.  
Lack of or insufficient clinical response, benefit, efficacy, or therapeutic effect should not be 
recorded as an adverse event.  The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of 
pre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic effi cacy.  
 
In addition, abnormal objective test findings (e.g., electrocardiogram changes, abnormal 
 Page [ADDRESS_786524] results) that can result in a change in study drug dosage or in discontinuation of the 
drug, or require intervention or diagnostic evaluation to  assess the risk to the subject , should also 
be recorded as adverse events.  Clinically significant changes in physical examination findings 
should also be recorded as adverse events.  For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and 
obtain informa tion adequate both to determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess 
whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate 
notification to UPCI or its designated representative.  
 
All observed or volunteer ed adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to study drug will be recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  The 
investigator will record all adverse events in the CRF and assess each event as to severity and 
causal relationship to study drug.  
‘Expectedness’ : AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting purposes only.   
 
Attribution  of the AE:  
Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 
For all adverse events, sufficient information shou ld be obtained by [CONTACT_595776], (i.e., study drug or other illness).  The investigator is required to assess causality and 
indicate that assessment on the CRF.  Follow -up of the adverse event, after the date of therapy 
discon tinuation, is required if the adverse event or its sequelae persist.  Follow -up is required until 
the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator.  Adverse 
events that continue, or emerge within [ADDRESS_786525] ’s discontinuation or completion of 
the study will be followed until the events resolve, are considered stable, or can be ascribed to 
causes other than study treatment.  
 
All serious AE shall be reported meeting criteria for reporting can be found on  the University of 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159499]’s website at http://www.irb.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu . In the event of such 
adverse event, the investigator must report the event(s) via phone within 24 hours and a written 
report filed within 24 hours to the Principal Investigator, or the UPCI’s Clinical Research Office.

 Right ventricular (RV) failure is the most common cause of death in pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH). No RV -specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123325], in part because the underlying 
mechanisms of RV failure are poorly understood. A growing body of evidence su ggests that 
metabolic abnormalities may underlie RV dysfunction in PAH. Interventions against metabolic 
dysfunction in PAH may protect against RV failure . We have identified abnormalities in fatty acid 
(FA) metabolism in PAH that overlap considerably with disorders of carnitine deficiency. 
Carnitine links to an acyl group, which is required to transport FAs across the mitochondrial 
membrane to undergo beta -oxidation, the  predominate source of ATP production in the human 
heart. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism and acquired carnitine deficiency are associated 
with cardiomyopathy. Acquired deficiency primarily occurs via binding of carnitine to excess 
circulating fatty acids or renal wasting. Carnitine deficiency and PAH are b oth associated with 
insulin re sistance, myocardial lipotoxicity, and mitochondrial oxidative stress. Carnitine 
supplementation in humans and animal models of cardiometabolic dysfunction reverses these 
abnormalities but has not been studied in PAH. In published work, we found that in RV  samples 
from humans with PAH, there is a marked (up to 300 -fold) reduction in acylcarnitines along with 
increased long -chain fatty acids. We also a found a two -fold increase in circulating fatty acids 
FAs in humans with PAH, indicating increased delivery to the myocardium. As a consequence 
of unchecked fatty acid accumulation, we observed [ADDRESS_717811] this 
mechanistic hypothesis , 1) Measure  the oral consumption  of carnitine  in human  PAH.  This aim 
will use food diaries  and carnitine  supplement  use questionnaires  in PAH patients  to test the 
hypothesis  that carnitine  supplementation  is uncommon  in PAH and food consumption  is 
adequate.  Aim 2) Measure the stability over time in plasma carnitine levels in PAH patients.  This 
aim will test the hypothesis that plasma carnitine is not affected by [CONTACT_548480]. We will measure plasma carnitine concentration and markers 
of fatty acid oxidation  at Visit 1  and Visit 2 . 3) Perform  a mechanistic  pi[INVESTIGATOR_548465].  This small  pi[INVESTIGATOR_548466]  (primary  endpoint)  and will 
test for physiologic  effects  using  six minute  walk testing,  echocardiography  and plasma  markers  
of lipid metabolism.

SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER:   
 In a study of 28 PAH patients6 the mean SD of plasma 
carnitine data was 38.6 11.1 uM. The data appeared to be 
normally distributed. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]21, L-carnitine 
supplementation increased free plasma carnitine 
concentration by 22% (Table 3 in21). A sample size of [ADDRESS_717812] 80% power to detect a within subject change in 
means of 8.5 (increase from Visit 1  mean of 38.6 to 47.1 
after 2 weeks of treatment, representing a 22% increase) 
using a paired t -test with a 5% two -sided significance level. 
The standard deviation of within -subject differences is 
assumed to be 8.[ADDRESS_717813] correlation 0.7. We 
plan to study 10 PAH patients in this proof -of-concept 
study. The study has 80% power to detect a within -subject 
change of effect size 1, i.e. change measured as 1 times of 
the SD.  
DATA ANALYSIS:  
The primary endpoint and other continuous endpoints will 
be summarized using the mean, standard deviation, the 
median, and interquartile range. We will use either the 
paired t -test or the Wilcoxon -signed rank test to assess the 
change from Visit 1  on these endpoints. Estimate of mean 
change along with its 95% confidence interval will be 
reported to quantify the treatment effect. To assess 
tolerability of carnitine, we will closely monitor any adverse 
events. For these binary events, proportion of s ubjects w ho 
experience the event will be calculated along with its 95% 
confidence interval. We will use the open -source statistical 
package R48 for analyses.  
  
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  9 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   1 Background  & Significance  
1.1 RV Failure in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  
PAH is a progressive and incurable disease characterized by [CONTACT_548481], elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and eventual 
right ventricular (RV) failure often within [ADDRESS_717814] 60% of unrecognized glucose intolerance in our PAH 
patients, independent of body mass index (BMI)4. The lack of an association with BMI 
suggests that the mechanism of insulin resistance in PAH may be unrelated to increased 
adiposity, per se . In addition, we found elevated plasma free fatty acids and long -chain 
acylcarnitines in humans with PAH compared with matched controls (see Preliminary 
Data)5. More recently, we showed that insulin resistance in PAH specifically involves the 
lipid axis and is detected through peripheral blood abnormalities in triglycerides and lipid 
metabolism6. While many organs may be affected by [CONTACT_30361], the RV is highly 
reliant on fat metabolism and thus susceptible to metabolic disorders. We have 
previously published that the RV in humans with PAH, both alive and at autopsy, has 
enhanced lipid content5,7. We have also demonstrated that this lipotoxicity is due to 
increased lipid import via CD36 and reduced fatty acid oxidation in cardiomyocytes8. We 
also demonstrated in human samples an increase in plasma free fatty acid delivery to 
the PAH RV and a marked (100 -300 fold) reduction in myocardial long -chain 
acylcarnitine concentration, suggesting reduced fatty acid oxidation5. These findings 
provide strong evidence that metabolic dysregulation, and specifically lipid metabolism, 
is an important feature of PAH and that the RV appears impacted by [CONTACT_548482].  
1.3 Carnitine Metabolism in Health and Disease: Focus on the heart  
Carnitine is a nutrient required for the transport of long -chain fatty acids as acylcarnitines 
across the mitochondrial membrane to undergo beta -oxidation and subsequent ATP 
production9. Carnitine is particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and the myocardium, 
where fatty acids are the predominant substrate for energy production10. The presence 
of adequate carnitine in myocardial cells is essential for normal fatty acid metabolism. 
Reduced availability of carnitine from any cause leads to impaired fatty acid oxidation 
and muscle dysfunction. When carnitine binds fatty acids, acylca rnitines are formed and 
then normally undergo beta -oxidation. In conditions of excess circulating free fatty acids 
(e.g. diabetes and heart failure), acylcarnitines are formed in excess of mitochondrial 
oxidative capacity. This results in a depletion of ca rnitine, reduced fatty acid oxidation, 
oxidant stress, and accumulation of toxic lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Excess acylcarnitines are excreted from 
cells and elevated levels can be detected in the plasma in conditions of abnormal 
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  10 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   carnitine metabolism9. Oleoylcarnitine and three other long -chain acylcarnitines are 
strongly associated cardiovascular mortality in a dialysis population11; the same four 
acylcarnitines were most elevated in our PAH population compared to healthy subjects5.  
Cardiomyocytes cannot synthesize carnitine, which must be acquired exogenously. 
Thus, deficiencies, even relative, in carnitine have particularly adverse effects in 
cardiomyocytes. Inborn errors of carnitine metabolism involve abnormal transporter 
function  and present with severe, often fatal, cardiomyopathy12. Secondary carnitine 
deficiency occurs because the available carnitine is bound to excess fatty acids or due to 
renal wasting13. Acquired carnitine deficiency has been described in dialysis therapy, 
diabetes, and heart failure, among other conditions14-16. Chronic carnitine deficiency is 
associated with insulin resistance, lipid -induced cardiomyopathy, and increased 
mitochondrial oxidative stress16. Carnitine supplementation in humans and experimental 
models appears to mitigate these defects. In humans with heart failure, carnitine 
improves diastolic and systolic dysfunction and may reduce cardiovascular events15,17. In 
diabetics, carnitine reduces myocardial free FA uptake and circulating long -chain 
acylcarnitines. In mice exposed to doxorubicin, carnitine reduces ceramide production 
and apoptosis. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that maintenance of intrace llular 
carnitine may be beneficial for cardiometabolic function.  
1.[ADDRESS_717815] has not 
established a recommended dietary allowance for carnitine and it is not considered an 
essential nutrient19. Nonetheless, relative carnitine deficiency develops in numerous 
inborn and chronic diseases, indicating that background ingestion is not sufficient to 
prevent depletion in some states13,18,20 and that normal plasma carnitine 
concentration may not be adequate for tissue needs depending on the demand21. 
This observation suggests that supplementation may be required to prevent or reverse 
depletion in at risk individuals despi[INVESTIGATOR_548468]. There are no 
published data on frequency of vegetarian or vegan diet in PAH that may predispose to 
deficiency or use of carnitine supplementation in this disease state.  
1.5 Carnitine Supplementation in Humans  
Given its safety and role in energy production, carnitine has been studied extensively 
and even touted as a performance enhancer for professional athletes. Although the liver 
and kidneys in a healthy human can metabolize the amino acids lysine and methioni ne 
to meet daily carnitine needs19, carnitine supplements are widely available. Carnitine 
supplementation has primarily been in the form of L -carnitine, or levocarnitine, which is 
the active form in the body22, that has a bioavailability of approximately 25%22,23. After an 
oral dose of 30 -100mg/kg body weight, peak plasma carnitine concentration occurs at [ADDRESS_717816] of long -term supplementation with L -carnitine, healthy 
adult men were fed similar doses (2g/day) of L -carnitine per day or placebo for 15 days. 
Subjects in the supplementation group maintained total plasma concentrations that wer e 
about 25 umol/L higher than in the control group, thus demonstrating the ability of 
carnitine supplementation to increase plasma carnitine over two weeks22. While there 
are no data on the effect of oral carnitine supplementation on cardiac carnitine content, a 
2g/day oral L -carnitine supplement can modesty increase the skeletal muscle carnitine 
concentration by [CONTACT_2902] 13% over four weeks25. Carnitine supplementation has been tried 
in ageing, where it has had no effect on muscle strength21, however after acute 
myocardial infarction, a meta -analysis demonstrated that L -carnitine supplementation 
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  11 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   reduced mortality, ventricular arrhythmias and angina over two months26. L-carnitine can 
be metabolized by [CONTACT_548483] -N-oxide (TMAO) 
which is associated with increased cardiovascular risk27. However, limited prospective 
data exist to support this notion and none related to PAH or RV failure, which is not an 
atherosclerotic disease. Moreover, survival in PAH is generally fewer than 10 years28, 
thus the relevance of TMAO to PAH is unclear.

Subjects will rate at resting and peak exercise.  
5.2.3  WHO Functional Class  
The WHO functional classification for PAH has been modified from the 
well-known [LOCATION_001] Heart Association functional classification. This 
functional classification is based on symptoms, with Class I being defined 
by [CONTACT_341886], Class II as having mild li mitation in physical activity, 
Class III as having markedly limited physical activity and Class IV as being 
unable to perform any physical activity. The WHO functional class will be 
assessed at Visit 1 , Visit 2 visits and Visit 4  visits.  
5.2.4  Blood Biomarkers  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lipid Metabolism  
Fasting plasma lipid metabolites will be evaluated via non -targeted 
metabolomics screen. Mass spectroscopy metabolites such as 
LDL, HDL, and triglycerides  will be performed at Visit 1 , Visit 2 , 
Visit 3  and Visit 4 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fatty Acid Metabolism  
Elevated circulating fatty acids and acylcarnitines contribute to RV 
lipotoxicity . To evaluate the effect of this intervention on fatty acid 
metabolism, we will measure fasting long -chain fatty acid and 
acylcarnitine profiles using mass spectrometry at Visit 1  and Visit 
2.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plasma NT -proBNP  
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  18 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   Plasma NT -proBNP reflects right ventricular function in PAH and is 
a strong predictor of outcome in PAH. BNP will be assessed at 
Visit 1 , Visit 2 , Visit 3, and Visit 4 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  TMAO  
Trimethylamine -N-oxide (TMAO) is associated with increased 
cardiovascular risk27 and presents as a detrimental carnitine effect. 
As a safety endpoint, TMAO will be measured via mass 
spectroscopy.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_717827] focused on metrics, which are predictors of survival in PAH, 
including RV strain and qualitative RV function. The following metrics will 
be obtained: 1) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE); 2) RV 
& LV ejection fraction51; 3) RV fractional area change; 4) tricuspid annul ar 
velocity (S’); 5) tricuspid regurgitant (TR) velocity; 6) RV systolic pressure 
(estimated from the equation: RV systolic pressure = 4(maximum TR 
velocity)61 + right atrial pressure); 7) right atrial pressure59; 8) RV & LV 
diastolic function53; 9) RV free wall longitudinal strain54,60. All 
measurements will be performed according to the American Society of 
Echocardiography guidelines51,53,59. 
5.2.6  Other Feasibility Endpoints  
a) Drop Out Rates  
b) Side effects and tolerability of supplementation including carnitine  
5.2.7  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371481]/or right -sided heart failure 
will be defined as a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548471]/or PAH symptoms (e.g., syncope) refractory to outpatient 
increases in dose or frequency of diu retics or specific PAH medications.  
We will record all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371483]. Records from 
each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_371484]. These 
records will be reviewed by [CONTACT_39109] (DSMB), 
which is unrelated to the st udy. 
5.2.8  Death  
 Cardiovascular Death: We define as cardiovascular death:  
1) sudden death  
2) death preceded by [CONTACT_548486]:  
a) cardiogenic shock defined by [CONTACT_5640]:  
i. hypotension resulting in a failure to maintain normal renal  
ii. cerebral function for >15 minutes prior to death)  
b) heart failure symptoms or signs requiring one of the following:  
i. intravenous therapy or oxygen in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548472] #: 2.1  19 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   ii. confinement to bed  in the absence of secondary causes (such as 
systemic infection or dysfunction of intravenous or subcutaneous 
medication delivery devices) or alternative causes of death.  
Non-Cardiovascular Death: A death which does not meet the criteria above will 
be considered a non -cardiovascular death.  
6 Statistical Considerations  
6.1 Study Design  
In a study for 28 PAH patients6 the mean  SD of plasma carnitine data was 
38.611.1 uM. The data appeared to be normally distributed. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]21, 
L-carnitine supplementation increased free plasma carnitine concentration by 
22% (Table 3 in21). A sample size of [ADDRESS_717828] 80% power to detect a within 
subject change in means of 8.5 (increase from Visit 1  mean of 38.6 to 47.1 
after 2 weeks of treatment, representing a 22% increase) using a paired t -test 
with a 5% two -sided significance level. The standard deviation of within -subject 
differences is assumed to be 8.[ADDRESS_717829] correlation 0.7. We plan to study 10 PAH 
patients in this proof -of-concept study. The study has 80% power to detect a 
within -subject change of effect size 1, i.e. change measured as [ADDRESS_717830] to assess the 
change from Visit 1  on these endpoints. Estimate of mean change along with 
its 95% confidence interval will be reported to quantify the treatment effect. To 
assess tolerability of carnitine, we will closely monitor any adverse events. For 
these binary events, proportion of s ubjects w ho experience the event will be 
calculated along with its 95% confidence interval. We will use the open -source 
statistical package R57 for analyses.  
6.3 Subjects’ retention and supplement compliance  
We will enforce subject retention in several ways. We will record extensive 
contact [CONTACT_341885]. This will 
include home, work, and cellular telephone numbers. The research 
coordinator will call before each study visit to remind the subject to attend. 
Subjects will be reimbursed for time at the clinic for research procedures 
and reasonable travel expenses necessary for their participation in the 
study. Subjects will receive  $75 each for Visit 1 and Visit 2,  $100 for Visit 3, 
and $150 for Visit 4. The total reimbursement for completing all study 
procedures will be $400.  
The research coordinator and physician will explain the importance of 
compliance with the study protocol at each subject contact. If a subject fails 
to comply with a study visit, the coordinator will contact [CONTACT_548487]. If this fails, the coor dinator will send two letters, one week apart, 
to request follow -up.

can lead to infection at the site of the blood draw. The amount of blood drawn 
is small and represents an exceedingly small percentage of the amount of the 
total blood volume and will not r epresent a significant risk to the patient.

9.2 Safety and Adverse Even t 
9.2.1  Definitions of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Problem (UP):  any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
1) unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and b) the characteristics the subject population 
being studied ; 
2) related or possibly related to participation in the research (Possibly 
related to participation  in the research means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the AE, experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459]) ; and  
3) suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater 
risk of harms (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) that was previously known or recognized.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE):  Any symptom, sign, illness, or experience 
that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the 
study. Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as 
AEs. Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered 
to be  AEs if the abnormality:  
• Results in study withdrawal  
• Is associated with a serious AE  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_548489] #: 2.1  23 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   [IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Adverse reactions are classified 
as serious or non -serious. A serious adverse event is any AE 
that is:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• An important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life 
threatening but  are clearly of major clinical significance. They may 
jeopardize the subject and  may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or 
abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548473]. All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for 
serious should  be regarded as non-serious AEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Reaction : any adverse event for which 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse event. For reporting purposes, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug/investigational product and th e adverse event.  
9.2.2  Classifying AEs  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity : the intensity of the AE is classified according to the 
CTCAEv4.0. Grade refers to the severity (intensity) of the AE:  If 
the intensity of an AE worsens during study drug administration, 
only the worst intensity should be reported on the AE page. If 
the AE lessens in intensity, no change in the severity is required.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 2: moderate;  minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention 
is indicated; limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities or daily living 
(ADL; instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422856], using the telephone, managing money, etc).  
CTCAEv4 Grade 3: severe  or medically significant but not immediately 
life threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548474]; disabling; limiting to self -care ADL (self -care ADL refers to 
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  24 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden)  
CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life -threatening  consequences; urgent intervention is 
indicated.  
CTCAEv4 Grade 5 : death due to an AE.   
In this grading system, severity is not equivalent to seriousness. For 
example, a SAE would be any events which is life -threatening or disabling 
(Grade 4) or fatal (Grade 5) or was moderate -severe (Grade 2 -3) and 
required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness : AEs must be assessed as to whether they were 
expected to occur or were unexpected, meaning not anticipated 
based on current knowledge found in the protocol, investigator 
brochure, product insert, or label.  
Expected:  an AE known to be associated with the intervention or 
condition under study. OHRP defines an unexpected AE as any AE 
occurring in one or more subjects participating in a research protocol, 
the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with  either:  
1) the known or foreseeable risk of AEs associated with the 
procedures involved in the research that are described in a) the 
protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current 
IRB-approved informed  consent document, and b) other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package 
inserts; or  
2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, 
disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the AE and 
the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relatedness  
1) Definite: the AE is clearly related to the research procedures  
2) Probably:  the AE is likely related to the research procedures  
3) Possible:  the AE may be related to the research procedures  
4) Unlikely:  the AE is doubtfully related to the research procedures  
5) Unrelated:  the AE is clearly not related to the research procedures  
Possibly related to participation in the research: There is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event experience, or outcome may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_3459].  
For each identified AE, an AE entry on the appropriate form will be 
completed using the above classifications as soon as possible, updating 
as necessary. Reporting procedures should be started immediately (within 
24 hours) upon learning of a SAE or UP.  
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  25 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   9.2.3  Interpretation  of Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AE and UP Reporting Period  
The study period during which AEs must be reported is normally defined 
as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the 
study treatment follow -up. For this study, the study treatment follow -up is 
defined as [ADDRESS_717837] administration of study treatment .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting Procedures   
Any adverse event that occurs will be reported to [CONTACT_548496] R. Hemnes, 
MD, or [CONTACT_548497], MD, within [ADDRESS_717838]’s best  interest. A subject should be withdrawn 
from the study if there is:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Termination of study  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_548475].  
In order to preserve the integrity of the intention -to-treat analysis, even if 
the subject is withdrawn from the treatment portion of the protocol (either 
due to subject, physician, or investigator decision), it is imperative to 
continue with the scheduled  follow -up assessments both for the safety of 
the subject and for completeness of data collection. This will be explained 
to potential subjects at the time of informed consent. The importance of 
compliance with study visits will be reinforced throughout th e trial.  
9.3 Confidentiality  
In this study, each patient will be assigned a unique Participant ID number 
(PID) when his/her demographic and race/ethnicity information is entered for 
the first time. Follow -up data are subsequently entered as needed when a 
patient has a clinic visit. Th e unique PID number remains with each patient 
permanently and is matched with all new data entered. The PID number and 
patient identifiers are directly linked in the study database.  
 
Study personnel will also generate a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) for each 
subject using a NIH tool client. This is an identifying code assigned to a single 
research participant so that data can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_548476] (PII), even if the data are 
collected at different locations or by [CONTACT_371517]. The GUID is created 
using PII (including, current name, legal given name [CONTACT_371521] (first , middle, 
and last), date of birth, city of bir th, state of birth, country of birth, and physical 
sex at birth). Data including the GUID (without other identifiers) is considered 
Carnitine    Protocol  
Protocol Version #: 2.1  26 
Protocol Date: 9.7.21   de-identified by [CONTACT_371518]. Personal identifying information used to 
generate the GUID will be erased by [CONTACT_548490].  
 
The potential for data sharing has been included in the informed consent. Data 
releases to investigators for approved research purposes and analyses (after 
review and approval by [CONTACT_548491] n of a Data Use Agreement) will be stripped of 
identifiers using a “Safe Harbor” approach. If an approved investigator has 
conducted a separate study in which a shared participant has also consented 
to use of GUID then this will be retained in the data rel ease; however, for all 
other data releases the GUID will be removed.  
 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed 
according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Those regulations require a signed subject 
authorization  informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects 
in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of 
their PHI  
9.[ADDRESS_717839] been removed. As an additional 
precaution all  HIPAA regulated information is stored in an electronic file 
separate from other study data. Only approved study staff (determined by [CONTACT_1600]) will be given authorization to access the database. Bio -specimens are 
processed and labeled with barcode labels th at include the subjects 
electronically generated study code and date of sample collection. The bio -
specimens are stored in locked freezers in the study Laboratory; only approved 
study staff has access to the keys for each freezer. Access to the electronic 
freezer inventory of the specimens is kept on a secure password protected 
computer.  
9.[ADDRESS_717840] 6 years after study completion, but the possibility exists 
for indefinite archival of study information via the REDCap database. Should 
the outcome of t his study prompt future investigations, the participants may be

studies.

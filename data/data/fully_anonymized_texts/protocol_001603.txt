BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION FOR CONDUCTING THE 
TRIAL
Successful human reproduction is dependent upon the influence of progesterone on endometr ial 
structure and receptivity . Once the corpus luteum is formed after ovulation, it begins to secrete 
progesterone, which is necessary  and sufficient to decidualize the endometrium to facilitate 
implantation. If conception and implantation occur, increasing concentrations of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) drive continued secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum, which is 
critical for the maintenance of the endometrium. Progesterone continues to be produced b y the 
corpus luteum until the seventh or eighth week of gestation, at which time the placenta becomes 
the primary  site of production for the remainder of pregnancy .
Administration of exogenous progesterone to support luteal function has been utilized in the 
treatment of infertility , particularl y with ART. A number of studies have demonstrated that the 
use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogs during controlled ovarian stimulation is 
associated with defects in corpus luteal function. Progesterone supplementation after the transfer 
of a fresh, autologous embry o has been shown to improve pregnancy  rates.
Vaginal routes of progesterone administration have been shown to allow effective targeted 
delivery  for various indications, including supplementation of corpus luteal function. The vaginal 
route offers several important advantages over other methods: it is convenient and acceptable for

and it rarel y produces allergic or other adverse reactions.
A flexible, non -degradable progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) has been developed, releasing an 
average of 11 mg  progesterone/day  consistently  over 7 day s.The progesterone (20% w/w) is in a 
micronized formulation and dispersed evenly  throughout the ring. 
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] p hase 3 trial (Teva Women’s Health, Inc. Study  DR-PGN -302) evaluating the 
efficacy  and safet y of PVR used for luteal phase support in women undergoing in vitro 
fertilization (I VF), the primary  endpoint was clinical pregnancy  rate at 8 and 12 weeks of 
pregna ncy.Once -
weekl y PVR was statistically  non-inferior to the active comparator, dail y 8% 
progesterone vaginal gel, in women 18- 34 years of age. Secondary  efficacy anal yses included 
evaluations of live birth rate, cy cle cancellation rate, rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of 
biochemical pregnancy , and rate of ectopic pregnancy  for each treatment group. These rates were 
similar between the 2 active treatment groups and consistent with reported background rates.
Weekly  PVR insertion appeared to be safe and well tolerated. Adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (S AEs) were similar for both active treatment groups, and no significant safet y 
trends were noted for PVR. Treatment -related AEs were generally  similar between the [ADDRESS_281311] because of a 
bleeding issue. There were no increased rates of cervical/vaginal abrasions or irritation associated 
with use of a vaginal ring compared with vaginal gel.
Manufacturing enhancements for the PVR were impleme nted subsequent to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 
trial. Therefore, a bioequivalence trialwas conducted to compare the PVR manufactured using 
the new process to the ring manufactu red by  [CONTACT_233161] (the phase 3 clinical trial 
material). The results from the pharmacokinetic trial(DR201- BE-[ZIP_CODE]) demonstrated that the 
PVR manufactured with the new process was bioequivalent to the PVR produced from the legacy  
process. The safet y data indicated that both rin gs were similarl y safe and well tolerated b y 
healthy , postmenopausal female subjects who were pretreated with estrogen.
The present trial assesses the safet y and tolerability of the PVR manufactured with the new 
process when used for luteal phase support i n women undergoing ART. While the design of the 
proposed trialis similar to that of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] p hase [ADDRESS_281312] been implemented as requested by  [CONTACT_137349] .

METHODOLOGY
This is an open -label, single -arm, safety trialof PVR for luteal phase support in women 
undergoing IVF with fresh oocy tes.Women between the ages of 18 and 34 years with tubal, 
idiopathic, male factor, ovulatory  dysfunction, or endometriosis -linked infertility , who agree to 
be considered for inclusion in the trial, will be invited to be seen at the trialsite.
Once informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects will be started on an ovarian down -
regulation / suppression protocol utilizing combined oral contraceptives supplied by [CONTACT_233163] 
≥14 day s to ≤21 days (based upon the site standard of care), with leuprolide a cetate at a dose of 
0.1mL (500 µg)/day  beginning 4days prior to the last birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_233132] ≥10 day s to 
≤20days; ovarian suppression is to begin in the cycle immediately  prior to the ovarian 
stimulation cy cle.After suppression, an ovarian stimulation protocol will begin on the second or 
third day after the start of menses 
with a reduction in leuproli de acetate dose to 0.05 mL  
(250 µg/day ) followed by  [CONTACT_233164] y determined ovarian stimulation protocol with highl y 
purified, human menopausal gonadotropin (HP -hMG; MENOPUR) at an initial dose o f 
225IU/day  for [ADDRESS_281322] response. Dose adjustments should not be made more 
frequentl y than once every two days and should not exceed 150 IU per adjustment. The 
maximum daily  dose of MENOPUR should not exceed 450 IUand the minimum daily  dose 
should not be lower than 75 IU .MENOPUR dosing should not continue for >20 day sand 
coasting is not allowed .
Subjects will be monitored to determine when to trigger ovulation with

the hCG trigger. Subjects who do not reach this threshold after 20 day s of stimulation are to be 
discontinued from the trial. If the estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, hCG should not be 
administered and the subject should be discontinued from the trial.
Oocy te retrieval will occur approximately  35-[ADDRESS_281324]

PVR (PVR1) at the trial site
.The PVR will remain in place a minimum of 23 hours/day .The 
subject will remove PVR1 before fresh embry o transfer and reinsert it after the transfer .Fresh 
embry o transfer will occur 5 day s after oocy te retrieval per the trialsite’s protocol. The number 
of embry os to transfer must be guided b y the 2017 American Societ y for Reproductive Medicine 
(ASRM) and the Societ y for Assisted Reproductive Technology  (SART) guidelines 
(SART/ASRM 2017): women with the expectation of one or more high -quality  embry o(s)
available for cry opreservation, and women with previous live birth after an IVF cy cle, will have
transfer of a single blastocy st. All other women will have transfer of no more than two 
blastocy sts.Additional PVRs will be distributed for weekl y insertion, with the second PVR 
(PVR2) to be inserted at home [ADDRESS_281325] PVR (PVR1) , and 
the third PVR (PVR3) to be inserted either at home or at the site 7 day s follo wing the insertion of 
PVR2 .
Two weeks after oocy te retrieval, a blood draw will be performed to measure serum levels of 
progesterone and β -hCG. Subjects with a β- hCG level <5 mIU/mL will be discontinued from the 
trial.Those with a β -hCG level ≥5mIU/mL will insert their next PVR and continue in the trial
for up to a total of 10 weeks 
(up to a total of 10 PVRs). Additional serum pregnancy  tests will be 
performed at 2 weeks + 3 -4 day s and at 3 weeks. Subjects who are no longer pregnant will be 
discontinued from the trial. Subjects with positive β -hCG results at 3 weeks will insert PVR4 and 
receive PVR5 and PVR6 to be inserted weekl y.
A TVUS will be performed to document the pre sence of an intrauterine gestational sac 4 weeks + 
3-[ADDRESS_281326] will be treated according to the site’s standard protocol and will be withdrawn from the 
trial. Six weeks after oocy te ret rieval, a TVUS will be performed to determine the presence and 
number of gestational sacs with/without fetal heart beat.Pregnant subjects will insert PVR7 and 
receive additional PVRs to be inserted weekl y (PVR8, PVR9, and PVR10). Ten w eeks after 
oocy te retrieval (if the subject is pregnant), an ultrasound (either transvaginal or abdominal) will 
be performed to determine the number of gestational sacs present with and without fetal heart 
beat and the estimated gestational age.
Safety  will be monitored throu

STATISTICAL METHODS
Primary Analysis
At the final anal ysis, the cumulative rate of any  spontaneous abortion, including spontaneous 
clinically  recognized pregnancy  loss and blighted ovum during the trial(up to Week 12 following 
oocy te retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh e mbryo transfer will be estimated
(i.e.,modified intention -to-treat [mI TT] population). 
The number and rate of any  spontaneous abortions (occurring on or before 12 weeks following 
oocy te retrieval) for subjects in the mITT cohort will be summarized and th e associated two -
sided exact 95% confidence interval will be generated. Upon generating the two -sided exact 
95% confidence interval, the upper bound of the interval will be assessed for whether it excludes 
or fails to exclude a spontaneous abortion rate of 15%.
Determination of Sample Size
Statistical simulations have been performed to understand the operating characteristics under 
varying assumptions for both the sample size of the mITTanalysis population and the “true” 
proportion of spontaneous abortions. For each simulation rep etition , a sample of subjects was 
simulated using the binomial distribution and a given pair of sample size and “true” proportion of 
spontaneous abortions assum ptions. A two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasthen created 
based on the simulated data and the upper bound of this confidence interval wascompared to the 
threshold of 0.15 ( corresponding to a spontaneous abortion rate of 15%). If the upper bound o f 
the two- sided 95% exact confidence interval wasless than 0.15, the simulation rep etition was

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALdeclared a “success”. If, however, the upper bound of the two-sided 95% exact confidence 
interval wasgreater than or equal to 0.15, the simulation rep etition was declared a “failure”. This 
process wasrepeated 10,000 times for each combination of assumed sample size and “true” 
proportion of spontaneous abortions. The proportion of simulation rep etition successes to the 
total number of simulation rep etitions then describe d the power of the proposed trialgiven the 
pair of assumptions.
If the “true” spontaneous abortion rate is 8%, 9%, or 10%, the sample size required to achieve 
80% power to exclude the possibility  of a 15% spontaneous abortion rate after the use o f PVR is 
180, 240, or 365, respectively .Taking the middle of this range, a trialwith [ADDRESS_281335] 1 dose of IMP, and had completed fresh embry o 
transfer. The safet y cohort comprises all subjects treated with IMP. The eligible subjects (ES) 
cohort consists of all subjects who were deemed eligible for trialparticipation based on inclusion 
and exclusion criteria at screening and treated with oral contraceptives, leuprolide acetate ,or 
MENOPUR.
Theprimary  objective is to estimate the cumulative rate of an y spontaneous abortion, including 
spontaneous clinicall y recognized pregnancy loss and blighted ovum during the trial(up to 
Week 12 following oocy te retrieval) for subjects in the mI TT cohort. Thenumber and rates of 
any spontaneous abortions will be summarized and associated exact 95% confidence intervals 
will be generated. Furthermore, 
as part of a Bayesian sensitivity  analysis, a95% credible interval
will be generated . The spontaneous abortion rate, biochemical abortion rate, clinical pregnancy  
rate, and positive β -hCG rate will be similarly  analy zed for the mITT and safety  cohort, for 
subject s that had oocy te(s
)retrieved. However, for these endpoints, credible intervals will not be 
derived. Furthermore, safety  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_233165]-emergent AEs for the 
safet y and ES cohort s. Treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized overall, by  [CONTACT_479] ( intensit y),

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Successful human reproduction is dependent upon the influence of progesterone on endometrial 
structure and receptivity .Once the corpus luteum is formed after ovulation, it begins to secrete 
progesterone, which is necessary  and sufficient to decidualize the endometrium to facilitate 
implantation. If conception and implantation occur, increasing concentrations of human chorionic 
gonadotropin (hCG) drive continued secretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum, which is 
critical for the maintenance of earl y pregnancy and the endometrium (Penzias, 2002). Progesterone 
continues to be produced by  [CONTACT_233167], at 
which time the placenta becomes the primary  site of production for the remainder of pregnancy .
Unfortunatel y, not all women of reproductive a ge are able to become pregnant or maintain a 
pregnancy ; indeed, [ADDRESS_281347] received an 
infertility  service at some time in their lives. The administration of exogenous progesterone to 
support luteal fu nction has been utilized in the treatment of infertility , particularl y with assisted 
reproductive technology  (ART). Assisted reproductive technology  generally  involves the surgical 
removal of eggs from a woman’s ovaries, fertilizing them with sperm in the laboratory , and then 
returning them to either the donor woman’s or another woman’s uterus 
(Centers forDisease Control, 2005
).For man y women, in conjunction with ART, steps must be 
taken to prime the uterus for implantation and to sustain the pregnancy  after implantation. Many  
tools have been developed to aid in this process.
In the middle of the 1980s, gonadotrophin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists were incorporated 
into ovarian stimulation regimens and are associated with improved outcomes after in vitr o 
fertilization (I VF) and other ARTs. These GnRH agonists work b y suppressing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_233135] (LH) during IVF cy cles and 
allowing time for a larger number of oocy tes to reach maturity  prior to harvesting. However, GnRH 
agonists inhibit the corpora lutea in these cy cles and may  create an iatrogenic luteal phase defect.
Use of a GnRH agonist causes suppression of pi[INVESTIGATOR_233136] [ADDRESS_281348] dose, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_233137] 2 -3 weeks after the end of therapy .
Without this LH signal, the corpus luteum may  be dy sfunctional, and subsequent progesterone and 
estrogen secretion may  be abnormal, compromising endometrial receptivity  and potential ly leading 
to decreased implantation and pregnancy  rates ( Pritts, 2002 ).
Various hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and hCG have been used during the luteal 
phase and bey ond in IVF cy cles for luteal phase support. A 1994 meta -analy sis showed that the use 
of hCG or progesterone led to significantly  higher pregnancy  rates than placebo ( Soliman, 1994 ).
Most treatment protocols advocate the use of progesterone throughout the first trimester of 
pregnancy , since corpus luteum activity  has been demonstrated up to Week [ADDRESS_281349] 
become compromised durin g ovulation induction or oocy te retrieval ( Penzias, 2002 ).

Vaginal Ring
Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMoreover, the vaginal route of progesterone administration has been shown to allow effective 
targeted delivery  for various indications, including supplementation of corpus luteal function. The 
vaginal route offers several important advantages over other methods: it is convenient and 
acceptable for man y patients, is not painful, does not require an y special equipment, sy stemic levels 
are low, and it rarel y produces allergic or other adverse reactions .Therefore, a flexible, 
non-degradable progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) has been developed, releasing an average of 
11mg progesterone/day  consistently  over 7 day s.The progesterone (20% w/w) is in a micronized 
formulation and dispersed evenl y throughout t he ring.
1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] p hase 3 trial (Teva Women’s Health, Inc. Study  DR-PGN -302) evaluating the efficacy  
and safet y of a progesterone vaginal ring ( PVR )used for luteal phase support in women undergoing 
IVF, the primary  endpoint was clinical pregnancy
 rate at 8 and 12 weeks of pregnancy .Once 
weekl y PVR was statistically non -inferior to the active comparator, daily  8% progesterone vaginal 
gel, in women 18 -34 years of age. Secondary  efficacy  anal yses included evaluations of live birth 
rate, cy cle cancellation rate, rate of spontaneous abortion, rate of biochemical pregnancy , and rate 
of ectopic pregnancy  for each treatment group. These rates were similar between the 2 active 
treatment groups and consistent wit h reported background rates. Weekl y PVR insertion appeared to 
be safe and well tolerated. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse event s (SAEs) were similar 
for both active treatment groups, and no significant safet y trends were noted for PVR. Treatment -
related AEs were generally  similar between the [ADDRESS_281350] because of a bleeding issue. There were no 
increased rates of cervical/vaginal abrasi ons or irritation associated with use of a vaginal ring 
compared with vaginal gel.
Manufacturing enhancements for the PVR were impleme nted subsequent to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 
trial. Therefore, a bioequivalence trialwas conducted to compare the PVR manufactured using the 
new process to the ring manufactu red by  [CONTACT_233161] (the phase 3 clinical trial material). The 
results from the pharmacokinetic trial(DR201- BE-[ZIP_CODE]) demonstrated that the PVR 
manufactured wi th the new process was bioequivalent to the PVR produced from the legacy  
process. The safet y data indicated that both rings were similarl y safe and well tolerated b y healthy, 
postmenopausal female subjects who were pretreated with estrogen.
The present tri alassesses the safet y and tolerability of the PVR manufactured with the new process 
when used for luteal phase support in women undergoing ART. While the design of the proposed 
trialis similar to that of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] p hase [ADDRESS_281351] been implemented as requested b y the Agency.

The benefit/risk aspects are expected to be similar to what is outlined in the Investigator ’s Brochure 
for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), PVR ,and in the appropriate package inserts for 
the non- investigational medicinal products: oral contraceptives, leuprolide acetate , hCG, and 
MENOPUR ( menotropi[INVESTIGATOR_233138] [package insert], 2016 ).The PVR offers patients a 
convenient, once -weekl y option for luteal phase support as an alternative to twice -daily dosing or 3 -
times daily  dosing of the progesterone vaginal insert, once -daily  dosing of the progesterone vaginal 
gel, or once -daily intramuscular injection of progesterone in oil that are in current clinical use in the

3.1.2 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is an open -label, single -arm, safety trialof PVR for luteal phase support in women undergoing 
IVF with fresh oocy tes.Women between the ages of 18 and 34 years with tubal, idiopathic, male 
factor, ovulatory  dysfunction, or endometriosis -linked infertility , who agree to be considered for 
inclusion in the trial , will be invited to be seen at the trialsite.
Once informed consent is obtained, eligible subjects will 
be started on an ovarian down -regulation /
suppression protocol utilizing combined oral contraceptives supplied by  [CONTACT_233163] ≥14 day s to 
≤21days (based upon the site standard of care), with leuprolide acetate at a dose of 0.1 mL 
(500 µg)/day  beginning [ADDRESS_281362] birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_233132] ≥10 day s to ≤20 days; 
ovarian suppression is to begin in the cy cle immediately  prior to the ovarian stimulation cy cle.
After suppression, an ovarian stimulation protocol will begin on the second or third day after the 
start of menses 
with a reduction in leuprolide acetate dose to 0.05 mL (250 µg/day ) followed by  [CONTACT_233169] y purified, human menopausal 
gonadotropin (HP -hMG; MENOPUR) at an initial dose of 225 IU/day  for [ADDRESS_281363]
response. Dose adjustments should not be made more frequently  than once every  two day s and 
should not exceed 150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily  dose of MENOPUR should not 
exceed 450 IUand the minimum daily  dose should not be lower than 75 IU .MENOPUR dosing 
should not continue for >[ADDRESS_281364] 2 follicles ≥17 mm 
(mean of 2 dimensions) to receive the hCG trigger. Subjects who do not reach this threshold after 
20 day s of stimulation are to be discontinued from the trial.If the estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, 
hCG should not be administered and the subject should be discontinued from the trial.

Page 26of 99Progesterone, FE 999913 Trial C ode:  [ADDRESS_281365] will begin treatment with the I MP, PV R. Following instruction on PVR
insertion and removal (see Appendix 1 ), the subject will insert the first PVR (PVR1) 
at the trial site
The PVR will remain in place a minimum of 23 hours/day . The s ubject will remove PVR1 before 
embry o transfer and reinsert it af ter the transfer. Fresh embry o transfer will occur 5 day s after 
oocy te retrieval per the trialsite’s protocol. The number of embryos to transfer must be guided b y 
the 2017 American Society  for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society  for Assisted 
Repr oductive Technology (SART) guidelines (SART/ASRM 2017): women with the expectation of 
oneor more high- quality  embry o(s)available for cry opreservation, and women with previous live 
birth after an IVF cycle, will have transfer of a single blastocy st. All other women will have transfer 
of no more than two blastocy sts.Additional PVRs will be distributed for weekl y insertion, with the 
second PVR (PVR2) to be inserted at home [ADDRESS_281366] PVR
(PVR1) , and the third PVR (P VR3) to be inserted either at home or at the site 7 day s following the 
insertion of PVR2 .
Two weeks after oocy te retrieval, a blood draw will be performed to measure serum levels of 
progesterone and β -hCG. Subjects with a β- hCG level <5 mIU/mL will be disc ontinued from the 
trial.Those with a β -hCG level ≥5mIU/mL will insert their next PVR and continue in the trial for 
up to a total of 10 weeks (up to a total of 10 PVRs). Additional serum pregnancy  tests will be 
performed at 2 weeks + 3
-4 day s and at 3 wee ks.Subjects who are no longer pregnant will be 
discontinued from the trial. Subjects with positive β -hCG results at 3 weeks will insert PVR4 and 
receive PVR5 and PVR6 to be inserted weekl y.
A TVUS will be performed to document the presence of an intrauter ine gestational sac 4 weeks 
+ 3-[ADDRESS_281367] will be treated according to the site’s standard protocol and will be withdrawn from the 
trial. Six weeks after oocy teretrieval, a TVUS will be performed to determine the presence and 
number of gestational sacs with/without fetal heart beat.Pregnant subjects will insert PVR7 and 
receive additional PVRs to be inserted weekl y (PVR8, PVR9, and PVR10). Ten weeks after oocy te 
retrieval (if the subject is pregnant), an ultrasound (either transvaginal or abdominal) will be 
performed to determine the number of gestational sacs present with and without fetal heart beat and 
the estimated gestational age.
Safety
 will be monitored t hroughout the trial .Standardized criteria will be applied to AEs of special 
interest (vaginal bleeding, vaginal pain, and vaginal irritation etc., see section 8.3) to establish grade 
(intensity ).Patient- reported vaginal pain and/or irritation (Appendix 3 )should be recorded as an 
AEif considered clinically  significant b y the ph ysician. The ph ysician can perform an unscheduled 
pelvic examination at his or her discretion based upon these AEs a t any time (see Appendix 2 ).A 
scheduled pelvic examination will be performed at screening , onday1of PVR treatment ,and 4
weeks + [ADDRESS_281368] -oocy te retrieval (Visits 4, 7P, 8, 9 and 10) to document

Discussion of Overall Trial Design and Choice of Control Groups
3.5.1 Trial Design
This is an open -label, single -arm trialof progesterone supplementation (luteal phase support) in 
women undergoing IVF with fresh oocy tes.Each trialcenter will follow the trialcenter’s standard 
practice for ART unless otherwise noted in this protocol. On the day  after oocy te retrieval, the 
subject will begin treatment with the I MP, PVR. Embry o transfer will occur 5days after oocy te 
retrieval. A serum pregnancy  test will be conducted 2 weeks after the oocy te retrieval. Subjects 
with a β -hCG level <5 mIU/mL will b e discontinued from the trial.Those with a β- hCG level 
≥5mIU/mL will continue dosing with PVR for up to a total of 10 weeks.
The primary  objective is to estimate the cumulative rate of an y spontaneous abortion, including 
spontaneous clinicall y recognized pregnancy loss and blighted o vum during the trial (up to 
Week 12 following oocy te retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh embry o transfer. 
Approximately  240 subjects will be enrolled in the trialin order to ensure that 215subjects undergo 
fresh embryo transfer.
3.5.2 Selection of Endpoints
The endpoints in this trial(rate of an y spontaneous abortion, biochemical abortion, ectopic and 
heterotopic pregnancies as well as rate of clinical pregnancy  
and positive β- hCG ) are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_233139] y of product s used for progesterone supplementation in women 
undergoing ART. AEs of special interest due to the vaginal administration are also included as 
secondary  endpoints, and cover vaginal bleeding/spotting, vaginal hemorrhage, pain, vaginal

6.2.1 Visit 1: Start of Ovarian Stimulation
After suppression, subjects will attend thestart of ovarian stimulation visit (Visit 1).Ovarian 
stimulation will begin on the second or third day  after the start of menses in the subsequent cy cle.
The following must take place at the visit:
TVUS of ovaries ( number and size of follicles)
Blood collection for local laboratory assessment of :
-Endocrine p
arameters (estradiol)
Reduction of leuproli de acetate dose to 0.05 mL (250 µg/day )
Start ovarian stimulation protocol with MENOPUR .
MENOPUR will be at an initial dose of 225 IU/day for [ADDRESS_281400] response. Dose adjustments should 
not be made more frequently  than once every  two days and should not exceed 150 IU per 
adjustme nt. The maximum daily  dose of MENOPUR should not exceed 450 IUand the 
minimum daily  dose should not be lower than 75 IU . MENOPUR dosing should not continue 
for >20 day sand coasting is not allowed .
Recording of use of an y concomitant medication
Recording of AE s
During stimulation , s
ubjects will be monitored to determine when to trigger ovulation with hCG.
6.2.2 Visit 2: End of Ovarian Stimulation
The end -of-stimulation visit (Visit 2) takes place when the subject reaches the criterion for triggering 
of final follicular maturation. Subjects who do not reach the triggering criteria after 20 days of 
stimulation are to be discontinued from the trial.
Criterion for triggering of final follicular maturation with hCG: 
at least 2 follicles ≥17mm (mean of 2 dimensions)
The following must take place at the visit:
Blood collection for local laboratory assessment of:
-Endocrine parameters (estradiol)
If the estradiol level is ≥5000 pg/mL, the hCG trigger should not be administered and the 
subject should be discontinued from the trial.

8.1 Adverse Event Definition
An adverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical trial.
It includes:
Any unfavourable and unintended sign, s ymptom or disease temporally  associated with the use 
of the IMP, whether or not considered to be caused by  [CONTACT_2203].
AEs commonly  observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP.
Any laboratory  abnormality , vital sign, or finding from phy sical or gy necological examination 
assessed as clinically  significant by  [CONTACT_737] (Note: pre-existing conditions diagnosed 
through assessments and examinations at the sc reening visit or during the screening period are 
not AEs, but are recorded as medical history ).
Accidental injuries, reasons for any change in medication (drug and/or dose), reasons for an y 
medical, nursing or pharmacy  consultation, or reasons for admissio n to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31343].
Overdoses and medication errors with and without clinical consequences.
All AEs will be coded b y Ferring Global Pharmacovigilance using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) (the version effective at trial start).

The sources of AEs cover:
The subject’s response to questions about her health (a standard non -
leading question such as 
“How have you been feeling since your last visit?” is asked at each visit).
Symptoms spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_423].
Investigations and examinations where the findings are assessed b y the Investigator to be 
clinically  significant changes or abnormalities.
Other information relating to the subject’s health becoming known to the Investigator

abnormal clinicall y significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the date 
the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity  of an AE must be classified using the following 3- point scale:
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.
Moderate: Event sufficient to affect usual activity  (disturbing).
Severe: Inability  to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).
The grading of AEs of special interest will be based on predefined criteria as discussed i n section 8.3.
Causal Relationship to IMP
The possibility  of whether the IMP caused the A E must be classified as one of the following:
Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between 
the IMP and the AE. The AE may  occur as part of the pharmacological 
action of the IMP or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strongl y associated with IMP exposure.
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in association 
with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such a s a strong temporal association or the 
event recurs on rechallenge with the IMP .
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
Known consequences of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation.
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to occur with some frequency 
during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.

The statistical anal yses will be detailed in a separate Statistical Analy sis Plan.
9.1 Primary Analysis
At the final anal ysis, the cumulative rate of any  spontaneous abortion, including spontaneous clinically  
recognized pregnancy  loss and blighted ovum during the trial (up to Week 12 following oocy te 
retrieval), in subjects treated with PVR following fresh e mbryo transfer will be estimated (i.e.,
modified intention -to-treat [ mITT]population) . 
The number and rate of any  spontaneous abortions (occurring on or before 12 weeks following oocyte 
retrieval) for subjects in the mITT cohort will be summarized and th e associated two -sided exact 95% 
confidence interval will be generated. Upon generating the two -sided exact 95% confidence interval, 
the upper bound of the interval will be assessed for whether it excludes or fails to exclude a 
spontaneous abortion rate of 15%.
9.[ADDRESS_281428], PVR. The primary  anal ysis involves 
the construction of a two -sided 95% exact confidence interval surrounding the proportion of subjects in 
the m ITT anal ysis population that experience a spontaneous abortio n. The upper bound of said 
confidence interval is then compared with the threshold of a 15% spontaneous abortion rate.
Statistical simulations have been performed to understand the operating characteristics under vary ing 
assumptions for both the sample siz e of the m ITT anal ysis population and the “true” proportion of 
spontaneous abortions. For each simulation rep etition , a sample of subjects was simulated using the 
binomial distribution and a given pair of sample size and “true” proportion of spontaneous ab ortions 
assumptions. A two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasthen created based on the simulated data 
and the upper bound of this confidence interval wascompared to the threshold of 0.15 ( corresponding 
toa spontaneous abortion rate of 15%). If the upper bound of the two-sided 95% exact confidence 
interval wasless than 0.15, the simulation repetition was declared a “success”. If, however, the upper 
bound of the two -sided 95% exact confidence interval wasgreater than or equal to 0.15, the simulation
repetition was declared a “failure”. This process wasrepeated 10,000 times for each combination of 
assumed sample size and “true” proportion of spontaneous abortions. The proportion of simulation 
repetition successes to the total number of simulation rep etitions then describe dthe power of the 
proposed trialgiven the pair of assumptions.

Standardized criteria will be applie d to some AEs of special interest to establish intensity /grade. For 
AEs associated with vaginal bleeding/spotting, vaginal pain and
irritation, and vaginal or cervical 
abrasions and lesions, standardized criteria will be used by [CONTACT_233182] 
(see section 8.3andAppendix 2 , Appendix 3 , and Appendix 4
).For these AEs and AEs associated 
with vaginal haemorrhage ,vagina l infection andvaginal adhesions , a summary  table of the treatment -
emergent AEs of special interest will be produced by  [CONTACT_11702], grade ( intensity ), and seriousness 
for subjects in the safet y cohort for the treatment phase and the stud y phase.

incidence of sanitary  napkin use for bleeding/spotting, subjects will be instructed to record the dat e, 
time of day , and the severity  of the bleeding. For each subject , for each da y:the grade (intensity ) of 
bleeding associated with each sanitary  napkin use will be summed. The sum of the daily  grades 
(intensity ) of bleeding will be averaged by  [CONTACT_233183] ’
sBleeding Log recording period (i.e., from the start of the PVR to the End-of- trialvisit). 
Finally ,this subject data will be summarized across all 
subject s for the safety  cohort by [CONTACT_233184] . 
The summary  will include mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Furthermore, 
this analy sis will be repeated removing the periods associated with AEs reported as vaginal 
hemorrhag e, the primary  endpoint of spontaneous abortion , the secondary  endpoint of biochemical 
abortion and information collected after the cessation of the use of PVR .
9.9.6 Vaginal Hemorrhage
The number of subjects with vaginal hemorrhage (see Sections 7.2.5 and 8.3.6
) will be summarized for 
the safet y cohort.
9.9.7 Pelvic Examination
A pelvic examination will be performed at screening, Visits
4, 7P, 8, 9, and 10 to document the 
presence and grade ( intensity ) of any  pain, irritation, abrasions, or lesions on the cervix or vagina using 
standardized criteria , andthe presence and grade ( intensity ) of any vaginal adhesions using 
standardized criteria (Appendix 2 ).If any lesions or abrasions are found on the cervix or vagina or 
vaginal adhesions are noted , another examination will be performed 2 -4 day s later. The grade 
(intensity ) for each t ype of assessment will be summarized by  [CONTACT_233185] y cohort. Furthermore, 
a shift table will be presented summarizing the change in grade ( intensity ) from Visit [ADDRESS_281447] assessment in the trea tment phase.

Hierarchical Modeling Details
Define n1as the number of subjects in the current trialand Y1ias the indicator of spontaneous 
abortion for the ithsubject in the current trial where Y 1~ Bin(n 1, π1). Let π1be the true rate of 
spontaneous abortions in the current trial.
The previous trial (Study DR -PGN -302) reported a spontaneous rate of abortion of 55/549. This 
prior information about abortion rate is incorporated into the modeling framework through a 
hierarchical model. Dynamic borrowing between this trial’s resu lts and the current trial’s data 
allows borrowing to occur to the extent indicated by [CONTACT_233197]. More borrowing occurs 
when the two rates are similar while less borrowing occurs when they  differ. This “d ynamic” 
borrowing property  is distinct f rom other approaches which use a fixed informative prior or apriori 
assume an amount of borrowing between these two data sources. Let Y 0~ Bin(n0=549 , π0)where 
π0
is the true rate of spontaneous abortions from the previous trial.
We transform to the logit scale for modeling purposes. Let 1=log(π1/(1- π 1)) and 0=log(π0/(1-
π0)). The hierarchical model assumes that 0and[ADDRESS_281468] an across studies distribution:
1,0  ~ N( , 2)
The across trial mean and variance 2are unknown and hence have a prior distribution which is 
combined with the data to produce estimates of and 2:
~N(–
2.2, 2.25)
2~ IG(0.125,0.005)
The mean parameter assumes a relativel y vague prior on the original scale and centered at 10%. 
The var iance component 2controls the degr ee of borrowing among studies. 
Small values of 2
result in a greater degree of borrowing while large values of 2correspond to less borrowing. The 
parameter 2is estimated using the data, so the observed between studi es variation is a key  
component of the model behavior. The prior specification on 2corresponds to an inverse -gamma 
distribution with mean 0.2 and weight 0.25.

Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALOperating Characteristics
The planned sample size is based only  on subjects that undergo fresh embryo transfer. No further 
drop-outs are assumed. The anal ysis is evaluated across a range of true effects for the current trial’s 
spontaneous abortion rate. For the null scenario where in truth the PVR spontaneous abortion rate is 
15%, 100,000 sets of tr ials were simulated. For all other assumed scenarios, 5,000 sets of trials 
were simulated.
Overall Success
We evaluated the overall probability that the 95% credible interval is entirely  below 15% for each 
scenario of the true PVR rate. If PVR trul y mainta ins an abortion rate below 15%, then this 
represents the power for achieving a credibl e interval entirel y below 15%. If the true rate of 
abortions for PVR is 15%, then obtaining a credible interval entirel y below 15% is the type I error. 
Results are provid ed in the table below.
True PVR Rate 8% 9% 10% 11% 12% 13% 14% 15%
Trial Success 0.979 0.933 0.830 0.670 0.485 0.297 0.167 0.084
When in truth the PV R spontaneous abortion rate is 9%, the trial has 93.3% power of achieving a 
95% credible interval entirely  below 15%. Alternatively , when in truth the spontaneous abortion 
rate is 15%, the trial has a 8.4% rate of success.
Inference Associated with Various Observed Rates
For various observed rates of spontaneous abortions, the corresponding primary analysis based on 
the hierarch ical model is described below. The posterior mean, 95% credible interval, effective 
number of borrowed subjects, and the borrowing percentage (out of the n= 549subjects from the 
previous trial ) is provided. The effective numbe r of borrowed subjects calculation [E( π1)*(1-
E(π1))/Var( π1)–1–240] is somewhat approximate as it is bas ed on the binomial likelihood. Results 
are provided in the below table.
Observed Data Estimated Rate (%) 
(95% CI)Effective Number of 
Borrowed SubjectsBorrowing 
Percentage
19/240 (7.92 %) 8.6% ( 5.7, 11.7 ) 103 18.9%
24/240 (10.00 %) 10.0 % (7.2, 13.3 ) 130 23.7%
36/240 (15.00 %) 13.8 % (10.1, 18.5 ) 9 1.7%
Borrowing based on the hierarchical modeling is dy namic, with higher borrowing achieved when 
the current trial’s results are similar to the previous data and minimal borrowing when the current 
trial’s results are at 15%. This is evidenced b y both the decre asing number of borrowed subjects 
and the increasing width of the credible intervals. Also, based on 240subjects being included in the 
analysis, the maximal number of observed responses which maintains a 95% credible interval 
entirely  below 15% is 28.

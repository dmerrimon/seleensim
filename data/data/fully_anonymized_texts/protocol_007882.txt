 2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RA TIONALE  
2.1  Background Information 
Improved mana gement of obesity is an urgent public health need.  Nearly 40% 
of US children and adolescents have a body mass index that markedly increases 
their risk for serious metabolic and cardiopulmonary sequelae. Current childhood 
obesity rates, for the first time i n US history, predict a decline in life US expectancy. 
Importantly, childhood obesity is a key driver of health disparities in the US, with 
obesity disproportionately affecting African- American, Hispanic -Latino and Native 
American children. A key contribut or to the sequelae of obesity is sedentariness. 
Thus, best practice in obesity management includes both reducing sedentariness 
and establishing durable increases in daily physical activity1,2, however, attrition fr om 
planned ex ercise programs remains high. 3 A key challenge to initiating and 
sustaining physical activity in children with obesity is the extreme dyspnea 
(breathlessness) they experience. This is due to the  altered thoracic mechanics of 
obesity which lead to enhanced inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65163], with even 
modest physical activity (Figure 2A). Our group has confirmed that among 
adolescents, higher body mass index (BMI) associates with lower inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65164] (r= - 0.680, p=0.049, n=14), and that this lower endurance correlates with 
more frequent dyspnea (r= -  0.672, p=0.023, n=12). Treating obesity -related 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65165] a promising approach to support 
physica l activity in children with obesity, but is yet unproven.  
 
Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65158] (IMR) is a promising approach to reduce 
obesity -related dyspnea and 
boost physical activity. 
Pulmonary rehabilitation (in its 
various forms, including IMR) is 
a treatment cornerstone in 
adult medicine but is 
underutilized in pediatrics.4 In 
adults, IMR has been studied 
in healthy athletes5,6, and 
numerous lung 7-10 and neuromuscular 11-13 diseases. In adults, IMR consistently 
improves inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13945], reduces dyspnea and improves exercise 
tolerance.14-19  Adding IMR to an exercise training regimen in healthy young adults 
who were obese led to significant improvements in subjective ratings of dyspnea and 
objectively measured exercise capacity.20 IMR has not been sufficiently studied in 
children with obesity.  However, recently in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_65166], children with 
obesity (and asthma) underwent the ‘DHBS’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_65167] ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Children 
(n=11) were randomized to IMR (3 sets of 50 reps, three times/week), exercise or 
usual care for 6 weeks. Ten of 11 completed all visits, and 11 reported wanting to 
continue IMR after the study. IMR improved mean maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65168] 
(MIP) (+34 cm H 2O, p=0.014) and improved exercise capacity measured by 6-
minute walk distance (+115 meters) (p=0.136) compared to IMR. Based on these 
 
 Figure 2 Mechanisms of action of (A) obesity 
leading to dyspnea  and activity avoidance, and (B)  
 
 data, we are highly encouraged that IMR will help children with obesity increase their 
physical activity ( Figure 2B). 
 
 
Duke Pediatrics is expertly equipped to advance IMR in Children with Obesity . 
Duke Pediatrics’ Healthy Lifestyles (HL) clinic, led by [CONTACT_15957]- I [CONTACT_65250], 
treats >7000 children ages 8- 17 with obesity each year (>35% Black, >20% 
Hispanic).[ADDRESS_70976] (as part of consented research)  provided wearable 
accelerometers to track total daily activity (i.e. steps) and time achieving moderate to 
vigorous physical activity (MVPA) .23,24 [CONTACT_39654] has led or facilitated multiple 
research studies within the obes ity clinic, with established protocols and regulatory 
processes for recruitment, consent, and follow up study visits.21,25- 27 This 
collaboration between the Pediatric Pulmonary and Healthy Lifestyles clinical 
research teams focuses on a completely new area of research for the investigators 
(IMR) and provides a superior environment for studying impactful innovations in 
pediatric obesity.  
Together, we propose BREATHE Fit , a randomized SHAM -controlled 6- week trial of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65169] 8- 17 years with obesity enrolled in 
the Duke HL.  Primary research question:  Is IMR an acceptable add- on 
intervention that promotes greater activity in children with obesity?  The BREATHE 
Fit trial will ad dress the following aims:  
Aim 1. Demonstrate the acceptability of IMR in children with obesity. 
Hypothesis 1a (H1a). More than 80% of participants will be satisfied with active IMR 
at study completion. H1b. Total IMR adherence will be >80% of planned activ e IMR 
repetitions. H1c. Active IMR will not be associated with any serious adverse 
reactions.  
Aim 2. Demonstrate changes in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65170]. H2a. IMR will significantly increase inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65171] 
(meas ured by [CONTACT_65222]). H2b. IMR will reduce patient -reported 
retrospective dyspnea scores during  activities of daily living.   
Aim 3. Demonstrate changes in daily physical activity following IMR.  
H3a. IMR will lead to reduced sedentary time, increase d moderate- strenuous time 
and increased total daily activity measured by a wrist -worn continuous activity 
tracking monitor.  
 
2.2  Potential Benefits  
IMR is very likely to improve inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65172]. These benefits in 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65173] (breathlessness) with daily activity 
and with exercise. In addition, IMR may improve exercise capacity and exercise 
tolerance. Although improvements in these outcomes are not guaranteed, 
improvements in general health, daily activity and w eight loss are a possibility.  
 
 Conclusions drawn from this study may benefit children with obesity by [CONTACT_65223].  All participants will have baseline lung 
function testing and will have their daily physical acti vity monitored.   
 
2.3  Compensation 
Participants  will be fairly compensated for their time and effort.  Successful 
completion of the study (visit 3) will result in a $75  monetary payment  (gift cards). In 
addition, participants will be gifted the Garmin Vivosmart 4 study activity tracker 
(retail value $10 0) on visit 1 . If participants do not complete the study, they will be 
asked to return the activity tracker and inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65174].  Participants will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_70977] with the successful completion of visit 2, and $[ADDRESS_70978]

 4. STUDY DESIGN  
Overall Design  
Single-center, randomized, SHAM -controlled, parallel assignment, double masked, 
interventional study.  
4.1 Randomization 
Participant s (n=30) will be randomized to one of two  treatment arms.  
• Arm A  (n=15): IMR 
• Arm B (n=15): Sham  
4.2 Blinding/Masking  
Treatment assignment will be obtained through the Duke REDCap randomization 
system. All participant -facing study staff and participants will be blinded to t he 
treatment assignment. Participants may come to feel that they can surmise whether 
their device is set to the active resistance. Although complete masking may not be possible in all participants, participants will only be informed that they are receiving  
one of two resistances (low or active). However, all study staff that assess outcomes (and the l ead statistician ) will remain blinded. Participants will be instructed to not 
discuss their presumed IMR assignment with study staff.  
4.3 Study Interventions  
Activ e IMR  or SHAM  using the PrO2™  device. Each participant will be provided a 
PrO2™ device and trained on its use as well as its accompanying PrO2 Fit™ app. The PrO2™ is a flow -resistive device that provides inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65176] a fixed 
2mm orifice and h as Bluetooth connectivity to most IOS/Android devices or 
Mac/Windows computers. The PrO2™ device and app allows for both 100% adherence monitoring and immediate user biofeedback.  
Participants will be instructed at V isit 1 and V isit 2 to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65177]2™ until the device signals that the user has achieved the target resistance (via audible alarm and visible light signal). The research team will implement biofeedback signals at a specific inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65178]. Successful IMR repetitions will require that subjects 
achieve a pressure target that is 75% of their MIP.   
SHAM intervention.  Participants in the control intervention will also use the same 
PrO2™ device but at a reduced peak resist ance of 15%  MIP. The research team will 
implement biofeedback signals at a specific inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65179]. Successful IMR repetitions will require that subjects achieve a pressure target that is 15% of  their MIP. 
Adherence monitoring. All device repetitions are automatically captured and 
documented via the Bluetooth connection with the PrO2™ app and end- to-end 
encrypted and transferred to a HIPAA -compliant cloud server (Amazon Web 
Services). Study staf f will review eac h participant’s adherence each week  and will 
provide encouragement as needed.

Not applicable.  
4.8 Rationale for Dose (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65180]) Selection  
We used published IMR regimens to select an initial resistive load (intensity), 
number of repetitions/sets per day, and weekly session number for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732] (Table 2 ). We first completed an IRB -approved pi[INVESTIGATOR_65181] 1(DHBS1) of directly supervised IMR in 10- 17 year-olds with 
asthma. Using a commercially available IMR respi[INVESTIGATOR_65182], participants with asthma completed and tolerated 4 sets of 60 reps of IMR at 60- 75% MIP. We 
solicited feedback from both adolescents and parents regarding tolerability, acceptability, and future interest in IMR as a potential chronic breathing intervention. Nearly 95% of participants were able to complete all repetitions at 60- 75% of MIP. 
This one- time session was wel l-tolerated in all participants without any significant 
adverse events. Thirteen of 14 (93%) participants wanted to continue daily IMR after study completion. Based on DHBS1, we initiated the DHBS2 study, an IRB -
approved ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) randomized, ‘usual care’ -controlled, parallel -group,  6-Table 2 Prior Duke IMR Projects

 week  intervention trial in which we tested the IMR regimen (75% MIP) in 10-17 year-
olds with obesity and asthma.  
 
Participants randomized to the IMR treatment completed 3 sets of 60 repetitions at 
75% MIP three days per week. Preliminary IMR findings from 11 participants 
involving changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_65185], 6- minute walk 
distance and asthma symptom scores are encouraging and support the aim s of this 
proposal (See Figure 3  and Table 3 ). Adherence o f IMR  (n=6) was 79.2% of 
prescribed repetitions over 6 weeks, which is superior to published adherence rates 
(47-57%) for daily asthma controller drugs .

symptoms, undiagnosed chest pain, pneumothorax in the past [ADDRESS_70989] 12 months, or undiagnosed syncopal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
 Screen Failures  
Participants who sign informed consent but are not enrolled in the active study are 
considered screen failures and will be recorded in the Screen Failures area of the electronic 
data capture ( EDC) . Participants who do not initially satisfy eligibility requirements may be 
rescreened up to 2 additional times. Re -consent is not required for rescreened participants  
unless a revised version of the consent that requires re -consent is made available.   
5.4. Treatment Assignment Procedures  
5.4.1  Randomization  procedures 
Treatment assignment will be 1:1 (IMR or sham intervention), and will be obtained 
through the Duke REDCap randomization system  using the randomization schedule as 
 
 designed by [CONTACT_63539]. All study staff and participants will be blinded to 
the treatment assignment  with the exception of one un- blinded clinical research 
coordinator . Participants may be able to tell whether their device is set to the active 
resistance. Although complete masking may not be possible in all participants, 
partic ipants will only be informed that they are receiving one of two resistances (low or 
active). However, all study staff that assess outcomes (and the lead statistician ) will 
remain blinded. Participants will be instructed to not discuss their presumed IMR assignment with study staff.  
5.5. Participant Discontinuation /Withdrawal  
5.5.[ADDRESS_70990] the participant’s medical care outside of this study. The reasons for withdrawal, or failure to provide a reason, must be documented by [CONTACT_093]. No additional study procedures or data should be collect ed 
after consent has been withdrawn.  
5.5.2  Participant  decides to withdraw from study intervention/ product  
Participants may also withdraw from receiving the study intervention/product for any reason but continue to be followed for safety. Participants are not obligated to 
state the reason for withdrawal.  
5.5.3  Study investigator/ sponsor decides to withdraw participant  
The study investigators  or sponsor may decide to take the participant out of this  
study at any time without consent  if: 
• Participant’s condition changes and the study is no longer in his/her best interest ; 
• Participant  non-compliance with the study protocol ; 
• The entire st udy is stopped by [CONTACT_456] . 
5.5.4  Individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65186]:  
The study investigators will  stop treatment of  study intervention and the participant 
will not receiv e additional doses of study intervention if:  
• Participant has a clinically significant severe AE or SAE related to the study 
intervention;   
• Participant becomes  pregnant ;  
• Participant  newly meets criteria for  study  exclusio n; 
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , the participant is at significant risk.  
 
If the intervention is discontinued for safety concerns, participants must be followed for 
safety until [ADDRESS_70991] be documented by [CONTACT_093].  Reasons for withdrawal may include:  
 
 a. Participant withdraw s consent and request s no further follow -up; 
b. Participant  does not withdraw consent but withdraws from study  intervention;   
c. Study PI/Sponsor decision.  
Unless there is complete withdrawal of consent from the participant, every effort 
will be made to continue follow -up visits.

satisfy all 
Inclusion /Exclusion 
criteria  to be en rolled 
in the active study . 
Information will be recorded from the clinical medical record or from interview of the participant. The 
investigator will not exercise selectivity so that bias is  prevented.  
 Informed consent and collection of demographic information will be performed at screening. The following screening assessments must be done to confirm study 
eligibility: medical history (past medical/surgi cal history, medications, and 
smoking/ drug history), review of concomitant  medications , height /weight/physical 
exam , and confirm satisfaction of all eligibility criteria  (inclusion and exclusion) for 
the study. Assessments not recorded per standard of care, must be conducted as a

6.5 Maximal Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_13955] (MIP) Measurement   
Each participant w ill be asked to perform five MIP maneuvers, with a goal of matching the 
highest two within [ADDRESS_71001] 
maneuver. The participant will be  instructed to exhale slowly and c ompletely, seal lips firmly 
around the MIP mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], and then “ breathe in as hard as you can, like you are trying to 
suck up a thick milkshake.” The study staff member  will note the largest negative pressure 
sustained on the pressure reading . The partici pant will be allowed to rest for about [ADDRESS_71002] MIP value (post minus pre) will 
be computed.  
 
6.6 Questionnaires/Data  Forms  
6.6.1  Baseline medical history form   
The baseline medical history form will ascertain general demographics, 
medical evaluation (for eligibility), degree of dyspnea at rest and related to 
daily activity, and other general respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  This will be completed 
by [CONTACT_65224] a combination of adjudicating the electronic health 
record and direct enquiry from the participant or guardian.  
 
6.6.2  Questionnaire during e xercise: Modified Borg  dyspnea scale  
 Ten-unit scale used to denote degree of dyspnea with exercise28,[ADDRESS_71003] -3.  
 
 Patient Instructions for Borg Dyspnea Scale 
“This i s a scale that asks you to rate the difficulty of your breathing. It starts at 
number 0 where your breathing is causing you no difficulty at all and progresses 
through to number 10 where your breathing difficulty is maximal. How much difficulty 
is your breathing causing you right now?”  
 
   
 
6.6.3 
 Questionnaire during Exercise: Dalhousie rating with exercise  
This will be assessed at the 1-, 2- and 3- minute marks during the [ADDRESS_71004] is to assess breathing and leg and body fatigue 
during exercise. Participants will be told that t here is no right or wrong 
answer. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_65188]30 will be shown to the 0 Nothing at all

7 Very Severe  
8  
9 Very, very severe (almost maximal)  
[ADDRESS_71005] difficulty you can imagine. (Figure 4) 
 
Research staff will say, “You might feel this difficulty breathing in your chest or in your throat. Another scale simply asks you to tell us how hard it is to breathe— from nothing at all, to the hardest breathing imaginable. With the 
final set of pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], tell us how your legs feel —from nothing at all, to the 
hardest imaginable. ”

• Direct child to remain in chair for another minute, then check heart rate (post -3). 
6.7.[ADDRESS_71015] DESCRIPTION  
7.1 Dosage and Study Intervention Information  
7.1.1  Dose of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65190] A: The intervention group will be required to achieve a pressu re target that is 75% 
of their MIP  for each repetition. Participants will perform 3 sets of 50 inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65161] 
3 times per week.  
Arm B: The sham group will be required to achieve a pressure target that is 15% of 
their MIP  for each repetition.  Participa nts will perform 3 sets of 50 inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65161] 3 
times per week.  
7.1.2  Formulation, packaging, and l abeling  
The PrO2™ is a flow -resistive device that provides inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65176] a fixed 
2mm orifice and has Bluetooth connectivity to most IOS/Android devices or 
Mac/Windows computers. The PrO2™ device and app allows for both 100% adherence 
monitoring and immediate user biofeedback . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_71016] use and directions  
Participants will be instructed to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65191]2™ until the device signals that the user has achieved the target resistance (via audible alarm and visible light 
signal). The research team can implement biofeedback signals at a specific inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32721], which allows for a precise and individualized training target.  
At Visit 1: Participa nts will download the PrO2™  Fit App from the Apple App Store  or 
Google Play. They will be shown how to set up their own PrO2 Fit account and how to connect with their PrO2 ™ trainer. Research staff will review the planned dosing to start 
after visi t 2. They will be instruct ed to try to avoid inferring what treatment assignment 
they have been given, and to not share any impressions they have developed on 
treatment assignment. The proper use of the trainer will be taught, including safe 
storage, cleaning and maintenance. Participants will be taught to create an air -tight seal 
over the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_65192]. The participant will be instructed to 
breathe in forcefully until the device alarms then continue to maximal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. At V isit 
1, participants will be taught on the device while the alarm is set for 15% of their MIP. 
They will complete a set of 50 repetitions supervised so their technique is assessed and re-direction can occur if needed.  
At Visit 2: participants will have refresher training on the use of the PrO2™  Fit app and 
will repeat their supervised single set of [ADDRESS_71017] the proper technique and the device is working properly.  
Research staff will encourage participant and guardian to discuss a plan to optimize 
adherence to the IMR intervention. This may include pi[INVESTIGATOR_65193] 
(e.g. MWF, TuThS) and particular activities to link with IMR (e.g. in mornings before

 8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 Adverse Event  
All adverse events during the study period will be collected.   
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not 
considered study drug-related, which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in 
clinical status, ECGs, routine labs, x -rays, physical examinations, etc. , that is considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_65227].  
An unexpected Adverse Event  is defined as any adverse event, the nature, specificity, or 
severity of which is not consi stent with the applicable product information (e.g., package 
insert/approved label) or investigational plan.  
A suspected adverse reaction  (SAR)  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study intervention caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies 
that there is evidence that the study intervention caused the event.  An adverse reaction  is any 
AE caused by [CONTACT_34144].  
 Guidelines for Assessing Association of an Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (S AE) or serious suspected adverse reaction or serious 
adverse reaction as determined by [CONTACT_65228] : 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (“life -threat ening” means that the study participant was, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred and required immediate intervention)  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event  
 Guidelines for Assessing Intensity of an Adverse Event  
The investigator/delegate (defined as a clinici an licensed to make a diagnosis) should 
use the following definitions when assessing intensity of an adverse event:  
• Mild - Participant is aware of symptoms or has minor findings but tolerates them well, 
and no or minimal intervention required .  
• Moderate  - Participant experiences enough symptoms or findings to require 
intervention.   
• Severe - Participant experiences symptoms or findings that require significant 
intervention.   
 
 Guidelines for Assessing Causality  
The investigator/delegate (defined as a clinician licensed to make a diagnosis) will use 
the following question when assessing causality of an AE to study intervention:  Is there 
a reasonable possibility that the intervention caused the event? “Reasonable possibility” 
means that there is evidence to sugg est a causal relationship between the study 
 
 intervention and the AE. An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected 
adverse reaction. The investigator/delegate (defined as a clinician licensed to make a 
diagnosis) must document their assessment of severity and causality in the participant 
records in a timely manner and submit safety reports as required by [CONTACT_65229]/REB/IEC .  
 
 Collection Period and Reporting  Procedures  
Adverse event information will be gained from direct monitoring of the study participants as well as from clinician observation and self -reporting by [CONTACT_65230]. The investigator/delegate (defined as a clinician licensed to make a diagnosis) must document their assessment of intensity  and causality in the 
participant records in a timely manner and submit safety reports as required by [CONTACT_11577]. 
 
8.5.1  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) and SAEs will be reported from the time of consent through the end of study participation.  
Participants who hav e study intervention stopped due to a safety concern will be 
followed for an additional 7 days from the time the intervention was stopped.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be followed until resolution, even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period. Resol ution of an AE is defined as the return 
to pretreatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be entered in the data system within 7 days of identification. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be entered in the data system within 24 hours of identification.  
Any SAE entered in the EDC system will generate an automatic email notification to the DCC, BPCA medical monitor, and the sponsor. The BPCA medical monitor will review all SAEs  at the time they are reported. The 
investigator/delegate (defined as a clinician licensed to make a diagnosis) must document their assessment of severity and causality in the participant records in a timely manner and submit safety reports as required by [CONTACT_65231] (IRB)/ Research Ethics Board (REB)/ Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC).  
8.5.2  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
Serious, unexpected, suspected adverse reactions related to terbutaline sulfate will be  reported from the time of first study procedure through the end of study 
participation.  S[LOCATION_003]Rs can be elicited at any time during the defined study 
period. S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be entered in the data system within [ADDRESS_71019]

 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1 Study Hypotheses  
Primary  Specific Aims: Compare measures of satisfaction, adherence and safety between 
patients randomized to IMR as c ompared to sham  to demonstrate IMR as an acceptable 
add-on intervention that promotes greater activity in children with obesity  with no safety 
concerns .  More satisfaction and adherence are expected in the IMR group compared to 
sham.  
• Hypothesis 1: More than 80% of participants will be satisfied with active IMR at study 
completion.  
• Hypothesis 2: Total  active  IMR adherence will be >80% of planned IMR repetitions.  
• Hypothesis 3: Active IMR will not be associated with any serious adverse reactions.  
Secondary A im:  Compare inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65171] (measured by [CONTACT_65222]) in IMR 
versus sham participants  to demonstrate changes in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65196].  Also, to demonstrate changes in daily physical activity following IMR 
versus sham participants.  
• Hypothesis 1: IMR will significantly increase inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65171] (measured by [CONTACT_65232])  with more improvements in IMR compared to participants receiving 
sham .  
• Hypothesis 2: IMR will reduce patient -reported dyspnea scores  from activities of daily 
living and during the step test .  
• Hypothesis 3: IMR will lead to reduced sedentary time, increased moderate-
strenuous time and increased total daily activity measured by a wrist -worn 
continuous activity tracking monitor.  
Explorato ry Aim:  Demonstrate changes in exercise capacity following IMR versus sham 
participants.  
• Hypothesis 1: IMR will reduce the peak heart rate  increase induced by [CONTACT_65233] . 
10.2 Objectives and Endpoints 
Aim 1 : 
• Satisfac tion with  active  IMR (yes/no) as an intervention rated at study completion 
measured as a percentage of study completers.   
• Active IMR adherence measured as a percent age of planned IMR repetitions  
(completer status) .  
• Serious adverse events  (yes/no) measured  as a percentage of participants receiving 
at least one active IMR intervention.  
Aim 2 : 
• Change in maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_65197].  
• Change in dyspnea as measured retrospectively of activities of daily  living . 
• Change in sedentary time measured by [CONTACT_65234] 4 activity tracker.  
 
 • Change in moderate -strenuous physical activity time measured by [CONTACT_65235] 4 activity tracker.  
• Change in total daily activity measured by [CONTACT_65236].  
Aim 3 : 
• Change in heart rate during step test.

Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at Duke. She will serve as the unblinded 
statistician and ov ersee the lead statistician.  
Patient disposition, demographics , baseline measurements, outcomes and adverse events will 
be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_65237].  We will use standard summary statistics to 
describe the distribution of outcome measures  outlined in each aim  by [CONTACT_65238], standard deviation (SD), median, 25th and 75th percentiles (Q1-Q3) and range  
for continuous variables and frequency counts with percentages for non -missing data . We will 
assess distribution and  normality assumptions, identify outliers, evaluate missing data and 
check for unusual patterns. We will use SAS version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary 
NC) for all analyses , and a two- sided p- value <0.[ADDRESS_71024] Disposition   
Some withdrawal from the study is expected for various reasons. A CONSORT diagram will 
be used to describe the number of patients that reached the various stages of the trial and the 
number of participants that dropped out and for what reasons.  
 
10.9 Protocol Deviations   
Protocol deviations are expected to be minimal and will be summarized in tables by 
[CONTACT_65239] i ntervention group.  
 
10.10  Efficacy Analyses   
Aim 1:   We will use exact  95% confidence intervals and Fisher’s exact test to report and 
compare  the expected satisfaction, adherence and SAE percentages within the IMR 
compared to the sham group.   
Aim 2:   We will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to estimate and test the difference in 
mean 6 -week change between treatment groups (IMR versus Sham) for each outcome 
adjusting for the baseline value of the outcome variable.  Given the small sample size, sex 
(male /female), age, and BMI will each be evaluated in separate ANCOVA models. We will 
report adjusted (least squares) means with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group, as 
well as the estimated between- group difference in means with 95% CI and p- value for  testing 
the null hypothesis of no difference between group means. The model assumptions will be 
verified for each outcome, and model fit will be assessed using residual plots.

 11. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF  HUMAN PARTICIPANTS  
11.1  Informed Consent Process 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the partic ipant agreeing to 
participate in the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation.  
11.2  Permission from Participants  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks 
are given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting study specific procedures or intervention.  
Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of participation in this study will be provided to the participant. Consent forms w ill be IRB -approved, and the participant 
will be asked to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise.  The participant will provide c onsent prior to being enrolled in 
the study. The participant may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the executed informed consent document will be given to the participants for his/her records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be 
protected by [CONTACT_34693].  
The IND sponsor, or designee will provide the investigator, in writing, any new information that bears significantly on the participant’s risk to participating in the study. This new information will be communicated by [CONTACT_65240]. The i nformed 
consent document will be updated, and participants will be re- consented, if necessary. 
Site staff may employ IRB -approved recruitment efforts prior to the participant 
consenting; however, before any protocol -specific procedures are performed to 
determine protocol eligibility, an informed consent form must be executed. By 
[CONTACT_65241], the participant agrees to complete all evaluations required by [CONTACT_20767], unless the participant withdraws voluntarily or is involuntarily withdrawn from the trial for any reason. Participants may be asked to authorize exchange of 
information between the study staff and their primary care provider and/or other significant medical providers.

amendments will be written by [CONTACT_456], approved by [CONTACT_12638], and provided 
to the site  investigator for submission to the site’s IRB/REB/IEC of record.  
Participants may be compensated for their participation in this study. Compensation will be in accordance with the local IRB/REB/IEC’s policies and procedures and requires IRB/REB/IEC approv al, and must be documented in the consent forms .  
For non- English speakers, a fully translated consent or an oral presentation 
accompanied by a short form may be used to obtain informed consent. The fully translated consent and the short form must be approved by [CONTACT_779]’s IRB of record 
and executed according to local requirements.  
Participants must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the executed informed consent document will be given to the participant for their records.  
Site staff may employ IRB/REB/IEC -approved recruitment efforts prior to the 
participant consenting; however, before any protocol -specific procedures are 
performed to determine protocol eligibility,  informed consent or waiver of informed 
consent must be obtained. The informed consent process will be conducted and the form fully executed e.g., signed and dated, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights and welfare of t he participants will be protected 
by [CONTACT_34693].  
The IND sponsor, or designee will provide the investigator, in writing, with any new information that bears significantly on the participants' risk to receive the

Investigator ’s reference.  
 
  
12.7  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance/unplanned excursion from approved 
investigational plan (e.g., protocol, MOP), or ICH GCP guidelines. The noncompliance may 
be on the part of the participant, investigator, o r site staff. As a result of deviations, 
corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. For this study, 
certain procedures  obtained out of window will not be considered protocol deviations in 
order to facilitate retention of participants for later study assessments but  will be tracked and 
reported to the sponsor.   
Each investigator must adhere to the investigational plan as detailed in the study protocol and/or associated study materials (e.g. MOPs, Forms Instructions, User Gui des etc.). Each 
investigator will be responsible for the training of delegated staff and enrolling only those 
participants who have satisfied all protocol eligibility criteria.  
It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations

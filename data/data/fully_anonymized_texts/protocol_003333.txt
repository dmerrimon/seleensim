 Page 3 of 16 Version Date : December 7 , 2015 1. Objectives  
1.1. To determine whether the use of a balanced -salt / physiologic level of Cl - 
crystalloid solution (Isolyte) as compared to NS in cardiac surgery leads to less 
kidney injury as measured by [CONTACT_603329] [TIMP -2]*[IGFBP7] bioassay.  
2. Background  
2.1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a potential complication for patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery. AKI in post -cardiac surgery patients is associated with adverse outcomes, such 
as prolonged intensive care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], diminished quality of life, increased long -
term mortality, and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. [1-4]  
The mortality in cardiac surgery patients with AKI severe enough to require renal 
replacement therapy (RRT) can be as high as 60%. [5]  
There are a number of causes and risk factors associated with AKI including poor 
preoperative cardiac function, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and female 
gender.[6] One of the putative  agents associated with AKI in animal models receiving 
crystalloid fluids for resuscitative interventions is excess exogenous chloride ion (Cl -
).[7, 8]  As compared to non -Cl- containing solutions  in animal models , excess Cl - 
appears to lead  to a hyperchlo remic metabolic acidosis, increased renal vascular 
resistance, reduced renal blood flow, and reduced glomerular filtration rate – all of 
which are injurious to kidney function.[9 -11]  
In non -cardiac surgery, including kidney transplantation, the use of low -chloride 
containing crystalloids leads to less acid -base and electrolyte perturbation.[12, 13] In 
trauma resuscitation, low Cl - containing resuscitation solutions are also associated with 
more ideal acid -base status.[14]  
Historically, one of the most comm on balanced salt -solutions used in adult cardiac 
surgery has been 0.9% normal saline (NS), a crystalloid solution with 154 mmol/L of Cl -
.  This is much higher than physiologic plasma levels of 103 mmol/L.  Isolyte, a less 
commonly used crystalloid solution , is much closer to physiologic levels at 98 mmol/L 
Cl-.  In the context of cardiac surgery, there is no literature  expressly comparing the 
effects of balanced crystalloid solution such as Isolyte versus NS on AKI incidence.  
There is a single trial examin ing a low -Cl- containing colloid solution in cardiac surgery 
that found less metabolic acidosis [15]; however, AKI or markers of AKI were not 
measured outcomes  in that lone trial, so it is not known whether low Cl - solution will 
have any effect on AKI risk in humans .   
AKI results from a series of extremely complex cellular and molecular pathways 
involving endothelial, epi[INVESTIGATOR_018], inflammatory, and interstitial cells. The gold standard 
for identification and classification of AKI is dependent on serial serum  creatinine (Scr) 
measurements[16], but this measurement  can be unreliable during acute changes in 
kidney function.[17, 18] Recent studies have shown that tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase (TIMP -2) performs better than existing markers for predicting t he 
development of moderate or severe AKI (KDIGO stage 2 or 3) within 12 hours of 
sample collection.[19]  To further enhance the sensitivity of utilizing TIMP -2, we plan 
on also measuring urinary insulin -like growth factor -binding protein 7 (IGFBP7).  Along  
The Impact of Low Chloride Containing Fluids on Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiopulmonary 
By[CONTACT_603327] [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]  
 Page 4 of 16 Version Date : December [ADDRESS_798948], a key mechanism 
implicated in AKI.[19]  
This study will utilize the urinary [TIMP -2]*[IGFBP7] multiplicative product as a 
composite biomarker index to investigate the impact of intraoperative infusion of NS 
versus Isolyte on post -cardiac surgery renal function.  This biomarker should identify 
patients at risk of imminent (within 12 hours) AKI according to the Kidney Disease: 
Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria.[19, 20] . 
2.2. The investigators  have not gathered  preliminary data.  
2.3. Patients presenting for cardiac surgery are already quite ill often with multiple 
comorbidities.  Acute kidney injury in this population is associated with significant 
morbidity and mortality.  The a vailable literature indicates that a fairly simple 
intervention could  plausibly  reduce the incidence of AKI , but it has not yet been 
examined in humans .  Generating an evidence basis for it will substantially improve the 
safety of patients who need cardiac surgery. This inter vention to reduce AKI may also 
then be applied to the broader non -cardiac surgery population as well.

similarly analyze routine demographic data and potential confounders, as well as 
secondary outcomes as listed below.  
3.2. This is an open -label trial.  
4. Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria  
4.1. Participants will be drawn from the population of adult patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery at UNMH.

By[CONTACT_603327] [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]  
 Page 6 of 16 Version Date : December 7 , 2015 4.2. Inclusion criteria: consenting adult male and female pat ients undergoing non -emergent 
on- and off -pump cardiac surgery including : by[CONTACT_15806], valvular procedures, 
congenital defect correction, and thoracic aortic procedures or a combination of these 
procedures.   
Exclusion criteria: emergency surgery, preg nancy, previous renal transplantation, 
documented moderate to severe AKI prior to enrollment (e.g. RIFLE -I or RIFLE -
F/KDIGO stage 2 or 3), patients already receiving dialysis (acute or chronic) or in 
imminent need of dialysis at time of enrollment, subject s with chronic kidney disease 
without baseline serum creatinine value (baseline within 6 months of enrollment) . 
4.3. This study does not involve adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, 
pregnant women, or prisoners.   
4.4. We will not exclude pa rticular populations such as women, children, persons not fluent 
in English,  any particular racial or ethnic group s, etc.  
5. Number of Subjects  
5.1. This is not a multicenter study ; all recruitment will occur at UNMH . 
5.2. We plan to recruit sufficient participants to  obtain complete data on 30 subjects 
(15/group).  We do not anticipate a high withdrawal rate, but may recruit as many as [ADDRESS_798955] begins study treatment 
(whichever comes first).     
5.3. A power analysis with G*Power [IP_ADDRESS] software indicates that n=[ADDRESS_798956] deviation. For (purely hypothetical) example, if the 
mean is 100 units and roughly 2/[ADDRESS_798957] 80% power to detect a treatment  difference of [ADDRESS_798958] the decision to refer for surgery, or the subsequent 
decision to proceed or not proceed with surgery , for any patient . 
 Data collect ion will include pre -operative serum creatinine levels, which are very 
likely to already have been recorded for clinical reasons.  The maximum pre -
operative interval for this value will be six months  (it is extremely unlikely that 
sufficiently recent serum  creatinine data will be unavailable , but if this is the case, 
this value will be obtained prior to surgery ).  Other data will be gathered immediately 
prior to surgery, immediately after surgery, and up to 48 hours postop eratively .  It is 
anticipated that all participants will already be in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603319] . 
 A recruitment period  duration of one year should be sufficient to recruit the targeted 
participant sample ; we will apply for continuing review prior to study expi[INVESTIGATOR_603320] .

completion of all analyses, manuscript/presentation preparation, and submission of 
scholarly product to relevant outlets.  
7. Study Endpoints  
7.1. The primary outcome is the change in urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] composite from 
baseline to 24 hours postoperatively.   
The secondary outcomes are : 
 serum creatinine preoperatively and postoperatively at 24 and 48 hours,  
 serum chloride preoperatively and postop eratively at 24 and 48 hours,  
 clinically -determined need for dialysis prior to discharge, and  
 arterial pH , measured [ADDRESS_798959] not identified any exploratory endpoints . 
8. Research Setting  
8.1. This research study will be conducted at the UNM Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603321] . 
8.2. Potential subjects will be identified from among the investigators’ routine patients who 
present for cardiac surgery . 
8.3. Some data collection will involve the results of pre -existing laboratory orders; 
investigators will not necessarily have any influence over where participants have the 
pre-operative baseline serum creatinine labwork completed.  Routine labwork will be 
completed in the main UNMH laboratory.  The data for the TIMP2*IGFBP7 index  will 
be obtained via assays conducted in co -investigator [CONTACT_603341]’s laboratory at 
UNM HSC.  The blood sample collection for these timepoints will occur in UNMH 
patient areas.  
8.4. We do not plan to involve a community advisement board.  
8.5. This research will not be conducted outside UNMH or its affiliates.

likely to be completed in one year.  The target sample size represents less than one 
consenting patient per week.  
 All investigators have available time (non -clinical days, etc) for completion of 
research -related tasks as part of their routine job duties.  
 UNMH already performs many cardiac surgeries per year, and is equipped with the 
personnel and other resources needed to provide appr opriate care for these patients, 
including both routine care and care for any com plications or other unexpected 
situations.  
 All investigators will receive a copy of the HRRC -approved protocol  and will 
participate in discussions about the research plan and logistics.  
10. Prior Approvals  
10.1. HRRC approval will be obtained before research activit ies commence.  
10.2. The Departmental Review Form is included with this application . 
10.3. This study does not involve ionizing radiation . 
10.4. This study does not involve the collection of biological specimens for long -term 
storage .  All blood and urine samples obtained wi ll be destroyed as appropriate upon 
completion of individual lab analyses.  
10.5. This study will be listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.  
11. Multi -Site Research  
11.1. This is not multi -site research.  
12. Study Procedures  
12.1. Consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive eith er Isolyte -S balanced 
crystalloid or normal saline for intraoperative maintenance and resuscitation fluids.  
The amount administered is left to the discretion of the clinical providers, according to 
usual clinical criteria and practice.  Other than the pro duct selection of normal saline vs. 
Isolyte, this study presents no changes to patient treatment.   
 Consenting patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Isolyte -S or normal 
saline solution in the perioperative period, in an amount determined by t he provider 
for clinical reasons.  Data to be gathered include basic demographic data, surgery 
type, and certain laboratory values.  Lab data to be gathered include serum creatinine 
levels preoperati vely, as well as levels of TIMP 2, IGFBP7, serum creatinin e, serum 
chloride, and arterial pH at timepoints as defined in the primary and secondary 
outcome measures listed above.  The need for dialysis (clinically determined by [CONTACT_603331])  prior to discharge will a lso 
The Impact of Low Chloride Containing Fluids on Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiopulmonary 
By[CONTACT_603327] [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]  
 Page 9 of 16 Version Date : December 7 , 2015 be recorded.  The outcome measures are intended to indicate risk for or actual acute 
kidney injury.    
 Both normal saline and Isolyte -S (B Braun Medical Inc., Bethlehem PA, [LOCATION_003])) are 
legally marketed in the [LOCATION_002], and FDA approved for this indic ation  (fluid 
maintenance) . Providers already have clinical discretion to administer either normal 
saline or Isolyte -S in the setting of cardiac surgery , and it is normal practice to 
administer electrolyte -containing fluids intravenously during these surger ies. 
 Subjects will not be asked to complete a questionnaire or otherwise volunteer 
information . 
 All study data will be sourc ed from patient medical records , except for the TIMP2 
and IGFBP7 laboratory values .   
 The preoperative serum creatinine test is part  of routine practice, and is expected for 
all preoperative cardiac surgery patients.  Intraoperative fluid maintenance is routine 
for surgical patients, and providers already have clinical discretion to administer 
normal saline or Isolyte -S.  Arterial bloo d pH monitoring is also routine  for these 
patients.  The remaining data consists of laboratory values.  Routine labwork  
(including all of the lab -based secondary outcome measures)  is an expected part of 
cardiac surgery patients’ postoperative care .  The TI MP2*IGFBP7 index will be 
obtained in addition to routine postoperative monitoring; routine postoperative 
labwork (e.g. to assess kidney function) is not being replaced.  
 This is not a humanitarian -use device study . 
 There will be an interim review of all stu dy data  after completion of the 20th 
participant, in an effort to detect any unusual patterns of morbidity/mortality.  All 
outcomes will be analyzed.  The study will be suspended if this interim review detects 
a statistically -significant difference is dete cted between study arms with respect to the 
clinically -determined need for dialysis prior to discharge.  
13. Data Analysis  
13.1. The primary outcome involves a composite index: the product of urinary TIMP2 and 
IGFBP7 values.  For a given patient, this index will be c alculated for preoperative 
values and for postoperative values as described above, and the difference between pre - 
and postoperative index values will be recorded as the primary outcome.  A t -test (or 
Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test, in the case of nonnormal di stributions) will be used to 
evaluate the hypothesis.  Secondary outcomes that similarly involve pre - vs. 
postoperative changes in laboratory values (serum creatinine and serum chloride) will 
be tested in the same fashion.  The [ADDRESS_798962] 
or Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney as appropriate depending on distribution normality.  The 
clinically -determined need for dialysis prior to discharge will be assessed with Fisher’s 
Exact test.   
13.2. A power analysis with G*Power [IP_ADDRESS] softwar e indicates that this sample size is 
sufficient in the context of a t -test to detect a difference between groups for the primary 
outcome that is roughly equal to the sample standard deviation. For (purely 
hypothetical) example, if the mean is 100 units and  roughly 2/[ADDRESS_798963] 80% power to detect a treatment difference of [ADDRESS_798964] of Low Chloride Containing Fluids on Acute Kidney Injury after Cardiopulmonary 
By[CONTACT_603327] [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7]  
 Page 10 of 16 Version Date : December [ADDRESS_798965] been safely used in cardiac surgery for many years. 
It is exceedingly unlikely that scientific literature would indicate a substantial 
difference in risk posed by [CONTACT_603332]; however, as Chief of Cardiac 
Anesthesia at UNMH, [CONTACT_603345] routinely reviews scientific/medical literature 
related to cardiac surgery.  
14.4. Patient records will be reviewed for unusual patterns of morbidity/m ortality.  In 
addition, all outcomes will be analyzed with the above -described statistical tests.  
14.5. The study will be suspended if a statistically -significant difference is detected in the 
interim analysis between study arms with respect to the clinically -determined need for 
dialysis prior to discharge.   
14.6. The HRRC will be notified if the suspension criterion is met.  
15. Withdrawal of Subjects  
15.1. We have not identified any likely circumstances in which subjects may be withdrawn 
from the study without their consent.  However, there is a very unlikely chance (<1%) 
of an unforeseen situation in the process of administering the fluids that may bias the 
results; data for any affected patients would be omitted from the final analysis.  
15.2. Consenting participants may withdraw at  any time.  If medically appropriate in the 
clinical judgment of the attending physicians, the IV fluid solution may be changed 
upon participant -initiated withdrawal.  This change would not require any tapering of 
dosage or laboratory tests.  Data collecti on would simply cease.   
15.3. We do not anticipate any partial withdrawals  from arm assignment only , but 
participants who wish to withdraw from arm assignment and for whom the IV fluid is 
changed per the providers’ clinical judgment will also be removed from da ta collection 
efforts  in order to maintain data consistency .  If an enrolled  patient elects this type of 
partial withdrawal  after IV fluid administration begins and the fluid is not changed  per 
the providers’ clinical judgment , data collection will continu e as usual because there is 
no effective change to treatment.  After arm assignment, details of the administration of 
IV fluids (e.g. flow rate, duration, etc) are always left to the discretion of the attending 
physicians , so post -withdrawal IV fluid admin istration will not change in a specified 
way.   
15.4. Data for participants who elect to withdraw completely will be omitted from analysis.  
Any already -gathered data will be maintained for purposes of safety review and 
oversight, but identifiers will be removed  upon withdrawal.  Specimens will be 
appropriately discarded upon patient withdrawal regardless of data collection status.

of data collection.  Paper data collection forms bearing identifiers will be maintained in 
a locked cabinet i n Anesthesiology department offices.  Upon completion of data 
collection, deidentified data will be entered to a spreadsheet maintained on UNM HSC 
password -protected servers.  When this step is complete, all data forms bearing 
identifiers will be securely shredded, leaving only deidentified data for analysis.  
16.7. Data will not be coded.   
16.8. Datasheets will be maintained until the completion of data collection .  Data may be 
spot-checked at this point against the medical record, and any incomplete or illegible 
entries will be rectified by [CONTACT_603333].   
16.9. Identifiable data will not be transferred or transmitted to outside entities.   
16.10.  Identifiable data will not be collected, transmitted, or stored via the internet.   
16.11.  Data will not be collected by [CONTACT_603334].   
16.12.  Data will not include photographs.   
17. Data and Specimen Banking  
17.1. Upon completion of data collection, all study data will be deidentified.  Deidentified 
data may be maintained indefinitely for future use, e.g. to provide underlying d ata for a 
future power analysis.    
17.2. This is not a multicenter study; all data will be maintained locally on password -
protected UNM HSC servers.    
18. Risks to Subjects  
18.1. The primary risk to participants is posed by [CONTACT_17628].  The current evidence is 
hypoth etical and thus not sufficient to make a clear determination as to the relative

 Page 12 of 16 Version Date : December 7 , 2015 safety of normal saline vs. Isolyte for cardiac surgery patients, or the extent to which 
they may or may not reduce  kidney -related complications of surgery.       
18.2. Both normal s aline and Isolyte are in widespread use for fluid replenishment during 
surgery, with excellent safety records.   
18.3. Risks to embryos and fetuses are not relevant here; pregnancy is an exclusion criterion.   
18.4. There are no appreciable risks to others who are not  subjects.   
18.5. Steps taken to minimize the probability or magnitude of risks include: selection of 
FDA -approved IV fluids for the study, the open -label nature of the study, permitting 
provider discretion in amounts administered, gathering as much study data as possible 
from the already -existing medical record, maintaining routine labwork to forewarn 
providers of developi[INVESTIGATOR_603323],  and exclusion of patients known to have 
kidney problems . 
19. Potential Benefits to Subjects  
19.1. We have not identified any benefi ts that will accrue to all subjects.  If one of the two IV 
fluids is superior to the other, patients randomized to receive it may experience benefit.  
The existence and nature of these benefits is not currently known, but because both 
normal saline and Iso lyte are currently in widespread use for intraoperative fluid 
maintenance without known major problems, any benefit is expected to be small  and 
only detectable at the group level . 
20. Recruitment Methods  
20.1. Potential subjects who are already inpatients will be re cruited in patient rooms at 
UNMH the night before surgery.  For patients who arrive at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603324], recruitment will occur in the pre -operative holding areas.  
20.2. Investigators will identify potential subjects from their regularly -schedu led case load, 
and apply the inclusion/exclusion criteria to the extent possible prior to making 
research -related contact [CONTACT_4490] a patient.   
20.3. No recruitment materials are planned.  Potential participants will be provided a copy of 
the consent form for their review and consideration  during the recruitment process .  
Consenting participants will be provided a copy of the completed form.  
21. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
21.1. Cardiac surgery patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will  be asked to 
consider participation in a research study while in the pre -operative holding area.  This 
area is already used for private doctor/patient conversations, so it provides sufficient 
privacy for research conversations.  This conversation will cons ist only of study 
introduction and the consent process, because patients do not need to personally 
provide any information for this study.  Similarly, this study does not involve patients 
being observed or otherwise experiencing anything beyond their expec ted surgery.   All 
data to be gathered will be obtained from the patients’ medical records, in a secure HSC 
area by [CONTACT_603335].

22.1. All research activities for this study, save the TIMP2 and IGFBP 7 assays, occur in the 
context of routine care for cardiac surgery patients.  All relevant costs are listed above.    
22.2. Both normal saline and Isolyte are already approved for use in this context, and 
depending on providers’ clinical preference, either of th em may be used for any cardiac 
surgery patient at UNMH.  Relevant patients are already expected to receive one or 
both of these types of IV fluids, regardless of participation in this study.  The difference 
in participant costs is relatively small: most p atients are expected to receive 4 or fewer 
1L bags of fluids.  Normal saline costs approximately $2.50, and Isolyte costs 
approximately $25.  
22.3. Patients will be responsible for paying for treatment of adverse events.   
22.4. Relevant costs are described in the conse nt form.   
23. Compensation  
23.1. Participants will not be compensated for their participation.   
24. Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
24.1. Research -related injury is not anticipated , and we do not have dedicated funds available 
to compensate in the unlikely event of  research -related injury .  This information is 
contained in the consent form.   
25. Consent Process  
25.1. Consent will be obtained for participation in this study.   
25.1.1.  Only qualified study team members will obtain consent.  All study team members 
are qualified to disc uss medical information with patients and have HIPAA 
certification.   
25.1.2.  The consent process will occur in patient rooms or the preoperative holding areas.  
To provide for privacy, the consent conversation will begin with a simple 
question about whether the p atient has interest in participating in a research study.

 Page 14 of 16 Version Date : December 7 , 2015 25.1.3.  Coercion and undue influence will be minimized by [CONTACT_603336], and by [CONTACT_603337]’s participati on choice.   
25.1.4.  Inpatients will be able to consider participation overnight.  Patients who arrive at 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_603325] (after study  
introduction).  As any difference in risk and benefit is expected to be very small, 
this period of time should suffice for most patients.  Any patients who cannot 
come to a decision in this time will be excused from participation, and receive IV 
fluids ac cording to the provider’s clinical judgment.  
25.1.5.  The study intervention occurs over the duration of surgery.  Ongoing consent 
should not be an issue, but  any expressed desire to withdraw will be acted upon as 
soon as is practical.  
25.1.6.  The study team member obtaini ng consent will describe the study and consent 
material carefully, but as this study involves a relatively simple intervention, will 
not take specific steps to enhance understanding.   
25.1.7.  The study team member obtaining consent will ask the potential particip ant to 
describe the planned intervention, randomization, and risks/benefits to ensure 
understanding.   
Subjects  not fluent in English  
25.1.8.  We do not anticipate enrollment of large numbers of patients who do not speak 
English.  We expect that Spanish would be th e most common alternative language 
spoken by [CONTACT_42148].   
25.1.9.  If any enrolled participants have limited fluency in English, consent will be 
obtained with the HRRC’s standard short -form consent document for these 
enrollments.  Translation into a la nguage suitable for the participant will occur via 
the same channels as routine clinical conversations: e.g. the official UNMH 
translation service, a bilingual family member whose presence is approved by [CONTACT_603338], and/or bilingual UNMH s taff.   
Cognitively Impaired Adults /Adults Unable to Consent/Use of a Legally Authorized 
Representative  
25.1.10.  We do not plan to enroll participants who are cognitively impaired, unable to 
consent, or who require the use of a legally authorized representative . 
Subjects  who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)  
25.1.11.  Only adults will be enrolled.   
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (consent will not be obtained, required 
element of consent will not be included, or one or more required elements of consen t 
will be altered)

26.1. Consent will be documented; the form is included with this application.   
26.2. This study does not involve the storage of tissue samples.   
27. Study T est Results/Incidental Findings  
27.1. Individual Results:   Nearly all of the clinical data to be obtained for this study  are 
already gathered as part of routine medical care.  Any important individual results 
indicated by [CONTACT_603339], consistent with 
routine medical care.  The TIMP2 * IGFBP7 index used here is likely to be  an indicator 
of outcomes relevant to the care of post cardiac surgery patients , but it has not yet been 
validated so it is of little utility outside th e research context .  Individual results of note 
for all lab results  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_603326], but usually  implicitly  (e.g. 
reference to overall “labwork”) , in connection with routine  care.   The specific index 
result may or may not be calculat ed prior to patient discharge.  
27.2. Incidental Findings:  All dat a to be recorded for this study are relevant to patients’ 
postoperative care, and most are already gathered as part of routine medical care.  Only 
the TIMP2 * IGFBP7 index is specific to this resea rch (this test is only available in the 
context of research) .  Any results that fall outside expected ranges would inform 
ongoing medical treatment.  This study does not involve imaging, genetic sequencing, 
or other technique likely to generate incidental findings.  We do not anticipate any 
incidental findings being produced by [CONTACT_15365] .   
28. Sharing Study Progress or Results with Subjects  
28.1. This study does not inv olve ongoing treatment, so  there would be little benefit to 
informing participants of overall study results while the study is underway.   Similarly, 
even if any preliminary results were available, the resultingly small sample size would 
reduce their reliability.  Accordingly, we do not plan to share preliminary  study results 
with subjects .   
28.2. We do n ot plan to provide subjects with a summary of study results after the study is 
complete, because study data will be deidentified upon completion of data collection, 
and it will not be possible to identify participants when th e final results are available.  It 
would also not be possible to change the IV fluids that the patient had received during 
surgery.  Similarly, this study does not involve collection of long -term outcome data, so 
it will not be possible to provide patients with information about any fut ure risk.  
29. Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations  
29.1. This research does not involve vulnerable populations.   
30. Community -Based Participatory Research  
30.1. This study does not involve community -based participatory research.   
31. Research Involving American Indian/Native Po pulations

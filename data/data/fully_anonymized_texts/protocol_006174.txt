Protocol Version  #: 12  8 
Protocol Date:  4/11/2023  1.0 Background  
 
Mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience high  levels of depressive 
symptoms,  which impair their ability to monitor and manage diabetes treatment 
effectively. The regimen recommended for type 1 diabetes is complex and demanding, and caregivers - especially mothers - experience stress related to the burden of 
treatment management. This stress is associated with increased risk for psychosocial 
problems in caregivers, with rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression 
evident in up to 61% of parents. Further, maternal depressive symptoms are one of the 
strongest predictors of negative outcomes in adolescents, including deteriorating 
glycemic control, problems with adherence, poorer quality of life, and greater risk for depression. Given that adolescents are a high -risk population for suboptimal glycemic 
control - with only 17% meeting treatment goals - there is a critical need for novel 
interventions to improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D. Yet, previous behavioral interventions for youth with diabetes have had only modest effects on glycemic control, 
many were time - and resource -intensive, and none have directly targeted maternal 
depressive symptoms.  
 
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Based on the Transactional Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_459583], which views chronic illness as a 
stressor to which children and mothers attempt to adapt, the ways in which mothers 
cope with the stress of diabetes play an important role in both maternal and adolescent 
adjustment to the disease. The proposed study is based on the premise that, by 
[CONTACT_740931]' depressive symptoms and improving the quality of parental 
involvement, we will improve outcomes in adolescents with T1D.  Building on effective 
interventions to treat depression in adults, and our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_740914], the 
proposed study will use a rigorous approach to evaluate the efficacy of a cognitive -
behavioral intervention for mothers of adolescents with type [ADDRESS_1012957] are:  
1. Evaluate the efficacy of the Communication & Copi[INVESTIGATOR_740915]’ diabetes outcomes (i.e., glycemic control, adherence) over 12 months. We will examine whether 
these effects were driven by [CONTACT_740932] ( maternal depressive 
symptoms, parental involvement ). 
Hypothesis: The adolescents of mothers who receive the intervention will demonstrate better glycemic control and better adherence to treatment 
than those in the attention control  condition . 
 2. Evaluate the efficacy of the Communication & Copi[INVESTIGATOR_740916]’ psychosocial 
outcomes (i.e., adolescent depressive symptoms and quality of life) over 12 months.  
Hypothesis:  The adolescents of mothers who receive the intervention will 
report better quality of life and fewer depressive symptoms than those in 
the attention control  condition.  
NIDDK  
 
Protocol Version  #: 12  9

Exploratory Aim : Examine the differential impact of intervention effects across 
demographic  factors (i.e., marital status, income, adolescent age, and sex).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1012958]. Jaser and colleagues conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_740917] & copi[INVESTIGATOR_740918] 30 mothers of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, which supported the 
feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention ( http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018 -
[ZIP_CODE] -003). Results from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_740919]' quality of life and depressive symptoms. In addition, adolescents whose 
mothers received the intervention demonstrated promising improvements in glycemic 
control, and we found support for the effect of the intervention on mediating variables, 
with large effects on maternal depressive symptoms and family conflict.  
 
4.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
List the criteria:  
• mother or female caregiver to an adolescent (age 11 -17)  
• mother lives with adolescent at least 50% of the time  
• adolescent child has been diagnosed with type [ADDRESS_1012959] 12 months  
• mother uses Facebook regularly  
• mother reports mild to moderate symptoms of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 score of 5- 19) OR mother reports diabetes distress (Parent /Teen 
Relationship Distress Subscale score of 2 or higher)  
• mother and adolescent able to speak and read English  
• mother and adolescent do not have a history of severe psychopathology (e.g., 
schizophrenia, bipolar  disorder)  
 
5.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 Participants will be enrolled from the Children’s Diabetes Program at Vanderbilt.  
 
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and social distancing requirements, a remote 
recruitment and enrollment protocol was established. KSP will review the diabetes clinic 
schedule, and participants who meet initial eligibility criteria (age, date of diagnosis) will 
be called the week of their clinic visit. The RA will introduce the study, and if mothers are interested, verbal consent for the screening questionnaire will be obtained. Mothers 
who consent will be emailed a link to the screening survey in REDCap. The RA will then 
email the mother to let her know if she is eligible or not. Eligible mothers will be asked to schedule a time for enrollment. At the preferred time, the mother and adolescent will 
be called, and the RA will provide each with a full description of the risks and benefits of 
the study. If they agree to participate, they will be emailed the link to sign the eConsent form in REDCap. The RA will stay on the phone while these are signed to answer any 
questions. Once consent/assent forms are signed, the parent and adolescent will be 
emailed links to complete the study surveys in REDCap. The mother will be asked to text 
the RA when these are completed or if they have any questions. The final enrollment 
will take place over the phone (demo text message and Facebook friending).

Protocol Version  #: 12  10 
Protocol Date:  4/11/2023   
After completing all baseline data, mothers will be given  instructions to "friend" the 
study Facebook account. Once the mother has established a connection to the study 
Facebook account, the mother -adolescent dyad will be randomly assigned to the 
intervention condition or attention control (equal numbers in each group). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_521230]' treatment type (insulin pump vs. 
injections) and use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM or no CGM) to remove the 
possibility of confounding by [CONTACT_740933]. Randomization will 
be determined by a computerized program created by [CONTACT_740934] 
(Chris Slaughter).  
 
Participating  mother s will be mailed a study binder and an A1C mail -in kit within 2- 3 
days of enrollment.  
 Adolescents’ glycemic control will be assessed with HbA1c, which is obtained as part of 
regular clinical care. For adolescents who do not have an HbA1c value associated with a 
clinic visit (due to social distancing requirements), we will request that they use a mail -in 
kit. The kit includes clear instructions to provide a dried blood spot that is mailed to the 
lab (Coremedica). When the lab value is available, KSP will notify study participants.

successfully by [CONTACT_258179]. Follow -up data will be collected at 
regularly -scheduled diabetes clinic visits, so that questionnaire data corresponds with 
clinical data. The measures take about 40 minutes to complete. Mothers will also 
complete a measure of depression (PHQ -9) via a link emailed to them by [CONTACT_740935] (first 3 months). All measures will 
be collected using REDCap.

At baseline and 6 months data collection, adolescent -mother dyads will participate in a 
15-minute videotaped conversation about diabetes -related stress. To choose the topic 
for the video interaction, we will use the mother ’s highest -rated stressor  on the 
Response to Stress Questionnaire (Connor -Smith, Compas, Wadsworth, Thomsen, & 
Saltzman, 2000), completed as part of the survey data collection, which lists diabetes -
specific stressors. Mothers will rate the frequency of each stressor (e.g., worrying about 
"bad" numbers, remembering diabetes supplies) on a 4- point Likert scale ranging from 0 
(never) to 3 (almost every day). Each dyad will be given a cue card with questions 
regarding the highest -rated stressor (e.g., What happened the last time we [had to you 
remember diabetes supplies], what kind of emotions do we have when we [have to 
remember diabetes supplies]? How can we reduce this stress?) to guide their discussion during the videotaped interaction. This protocol has been used successfully in other 
studies conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jaser, and she has trained several cohorts of raters on the 
Iowa Family Interaction Rating Scales to be reliable coders.  
 
The interaction will be recorded using study iPads. Video files will be transferred from 
the passcoded iPad to an encrypted study computer, and then uploaded to Enterprise Storage, the secure, shared drive. Video files will only be viewed by [CONTACT_144052].  
 Mothers in the study will have [ADDRESS_1012962] approximately 10-
30 minutes. Mothers assigned to the Communication & Copi[INVESTIGATOR_740920] -related stress and positive parenting strategies, 
following the study manual mailed to participants after randomization. The content of 
this manual was reviewed by a coder trained in health literacy at Vanderbilt's Effective 
Health Communication Core. Each session was given a Suitability Assessment of 
Materials (SAM) score to objectively assess the materials for clear communication and 
health information design (content, literacy demand, graphics, layout and typography, learning stimulation, and cultural appropriateness). Scores of 70% to 100% are 
considered  superior material suitable for low health literacy individuals (Doak, Doak, & 
Root, 1996). On the SAM scale, our sessions were rated 78% to 86%, with a reading

Protocol Version  #: 12  12 
Protocol Date:  4/11/2023 level of 6th -7th grade. In addition, the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool 
(PEMAT) was used to assess the understandability and actionability of our intervention 
materials, with specific suggestions to raise these scores further (e.g., add pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], highlight goals for each session; Shoemaker, Wolf, & Brach, 2013). On the PEMAT, the 
scores for individual sessions ranged from 79% to 92% (higher scores indicate that 
material is more understandable or actionable). All recommendations for changes were incorporated into the final versions of the manual.  
 Mothers assigned to the Diabetes Education group will discuss content related to 
diabetes management, in line with the educational materials mailed to participants after 
randomization. These materials were based on information available on the American Diabetes Association website ( www.diabetes.org
). Mothers in the Diabetes Education 
group will be given the option to receive the manual containing the Communication and 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_740921] [ADDRESS_1012963] 2 "booster" calls will occur monthly. The calls 
will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for study participants. These calls will be 
audio recorded and 20% will be randomly assessed for fidelity by [CONTACT_740952].  
Audio files of the intervention sessions will be stored on the same secure, shared drive 
and will only be accessed by [CONTACT_740953].  
 
Study participants will be required to "friend" the study Facebook account before they 
are added to the secret groups to ensure that the correct person is added. All mothers 
in the study will receive [ADDRESS_1012964] per day for 3 months. The posts will be on topi[INVESTIGATOR_740922] (communication and copi[INVESTIGATOR_740923]). A moderator will view and respond to all comments made by [CONTACT_740954].  
Facebook data will be extracted using programming stored on a protected server and stored in a de -identified SPSS file.  
 
7.0 Risks 
 
Data collection requires participants (adolescents and mothers) to spend approximately 
40 minutes at each collection (baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months) completing 
surveys . At baseline and [ADDRESS_1012965] 30- 45 minutes (the first 5 
sessions will occur weekly, and the 2 booster sessions will occur monthly). In addition, we expect mothers to spend approximately 5 minutes per day reviewing Facebook posts. This is not anticipated to be an undue burden for the participants.  
 We will download data from the Facebook group including posts, comments, and reactions from the participants so that we can study these data to better understand 
how people participate in this component of the program. We will not download any 
data from participants' Facebook profiles or any posts to their feeds - only the posts, 
comments, and the posts/comments that participants react to in the study Facebook 
group.

If mothers report  severe symptoms of depression (PHQ -9 score of 20 or higher) or 
endorse the 9th item on the PHQ -9, indicating thoughts of self -harm , we will follow up 
with a depression protocol . A member of the research team will give the mother the 
resources handout, which includes crisis hotline numbers and mental health services. 
The PI (or the clinic social worker, if available) will follow up with the mother within 48 
hours to discuss and will refer her to the ER or crisis hotline if needed.  
 If adolescents  endorse items on the Youth Self Report ( YSR) measure pertaining to 
suicide or self -harm, we will follow the following p rocedure for self -harm assessment . 
Item 18 asks individuals to rate from 0- 2 (how often)  "I deliberately try to hurt or kill 
myself." Similarly, item 91 reads "I think about killing myself." Scores of 1 indicate 
"sometime" and 2 indicate "usually."  When the YSR is given during study enrollment, 
researchers will immediately check  items 18 and 91. If a 1 or 2 is indicated on either of 
these items , the Pediatric Endocrinology social worker will be paged and will complete a 
risk assessment following clinic protocol. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_740924]. If the clinic social worker is not available, research staff will administer the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS). If information gathered from the C -SSRS indicates low risk 
(non- specific ideation, no plan) , individuals will be given information on local behavioral 
health resources and informed that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_740925] 48 
hours. If the C -SSRS indicates high risk or risk is ambiguous the clinic social worker will 
be contact[CONTACT_740955]/or to transfer the patient for psychiatric evaluation. If the clinic social worker cannot be reached, the researcher will accompany 
the patient and their caregiver to the Children's Emergency Department for psychiatric 
evaluation.  
 
We will download data from the Facebook group including posts, comments, and reactions from the participants so that we can study this data to better understand how 
people participate and how much response our posts garnered from the group. We will 
not download any data from participants' Facebook profiles or any posts to their feeds - 
only the posts, comments, and the posts/comments participants react to in the study Facebook group.  
 
All children will receive clinical care throughout the course of the study. All diabetes 
treatment decisions will be made by [CONTACT_740956]. All patients have 
access to the treatment team 24 hours/day and 7 days per week. Participants will be 
informed that they may discontinue the study at any time or skip any questions they do 
not feel comfortable answering. There are no potential legal or social risks to 
participants consenting to participate in this investigation. Parents will be told to follow 
the diabetes clinic providers' guidance on any questions related to diabetes 
management.

(continuous variables) or Pearson's Chi -squared test (categorical variables).  We will 
also examine if diabetes -related variables (e.g., duration of diabetes, baseline A1C) are 
associated with treatment group. A priori, we assume that our block randomization will 
lead to well -balanced groups so that we will not need to control for additional 
confounders.  
NIDDK  
 
Protocol Version  #: 12  15 
Protocol Date:  4/11/2023  
Effects of the Intervention : We will estimate the effect of the intervention on each of the 
continuous outcomes by [CONTACT_740959] -effects models developed. In modeling, 
outcomes will be considered at their key time- points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 
12 months) with treatment group and the interaction of treatment with time serving as the 
main explanatory variables.  Such a model will allow us to test for any differences 
between treatment and control groups over time while accounting for baseline values . 
While the randomized block design should minimize confounding, we will adjust for age, 
income, and marital status to improve precision. The results from the adjusted and 
unadjusted models will be compared with respect to their estimates of the treatment 
effects. Our interpretation will focus on describing clinically relevant treatment effects 
(e.g., A1C reductions of >0.5%, >1 additional glucose check per day, reduction from 
moderate to mild depressive symptoms) with corresponding confidence intervals, rather 
than just significance testing. We will include a random intercept to account for within-
subject correlation. The error structure of the model is assumed to be compound 
symmetric, and the validity of this assumption will be examined by [CONTACT_740960].  Subjects will be included in the 
analysis if they have an outcome measured at baseline and at least one outcome 
measured [ADDRESS_1012969] effects of potential mediator variables, we will follow the steps outlined 
by [CONTACT_740961]108,109 to establish mediation.  The bootstrap method will be 
used to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the total, direct, and indirect effects. We will test maternal depressive symptoms and parental involvement as mediators of treatment 
effects, maintaining consistent temporal ordering, by [CONTACT_740962], 3 -month depressive symptoms and parental involvement variables as the 
mediators, and 6 -month outcomes (treatment effects), as well as 12 -month outcomes 
(sustained treatment effects)  Our longitudinal data will also allow us to consider 
additional analyses that account for the bidirectional relationships between family 
functioning and depressive symptoms. 
 
To determine the feasibility of the intervention, we will examine recruitment and retention 
data. In addition, fidelity checks will be conducted by [CONTACT_42574] 20% of the telephone 
sessions, which will be coded for content by [CONTACT_31185]. We propose a 
feasibility benchmark of >90% fidelity. To evaluate acceptability of the intervention, we 
will examine participation (phone call attendance), adherence (completion of homework), 
and satisfaction ratings. We propose a feasibility benchmark of > 80% attendance. We 
will also conduct exit interviews with mothers, which will be analyzed with a content analysis approach to identify themes across participants.  
 Assessing biases caused by [CONTACT_390464]:  Some subjects may not return for their follow -up 
visit and hence have missing values of their response variables.  Frequently, such subjects ("dropouts") are not a random sample of the entire cohort and an analysis of only the complete cases will bias the results.  Indirect information about the nonrandom 
dropouts will be obtained by [CONTACT_740963].

Exploratory Aim: Examine the differential impact of intervention effects across 
demographic factors (i.e., marital status, income, adolescent age, and sex).   
While evaluating the main effects of interventions is critical to improving health outcomes, it is equally important to examine moderators of randomized clinical trials – 
even those that are unsuccessful – in order to determine for whom  interventions may 
work.  Based on findings from the literature and our own earlier work, we will examine 
potential moderators, with a focus on marital status, income, and adolescent age and sex. Moderators will be tested by [CONTACT_740964].  
 
Power and sample size:  
We plan to enroll 154 subjects so that, after allowing for a 15 % attrition  
rate, 130 subjects will be available for analysis.  Preliminary data from 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] 30 adolescents indicates that mean A1C is 9.0% 
with a standard deviation of 1.16% and a correlation between repeated 
measurements over time of 0.60.  Under these assumptions, we will 
have 80% power to detect a 0.5% difference in A1C if 122 subjects are 
measured at all 4 time points or if 138 subjects are measured only 
twice  (out of 4 possible time points) .  Since we expect to obtain >[ADDRESS_1012970]  of subjects, enrolling 130 subjects with 2 to 4 
measurements each will provide sufficient power for Aim 1.  For the 
SCI (a measure of adherence), using preliminar y data in 30 subjects 
we estimated baseline scores of 23.6±4.[ADDRESS_1012971] 80% power to detect a 2.0 unit change due to 
treatment, which is an 8.5% difference from baseline.    
 Power calculations for mediation models were considered assuming [ADDRESS_1012972] 63% 
power to detect an indirect effect of treatment on A1C through PHQ9 and >99% power 
to detect an indirect effect of treatment on A1C through DFC. C alculations assume a 
0.[ADDRESS_1012973] size of the moderation and if the 
moderator is measured on a continuous or categorical scale.  For continuous 
moderators (adolescent age), we have 80% power to detect a 0.36% change in the treatment effect on A1C per 1 -sd change in the moderator.  For a binary moderator 
(frequency 50%), we have 80% power to detect a modification of the treatment effect on A1C of 0.55%.   All calculations assume α=0.05.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_740927]- based CBT to reduce 
depressive symptoms, there is a chance that mothers who receive the intervention will not report reduced depressive symptoms. If this happens, we would examine the data to 
determine for whom the intervention works. For example, it may be that a more limited 
range of scores on the screening tool (PHQ -9) predicts a better response to the 
intervention.

11.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Confidential participant data will be safeguarded by [CONTACT_740965], data encryption, and locked secure storage of paper documents.  
 
Facebook interactions will be conducted in private (called "secret") Facebook groups. 
Secret groups allow permissions access to be managed and monitored by [CONTACT_8702], only allowing approved study participants into the group. Any Facebook users not 
approved by [CONTACT_740966]. All 
interactions in the group will be extracted using programming stored on a protected server and stored in an SPSS file.  
 Study participants will be required to "friend" the study Facebook account before they are added to the secret groups to ensure that the correct person is added. All mothers 
in the study will receive [ADDRESS_1012974] per day for 3 months. The posts will be on topi[INVESTIGATOR_740922] (communication and copi[INVESTIGATOR_740923]). A moderator will view and respond to all comments made by [CONTACT_740954].  
 
Only Key Study Personnel (KSP) will have access to research information, and all KSP 
will complete training in Good Clinical Practice.  
 Participants will be identified with an ID number; names will not be included on any data 
outside of RedCAP. Only research staff who have completed IRB training and have been 
added as KSP have access to the study RedCAP. All identifying information will be 
destroyed at the earliest possible time following completion of the study. All data will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_10609], with no potential for individual patients to be identified. Any 
publications arising from the study will not contain personal information.  
Digital files will be erased after completion of the study.

research is closed with the IRB. All Health Insurance Portability and Accountabi lity Act 
(HIPAA) related documentation will be maintained for at least six (6) years from the date of the last use or disclosure of the Protected Health Information (PHI).

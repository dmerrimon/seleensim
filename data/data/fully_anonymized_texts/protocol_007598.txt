Signature       [CONTACT_265726], Sandoval HP   [ADDRESS_368355] frequently performed surgical procedures and offers 
significant improvement to the patients’ quality of life. For refraction correction at the time 
of cataract surgery, the range of intraocular lenses available goes from monofocal intraocular 
lenses to the multifocal ones, including among the options, trifocal and extended depth of 
focus lenses (EDOF).  
Conventional monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) are the most common device implanted1 due 
to their low cost, highly predic table distance visual outcome and low incidence of photic 
symptoms. However, monofocal IOLs have no power to meet the visual expectations for 
those patients that wish to be less dependent on glasses while performing simple activities brought to us by [CONTACT_301577] n life, like computer work and cell phone usage, since these activities 
demand an increased need for  intermediate or near vision. Trifocal lenses provide the most 
extended range of vision , and could meet the intermediate and near vision expectations, but 
also with limitations. Due to their design, these diffractive lenses split the light to distinct 
foci; as a result, at one focus the indistinct image from the other foci introduces the potential 
for glare and halos. For some patients, even if they notice th is phenomenon, it is not 
bothersome to the point to complain about it; to others, on the other hand, glare and halos 
can be so disturbing that they have a very hard time adapting to this new visual reality. Another common complaint is the low er contrast se nsitivity, reported by [CONTACT_301578].  
Extended depth of focus, or EDOF , lenses were developed as a bridge to cover the gap 
between the monofocal and trifocal or multifocal intraocular lenses. EDOF lenses provide 
spectacle indepen dence for far and intermediate vision and  need only a minimal negative 
defocus for optimized near vision ; they are considered the best option for patients aiming to 
be less spectacle dependent and, at the same time, to avoid some of the side effects and th e 
compromising from trifocal and multifocal IOLs.  
Although the performance of EDOF lenses under photopic conditions has been widely 
investigated,
2-7 the question about their performance under mesopic conditions remains 
unanswered.

Solomon KD, Sandoval HP   13 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  CEP 23 -001 Version 1. 2 - 22Sep2023  
 
A. Description  
The Symfony InteliLight IOL (DXR00V or DXW150 – 375 – Toric II IOL) combines an 
echelette design (to create an extended depth of focus) with an achromatic 
technology (to correct chromatic aberrations) and a violet -light filter that 
diminishes the perceptio n of visual disturbances such as halo, glare,  and 
starburst. The lens has been designed to provide high quality vision up to 26 inches so patients may still need to wear glasses for some activities mainly at 
near.  
 
Acrysof® IQ Vivity Intraocular Lens is a non-diffractive aspheric IOL that provides 
an extended range of vision maintaining low incidence of visual disturbances 
when compared to a monofocal IOL. The extended vision ranging from distance to near is obtained by a Wavefront -shapi[INVESTIGATOR_301574] e anterior surface of 
the lens.  
 
B. Treatment/Dosing Regimen  
The IOL will be implanted at time of uncomplicated routine cataract surgery. Intraocular lenses are implantable medical devices and are intended for long term use over the lifetime of the patient.  
 
C. Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment/Dosing Groups  
N/A 
 
D. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Since the IOL is implanted at time of cataract surgery, subject compliance will not be an issue in this particular study.  
 
E. Packaging, Receiving, Storage, Dispensin g and Return

7. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This clinical trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and Good clinical practice . The Investigator and all clinical trial staff will conduct 
the clinical trial in compliance with this protocol. The Investigator will ensure that all 
personnel involved in the conduct of the clinical trial are qualified to perform their

1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
INTRODUCTION  
 Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are lifelong neurodevelopmental 
disorders characterized by [CONTACT_464681], socialization, and behavioral problems  [1]. The term PDD encompasses autistic disorder, Asperger’s 
disorder  and PDD -NOS  – together also referred to as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). 
An increasingly higher prevalence of ASD is documented in each successive epi[INVESTIGATOR_242660], and ASD is now estimated to affect more than 1% of youth [2].  
 In addition to the core features  of impaired communication, social deficits, and 
repetitive behaviors, youth with ASD manifest comorbid symptoms of anxiety and mood 
dysregulation that contribute to the morbidity and impairment associated with ASD [3-6]. 
In fact, anxiety -related difficulties are so frequently exhibited in children with ASD that 
the DSM -IV highlights anxiety -like responses as a common, ‘‘associated feature’’ of 
autism [7]. 
 Anxiety is a very common concern in children and adolescents with ASD, with 
recent studies suggesting that nearly half of children with ASD meet criteria for an anxiety disorder [8-9 ], especially social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, separation 
anxiety , and obsessive-compulsive disorder [ 10]. 
 In a study of our clinically referred population of youth with ASD , we observed 
high rates of psychiatric comorbidities  [11]. Multiple anxiety disorders (≥2) were present 
in more than half (61%) of the youth with ASD. Among the anxiety disorders , separation 
anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder , and agoraphobia were  concurrently  
present in more than a third of the youth with ASD (37%, 35% and 35%, respectively)  
and social phobia in more than a quarter of subjects (28 %). 
 The high rate of comorbidity with anxiety disorders in our youth with ASD is 
consistent with several previous uncontrolled studies that reported equally high prevalence rates of anxiety  disorder(s) in referred populations of youth with ASD  (43–
84%) [ 8,12-14] . Our findings also concur with previous studies reporting high prevalence 
rates of various specific anxiety disorders [ 13-16 ] and higher level s of anxiety symptom 
severity in samples  of referred populations with ASD [ 17-18]. 
 Underscoring the importance of targeting anxiety symptoms in these youth, 
children with ASD  have been found to present with higher rates of anxiety symptoms, 
including social anxiety, than either typi[INVESTIGATOR_464650] (e.g., specific language impairments) [ 19]. 
 Child anxiety has been associated with numerous impairments in social and 
academic functioning, including poorer self-image, lower rates of peer acceptance, and poorer performance on academic achievement tests [20]. If left untreated in childhood, 
anxiety disorders have been shown to persist through adolescence and adulthood and 
can become more severely impairing [21-23 ]. Moreover, child anxiety predicts the 
development of later psychiatric comorbi dities, including major depression [24], 
Study Protocol: ASD Open -Label  Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464647] 5 RtR 1 : Submitted to the IRB  12/14/[ADDRESS_595634] Modified: 12/14/2017  
 2 substance use disorders [25], and disruptive behavior disorders [26]. The present 
impairment and risk of future psychopathology and psychosocial dysfunction posed by [CONTACT_464682].  
 The presence of anxiety symptoms in youth with ASD  may be especially 
impairing to their functioning. Such symptoms  are associated higher levels of repetitive 
behaviors and poorer social reciprocity in youth with ASD [1 4]. Anxieties and fears are 
also associated with behavioral problems  in youth with ASD  at rates higher than those 
found in children with similar mental and chronological ages  [19]. Children with ASD  may 
also be especially vulnerable to the negative impact of anxiety symptoms, as associated 
avoidance behaviors may further compromise social interactions and limit opportunities 
for the development of appropriate social behaviors and peer relationships. Given the 
high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in children with ASD and the potential for very poor outcomes in children who experience these comorbid symptoms, it is important to develop effective interventions for these youth. 
 Anxiety disorders are common in typi[INVESTIGATOR_392403], 
with prevalence rates varying from 6 to 20% [ 27]. Substantial evidence supports the use 
of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ) in the treatment of pediatric anxiety 
disorders. SSRIs have emerged as the medications of choice for pediatric anxiety 
disorders  based on several controlled trials in youth with moderate to severe anxiety 
symptoms [ 28-30] . Furthermore, compared to its  antidepressant and anti -OCD effects , 
the anti -anxiety efficacy of SSRIs appears greatest in pediatric populations [ 31]. 
 Compared to typi[INVESTIGATOR_464651], youth with ASD exhibit a less 
robust response to psychotropic medications, with higher rates of adverse effects to both 
medication and placebo . Such research suggests individuals with ASD may have an 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_464652] [32-35 ]. 
 T here is increasing empi[INVESTIGATOR_464653] , 
although there also remains a great need for controlled trials of these medications. 
Limited case series and open-label studies have suggested that while SSRIs are 
effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety in youth with ASD, they are less well tolerated by [CONTACT_464683]. Sertraline is the only SSRI that has been evaluated by [CONTACT_3440]-label 
trial and found to be effective for the treatment of transition-related anxiety in children 
with autistic disorder [36]. In this trial, Steingard et al. investigated the use of open-label  
sertraline in 9 children with ASD  and found that 89% had a positive response in their 
mood and anxiety. Though sertraline was well tolerated at lower doses (<50 mg/day) , it 
was associated with behavioral worsening at higher doses . Similarly, in two case series , 
citalopram was found to be effective in treating anxiety but was associated with 
treatment limiting adverse events in nearly a quarter of the youth with ASD [ 37-38]. 
 Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_131521] a serotonin (5-HT) receptor type 1A agonist that is widely used as 
an anxiolytic in adults and to treat generalized anxiety disorder in children. Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464654] [ 39,40]. 
 Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464655] s to be of particular interest for the ASD population because of 
its benign adverse effect profile, including the absence of significant sedative properties 
and complicated interactions with other psychotropic agents. In addition, the serotonin agonist activity of the drug may be useful in the treatment of ASD as serotonin deregulation is implicated in the etiology of ASD [41-42]. 
 Limited trials suggest that buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464656]/aggression in ASD individuals [43] . More importantly , these limited trials 
suggest that buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464657].  
Study Protocol: ASD Open -Label  Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464647] 5 RtR 1 : Submitted to the IRB  12/14/[ADDRESS_595635] Modified: 12/14/[ADDRESS_595636] profile, holds 
promise for the treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD. Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331] c ould also be effective 
in treating emotional dysregulation (irritability/aggression) and inattention/hyperactivity , 
which  often coexist with ASD. Moreover, as a serotonergic agent, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464658].  
 
Primary Hypo thesis  
Our central hypothesis is that buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464659], well tolerated, and efficacious in the treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis  
Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464660] (irritability/aggression) and ADHD  in youth with ASD . 
2. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 The main objective of this open-label 8-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_464661] (ages 6-17 years) with autism spectrum disorders. The study results will be used to generate hypotheses for a larger randomized-controlled trial with explicit hypotheses and sufficient statistical power.  
3. LENGTH OF STUDY  
 The study will last up to 11 weeks (it could take up to three weeks to schedule 
and complete the initial screening process). Once subjects have completed the screening process, they will begin the 8-week open-label  phase. Subjects will be 
assessed on measures of efficacy and safety every week for the first 4 weeks (at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4) and thereafter biweekly until  the end of the study (at weeks 6 and 8). 
4. SOURCE OF SUBJECTS   
We plan to enroll 15 youth in order to achieve the goal of exposing 10 subjects to 
the study medication. We will recruit subjects  both internally and externally. Participants 
will be recruited from the pool of existing patients and new referrals to the Pediatric 
Psychopharmacology Program and the Alan and Lorraine Bressler Clinical and Research Program for Autism Spectrum Disorders at the MGH , as well as from the Child 
and Adolescent Psychiatry Department at MGH.  
The Bressler clinic is a specialized ambulatory care program, devoted to the 
assessment and treatment of youth and adults with ASD. The patient population served by [CONTACT_464684]. Approximately 50% of referrals have never been diagnosed or treated. The 3,[ADDRESS_595637]’s clinician ascertains that the patient has an interest in study 
participation, the clinician will offer contact [CONTACT_464685]/or 
their parent/guardian. The patient and/or their parent/guardian can then contact [CONTACT_464686]. If the patient's physician is a 
Study Protocol: ASD Open -Label  Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464647] 5 RtR 1 : Submitted to the IRB  12/14/[ADDRESS_595638] Modified: 12/14/2017  
 4 member of study staff, the patient and his/her family will also be offered the opportunity 
to speak with another study physician who is not their treating clinician to review study 
details and consider participation. Clinical records are not scanned in order to recruit 
subjects.  
 Subjects may also be recruited from our department’s screening protocol entitled, 
“A General Screening Protocol for Child and Adolescent Research Studies in the 
Pediatric Psychopharmacology Program”, (#2014-P-001103). After participating in the general screening protocol, subjects may be identified as potentially eligible for this study and will be contact[CONTACT_464687] [ADDRESS_595639] and/or their parent/guardian. The nature of the study will be fully explained to the subject and/or their parent/guardian by a board-certified physician 
who is either the primary investigator or co-investigator. The subject and/or their 
parent/guardian will be encouraged to ask questions pertaining to their participation in 
the study and the subject and/or their parent/guardian may take as much time as they 
feel necessary to consider their participation in the study as well as consult with family members or their physician. Participation in this study is voluntary and the subjects and/or their parent/guardian may withdraw from the study at any time. The IRB -approved 
informed consent documents will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_163295].

7. DESIGN  
This proposal seeks to complete an 8-week open-label  trial
 to study the efficacy, 
tolerability, and safety of buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464662] . In this study , we propose to examine ASD youth ages 6-17 years with 
significant anxiety features. 
Outcome measures 
Primary outcome measures: Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_464690]-An xiety-
Improvement scores. Responders are defined as ≥ 30% reduction on the PARS and a 
score  ≤ 2 on the improvement subscale of CGI-A nxiety , i.e., “much” or “very much 
improved.”  
Secondary outcome measures  will assess the impact of buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464663]: 
I. Safety and tolerability assessed by [CONTACT_10056]: 
1. For treatment-emergent adverse events  
2. Vita l signs (blood pressure, height and weight)

e. Repetitive/ritualistic behaviors assessed by [CONTACT_3962] -BOCS -PDD and CGI -OCD  
II. Core features of ASD assessed by [CONTACT_218117]-2 , CY-BOCS -PDD,  and MGH -SECS- C and -I 
III. Associated features of ASD assessed by [CONTACT_408147], CDRS -R, and respective CGI-
Improvement subscale  
IV. Cognitive functioning assessed by [CONTACT_464693] 2. 
 
 This study plans to recruit 15 subjects  with ASD between 6-17 years of age with 
clinically significant and functionally impairing features of anxiety as rated by  [CONTACT_7078] 
(significant score on the Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL ] subscales for 
anxiety/d epression) and clinician (a ≥ 4 on severity subscale of Cl inical Global 
Impression Scale [CGI ] for anxiety).  
 We anticipate that subjects may enter this trial following completion of/withdrawal 
from other protocols in our office, and that there may be procedural overlap. So as to not burden subjects/parents/guardians with redundant time commitments, we will use the following diagnostic  data previously  collected:  If a subject has completed an evaluation 
with one of the study clinicians within the previous three years or an informant has completed the SRS-[ADDRESS_595643] meets appropriate study entrance criteria.   If the subset of scales assessing intelligence (WASI-II) in the neuropsychological 
battery has been completed within [ADDRESS_595644] and parent/guardian over the phone. The clinician will complete the phone visit form for all phone visits that occur. This will ensure that each subject will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_267198][INVESTIGATOR_146592]. T he study evaluation visit, the baseline visit or 
the final study visit may be not conducted over the phone. Additionally, phone visits may 
not occur for two consecutive visits.   
  
Evaluation and Characterization: Week 99 
 After providing study information and obtaining IRB -approved informed consent 
and assent, participants will undergo an initial screening assessment consisting of a brief demographic interview (collectin g information regarding socioeconomic status and 
history of head injury or trauma) , psychiatric and medical history, and assessment 
Study Protocol: ASD Open -Label  Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464647] 5 RtR 1 : Submitted to the IRB  12/14/[ADDRESS_595645] Modified: 12/14/2017  
 7 measures (CBCL, PARS, and CGI- Anxiety). Eligible subjects will be administered a 
detailed assessment battery consisting of diagnostic measures (complete psychiatric 
evaluation including MGH -ASD-SCL), cognitive assessments (WASI-II and DANVA 2), 
measures of psychosocial functioning (SAICA and M-FES), and physical assessment measures (complete physical examination including height, vitals, ECG , urine screens, 
and blood tests).  Screening (week 99) procedures can occur over 2 days (within the 
three week screening window).  
 
Washout Period 
 After the screening period, subjects who are currently taking prohibited 
medications (refer top section on the, “Concomitant Medications/Treatments”) must 
discontinue the use of their medication to be eligible for participation in this study. Medication washout is recommended by [CONTACT_464694], their parent/guardian, and current providers – this is done according to a case-by-case 
assessment, considering the duration on drug, the dose, and the adverse effects 
associated with the treatment and effects of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_267165]/treatment. Our 
office does not take over care for the patient, but remains available during this time period. The washout schedule will be discussed with the participant, their parent/guardian, and current providers. 
 
Treatment Trial Phase: Weeks 0 through 8 
 Participants who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be treated with 
buspi[INVESTIGATOR_163274] a period of 8 weeks. Subjects will be evaluated at weekly intervals during 
titration phase (4 weeks from baseline) and thereafter every [ADDRESS_595646] a visit window of +/- 2 days to 
facilitate scheduling. Each visit will assess drug efficacy ( CGIs  and GAF), tolerability 
(assessing for treatment-emergent adverse-events), and safety (vital signs incl uding 
weight). At baseline, midpoint (week -4), and endpoint, the PARS, MASC, SRS-2, MGH -
SECS- C and -I , BRIEF, CDRS -R, YMRS, CY -BOCS -PDD, and PQ -LES-Q assessment 
measures will be administered. The CBCL will also be administered at weeks 4 and 
8/drop-visit. At endpoint (completion/drop-visit) , participants will be reevaluated on 
cognitive (DANVA 2) and physical assessment measures (complete physical 
examination including vitals, ECG, blood tests, and urine screening). 
 
Study Discontinuation 
 Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they experience significant 
worsening of symptoms, or if the subje ct or their family decides to withdraw. A subject 
may be withdrawn from the study at any time if any of the following conditions are met: 
 
• Worsening of PDD, ADHD , OCD, anxiety, depression, or mania, as reflected by 
[CONTACT_464695] 6 (Much worse) or 7 (Very Much 
Worse) for 2 visits in a row. 
• Subjects who experience intolerable adverse effects, and/or clinically significant laboratory values inconsistent with continuation in the study. 
• Unstable psychiatric condition that clinically requires 1) a change in stable dose of concomitant psychotropic medications or 2) subjects requiring inpatient psychiatric 
admission.  
• Emergent suicidality  
• Active substance abuse

 8 • Pregnancy  
• Allergic drug reaction  
• Non-compliance (less than 70% compliance for 2 visits or longer)  
• Failure to return medication or dosing diary for 2 consecutive visits 
• Failure to keep study appointments for more than 2 consecutive visits without 
justification  
• Clinical judgment of the investigator  
• Withdrawal of consent  
  If study participation is discontinued for safety reasons, participants will  be 
offered three follow-up clinical vi sits, allowing adequate time for appropriate psychiatric 
referrals to treaters in their communities.  
 
 
Study Medication 
 At each visit , measures of safety and effectiveness will be administered. 
Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464664] (dose titration phase). Week -4 onwards , subjects will be maintained on maximum 
achieved dose till the end of the trial (dose maintenance phase). Dose titration phase: Titration of buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464665], holding at lower dose, or lowering the dose based on tolerability and response to buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464666]. Dose will be adjusted upward per titration schedule provided the treatment is well tolerated and the response 
is insufficient (CGI-Improvement>2).  
Dose maintenance phase: During the maintenance phase, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464667]. As a one-time option during the maintenance phase, 
the dose of the study medi cation can  be decreased by a maximum of 10 mg based on

Concomitant Medications / Treatments 
A detailed past and present treatment history (pharmacological / non-pharmacological) will be taken as part of initial evaluation. Following are the concomitant medications/treatments guidelines:  
o Participants on stimulant medication must be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline.  
o Subjects may take melatonin (up to 3mg) or Benadryl (up to 50 mg) at bedtime as needed (prn) for insomnia. 
o Non-pharmacological treatments such as supportive individual, family, or group 
therapy will be permitted provided they were in place for a substantial period of time 
(> 1 month) prior to study participation and remain unchanged during the course of 
the trial.  
o No new non-pharmacological treatments  may be initiated during the course of the 
trial. 
o  Subjects may not take monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) and CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors including: n efazodone, diltiazem, v erapamil, erythromycin, itraconazole, 
rifampin or grapefrui t juice 
8. ASSESSMENTS (see protocol schedule)  
A. Diagnostic Assessments 
Administered at Week [ADDRESS_595649] (MGH -ASD-SCL): The spectrum of ASD symptoms 
will be screened by [CONTACT_464696] -ASD- SCL. This screening 
instrument adopted items from DSM -IV diagnostic criteria for PDD and assesses for 
the individual core domains and associated features of ASD. 
B. Psychosocial Assessment Measures 
Administered at Week 99 
o Social Adjustment Inventory for Children and Adolescents (SAICA) : The SAICA is an 
assessment administered to parents that measures social functioning in children 6 to 
18 years old. Content areas include activities, peer relations, family relations, and academic performance.  
o Moos Family Environment Scale (M -FES): We will use the M- FES as a measure of 
general family conflict. The M -FES assesses the quality of interpersonal relationships 
among family members and consists of 90 true-false items completed by [CONTACT_31588](s). The M -FES has high internal and test- retest reliability and population 
norms. Ten aspects of the family environment are assessed, permitting an evaluation 
of the degree of stress in the family environment and of parental discord. In divorced/separated families, this instrument will be used to evaluate the biological family prior to the divorce, as well as the current family environment. Following procedures previously used by [CONTACT_27156], families will be categorized into "high" and 
"low" conflict family environments, based upon their scores on the conflict, cohesion, 
and expressiveness subscales.  
Administered Weeks 99, 4 and 8/drop-visit  
o Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL): The CBCL  is a parent-report measure that 
assesses maladaptive emotional and behavioral problems in children ages 6-18. Several subcategories are assessed including social withdrawal, somatic complaints, 
Study Protocol: ASD Open -Label  Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464647] 5 RtR 1 : Submitted to the IRB  12/14/[ADDRESS_595650] Modified: 12/14/2017  
 10 anxiety and depression, destructive behavior, social problems, thought problems, 
attention problems, aggressive behavior, and delinquent behaviors. 
Administered Weeks 0, 4, and 8/drop-visit  
o Pediatric Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (PQ -LES-Q) : The 
PQ-LES- Q is a self-report measure that assesses quality of life from the point of view 
of the subject. Subjects are instructed to consider each item and indicate their response scaled 1-5.  
Administered Weeks 0-8 
o DSM -IV Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) : The GAF will assess global 
functioning using a scale from 1 (worst) to 100 (best). This scale will be used at 
baseline to characterize the sample as well as at each visit to assess change. 
 
C. Neuropsychological Battery 
Administered at Week 99 
o Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Scale (WASI-II) Vocabulary and Matrix  
Reasoning subtests : This scale meets the demand for a quick reliable measure of 
intelligence in clinical, educational , and research settings and will provide a Full 
Scale IQ. 
 
Administered at Weeks 99 and 8/drop-visit  
3. Assessment of Social Cognition 
o Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy Scale (DANVA 2): Child Faces and Child 
Paralanguages subtests. This assessment consists of 2 tasks of social competence 
assessing participant ability  for recognizing feelings expressed through faces and 
paralanguag e by [CONTACT_7683]: Both subtests have been standardized and have 
acceptable internal consistency and reliability. This test can be administered for 
testing social competence in children as young as 3 years of age. 
D. Quantitative Scalar Assessments 
Administered Weeks 0-8/drop-visit  
Severity assessment of ADHD, PDD, Psychosis, Mania, Depression, Anxiety, and OCD  
o NIMH Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) : The CGI is a measure of illness 
severity, improvement, and efficacy of treatm ent. The score for severity ranges from 
1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill subjects). Improvement ranges from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). And lastly, the effectiveness index measures to what extent the subject is experiencing therapeutic effects as well as the level of adverse events. The CGI scales will be used for the assessment of PDD, ADHD, OCD, psychosis, mania, depression, and anxiety.  
 
Severity assessment of Anxiety  
Administered at screening (Week 99), baseline (Week 0)  midpoint (We ek 4) , & endpoint 
(Week 8/drop-visit)  
o Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS ): The PARS is a clinician-rated scale, to be 
used with parent and children. It has 2 sections: a symptom checklist and severity items. The symptom checklist is used to determine the child's repertoire of symptoms 
during the past week. The 7 severity items are used to determine severity of symptoms and the PARS total score. The total score for the PARS is derived by [CONTACT_10621] 7 severity items; total score ranges from 0 to 35.

 11 Administered at baseline (Week 0), midpoint (Week 4), and endpoint (W eek 8/drop-vi sit) 
o Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC ): We will ask all parents and 
children (ages 8-19) to complete the MASC, a 39-item scale, distributed into four 
major factors: physical symptoms, social anxiety, harm avoidance, and separation anxiety. It has been shown to distinguish between anxiety and depression, as well as among anxiety disorders [44 ]. 
 
Administered at baseline (Week 0), midpoint (Week 4), and endpoint (W eek 8/drop-visit)  
Severity assessment of Autism Spectrum Disorder – Core Features 
o Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS -2): The SRS -2 is a 65-item 
rating scale completed by [CONTACT_114788]. This scale measures the severity 
of autism spectrum symptoms as they occur in natural social settings.  
o MGH Social -Emotional  Competence Scale [Clinician-Rated Measure] (MGH -SECS -
C): Severity of ASD will be assessed by [CONTACT_464697] -
SECS-C . This is a 37 -item scale that assesses for the severity of core and 
associated symptoms of ASD in a Likert scale from 0 to 8. 
o MGH Social -Emotional  Competence Scale [Informant-Rated Measures] (MGH -
SECS-I): is a 37-item scale that assesses for the severity of core and associated 
symptoms of ASD in a Likert scale from 0 to 6. This scale is to be completed by [CONTACT_464698].  
Severity assessment of Executive Function Deficits 
o Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) : An 86 -item rating scale to 
assess level of executive function deficits.  
Severity assessment of Compulsive/Repetitive Behaviors 
o Children’s Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for PDD (CY -BOCS -
PDD) : CY-BOCS is a clinician -rated 10-item scale (total range from 0 to 40), with 
subtotals for obsessions (items 1-5) and compulsions (items 6-10). The CY -BOCS 
includes a Symptom Checklist of over 60 examples of obsessions and compulsions. CY-BOCS -PDD is modified and validated version of CY -BOCS for use i n children 
with PDD. CY -BOCS -PDD consists of following modifications: 1) the Obsessions 
checklist and severity scales are dropped because of the well -known cognitive and 
communication limitations in this population, 2) the compulsions checklist is retained from the original CY -BOCS and expanded to include repetitive behaviors commonly 
seen in children with PDD, 3) given that parents are the primary informant for 
children with PDD, selective alterations are made on the probes for Compulsion 
severity items. 
Severity assessment of Depression 
o Children’s Depression Rating Scale- Revised (CDRS -R): The CDRS -R is modeled 
after the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for adults, and assesses the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in children ages 6 and older. It includes 
questions relevant to youth, such as questions about school, family, and peer functioning. We will administer this measure to parents and directly to the child. 17 
symptom areas associated with depression are assessed. It has been widely used in 
treatment outcome studies of childhood depression and BPD. 
Severity assessment of Mania symptoms 
o Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) : The YMRS is an 11-item interview which 
queries the core symptoms of mania in the child, including elevated mood, irritabi lity, 
psychomotor agitation, hypersexuality, and aggressive behavior. The YMRS score

has been widely used in phenomenologic and treatment outcome studies of youth 
with BPD.  
E. Safety Assessment Measures  
Administered Week s 0-8/drop-visit  
o Adverse Experiences : We will r ecord any adverse health events experienced during 
the study, along with duration, severity, cause, treatment, and outcome. 
o Vital Signs: Blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
 Completed at screening (Week 99)  and endpoint (Week 8/drop-visit)  
o Physical Examination 
o Blood Tests:  Comprehensive metabolic panel including complete blood count, total 
electrolyte count, liver function test, thyroid function test, and random glucose levels  
o Urine Drug Screen (for subjects ≥ 12 years old)  
o Urine Pregnancy Test (for menstruating female subjects  
o ECG  
9. DATA ANALYSIS  
 Considering our open-label single group design, we will rely on comparisons of 
the participants’ performances at baseline (week 0) prior to the initiation of treatment 
relative to their scores at the last assessment (week 8 ). Thus, statistics for paired 
samples will be utilized. This design largely protects against the bias introduced by 
[CONTACT_35250]. That is, since the same participants are tested on two occasions, all 
static confounding factors are perfectly balanced, and can have no impact on the findings. Bias can still result from time-varying factors that are not associated with the 
outcomes, but we are confident that any such factors will have a minimal impact on this 
study, considering the duration of the trial. Specifically, we will employ Wilcoxon signed rank tests for continuous or discrete outcome measures, and McNemar’s test for binary outcomes. These tests are free from assumptions regarding the distribution of the outcome variables, which is appropriate since the scales we are proposing to utilize are not considered to have Gaussian distributions, and will not be amenable to parametric 
methods. 
 10. SAFETY  
 The principal investigator (PI) will be responsible for the safety of all research 
subjects. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_146605], laboratory tests, and 
vital signs. Consistent with good clinical practice, safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_12072]'s assigned clinician at each study visit. This clinician will be available [ADDRESS_595654] is withdrawn from the study due to adverse events, lack of response, 
or as a decision by [CONTACT_15370], they will be offered open treatment for three months, 
giving adequate time for appropriate psychiatric care to be arranged.

 13 Blood draw : A topi[INVESTIGATOR_464674] (EMLA) will be offered to subjects before blood 
draws . The dose of EMLA cream will not exceed administration guidelines based on 
subject age and weight. Subjects with sensitivity to local topi[INVESTIGATOR_464675].  If an infection does occur, it will be treated. 
Study Medication: Safety will be monitored through treatment-emergent adverse events 
and measuring change in vital signs through laboratory analyses. All adverse events will be recorded. A subject may be dropped from the study or dosage may be decreased and timing of medication changed at any time due to adverse events. All adverse events will be reported to the PHRC according to PHRC guidelines.  
11. CONFIDENTIALITY  
 All research -related records, initiated as  a result of a subject’s participation in this 
study that reveal the subject’s identity, will remain confidential except as may be required by [CONTACT_2371]. While the results of the clinical laboratory blood testing will become part of a subject’s [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18080], they will not link the subject to participation in any research. Subjects will only be contact[CONTACT_464699]. 
 When voice recordings are used, they will be labeled with the subjects’ code name 
[CONTACT_114040], and only the study coordinator and study clinicians will have access to the recordings.  These recordings will be used to monitor the completenes s of study 
evaluations and the similarities and differences between different raters.  These recordings will be saved securely using a password-protected database and maintained for 1 year after completion of the study for the purpose of verifying data and maintaining 
study reliability and will then be deleted after this time. 
12. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Blood Draw : There may be some discomfort during the blood draws. Subjects may 
have a bruise and/or bleeding at the needle site. Occasionally a subject may feel faint 
when blood is drawn. Rarely, an infection may develop. If an infection does occur, it can be treated. EMLA cream will be regularly offered to any subject to numb the site of the draw.  
Study Medication - Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331]: The most common side effects reported with use of 
buspi[INVESTIGATOR_464676]: nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, weakness, numbness, nervousness, lightheadedness, upset stomach, stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], depression, and excitement. Other side effects include: skin rash, itching, fast or irregular heartbeat, blurred vision, and unusual movements of the head or neck muscles. 
All subjects will be closely monitored for serious adverse reactions and drug-drug 
interactions with any ongoing concomitant medications. All serious unexpected adverse 
experiences of a research subject will be reported to PHRC.  
13. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 There may be no direct benefit to subjects participating in this study. Potential 
benefits to the participants incl ude education about ASD, a trial of medication that could

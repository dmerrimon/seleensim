Lutein & Zeaxanthin in Pregnancy (L-ZIP) - Carotenoid Supplementation During Pregnancy: Ocular and Systemic
Effects
6. Study Purposes and Objectives:
The primary objective of this study is to characterize the carotenoid status of mothers during pregnancy, specifically to determine ifprenatal supplementation counteracts maternal systemic and ocular carotenoid depletion. 
The primary outcome measure will be change in carotenoid levels from enrollment to final study visit (birth of child) as measured in
serum, skin and the macula by [CONTACT_5019]-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), resonance Raman spectroscopy, and macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130771], respectively.
7. Is this a multi-site study, where more than one site needs IRB approval?    Yes No
8. Background and Introduction:
The human macula has a high concentration of the dietary carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin which results in a yellow spot centered on
the fovea, the macula lutea.  Carotenoids are abundant in plants, fruits, and vegetables, and they are thought to play important roles in
the physiologic function of the retina and other tissues (Scott et al., 1996; Scarmo et al., 2010; Zimmer et al., 2007; Bernstein et al.,
2016).  Of the hundreds of carotenoids found in nature, 10 to 15 are detectable in human serum, but only lutein, z eaxanthin, and their
metabolites are present in the retina (Bone et al., 1985; Khachik et al., 1997).  The potential antioxidant and photoprotective effects of
carotenoids, especially with regard to age-related macular degener ation (AMD), have been studied extensively in the laboratory and in
clinical studies (Seddon et al., 1994; Bernstein et al., 2002; Eye Disease Case-Control Study Group, 1993), and recent reports have
demonstrated a role of dietary and supplemental carotenoids in slowing or preventing AMD (Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS)Report No. 22, 2007; AREDS2 Report No. 3, 2014). 
Studies also suggest a functional role for the macular carotenoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_130772], at a time when they ma y enhance contrast
sensitivity, decrease glare disability, and even increase visual acuity (Kvansakul et al., 2006; Stringham et al., 2008; Olmedilla et al.,
2003).  The physiological accumulation of the macular carotenoid pi[INVESTIGATOR_130773] (Malone, 1975; Dimenstein et al.,
1996).  Investigators have recently shown that the macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130774], correlates with infant and
maternal serum zeaxanthin levels, and progressively increases through the first seven years of life (Bernstein et al, 2013).  This
suggests that the macular carotenoids play physiological and protective roles throughout the lifecycle and may be particularly important
during infant visual development. 
Prenatal vitamin and micronutrient supplementation is standard-of -care for pregnant women worldwide; however, with the exception of
a few ingredients, most prenatal supplementation guidelines are not y et supported by [CONTACT_130804].  Recently,
prenatal supplements with added lutein and zeaxanthin have entered the American market with the stated intentions of enhancing infant
visual and neural development and maintaining maternal health.  Although clinical trials were never performed to support these
contentions, it is physiologically plausible from the neonate’s perspective because these dietary carotenoids are selectively concentrated
in human ocular and neural tissue in utero , especially during the third trimester of pregnancy.
From the mother’s perspective, the last trimester of pregnancy is a time when she must transfer some of her carotenoid stores to thedevelopi[INVESTIGATOR_130775], potentially putting her at risk for depletion systemically and in her ocular tissues.  On review of the
published literature, there are conflicting data regarding systemic maternal carotenoid status throughout pregnancy, and absolutely
nothing is known about maternal macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130776].  Some, but not all, studies report lower serum
carotenoid levels in pregnant women. Bernstein and others (Henriksen et al., 2013; Kiely et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2001) have reported
that mothers who did not take lutein or zeaxanthin supplements during pregnancy had >50% reductions of serum lutein and zeaxanthin
concentrations and ~20% lower total skin carotenoids at the time of delivery when compared to our clinic’s average of unsupplementednon-pregnant adults. 
Prospective, controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the benefits of carotenoid supplementation during pregnancy have never been
conducted.  To obtain data relative to the feasibility of such trials, this study will be a comprehensive, prospective assessment of
prenatal lutein + zeaxanthin supplementation on maternal and infant ocular and systemic biomarkers of carotenoid status throughout
pregnancy.

while participants are taking the study supplements will be performed in conjunction with routine prenatal visits to their Obstetrician, at
approximately 22-26 weeks gestational age and again at 37-39 weeks gestational age.  All mothers will undergo a final assessment
within two weeks of giving birth.
Infants’ evaluations will be performed in the first two weeks of life, either during the original hospi[INVESTIGATOR_130781] a follow up outpatient
clinic visit.

Mothers may be seen for Unscheduled Visits if deemed necessary for repeat measurements or follow-up of Adverse Events.  If a mother
delivers her baby [CONTACT_130807], she and her infant will remain in the study and will be asked to complete the final study visit.
Description of Study Assessments:
Visual Function - Manifest refraction, and measurement of best-corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity of the mothers will be
obtained by [CONTACT_130808].  The study staff performing visual acuity will be masked to the
treatment assignment. Best-corrected visual acuity testing will be assessed on ETDRS back-lit charts starting at a distance of [ADDRESS_147843] of the following:
External examination of the eye and adnexa.
Routine screening for eyelids/pupil responsiveness (including ptosis, abnormal pupil shape, unequal pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], abnormal reaction to
light and afferent pupi[INVESTIGATOR_130783]).
Slit-lamp examination [cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens, aqueous reaction (cells and flare).
Dilated fundus exam of the study eye including evaluation of retina and vitreous (i.e. posterior segment abnormalities, retinal
hemorrhage/detachment, and vitreal hemorrhage density and vitreous cells).
IOP measurement - A measurement of intraocular pressure will be conducted using a Tono-pen tonometer. This should be
performed prior to dilating the eyes and the same method should be used for all measurements in the same subject throughout
the study.
Skin Carotenoid Levels - A high-sensitivity scanner (Raman device) suitable for measurements of infants and adults will be used for
this study.  The measurements are taken by [CONTACT_1299] a probe on the subject’s palm of the hand (adults) or sole of the foot (infants) with a
special light source that does not generate heat and is harmless to one’s vision as long as it is not viewed directly for a long time (similar
in risk to a laser pointer).  The measurements require [ADDRESS_147844] and another 30 seconds to obtain the reading.  The
measurement is repeated 3 times to confirm the accuracy, so a total of 3 minutes of assessment is needed.  
Infant Macular Pi[INVESTIGATOR_130784]  - Infant macular measurements will be performed using blue light reflectometry .  The
infant’s pupi[INVESTIGATOR_130785] (standard-of-care for dilated eye examinations of newborns), and then the swaddled
baby’s eyes will be opened with a pediatric lid speculum.  Posterior pole 80-degree images centered on the fovea will be taken with a
retinal camera by a certified ophthalmic photographer under the supervision of a Pediatric Ophthalmologist using its optional blue light
source and deliberately omitting the fluorescein angiography barrier filter in the collection light path.  Color images will also be taken to
facilitate identification of key retinal landmarks.  Total image acquisition time is just a few minutes.
Infant Foveal Anatomy  - The sdOCT (Bioptigen) is an FDA-approved handheld portable unit that is used to image the foveal anatomy
of premature and full-term infants. Swaddled infants will have their eyelids gently opened by [CONTACT_130809] a
Pediatric Ophthalmologist.  Vertical and horizontal scans will then be acquired.  The OCT images will be obtained prior to the contact
[CONTACT_130810].
Maternal Macular Pi[INVESTIGATOR_130786]  - Mothers’ macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130787].  The subject looks at a fixation target
with her dilated study eye for about 30 seconds as her macula is scanned sequentially with alternating 486 nm (blue) and 518 nm
(green) lasers, and autofluorescence images are collected.  Macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130788] [ADDRESS_147845] blood will be analyz ed for serum carotenoid
content using well-established laboratory protocols that can provide baseline separations of all common dietary carotenoids.  Whenever
possible blood samples will be obtained by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_130789] a routine clinical blood collection.
Dietary Questionnaires - At each study visit mothers will be asked to complete the LZQ quantitative food frequency questionnaire 
that captures ~90% of the lutein/zeaxanthin foods consumed in the US,  based on National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
data.
Safety Evaluations - Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study/ early withdrawal will be followed by [CONTACT_130811] a clinically stable endpoint is reached. The study includes procedures to monitor safety, including
complete Ophthalmic exams and monitoring of adverse events.  
Optional Specimen Collection and Banking Sub-Study
Participants will be asked to allow a sample of placenta tissue to be collected and stored for future research related to maternal to infant
carotenoid transport on a tissue level.
Participants will be asked to provide a saliva sample to be stored and used for future research related to the genetics of carotenoid
metabolism enzymes.
Participants will be asked to allow a portion of their blood collected at study visits to be stored for future research related to the genetics
of carotenoid metabolism.Participation in these procedures is optional and participants may decline any or all of them and still participate in the main study. 
Participant identifiers will be stored separately from the banked samples and participants will be able to withdraw their samples if they so
desire.
Banked samples may be shared with other researchers, who must have IRB approval for their use and material/data transferagreements with the University of Utah as applicable.

Statistical Analysis
The study outcome data will be analyzed by a consultant from the University of Utah Study Design and Biostatistics Center of the Center
for Clinical and Translational Science.
Image analysis of retinal camera macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130790]. Bernstein's laboratory. Foveal anatomy parameters
such as width, depth, and layer structure will be assessed by [CONTACT_6283]. Hartnett and Bernstein using methods based on previously published
protocols. 
Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations
Statistical power and sample size (N ) for one of the primary outcome measures, maternal skin carotenoids at birth, w as determined
using data from the previous study by [CONTACT_130812]. (2013) in which the average maternal skin carotenoids ± SD at birth was [ZIP_CODE]
± 8300. This value is 20% lower than the University of Utah Moran Eye Center clinic average value of ~42,500 Raman counts reported
for the ancillary AREDS2 study (Bernstein et al., 2012).  With power of 0.[ADDRESS_147846] and prevent a 20% decline during pregnancy.  In order to accommodate subsequent ineligibility due to
premature birth, low birth weight, or other problems (~10%) and to plan for expected noncompliance and loss to follow up (~20%), we
intend to enroll 30 subjects in the Carotenoid Supplementation Group and another 30 in the Control Group . 
The other outcome measures (maternal ocular carotenoid depletion during pregnancy , infant carotenoid status at birth, and the
exploratory outcome measures of foveal maturity at birth and visual function changes during pregnancy) are not as well characterized,
but we estimate that a similar sample size of [ADDRESS_147847] set.  Paired t-tests
will compare the carotenoid status at enrollment and at the final study visit of the mothers receiving carotenoid supplementation to
mothers not receiving carotenoid supplementation.  We will also compare carotenoid status of infants whose mothers received
carotenoid supplementation to infants of mothers without carotenoid supplementation. Significance will be set at 2-tailed P<0.05.  The
associations between maternal and infant carotenoid status will be assessed with regression analysis.  
Subgroup analyses will be performed to assess the influences of maternal dietary carotenoid intak e, compliance with study supplement
use, co-existing medical conditions, BMI, infant gender, and other factors on our study results, with proper attention to the effects of
multiple tests on the ability to draw conclusions.
The complete statistical analysis plan will be finalized prior to database lock, and will provide statistical methods as well as descriptions
of how missing, unused and spurious data will be addressed.  Summarization of study data will be prepared of subject demographics,
baseline characteristics, and investigational product exposure.
Safety AnalysesSerious and unexpected adverse events will be collected from the time of the first study supplement administr ation until a subject
completes the study or discontinues prematurely. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as those AEs that develop or
worsen after the first dose of study supplement and up to [ADDRESS_147848] dose of study medication. The current version of
MedDRA will be used to classify all AEs.
Treatment- emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_39960], in accordance with the MedDRA
coding dictionary. The number of subjects reporting each AE preferred term will be tabulated for all TEAEs and separately for those
considered as related to study treatment by [CONTACT_079]. The number of subjects reporting SAEs will also be tabulated.
Adverse event summaries will be presented for each treatment group separately.
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_130813], and separate tabulations also will be produced for related adverse events
(those considered by [CONTACT_130814]), serious adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events.
Findings from ophthalmologic examinations will be tabulated for changes o ver time on study. Separate summaries will be prepared for
systemic (non-ocular) and ocular AEs, with events in the study eye and non-study eye summarized separately.

Kelliann Ordonez University of Utah
Emily Powers University of Utah
Kelly Vorwaller University of Utah
List by [CONTACT_2300], role, and affiliation any others who will obtain consent (e.g. Dr . John Smith, Co-Investigator, etc.).
2. Describe the location(s) where consent will be obtained.
Consent will be obtained in private research offices or clinic rooms
3. Describe the consent process(es), including the timing of consent. Describe whether there is a waiting period
between the consent process and obtaining consent from the participant (i.e., any time between informing
participants and actually obtaining consent).
If a patient appears to meet the criteria for the trial, she will be told about the study and asked for written informed
consent to participate in the trial.
If they wish to consider whether or not they want to participate in the study , they may have time to think about the study
and provide consent as long as there is enough time between approach and the gestational age required for eligibility .
4. Describe what measures will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence.
Research staff that conduct this consent process have been participating in research for several years. They are
experienced with obstetric study populations and will spend the time required to answer any questions or concerns. If
there appear to be concerns, the woman will be encouraged to take time to think about the study .
No additional benefits other than those described in the consent document will be discussed.
5. Describe the provisions that are made to allow adequate time to exchange information and questions between
the investigator and participant.
The research staff are experienced in interviewing and working with the obstetric population. They will be certain to take
the time needed to ensure that the person understands the study and is consenting willingly . If the woman continues to
have questions, she will also be offered the opportunity to discuss the study in further detail with the PI. She will also be
given the opportunity to return at a later time if she needs more to make a decision.
6. Will a legally authorized representative (LAR) be used?  Yes No
7. Will a language other than English be used to obtain consent?
  Yes No
a. Please indicate which form will be used:
A translated short form with an English long form.
Please provide justification for why a full, translated consent document will not be used:
After the first patient is consented with the short forms, we will get the full consent form translated into the
patient’s native language and provide a translation certificate. The consent will then be submitted to the IRB via
an amendment application and the first patient will be re-consented with the fully translated ICF . Any future
patients would be enrolled with a fully translated ICF as long as it is maintained, or a short form again will be
used, and an immediate translation will take place. An interpreter will explain the clinical trial and communicate
with the patient about their potential participation. Professional translation services will be provided. It will be
documented that the patient demonstrated an understanding of the study . The interpreter will sign and date the
consent.
b. Describe whether translation services will be used for the consent process and how the consent process
will be conducted?
In the event that a participant does not speak English, the oral presentation will be translated with the use of an
interpreter. The written summary of the oral presentation will be the IRB approved long consent document.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based, professional translation services will be provided to all non-English speaking study participants.
Consent will be documented using a short form. A third-party witness/interpreter will be present during the oral
presentation and will sign both the long form and the short form, the interpreter can act as the witness. They will
be fluent in both English and the patient’s native language. The person obtaining consent will sign the long form.
The participant will sign the short form. The participant will receive a copy of the consent form in English and the
short form.
8. Are you requesting that documentation of informed consent be waived by [CONTACT_1201] (a consent process in place,

Effects 
 
6. Risks and Bene ﬁ ts
1.Describe the reasonable foreseeable risks or discomforts to the participants:
Risks of Carotenoid and Control Supplements – Both kinds of supplements are within the standard of care expectant mothers would
receive if they were not in the study.  They pose no additional risk to participants.
Risks of Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity – These are routine vision tests and pose no risk to participants abo ve standard medical
care.
Risks of Ophthalmic imaging – Light levels projected on the retina during the photographs and macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130791].  Participants may notice a central dark spot in their vision similar to the afterimage generated by a camera
flash.  This will fade in about 5 minutes.  Infants may experience discomfort during the macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130792]. 
Parents may feel emotional distress when observing the infant undergoing this safe examination.
Risks of Carotenoid skin measurements – There are no expected risks from the light exposure from the skin measurement.  It is
important not to look directly at the laser for a long period of time.
Risks of Blood draws – Whenever possible the blood samples for this study will be taken at the same time participants are having blooddrawn for routine prenatal blood work.  The blood sample from the infants umbilical cord will be taken at the same time blood is collected for
his/her routine care.
Risks of Eye exams – The dilation drops used for the exams are considered standard of care for dilated ey e exams during pregnancy.
Risks of Nutrition surveys and supplement logs – recording diet and supplement intake will take a few minutes of participants time, but
poses no risk.
Risks of genetic research and sample banking  - There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality, but procedures are in place to make
this highly unlikely.Unforeseeable Risks - In addition to the risks listed above, participants may experience a previously unknown risk of side effect.
2.Describe the potential benefits to society AND to participants (do not include compensation):
Participants may not directly benefit from participating in this study. Participants may receive nutritional benefits from taking the
supplements.  We hope the information we learn from this study will help us provide better care for pregnant mothers and their infants in the
future.
3.Are there any costs to the participants from participation in research?
  Yes No
  If yes, specify:
4.Is there any compensation to the participants?

a. The medical device is NOT intended as an implant that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or
welfare of a subject.
b. The medical device is NOT purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life that
presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.
c. The medical device is NOT for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health that presents a potential for serious risk to the
health, safety, or welfare of a subject.
d. The medical device is does NOT otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a
subject.
2. The medical device is not banned.
1.Provide justification of why the investigational medical device used in this study meets the
definition of a NSR device. 
In this study, we are using the Heidelberg MultiColor Spectralis instrument to measure and image macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130799] (MPOD). This commercial device is FDA cleared for use in eye clinics throughout the [LOCATION_002] to image the
retina in various ways. Heidelberg has provided us with a beta version of a software package which analyzes
autofluorescence images to measure MPOD. Since this software has not yet been submitted to the FDA  for approval, we
can use it only under an IRB approved protocol. This software analyzes collected images in a new way, but the actual
collection of the images is done in the usual manner for the instrument, so there are no significant risks of harm to the
subjects.
The resonance Raman skin scanner measures carotenoids in the skin by [CONTACT_130828] a blue light on the palm of the hand for
about 30 seconds. It is a higher sensitivity research version of the commercially available BioPhotonic scanner made by
[CONTACT_130829]/Pharmanex. The laser power is less than many laser pointers and is completely safe for prolonged skin exposure,
so it poses no significant risk to the subjects.

Supplementation During Pregnancy: Ocular and Systemic
Effects 
Genetic Research
1. Describe the risks to participants in regard to genetic testing, including applicable risks to privacy and
confidentiality, as well as psychological and social risks.
Risks of Carotenoid and Control Supplements – Both kinds of supplements are within the standard of care expectant mothers would receive if they were not in the study.  They pose no additional risk to participants.
Risks of Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity – These are routine vision tests and pose no risk to participants abo ve standard
medical care.
Risks of Ophthalmic imaging – Light levels projected on the retina during the photographs and macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130800].  Participants may notice a central dark spot in their vision similar to the afterimage generated by a
camera flash.  This will fade in about 5 minutes.  Infants may experience discomfort during the macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_130801].  Parents may feel emotional distress when observing the infant undergoing this safe examination.
Risks of Carotenoid skin measurements – There are no expected risks from the light exposure from the skin measurement.  It is
important not to look directly at the laser for a long period of time.
Risks of Blood draws – Whenever possible the blood samples for this study will be taken at the same time participants are having
blood drawn for routine prenatal blood work.  The blood sample from the infants umbilical cord will be taken at the same time blood is
collected for his/her routine care.
Risks of Eye exams – The dilation drops used for the exams are considered standard of care for dilated ey e exams during pregnancy.
Risks of Nutrition surveys and supplement logs – recording diet and supplement intake will take a few minutes of participants time,
but poses no risk.
Risks of genetic research and sample banking  - There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality, but procedures are in place to
make this highly unlikely.Unforeseeable Risks - In addition to the risks listed above, participants may experience a previously unknown risk of side effect.
2. Describe the privacy protections in place for participants in regard to genetic testing. This includes how
family member privacy will be protected.
In order to maintain subject privacy, study personnel will not discuss genetic testing with the participant unless they
are in a private area.
3. Are you performing whole genome or whole exome sequencing?
  Yes No
4. Describe the confidentiality protections in place for participants’  genetic information. Discuss if and how
data will be shared and protected outside the local study team.
Genetic testing results will not be shared with participants or included in their medical record.
5. Will incidental findings relevant to individuals or families be communicated to the participants?
  Yes No
If yes, answer the questions below:
a. Describe the process for determining which incidental findings will be returned to the participants.
Describe the information and expert consultation that will be used to make this determination.
b. Indicate the process that will be used to return information about incidental finding to participants:

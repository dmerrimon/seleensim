Administration of S tudy T reatment  is outlined below. 
Study Design This is a double- blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 1/ 2 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy,  and PK of FPA144 + 
mFOLFOX6  versus placebo + mFOLFOX6 . 
This study incl udes a Phase 1 safety run -in portion and a Phase 2 portion.  
Patients may enroll in  either Phase 1 or Phase 2, but may not enroll in 
both phases of the study. The Phase 1 safety run -in is an open-label dose-escalation of FPA144 + 
mFOLFOX6  in patients with GI tumors (not FGFR2 -selected).  
The Phase 2 part of this study was initially  designed as a Phase 3 study in 
the front- line setting evaluating bemarituzumab (FPA144) with SOC 
chemotherapy.  The study initiated f ollowing promising monotherapy 
activity of bemarituzumab in the Phase 1 study conducted in late -line 
gastric cancer. The Phase 3 statistical design assumed the incidence of 
FGFR 2b positivity in front- line gastric cancer to be ~10%.   However, 
over the conduct of the study, the true incidence has been 30%. Additionally [ADDRESS_519730] been identified by [CONTACT_412288], leading to 
a question of adequate study power. The study design has been modified in consideratio n of these factors.
 
The Phase 2 portion of the study (to follow the Phase 1 safety run- in) is 
a global, randomized, double- blind, controlled, study to evaluate the 
efficacy of FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 versus placebo + mFOLFOX6 in 
patients with FGFR2 -selected GC (as determined by [CONTACT_412289]2b overexpression and/or a ctDNA blood assay 
demonstrating FGFR2  gene ampl ification).  
FGFR2 Expression Requirements  (Pre-Screening) : 
• R equired provision of tissue and blood sample for FGFR2 positive 
status by 1 of these testing methods for enrollment in Phase 2:  
Provision of archival (or fresh biopsy if archival tissue is not available) for pre-screening  FGFR2b overexpression testing by [CONTACT_61847] r equired; 
provision of a blood sample is also required for pre -screening  by 
[CONTACT_412290]2 amplification.  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 8 of 139 Confidential  • Results of the centralized FGFR2 testing may take approximately 2 
weeks; patients are permitted t o receive up to 1 dose of mFOLFOX6 
during this inter im time period (p re-screening ) at the discretion of the 
investigator .  This  1 dose of chemotherapy is not a requirement of the 
study and is not considered part of this clinical study. 
Screening Period : 
Pre-sc reening allows for collection of blood and tissue to determine 
FGFR2 positivity using ctDNA and IHC assays.  Once a patient is 
confirmed to have a positive result based on central testing, the screening period initiates, allowing for ev aluation of all other eligibility crite ria.   
All study assessments are outlined in the Schedules of Assessments in  
Protocol Appendix 2 and Appendix 3. 
Phase 1 Safety Run-in Dose Escalation Design  
The Phase 1 ; after a maximum 28 -day screening period , eligible patients 
will initiate study treatment.  
In Phase 1 , dose cohorts are planned at proposed doses beginning at an 
FPA144 dose level of 6 mg/kg per dose, and enrollment w ill depend on 
safety and tolerability.  Phase [ADDRESS_519731] 3+3 dose 
escalation design  (Cohort 1), and rolling- 6 design ( Cohort 2, 1a, and 1b),  
until the RD of FPA144 to be administered in combination with mFOLFOX6 in Phase 2 is determined.  A minimum of 2  dosing cohorts 
of FPA144 combined with mFOLFOX6  will be included in Phase 1.  
Proposed FPA144 Dose L evels  
The proposed FPA144 dose levels for dose escalation are as follows:  
• Cohort 1: 6 mg/kg FPA144 once every 2 weeks (Q2W)  
• Cohort 2: 15 mg/kg FPA144 Q2W with  1 dose of FPA144 7.5 mg/kg 
on Day 8 (Cycle  1 only) 
• Cohort 1a (if needed, eg, if the Cohort 2 dose level or schedule is not 
tolerated): 15 mg/kg FPA144 Q2W  
• Cohort 1b (if needed , eg, if  Cohort 2 and 1a dose level s or schedules are  
not toler ated):  Dose level lower than Cohort 1a, but higher than 
Cohort [ADDRESS_519732] 
day (Cycle 1 Day 1 [C1D1]) of treatment with FPA144  and mFOLFOX6 , 
for safety assessments, PK , and occurrence of DLTs.  If the first dose 
cohort (6 mg/kg) clears the 28-day DLT period, the second dose cohort (15 mg/kg Q2W with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day 8 [Cycle 1 only]) will be tested in a rolling -6 design and will enroll 6  patients  to explore the 
safety and efficacy at this dose level. Subsequent cohorts will also be 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 9 of 139 Confidential  enrolled as a rolling 6 design and will only be enrolled if C ohort 2 is 
deemed intolerable.  
Dose -Limiting Toxicity De finitions  
DLTs during Phase 1 are defined as any of the following events 
considered by [CONTACT_7185]: 
• Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC) < 0.5 × 109/L > 5 days’ duration or 
febrile neutropenia (ie, ANC < 1.0 × 109/L with a single temperature of 
> 38.3°C, or fever ≥ 38°C for more than 1 hour).  Use of granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G- CSF) is permitted in accordance with 
institutional standards  
• Platelets <  25 × 109/L  
• Platelets <  50 × 109/L with bleeding requiring medical intervention  
• Platelets < 50 × 109/L (> 3 days) 
• Grade 4 anemia (ie, life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated) 
• Any Grade 2-3 ophthalmologic AE that does not resolve within 7 days 
• Any Grade 4 ophthalmologic AE  
• Any Grade 4 laboratory value 
• Any Grade 3 laboratory values that a re not of clinical significance 
according to investigator and Sponsor agreement if they do not resolve 
within 72 hours 
• Aspartate aminotransferase/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT) 
≥ 3× upper limit of normal ( ULN) and concurrent total bilirubin 
≥ 2× ULN not related to liver involvement with cancer  
• Any non- hemato logical AE Grade 3 or greater (except nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea) 
• Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that does not resolve with supportive care in 72 hours  
• Grade 4 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 10 of 139 Confidential   Algorithm for Dose Escalation Decisions  
The following algorithm will be used for dose escalation decisions in 
Phase 1:  
Number of 
Patients with DLTs  Dose Escalation Decision  
0/3 O pen next cohort  
1/3 Enroll  3 more patients in same cohort  
≥ 2/3 Stop enrollment. If Cohort 1, then the study will be stopped.  
1/6 Open next cohort  
≥ 2 /[ADDRESS_519733] ed (held or reduced) based on the toxicity experienced according to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
Determination of a Recommended Dose for Phase [ADDRESS_519734] of FPA144 for Phase 2 will be identified by [CONTACT_412291] ( CRC) based on an evaluation of all available safety, 
tolerabi lity, and PK data and will not exceed 15 mg/kg administered IV 
Q2W with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day [ADDRESS_519735] of FPA144 will be a dose that is not anticipated to lead to a decrease in the dose inten sity of mFOLFOX6 to be 
administered.   Cohort 1a will not be opened for enrollment unless the 
Cohort 2 dose level i s not tolerated.  Identifying a maximum tolerated 
dose ( MTD ), therefore is not a requirement of this study and the 
recommended dose ( RD) may be lower than the MTD . 
The MTD is def ined as the maximum dose at which < 33% of patients 
experience a DLT during the DLT period.  If a DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients in Cohort 1, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level.  Dose escalation may continue until 2 of 3 to 6 patients treated 
at a dose level experience a DLT.  The next lower dose will then be 
considered the MTD.   
No additional doses of FPA144 or more than 2 doses of mFOLFOX6 should be administered during the 28-day DLT period.  The doses of FPA144 and mFOLFOX 6 on Day 1 of Cycle 2 do not need to be 
synchronized.  For example, if mFOLFOX6 is delayed due to an AE that is deemed related only to mFOLFOX6 and not to FPA144, FPA144 should be administered as scheduled for Cycles 1 and 2 regardless of delays in the mFOLFOX6 dosing schedule.

with an additional dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Cycle [ADDRESS_519736] dose level 
evaluated and tolerated in Phase 1.  Opening the Phase 2 portion of the 
study for enrollment will be at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
The Phase 2 screening period will be up to 28 days; after a maximum 
28-day screening period, eligible patients will initiate randomized study 
treatment.   
Phase 2 will include 2 treatment arms: 
• Arm 1: FPA144 combined with mFOLFOX6 , administered Q2W  
• Arm 2: Placebo combined with mFOLFOX6 , administered Q2W  
In Phase 2, patients must initiate  first administration of study treatment 
within 3 days of enrollment . 
Dosi ng Administration of Study Treatment  
Phase 1  (O pen Label, FPA144 + mFOLFOX6) 
FPA144 administration  i s outlined in Section  5.1.2 of the protocol; 
guidance for dose modification is provided in Section  5.1.3.  
FPA144 will be administered over approximately 30 minutes 
(± 10 minutes) Q2W (± 3 days) on Day 1 of each 2- week cycle. FPA144  
will be administered prior to mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy. Patients treated 
in Cohort 2 (only) will receive 1 additional dose of FPA144 on Day 8 of 
Cycle 1 (mFOLFOX6 will not be administered on this day).  
mFOLFOX6 administration  is outlined in Section  5.2 of the protocol; 
guidance for dose modification i s provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].   
mFOLFOX6 will be administered Q2W beginning on C1D1 and will be 
administered at least 30 minutes after the end of the infusion of FPA144.  
Leucovorin (or levo -leucovorin), 5- FU, and oxaliplatin will be 
administered  in accordance with the relevant local guidelines and 
summary of product characteristics ( SmPCs ).  For further details, refer to  
the manufacturer’s prescribing information for the respective 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_412252].  
Instructions for mFOLFOX6 administration include the following: 
On Day 1 of each cycle ( at least 30 minutes after FPA144/placebo ): 
• Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV infusion over 120 minutes 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 12 of 139 Confidential  • Leucovorin 400  mg/m2 IV infusion over 120 minutes, can be 
administered concurrently with oxaliplatin if us ing a Y  connector, 
(if not using a Y connector, administer drugs sequentially) 
• If leucovorin is unavailable, 200 mg/m2 levo- leucovorin may be 
used.  Study treatment may be administered without either agent 
in the event that both are unavailable .  Leucovorin (or levo-
leucovorin) may be given at either the protocol-recommended doses o r as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_412292] 
• Immediately after oxaliplatin and le ucovorin, 5 FU 400 mg/m
2 bolus 
over approximately 5 minutes 
• Immediately after the 5 -FU bolus, 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 as a continuous IV 
infusion over approximately [ADDRESS_519737] of care.  
Phase 2 ( Double -Blind, Randomized, Controlled) 
Patients in Phase 2 will be randomized  to receive FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 
(Arm 1) or placebo + mFOLFOX6 (Arm 2).  FPA144 will be prepared 
and administered as in Phase 1, and the dosing and schedule of FPA144 
will be 15 mg/kg Q2W with an additional dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Cycle 1 
Day 8 ( determined in Phase  1).  
mFOLFOX6 will be administered as described for Phase 1: Q2W 
beginning at least 30 minutes after the end of the infusion of FPA144 /placebo .  For further details, refer to  the manufacturer’s 
prescribing information for the respective chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_412253].  
Dose Modification, Duration, and Dis continuation  
Dose Delays and Modifications 
I
n the event a cycle of mFOLFOX6 is delayed due to chemotherapy-
related toxicity during the first 3 cycles of treatment (42  days), FPA144 / 
placebo should be administered on schedule (± 3 days).  After the first 
3 cycles, FPA144/placebo may be delayed up to 7 days to be 
synchronized with administered mFOLFOX6.  
Duration of Dosing 
There is no protocol- mandated maximum number of doses for 
FPA144 /placebo  or mFOLFOX6.  
In Phase 1, upon completion of the DLT perio d (starting with Cycle 3), 
patients may continue receiving FPA144 in combination with 
mFOLFOX6.   Ongoing administration of the mFOLFOX6 regimen 
beyond the DLT period will be according to the schedule noted in Section  5.1.2 with any modifications as noted in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 13 of 139 Confidential  In both study phases, FPA144 or placebo dosing will continue Q2W until 
investigator-assessed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until 
the patient meets any of the other protocol- specified withdrawal criteria 
(refer to Section  4.5).  
Discontinuation   
Patients who discontinue all study treatment (all components of FPA144  
+ mFOLFOX6  and placebo + mFOLFOX6) for any reason other than 
consent withdrawal will undergo an EOT safety fol low-up visit 
approximately [ADDRESS_519738] ered 
component of treatment (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 5-FU, or FPA144).  In addition, patients in Phase 2 will continue to undergo tumor 
assessments according to the protocol schedu le until investigator- assessed  
disease progression or the initiation of additional anticancer therapy, at 
which point they will  enter a long term follow up (LTFU) period to assess 
survival. 
Discontinuation of any component of the study treatment (mFOLFOX6, 
a component of mFOLFOX6, or FPA144/placebo ) for any reason other 
than disease progression or any of the other protocol- specified withdrawal 
criteria does not mandate discontinuation of other components.  The 
exception is the permanent discontinuation of 5-FU for any reason, which requires discontinuation of oxaliplatin and leucovorin. 
Study Duration  The duration of study for an individual patient includes Screening (up to  28 days), treatment and an EOT visit approximately [ADDRESS_519739] dose.  Sin ce all patients are eligible to be treated until disease 
progression, the actual treatment duration for each individual patient will vary depending on the time to progression.  
In addition, patients enrolled in Phase 2 will be followed for subsequent 
anticancer therapy and survival. LTFU  for survival will be performed 
approximately every 3 months (± 1 month) after the EOT visit until up to [ADDRESS_519740] patient is enrolled in the study, or until death, loss 
to follow up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by [CONTACT_1034] (whichever occurs first).  
Number of Patients  The total number of patients planned for enrollment  in this study is 
approximately 167.  
• Phase 1  will enroll approximately 9 to 21 patients depending on 
incidence of DLTs; this allows for evaluation of safety, PK, and 
pharmacodynamics at 1 or more dose levels . 
• Phase 2 will enroll approximately 155 patients with FGFR2b 
overexpression and/or FGFR2 gene amplificati on. Patients will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_519741] received 2 doses of 
FPA144 ( except for Cohort 2 [must have received 3 doses of FPA144]) 
and 2 doses of mFOLFOX 6 (regardless of cohort ).  All patients deemed 
unevaluable must  be replaced, unless the reason they didn’t receive the 
required minimum amount of therapy was due to an FPA144- related 
DLT.  The replaced patien t may continue on study at the i nvestigator’s 
discretion and after discussion with the Sponsor. 
Phase 2 Patients are not replaced.  All enrolled patients are deemed evaluable for 
the endpoint of survival.

time points outlined in Appendix 6 for Phase 1 .  Blood samples will be 
collected to measure levels of FPA144 at the time points outlined in Appendix 7 for Phase 2.  PK parameters will be estimated using 
non-compartmental analysis, though compartment al analysis may be 
employed if appropriate. Serum concentration -time data f rom 
FPA144 -004 will be pooled with data from other studies for integrated 
population PK analysis and exposure- response relationship assessment . 
Immunogenicity  
Assessments: For all en rolled patients in Phase [ADDRESS_519751] of screening, confirmation, 
and determination of the antidrug antibody ( ADA) concentration.  
Additional characterization of a confirmed anti -FPA144 antibody 
response will be conducted.  
Efficacy Assessment s: During Phase 2, tumor resp onse asses sment will be performed by [CONTACT_76955] v1.[ADDRESS_519752] v1.1 guidelines.  Alternatively, MRI  is also acceptable at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Scans will be done during the screening

FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 19 of 139 Confidential  Safety 
Assessments:  Safety measures will include AEs, hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, vital signs, body weight, concomitant medications/procedures, ECOG performance status, targeted physical examinations, ECGs, and 
ophthalmology examinations in both Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Safety measures will also include evaluation for DLTs in Phase 1 only. 
In Phase 2, an independent Data Monit oring Committee (DMC) will 
evaluate safety  including AE s and serious adverse events ( SAEs) on a 
regular basis throughout the treatment phase. 
Pharmaco -
dynamic Assessments:  Phase [ADDRESS_519753] dose of study treatment and analysed retrospectively for 
FGFR2  gene amplification using a ctDNA blood assay.  
 
 will be collected longitudinally according to  
Appendix 5. 
No pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed during Phase 2. 
Statistical 
Procedures:  Power and Sample Size 
This Phase [ADDRESS_519754] ratio (HR) of PFS for 
FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 compared with placebo + mFOLFOX6. It is planned to observe 84 PFS events in order to achieve 71% power to detect an HR of 0.67 for PFS, at the 1-sided alpha of 0.1. Assuming an exponential distribution, this corresponds approximately to an 50% increase in median PFS (e.g. from 5 months to 7.5 months).  Statistical significance (at 1 -sided alpha of 0.1) for PFS will occur with an observed 
HR=0.756, corresponding approximately to a 32.3% increase in observed median PFS (e.g. from 5 months to 6.6 months). 
One hundred fifty- five patients have been randomized (1:1) during 
[ADDRESS_519755] deviation, median, range, and inter-quartile range for continuous variables, and the number and percent for categorical variables; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented 
where a ppropriate.  Additionally, incidence of treatment -emergent  adverse 

FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 20 of 139 Confidential  events (TEAEs) leading to dosing reductions or dose discontinuation will 
be tab ulated and summarized . 
In Phase 2, efficacy and tolerability will be evaluated  and presented by 
[CONTACT_2939] (Arm 1, FPA144 + mFOLFOX6; Arm 2, placebo + 
mFOLFOX6) . 
Eligible patients will be stratified by:  
• Geographic region  
• Prior treatment status (de novo versus adjuvant/neo -adjuvant)  
• Administration of a single dose of mFOLFOX6 prior to enrollment 
(yes or no) 
In Phase 2, the primary efficacy analysis is the comparison of PFS 
between the treatment arms .  The primary endpoint, PFS, is defined as 
time from randomization  until the date of radiological disease progression 
based on investigator assessment (using Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors version 1.1 [RECIST v1.1]) or death from any cause, whichever comes first .  The secondary efficacy endpoints include OS  and 
ORR.  
The analysis of PFS will be performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population and will be conducted using a stratified log- rank test.  The 
stratification factors will be the same used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the interactive voice and web response system (IXRS).  
The median PFS and the associated 95% CI for each treatment arm will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  The hazard ratio (HR= 
λ
FPA144+mFOLFOX6 / λplacebo+mFOLFOX6 ) will be estimated using a Cox 
regression model with treatment group as the only main effect and stratifying by [CONTACT_412294]-rank test.  An uns tratified HR will also be presented . 
Analyses of secondary endpoints OS  and ORR will be conducted 
hierarchically.  The formal hypotheses regarding effects on OS  and ORR 
will be tested hierarchically at a one -sided level of 0.1.  The OS will be 
tested  first and if it is significant, the ORR will be tested next.  The 
family -wise type I error rate of testing primary and secondary endpoints 
will be in a control by [CONTACT_412295]-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_412255] a one-sided level of 0.1.  
Overall survival will be analyzed in a similar manner as for PFS.  
The analysis of ORR will be performed based on the ITT population.  
In the analysis of ORR, patients without post baseline  adequate tumor 
assessments will be counted as non -responders.  Formal hypothesis tes ting 
of ORR will be performed using the stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel 
test at a one-sided level of 0.1.  The stratification factors will be the same 
used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the IXRS.

 P age 21 of 139 Confidential  Safety Analysis  
All AEs will be code d us ing the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities Version 20.1 (MedDRA v 20.1).  The investigator will classify 
the severity of AEs using the CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_519756].  
The number and percentage of patients who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormal 
laboratories after study treatment administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory measurement.  For each clinical laboratory 
measurement, descriptive stati stics will be provid ed for baseline and all 
subsequent post treatment scheduled visits.  Changes from baseline to the 
posttreatment visits will also be provided.  Descriptive statistics of vital signs will also be provided in a similar manner.   In addition, shift from 
baseline in CTCAE grade (where applicable) and by [CONTACT_5019]/low flags (where CTCAE grades are not defined) will be presented in a similar manner. 
Safety Analyses in Phase 1  
Safety analyses will be performed for patients included in the safety 
population.  The incidence of DLTs, incidence of TEAEs, clinical 
laboratory abnormalities (eg, shift table), vital signs, corneal and retinal findings, and ECGs  will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_15994].  
Additionally, incidence of TEAEs leading to dosing reduction or dose discontinuation of FPA144 or any component of mFOLFOX6 will be tabulated and summarized . 
Safety Analyses in Phase 2 
The analyses of safety will include all patients who receive any study 
treatment (FPA144 + mFOLFOX6  or placebo + mF OLFOX6 ) throughout 
the study and will provide post treatment safety information .  The 
incidence of TEAEs, clinical laboratory abnormalities, vital signs, corneal and retinal findings, and ECGs will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
No formal comparisons of safety endpoi nts are planned.  
PK Analysis and Immunogenicity  
Individual and mean (± SD) serum FPA144 concentration- ti
 me data will 
be tabulated and plotted by [CONTACT_15994].  PK parameters will be tabulated 
and summarized by [CONTACT_412296].  The  
impact of immunogenicity on FPA144 exposure will be assessed, tabulated, and summarized by [CONTACT_412297].  Integrated 
population PK analysis and exposure- response relationship assessment 
will be presented in a separate report.

 P age 33 of 139 Confidential  1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 General Gastric Cancer 
Gastric or gastroesophageal cancer (GC ), including gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, 
represents the fourth most common cancer worldwide (Kamangar 2006)  and is a highly lethal 
disease, with 5 -year overall survival (OS) rates below 30% in the [LOCATION_002] (US) regardless 
of stage (National Cancer Institute 2015 ).  Though intensive multimodal therapy for locoregional 
disease improves survival (The GASTRIC Group 2010, Waddell 2014)  it does not cure most 
patients and chemotherapy for metastatic disease provides only short- term benefits (Wagner 
2006, Waddell 2014) .  First -line chemotherapy used in patients with metastatic or recurrent 
disease consists of a fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil [5- FU] or capecitabine) with a platinum 
agent (usually oxaliplatin or cisplatin) ( Al-Batran 2008, Kang 2009) .  This treatment prolongs 
survival by [ADDRESS_519768] supportive care (Wagner 2006) , but the benefits are only 
short- term with a median OS (mOS) of 9 to  10 months and a progression- free survival (PFS) of 
5 to 5.6 months (Kang 2009, Waddell 2014) .  
1.[ADDRESS_519769] identified important pathways involved in GC development.  The 
availability of targeted agents has led to the development of strategies incorporating these agents in the therapy for patien ts with such a poor prognosis.  Recen tly ramucirumab (a monoclonal 
antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor  [VEGF ] pathway) was approved for 
treatment in patients with GC who progressed following first line treatment (Wilke 2014) .  OS  
for patients treated  with ramucirumab with paclitaxel was 9.[ADDRESS_519770] is the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_412257] 2 (HER-2 also 
known as ERBB2) (Gravalos 2008, Hofmann 2008) .  HER-2 overexpression has been identified 
in 9 to 38% of GCs depending on histology and tumor location ( Gravalos 2008) .  The 
availability of trastuzumab , a monoclonal antibody targeting HER-2, led to the development of a 
randomized trial in newly diagnosed GC patients whose tumors overexpressed HER-2.  About 
22% of screened patients we re HER-[ADDRESS_519771] chemotherapy ( Bang 2010) .  Based on these results, this has become 
standard care for patients overexpressing HER-2.  
In spi[INVESTIGATOR_412258], the majority of GC patients succumb to their disease, and there 
are few treatment options following progression after first -line chemotherapy .  Recently anti -
PD1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_412259].  In September 2017, Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare approved the PD1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo®) for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy.  This approval was based on the Phase 3 study 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 34 of 139 Confidential  ATTRACTION- 2 (ONO -4538- 12), in which Opdivo® signi ficantly reduced patients’ risk of 
death by 37% (HR 0.63 [95% CI: 0.51- 0.78, p<0.0001]) when compared to placebo (Kang 2017) .  
Additionally, in September 2017, the U nited States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
granted accelerated approval to pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) (Fuchs 2017)  for patients with 
recurrent locally advanced or metastatic, gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcin om a 
whose tumors express PD - L1.  Patients must have had disease progression on or after 2 or more 
prior systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including fluoropyrimidine -  and platinum-containing chemotherapy 
and, if appropriate, HER2/neu - targeted therapy.  Pembrolizumab approval was based on data 
from 143 patients with tumors expressing PD -L1 and who were either microsatellite stable 
(M SS) or had unknown microsatellite instable ( MSI) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR ) 
status , who demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR)  of 13.3% (95% CI: 8.2, 20.0) and a 
duration of response (DOR) rangi ng from 2.8+ to 19.4+ months.  The majority of patients, 
however, do not respond to anti- PD1 therapy and other late line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_412260], and irinotecan improve the mPFS by [CONTACT_21316] 2 months (Thuss-
Patience 2011, Ford 2014, Fuchs 2014) .  Therefore, continued evaluation of agents that can 
target the mutations present in GC  is imperative.  
Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) has recently been identified as 
having prognostic importance in patients with GC  (Jung 2012, Matsumoto 2012, Su 2014, 
Seo 2016) .  Patients with FGFR2 gene amplification appear to have a worse prognosis (Su 2014, 
Seo 2016) , suggesting that inhibition of FGFR2 may be an important target (Jung 2012, 
Matsumoto 2012) .  FPA144 is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific to the human FGFR2b 
receptor that blocks fibroblast growth factor (FGF ) binding to the receptor .  Evaluation of this 
agent in pat ients with GC whose tumors have alterations of FGFR2 would be an important 
strategy to improve the prognosis for these pat ients.   
1.[ADDRESS_519772] in cancer is well known.  FGFs can stimulate the transformation 
and proliferati on of tumor cells and stimulate angiogenesis .  There are 22  known human FGFs 
with the expression of individual FGFs generally re stricted to specific tissues, cell types, and/or 
developmental stage.  FGF signaling is mediated by a family of transmembrane ty rosine kinase 
receptors encoded by [ADDRESS_519773] genes producing FGF receptor subtypes termed FGFR1–4 
(Turner 2010) .  
The FGFR2 has 2 splicing variants, b and c.  In general, FGFR2b is expressed in tissues of epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261] (eg, stomach, skin) (Miki 1992) .  The major ligands s ignaling through FGFR2b 
are FGF7, FGF10 and FGF22.  Alteration in signaling in the FGF/FGFR2 pathway (eg, overexpression of FGFR2 protein or amplification of FGFR2  gene) has been associated with 
gastric, breast, and othe r cancers, and appears to portend a worse prognosis ( Turner  2010, 
Wu 2013) .  As early as 1990, subsets of patients with GC (approximately 3 to  9%) and breast 
cancer (1 to 2%) were noted to have amplification of the FGFR2 gene, which resides on 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 35 of 139 Confidential  chromosome 10q26 (Hattori 1990, Turner 2010) .  In GC, FGFR2  gene amplification leads to 
high-level expression of the FGF R2b receptor on the surface of the cells.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_519774] or R eceptor 2-S pecific Antibody  
FPA144 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1 isotype) specific to the human FGFR2b 
receptor (National Cancer Institute 2015 ) that blocks FGF ligand binding to the receptor.  
FPA144 is directed a gainst the third Ig region of the FGFR2b receptor isoform, the region that is 
alternatively spliced and regulates ligand specificity .  This antibody is glycosylated but is 
produced in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that lacks the FUT8  gene 
(α1,6-Fucosyltransferase) and therefore lacks a core fucose in the polysaccharide portion of the antibody.  The absence of the core fucose results in higher affinity for the Fc receptor FcγRIIIa compared to the fucosylated molecule and potentially enhances immune cell -mediated tumor cell 
killing (Shinkawa 2003) .  The antibody has thus been glycoengineered for enhanced 
antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Gemo 2014) .  FPA144 inhibits FGF 
ligand-stimulated FGFR2b phosphorylation and cell proliferation in cell culture in FGFR2b overexpressing gastric and breast cancer cell l ines.  FPA144 also inhibits tumor growth in 
FGFR2b overexpressing gastric and breast xenograft models .  The 3 potential mechanisms of 
action of FPA144 thus include blocking ligand binding and downstream signaling, decreasing expression of the FGFR2b driver protein, and enhancing ADCC.  
FPA144 can produce complete and durable tumor growth inhibition in FGFR2b-overexpressing 
and FGFR2  gene-amplified GC xenografts in immune- compromised mice where FGFR2b is 
considered a driver of tumor growth (Gemo 2014) .  In addition, FPA144 demonstrates 
recruitment of natural killer (NK) cells and concomitant tumor growth inhibition in the 4T1 
syngeneic tumor model with modest expression of FGFR2b (Powers 2016) .  These data suggest 
that ADCC may be efficacious in patients without  FGFR2  gene amplification with moderate 
FGFR2b overexpression, and that ADCC activity may be a major contributor to the mechanism of action in these patients.  
Additionally, since FPA144 is specific for the FGFR2b receptor, it does not interfere with signaling of the other FGFs/ FGFRs, including FGFR2c.  In contrast to the FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), FPA144 does not inhibit FGF23 signaling.  FGF23 is a ligand involved in calcium/phospha te metabolism.  Th us, treatment with FPA144 is not expected to cause the 
dose-limiting hyperphosphatemia associated with the FGFR TKIs (Brown 2005, Andre 2013, Dienstmann 2014, Sequist 2014) .  
As FPA144 is a targeted biologic, the clinical development of FPA144 will ultimately b e in 
selected patients with alterations in the FGFR2 pathway that are most likely to respond to this novel agent .  The tumor types most relevant to date include gastric, bladder, and possibly 
cholangiocarcinoma.  Each of these cancers needs new therapeutic options .  The FPA144 -004 
study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of FPA144 in combination with modified FOLFOX (inf usional 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) ( mFOLFOX6 ) chemotherapy

while the Phase 2 will enroll GC patients  specifically selected for FGFR2 expression and/or

in vivo. 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vivo  Pharmacology 
FPA144 has been studied in a series of mouse xenograft models using human gastric and breast 
tumor cell lines that contain th e FGFR2  amplicon.  These FGFR2  amplified lines all express 
high levels of the FGFR2b protein and respond to FPA144 in a dose-dependent fashion.  A dose response study (twice weekly dosing) was performed with the mo st sensitive model, a GC line, 
OCUM -2 (Figure 1).  Mice were treated at the indicated concentrations of FPA144, and the 
tumor growth was compared to mice treated with albumin alone .  Statistically significant tumor 
growth inhibition was seen at 0.3 mg/kg, but not at 0.1 mg/kg, and tumor regression was seen at 1 mg/kg with complete tumor regression starting at doses of 1.5  mg/kg (2/15 animal s), 2 mg/kg 
(1/15 animals), 3  mg/kg (5/15 animals), and 5 mg/kg (8/15 animals) .  In the SNU -16 GC model, 
tumor growth i nhibition was seen at 1 mg/kg, while in the MFM-223 tumor- bearing mice, 
5 mg/kg led to tumor stasis.

 P age 37 of 139 Confidential  These tumor models require immunodeficient mice for tumor engraftment.  Because these mice 
lack a fully functioning immune system, and because the mouse Fc γ receptor (the receptor on 
immune cell s required for ADCC) has lower affinity for human antibodies than the human 
Fcγ receptor, ADCC is impaired in these mod els of FPA144 mediated tumor growth inhibition.  
Thus, in patients with FGFR2 overexpressing tumors, ADCC may further contribute to anti tumor 
activity in the clinical setting .  To understand the contribution of Fc receptor engagement and 
ADCC on FPA144 antitumor efficacy, a mutant antibody was engineered that cannot bind Fc 
receptors, thereby [CONTACT_412298] .  The s yngeneic 4T1 model of 
breast cancer was employed in immune competent mice that express FGFR2b , but to a lesser 
degree t han amplified or overexpressed FGFR2b xenografts, such as OCUM-2M or SNU-16 
xenograft tumors.  4T1 tumors were grown to a volume of approximately 100 mm3, sorted into 
groups of equivalent tumor volume, then treated bi-weekly with FPA144, the ADCC- deficient 
FGFR2b antibody, or the Fc fragment of human IgG1 (hFc-G1) as control. FPA144 decreased tumor burden by 30% versus hFc -G1 control (p=0.001) while the mutant antibody showed no 
effect .  These data support a role for ADCC activity through Fc receptor bindin g as a required 
mechanism for FPA144 efficacy in a model that expresses modest amounts of FGFR2b protein. 
Mechanistically, FPA144 blocks FGFR2b phosphorylation, downregulates the receptor and 
inhibits downstream signaling .  The effect on downstream signaling was measured by [CONTACT_412299] a protein that is directly phosphorylated by [CONTACT_412300]2 protein, FGF receptor substrate -2 (FRS2) .  This has been demonstrated in the SNU -16 FGFR2 -amplified GC xenograft 
model.  In this experiment, mice were trea ted twice weekly with 10 mg/kg  FPA144 .  When 
tumors had reached approximately [ADDRESS_519777] on 
xenograft models that are not FGFR2  amplified or do not express the FGFR2b protein.  Mice 
bearing NCI-87 gastric tumors, which do not express FGFR2b, were dosed intraperitoneally 
twice a week with FPA144 once the tumors reached approximately 100 mm3.  The tumor growth 
rate was indistinguishable between animals treated with either FPA14 4 (5 mg/kg) or control 
animals administered albumin.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Immune Effector Functions of FPA144  
Some therapeutic antibodies containing IgG1 Fc are capable of recruiting immune effector function, specifically ADCC and complement-dependent cellular toxicity .  Once antibodies of 
the IgG1 isotype bind to their target on tumor cells, immune cells which express the Fc gamm a 
receptor IIIa (FcγRIIIa), especially NK cells and macrophages, are recruited to the tumor cells and promote cell death in a process known as ADCC.  FPA144 is specifically engineered for enhanced ADCC.  This antibody lacks a core fucose in the polysacchar ide portion of the 
antibody, and the lack of fucose results in higher affinity of FPA144 for FcγRIIIa compared to

 P age 38 of 139 Confidential  the fucosylated molecul e and potentially enhanced immune cell mediated tumor cell killing.  In 
some in vitro  studies, including ADCC assays, and in  vivo studies, including toxicology studies, 
the fucosylated form of FPA144 (FPA144- F) was compared to the afucosylated form (FPA144).  
FPA144 was compared to FPA144- F for in vitro  ADCC activity .  The target cell in the assay was 
an engineered ce ll line that expresses the full -length human FGFR2b described as Ba/F3 
FGFR2b, and the effector cells were peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained fresh 
from individual human donors.  As a negative control, FPA144 was also tested u sing a target cell 
line that was engineered to express the FGFR2c variant of the receptor (Ba/F3 FGFR2c cells), to which FPA144 does not bind.  The data ar e shown in Figure 2.  FPA144 and FPA144-F both 
showed ADCC activity, but the degree to which FPA144 killed the target cells was substantially greater than what was measured for FPA144 -F.  As expected, FPA144 showed no ADCC 
activity in the negative control.

FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519780] included pi[INVESTIGATOR_412263]/tolerability and repeat- dose studies as 
well as Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) repeat -dose studies.  The longest of these studies 
involved intravenous (IV) administration of 13 weekly doses in rats and monkeys. 
In pi[INVESTIGATOR_412264]-dose toxicology studies, rats and cynomolgus monkeys received 4 weekly IV 
doses of FPA144 up to 150 mg/kg.  There were no changes in clinical signs and symptoms or 
clinical chemistry .  The most significant findings from these repeat- dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_412265] .  FPA144 -treated animals displa yed a dose-dependent 
thinning that represents both attenuation and reduction in the numbe r of cells present in the 
corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  In addition, microscopic changes in the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE ) in 
rat were noted that included RPE atrophy in 1 high- dose animal that received 4  weekly 
150 mg/kg doses.  Retinal changes were not observed in the 13-week GLP toxicology studies with a high dose of 100 mg/kg. 
In the 13- week repeat -dose GLP toxicology studies, FPA144 was administered by [CONTACT_412301] 1, 5, or 100 mg/kg/dose to both rats and monkeys for 13 weekly doses.  
In the rat, F PA144 resulted in adverse findings including: tooth (incisor) abnormalities (clinical, 
macroscopic, and microscopic findings) and body weight loss/lack of weight gain, which were 
most likely secondary to the tooth findings that necessitated early euthanasi a at the 
100 mg/kg/dose, ocular findings (ophthalmic and microscopic findings), and macroscopic and/or microscopic findings in the Harderian gland (not present in huma ns) and oral mucosa (hard 
palate) at 5 and 100 mg/kg/dose, and macroscopic and/or microscopic findings in the tongue at all dose levels .  FGFR2 pathway signaling is known to play a critical role in maintaining the 
health of rat incisors , but has not been found to be relevant in human dentition.  FPA144 -related, 
but non- adverse microscopic findings, were also noted in the mammary gland of animals at all 
dose levels.  Administration of FPA144 also resulted in exacerbation of background microscopic findings in the prostate gland of males given 1, 5, and 100 mg/kg, the non-glandular stomach of animals given 5 and 100 mg/kg/dose, and the lung of animals given 100 mg/kg/dose .  With the 
exception of FPA144- related effects on incisor teeth, some degree of recovery u p to total 
recovery was evident for all findings at the end of recovery.  The absence of FPA144 -related 
findings in the eye (ophthalmic or microscopic findings), Harderian gland, mammary gland, and prostate gland at the end of the recovery period indicated complete reversibility of the findings in these tissues .  Since all findings in the 1 mg/kg/dose group were minimal, without clinical 
consequences, and recoverable, the highest, non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in rats was 
determined to be 1 mg/kg/dose when given weekly for [ADDRESS_519781] dose of 
1 mg/kg/dose level was associated with mean maximum observed serum concentration (C
max) 
and area under serum concentration -time curve  (AUC) over the dose interval τ (AUC τ) 
(τ=168 hours ) of 27.7 µg/mL and 789 h*μg/mL, respectively, for combined sexes on Day 85 of 
the dosing phase. 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 41 of 139 Confidential  In the 13- week repeat -dose GLP toxicology study performed in cynomolgus monkeys, FPA144 
was generally well tolerated .  FPA144 -related effects were limited to micro scopic findings of 
corneal atrophy (slight to moderate) in animals given 5 and 100 mg/kg/dose and mammary gland 
atrophy (moderate to marked severity) in females from all dose groups.  These findings in the cornea and mammary gland were not associated with clinical sequelae and were not observed at 
the end of the recovery phase, indicating complete recovery.  Therefore, based on the lack of 
correlative clinical findings or changes (eg, ophthalmic findings or c linical observations) and 
the demonstrated revers al during a recovery period, neither finding was considered adverse.  
The 100-mg/kg/dose level is considered below the severely toxic dose level in monkeys for the 
study.  This represents a > 300- fold safety  factor over the proposed starting dose of 0.3 mg /kg.  
The highest dose of 100 mg/kg was associated with mean C
max and AUC τ (τ=168 hours) values 
of 3,266 µg/mL and 252,787 h*μg/mL, respectively, for combined sexes on Day 85 of the dosing phase.  
In addition to in vivo toxicology studies, a GLP -compliant tissue cross reactivity study has been 
performed to compare the binding of FPA144 to a panel of 36 tissues from rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human.  In general, the binding pattern of FPA144 was similar among the 3 species and agreed with literature reports on the expression of FGFR2b being epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- based.  
Additional details of  the nonclinical program for FPA144 are provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure ( IB), which contains comprehensive information on the investigational product. 
1.3.5 Clinical Experience with FPA144  
Please refer to the bemarituzumab Investigator’s Brochure for upd ated results of the clinical 
experience with FPA144.  
FPA144 underwent evaluation in [ADDRESS_519782]- in-
human study, FPA144-001, entitled “A Phase 1 Open- Label, Dose-Finding Study Evaluating 
Safety and Pharmacokinetics of FPA144 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors” started in 
December 2014 and was conducted in the US, South Korea, and Taiwan.  This open-label study assessed  the safety, pharmacoki netics ( PK), and preliminary efficacy of FPA144 monotherapy in 
patients with solid tumors .  The study was  comprised of 3 parts: a dose escalation portion in 
unselected solid tumor patients (Part 1 A), a dose escalation portion in GC patients ( Part 1 B), and 
a dose expansion portion for patients with FGFR2b- selected tumors  including FGFR2b- selected 
GC, and FGFR2b- selected bladder cancer  (Part 2).  
Two parallel dose escalations were performed: Part 1 A enrolled patients with solid tumors 
(19 patients), and Part 1B enrolled patients with GC (8  patients) to evaluate early evide nce of 
efficacy and PKs to support the RD for the dose expansion cohort.  FPA144 was well tolerated in 
doses up to 15 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in patients with advanced solid tumors .  
There were no dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs ) observed during dose- escalation and a maximum 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 42 of 139 Confidential  tolerated dose (MTD ) was not reached .  Based on an assessment of safety, tolerability, and PK, 
an RD of 15 mg/kg administered Q2W  was selected.  
As of  20 March 2017, a total of 64 patients across the dose escalation ( Parts 1A and 1B : 
27 patients) and the dose expansion (P art 2: 37 patients) enrolled in the study and [ADDRESS_519783] 1  dose of FPA144.  Of the se 64 patients, 41 patients had GC and 21 of those were identified 
as having GC with strong FGFR2b overexpression ( or FGFR2b+ high, defined as IHC 3+ 
intensity in ≥  10% of tumor cells).  Of those 21 patients, 6  patients were enrolled in the Part 1B 
dose escalation and 15 patients in the  Part 2 dose expansion (Cohort  A).  In addition, 4 GC 
patients with low FGFR2b overexpression (or FGFR2b+ low, defined as IHC 2+ intensity in 
< 10% of tumor cells or any immunohistochemistry  (IHC) 1+ staining)  have been enrolled in 
Cohort E and 10 GC patients (IHC 0–2) have been enrolled in  Cohort C in Part 2 (dose 
expansion). 
Safety and tolerability of FPA144 is supported by a total of 64 patients from the Phase 1 study 
(FPA144 -001) who have received at least 1 dose of FPA144.  
Safety  data from 64 patients enrolled  in FPA144-001 including 37 patients treated at 15 mg/kg 
administered Q2W  (expansion dose) are described here.  Adverse events ( AEs) have been 
reported in 58  of 64 patients (90.6%) .  Thirty -two of the 64 patients reported an AE that was 
deemed by [CONTACT_412302] . Of the drug- related AEs, none were Grade 4  or 5.  
There were 6 Grade 3  events : an infusion reaction in 1 patient, an aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) elevation and alkaline pho sphatase increase in 1  patient, nausea in 2 patient s and a 
transient decrease in neutrophil count (which resolved without dose interruption or modification) 
in [ADDRESS_519784] patient (post data 
cut) with limbic stem cell deficiency after approximately 14 months  of therapy, considered 
related to study treatment also discontinued treatment.  All other patients discontinued treatment 
as a result of disease progression.  Treatment -related serious adverse events (SAEs) were 
reported in 3 patients : 1 patient  (15 mg/kg) with the  Grade  3 infusion reaction, 1 patient 
(15 mg/kg) with the Grade  2 corneal ulcer, and 1 patient  (10 mg/kg)  with the  Grade 2 limbic 
stem cell deficiency (post data cut). In all 3 patients with treatment- related SAEs, the events 
resolved.  The patie nt with the infusion reaction resumed drug administration after premedication  
and a reduced dose.  The patient with the Grade 2 corneal ulcer temp orarily interrupted FPA144 
and received ophthalmic drugs with resolution of the event.  The patient with the Grade 2 limbic stem cell deficiency discontinued study treatment and her symptoms and  signs resolved after 
approximately 3 months. 
Additional development of FPA144 for the treatment of GC includes an ex -US, non- US 
investigational new drug ( IND)  study , FPA14 4-002, entitled “A Phase 1 Open- Label, Dose-
Finding Study of FPA144 in Japanese Patients with Advanced Gastric or Gastroesophageal 
Cancer.”  This dose escalation study was designed to assess the PK and safety of single agent 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519785] fo r single agent FPA144 in Japanese patients.  No DLTs were 
reported in the FPA144-004 study. 
Please reference the bemarituzumab investigator’s brochure for an updated review of the ocular 
events that have occurred in clinical studies with FPA144. As discussed in Section  1.3.4, 
preclinical animal toxicity studies support a need for comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations.  The comprehensive ophthalmologic examinations in the Phase 1 study (FPA144-
001) includedd fundoscopic and slit lamp examination , ocular coherence tomography (OCT), 
visual acuity, and review of ocular and visual symptoms at screening, prior to the third dose , and 
at the end of treatment (EOT) visit.  Slit lamp examinations (with completion of flu orescein 
staining score form ), were  conducted at regular intervals for all patients .   
Twenty -three  of 79 (29%) patients treated with FPA144 monotherapy in study FPA144-[ADDRESS_519786] common ocular even ts (> 5%) were dry eye 
(14 
patients [1 8%]) and increased lacrimation (5 patients [6 %]). Among these patients, [ADDRESS_519787].   
In the phase 1 part of study FPA144-004, two events of punctate keratitis and one each of corneal abrasion, corneal disorder and limbal stem cell deficiency were reported. As of October 29, 2019, 18 of 134 (13%) patients treated  in the phase 2 part of the FPA144 -004 stu dy 
had reported ocular adverse events involving the cornea or retina.  Eight patients experienced keratitis (grade 1  (1); grade 2  (5), grade 3 (2) ), three patients experienced punctate keratitis 
(grade 1; grade 2; grade 3  (1 each) ), two experienced limbal stem cell deficiency (grade 3), two 
patients experienced retinal hemorrhage (grade 1) , two patients experienced ulcerative keratitis 
(grade 2 (1); grade 3 (1) ),one patient each experienced corneal erosion (grade 1), corneal 
infiltrate (g rade 1) and xeropht halmia (grade  2). The retinal hemorrhages were asymptomatic 
incidental findings during comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation and did not preclude ongoing treatment with FPA144/placebo. The study drug/placebo was withdrawn in eight patients (2  patients wi th keratitis, 1 patient each with corneal infiltrates, corneal ulcer, eye 
disorder, dry eye, ulcerative keratitis, xerophthalmia) and was delayed in four patients (2 cases of 
keratitis, and one patient each with superficial punctate lent itis both eyes and punctate epi[INVESTIGATOR_412266]).  
Evidence of early efficacy in the FGFR2b
+ high gastric and GEJ cancer patient population is 
supported by a confirmed response rate (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
version 1.1 [RECIST  v1.1] ) of 19.0% [5.4-41.9%]) in 21 patients in the target patient population 
with a duration of response (DOR) of 15.4 weeks (95% confidence interval  [CI] 9.1, 19.1 weeks) 
and a median PFS o f 11 weeks (95% CI 5.7, 20.6 weeks).  
FPA144 serum concentration was m easured by a validated enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) ( refer to  the FPA144 IB ).  FPA144 demonstrated nonlinear clearance (CL)  from 
0.3 mg/kg to 1 mg/kg and close to linear CL  from 1  mg/kg to 15 mg/kg in patients with solid 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 44 of 139 Confidential  tumors including GCs tested in Parts 1A and 1B, suggesting target- mediated CL.  The estimated 
half- life (t1/2) ranged from 6.01 to 11.7 days across cohorts, which supports every 2-week dosing.  
As derived from the mouse efficacy study using the OCUM2 FGFR2 -amplified GC xenograf t 
model, 60 µg/ml was selected as target trough serum concentration at steady state (C trough ss).  
Based on the PK data in combination with safety data and evide nce of efficacious activity  from 
Part 1 of the clinical study, the 15 mg/kg Q2W  dose was selected to test in the Part  2 expansion 
cohorts as this dose level was expected to achieve target C trough ss  of ≥ 60 µg/mL .  Limited PK 
data in Part 2 from a total of 18 GC pati ents dosed at 15 mg/kg Q2W , including 8 patients with 
high FGFR2b overexpression (Cohort A) and 10 patients  without FGFR2b overexpression 
defined as IHC  0 (Cohort C) , suggest ed that a dose of 15 mg/kg Q2W  will achieve C trough ss target 
of ≥ 60 µg/mL  (refer to  the FPA144 IB ) in approximately 70% of patients at Day 28.  PK 
modeling suggests that the addition of a single dose of 7.5 mg/kg administered on Day [ADDRESS_519788] 90% of patients to  achieve the target trough of ≥ 60 ug/ml at  Day 15, 
without significantly increasing the C max. 
1.4 Rationale for mFOLFOX6  
Chemotherapy for advanced GC prolongs survival and improves symptoms (Wagner 2006, Al -
Batran 2008, Kang 2009, Okines 2009, Waddell 2014) .  The combination of a platinum agent 
with a fluoropyrimidine has become a frequently used combination (Kang 2009)  and in a recent 
meta -analysis has been identified as superior to single agent treatment and best supportive care 
(Wagner 2006) .  Although there is no single standard globally acc epted first line reference 
chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced GC, the combination of a fluoropyrimidine (5- FU, 
capecitabine or S1) and a platinum agent (cisplatin or oxaliplatin) is an accepted standard of care 
in both Western and Asian countries (Wagner 2006, Al -Batran 20 08, Keam 2008, Kang 2009, 
Okines 2009) . 
The antitumor treatment effect of fluorouracil derivatives (5F U, capecitabine) are believed to 
result from inhibiting the enz yme thymidylate synthase  (TS) . (Ulrich 2000, P ullarkat 2001, 
Chen  2003) .  Leucovorin, also known as folinic acid, causes a biochemical modulation of 5- FU 
enhances the treatment effect of 5-FU in patients with GC (Kim 2003) . 
Oxaliplatin is a cisplatin analog that functions through its ability to form DACH -platinum 
adducts and block deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replications .  Oxaliplatin exhibits additive or 
synergistic properties when combined with 5- FU and has proven to be effective even when 
treating 5-FU resistant cell lines or cell lines resistant to cisplatin (Kim 200 3, Keam 2008) .  
In a randomized Phase 3 trial comparing 5-FU/LV/oxaliplatin  with 5-FU/LV/cisplatin (FLP) in 
the treatment of 220 patients with GC reported a statistically insignificant improved time -to-
progression; however, the oxaliplatin based regimen  was associated with meaningful reductions 
in Grade 3–4 AEs , including anemia, nausea, vomiting and renal  toxicity, but with more  
neuropathy (Al-Batran 2008) .  Subsequent studies have supported the safety and efficacy of 
mFOLFOX6 as the first line of treatment for advanced GC (Keam 2008) . 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519789] therapy in advanced/metastatic GC pa tients in the 
US, Europe, and Asia. 
1.5 Rationale for Combination Therap y: FPA144 and mFOLFOX6  
Since advanced GC is not cured with the currently available chemotherapy regimens, there is a 
continued need to provide improve ment to  available treatment s.  The FGF R pathway has been 
shown to play an important role in the transforma tion and proliferation of tumor cells, and 
inhibiting FGF ligand-stimulated FGFR2b phosphorylation and cell proliferation has been shown 
to reduce tumor growth in both FGFR2b overexpressing gastric and breast cell lines and xenograft models.  
FPA144 as monotherapy has demonstrated objective tumor responses in preclinical studies, 
blocking ligand binding and downstream signaling, decreasing expression of the FGFR2b driver protein and enhanci ng ADCC.  Preliminary data from the first- in-human study of FPA144 
indicate that FPA144 monotherapy has activity in patients with heavily pre treated 
FGFR2b -selected GC .  The safety profile has been tolerable, with no DLTs  encountered to date. 
The combination of FPA144 and paclitaxel demonstrated enhanced activity in both the OCUM -2M and HSC-39 xenograft models of GC compared to monotherapy of either agent at 
the doses tested (Gemo 2014) .  Using a more ag gressive chemotherapy regimen in these same 
models, such as ci splatin and 5- FU or oxaliplatin and 5- FU chemotherapy, provided near 
complete growth suppression in the HSC-39 model and therefore no additional benefit was observed with the addition of FPA144.  Alternatively, the OCUM -2M FGFR2 -amplified model, 
demonstrated near complete tumor suppression with FPA144 at the doses tested, and therefore no additional benefit was observed in combination with cisplatin + 5-FU or oxaliplatin + 5-FU 
chemotherapy.  Imp ortantly, the addition of FPA144 to any of these chemotherapy regimens did 
not increase the toxicity associated with chemotherapy as measured by [CONTACT_412303]. 
Advanced stage GC has been demonstrated to be heterogeneous, and the development of 
additional heterogeneity is hypothesized to be induced by [CONTACT_412304] (Smyth 2016) .  Specifically, GC metastases are more likely to overexpress FGFR2b compared to 
the primary tumor, suggesting that emergence of an FGFR2b overexpressing tumor is a later stage event  (Ahn 2016) , and may even be induced by [CONTACT_412305].  Sequential 
biopsies and circulating tumor DNA ( ctDNA) testing have demonstrated that subclones of 
tumors with different phenotype emerge after targeted therapy treatment (Smyth 2016, 
Catenacci  2017) .  The hypothesis that chemotherapy and FPA144 ta rget different subclones of 
GC is supported by t he ability of FPA144 or mFOL FOX [ADDRESS_519790] xenograft models (Gemo 2014) .  
Further , the hypothesis that adding a targeted biologic agent to standard chemotherapy in GC 
may be bene ficial in selected patients is further supported by [CONTACT_412306] (PFS and OS) of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy in patients with GC whose tumors

progressed after front- line therapy (Wilke 2014) .  
1.6 FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 Starting Dose Justification 
In study FPA144-001, no DLTs were reported at doses tested from 0.3 mg/kg to 15 mg/kg 
administered Q2W  and no MTD of FPA144 was identified .  Therefore, the RD for expansion 
was based on the observation of clinical efficacy  and tolerability in the human FPA144-001 
Phase 1 study , combined with  preclinical data from the OCUM2 FGFR2 -amplified GC xenograft 
mouse model, which  identified 60 µg/mL as t he target trough serum concentration to achieve 
maximum efficac y.  Supporting the  hypothesis that ≥ 60 µg/mL should be the target minimum 
trough serum concentration (C trough), all patients who demonstrated a partial response in the 
ongoing FPA144-001 study achieved the target C trough ss of ≥ 60 µg/mL .  Patients receiving a  
lower dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W  also achieved a target trough of ≥60 µg/mL , but not until steady 
state approximately 3  months after the initiation of FPA144.  At the earlier time poin t of 28 days, 
only 3 of 6 patients dosed at the 10 mg/kg dose achieved the target C trough of ≥ 60 µg/mL 
compared to 21 of 29 patients dosed at 15 mg/kg Q2W based on data as of 20 March 2017. 
To safely minimize the time needed to reach the target FPA144 target trough concentration while 
increasing the potential for earlier efficacy in this rapi[INVESTIGATOR_412267], a dose of 
7.5 mg/kg FPA144 will be administered on Day 8 of Cycle 1 for patients enrolled in Cohort 2. 
PK modeling suggests that the schedule of 15 mg/kg Q2W with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day 8 (Cycle 1 only) will allow at least 90% of patients to achieve the biologically active target trough concentration by [CONTACT_2006] 15 instead of by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  Achieving the target trough concentration earlier is clinically important in this patient population with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574] . 
No drug- drug interactions are ex pected between FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 based on known 
mechanisms of CL .  However, based on FGFR2b expression in tissues of epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261] 
(eg, stomach and skin), and the AEs reported in the ongoing FPA144-001 study, FGFR2 
inhibition could increase the rate of mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea observed with 
mFOLFOX6 alone .  
The Phase 1 portion of this study will initiate FPA144 combined with mFOLFOX6 a dose of 
6 mg/ kg administered Q2W .  Assuming the dose of 6 mg/kg  is demonstrated to be safe, 
tolerable , and without clinical or pharmacologic evidence of a drug interaction, the second dose 
to be tested will be 15 mg/kg Q2W  with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day 8 (Cycle 1 only).  If 
Cohort 1 (6 mg/kg Q2W ) clears the 28 day DLT  period, but ≥ 2 DLTs are observed i n Cohort 2 
(15 mg/kg Q2W  with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day 8 of C ycle 1 only), based on observed safety, 
tolerability and PK, a dose level between Cohorts 1 and 2 ( this new cohort will be Cohort 1a, 
proposed to be 15 mg/kg Q2W ) may be evaluated in a rolling  6 design.  If ≥ 2 DLTs are 
observed in Cohort 1a, then the Cohort Review Committee ( CRC)  may decide to  evaluate a dose 
between  the dose levels tested in  Cohort 1a and Cohort 1 ( this new cohort will be Cohort 1b) to

is 9 to 11 months with a median P FS of 5  to 7.4 months (Kang 2009) .  Patients with GC an d 
FGFR2  gene amplification (Seo 2016)  or FGFR2 b overexpression ( Ahn 2016)  have a worse 
prognosis (Hattori 1996, Gemo 2014)  thus warranting evaluation of a new targeted agent against 
FGFR2+ GC . 
mFOLFOX [ADDRESS_519792] frequently G rade 3 -4 
neutropenia reported in about 40–50% of patients, peripheral neuropathy (> Grade 2) reported in about 70% o f patients, diarrhea (> Grade 2) reported in about 25% of patients, and 
nausea/vomiting reported in about 3% of patients each (Tournigand 2004, van Hazel 2016) .  
Vomiting and mucositis were not observed in FPA144 toxicology studies, however, 20.4% of patients in the ongoing FPA144-001 study with monotherapy FPA144 reported nausea and/or vomiting, with 3.1% reporting Grade 3 (no Grade 4 or higher was reported).  Alt hough no 
mucositis or diarrhea has been reported (n=64), based on mechanism of action, inhibition of FGFR2 may increase this risk.  In patients with underlying metastatic GC receiving mFOLFOX6 
chem otherapy, an increase in the incidence of any of these GI symptoms could be clinically 
meaningful.  
The protocol includes standard anti-emetic therapy, close clinical monitoring and drug 
modifications and discontinuation.  Additionally, an independent data monitoring committee (DMC)  will monitor safety and toxicity on the study (refer to Section  8.10.2). 
The individual agents used in the FOLFOX regimen  (5-FU, oxaliplatin and leucovorin) are also 
associated w ith risks. Refer to local prescribing information for complete details.  
The risks associated with fluorouracil include: myelosuppression, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, 
mucositis , anorexia, palmar -plantar erythrodysthesia , alopecia, cardiac toxicity , neurotoxic ity 
and hyperammonemic encephalopathy.  Due to a potential drug-drug interaction between 5- FU 
and warfarin, there is a risk of an elevated international normalized ratio ( INR) for patients on 
warfarin who also receive 5 -FU (Teva Pharmaceuticals [LOCATION_003] Inc 2016) . 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 48 of 139 Confidential  The risks associated with oxaliplatin include allergic reactions, neuropathy, pulmonary toxicity, 
hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, rhabdomyolysis, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis,  
myelosuppression, fatigue .  
As of November 2017, no drug has been approved in the US , EU, or Asia specifically for the 
subset of pa tients with FGFR2 -selected GC .  Based on the emerging data from the Phase 1 
FPA144 -001 trial, FPA144 may provide a meaningful cli nical benefit with an acceptable 
tolerability profile in heavily pretreated patients with GC whose tumors overexpressed FGFR2 .  
FGF signaling pathways appear to be a valid target for clinical investigation in human cancer 
based on precli nical models as wel l as ongoing clinical trials with other molecules that broadly 
target FGF signaling (Taiho Oncology Inc 2015, Hall 20 16, GlaxoSmithKline 2017) . 
As detailed in Section  1.5, the addition of FPA144 to current standard of care first- line treatment 
for advanced GC with mFOLFOX6 is anticipated to improve PFS compared to chemotherapy alone.  Preliminary data from the  first- in-human study of FPA144 indicate that FPA144 
monotherapy has activity in patients with FGFR2b- selected gastric and bladder cancer .  The 
safety profile has been tolerable, with no DLTs  reported.  
In addition to the st udy design (dose escalation) and eligibility criteria that exclude patients with 
significant organ dysfunction, the following precautions will be taken in this study: 
• Based on non- clinical toxicology , FPA144 has an expected on- target effect leading to corneal 
thinning which may increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a corneal ulcer or a secondary corneal 
infection .  Based on the aggregate clinical data, keratitis has been identified as an adverse 
drug reaction to bemarituzumab treatment. Accordingly, patients who at baseline have a 
history of co rneal disease such as keratitis or corneal transplant will be excluded .  Patients 
found to have ocular abnormalities involving the cornea during screening  will also  be 
excluded, including c orneal defects, corneal ulcerations, keratoconus, or other abnormal ities 
that c an pose an increased  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a corneal ulcer.  Ophthalmology examinations 
will be performed at baseline and at regular protocol required intervals during the study to 
monitor potential ocular effects  (described in Section  6.6.2 ). 
• Based on non-clinical data, FPA144 may have on- target effects on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_412268], although redundancy in the FGF pathway i n these organs may limit and the 
toxicity b eyond what is anticipated from mFOLFX6 alone.  To date, 1 event of G rade 1 dry 
mouth has been reported in a patient during Cycle 6 of FPA144 given at 3 mg/kg. 
Fluoropyrimidines have a known toxicity of mucositis ( Teva Parenteral Medicines Inc 20 16). 
Patients will undergo physical exam ination approximately every 2 weeks, including 
examination of the oropharynx.  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 49 of 139 Confidential  • Patients will be closely monitored for infusion -related reactions which are known potential 
toxicities of both oxaliplatin and FPA144.  The  FPA144 infusion rate may be reduced a t the 
investigator’s discretion based on occurrence of infusion- related reactions, such as changes in 
vital signs, nausea, vomiting, or other constitutional symptoms or allergic reactions occurring 
during infusion or up to 2 hours after cessation of the in fusion.  
• Routine premedication is not generally administered for the initial FPA144 dose; patients who develop infusion- related AEs may be premedicated prior to subsequent infusions of 
FPA144 at the discretion of the investigator.  Pre -medication for mFOLFOX6 should be 
at the discretion of the investigator , administered according to the institution’s standard 
practice, and captured on the patient’s electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_41217], diphenhydramine (or equivalent) f or IV 
injection, and any other medications and resuscitation equipment for emergency management of anaphylactic reactions must be available in the room where the infusions 
are being performed.

demonstrating objective responses in patients with FGFR2b overexpression. 
Eligibility for enrollment in the Phase 2 portion is based on FGFR2b overexpression and/or  
FGFR2  
 gene amplification as determined by a centrally performed, validated IHC or ctDNA 
blood assay.  Patients are required to  provide both a tissue sample and a blo od sample to test  for 
FGFR2 and patients unable to provide both samples will not be eligible for this trial.  Patients 
who are pos itive for FGFR2 b overexpression and/or  FGFR2  gene amplification are referred to in 
this protocol as FGFR2 -selected .  Positivity based on only 1 assay is adequate to meet eligibility 
requirements (eg, positive by [CONTACT_412307], but negative by [CONTACT_4658]) ( refer to  Section  4.2).  
Pre-screening allows for collection of blood and tissue to d etermine FGFR2 positivity using 
ctDNA and  IHC assays.  Once a patient is confirmed to have a positive result based on central 
testing, the s creening period  initiates, allowing for evaluation of all other eligibility criteria  (refer 
to Section  4.2).  
Eligible patients for the  Phase [ADDRESS_519794] received prior adjuvant or 
neo-adjuvant therapy (chemoth erapy and/or chemoradiation) greater than 6 months prior to 
enrollment.  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 50 of 139 Confidential  Since the IHC and ctDNA blood results may require approximately 2 weeks to complete, 
patients eligible for entering Phase 2 of this study are permitted  to receive 1 dose of mFOLFOX6  
during this interim time period (p re-screening period) at the discretion of the investigator.  This 
1 dose of chemotherapy is not a requirement of the study and is not considered part of this clinical study .  
1.9 Rationale for Tumor Tissue and Blood Assessments  
Patients who do not demonstrate either FGFR2b overexpression using IHC or FGFR2  gene 
amplification using a ctDNA blood assay will not be eligible for enrollment.  Positivity based on 
either 1 or both assays is adequate to meet the eligibility requirements (eg, positive by [CONTACT_412287], but negative by [CONTACT_4658]).  The blood test will reveal  DNA amplification of FGFR2 ,

In studies evaluating GC samples, FGFR2  gene amplification has been uniformly associated 
with significant FGFR2b surface expression, as detected by [CONTACT_4658] (Gemo 2014) .  The antitumor 
effect of FPA144 that was observed in preclinical testing was predicated upon the 
overexpression of FGFR2b in the tumor cell lines.  Patients without overexpression of FGFR2 are unlikely to see a significant benefit fro m treatment with FPA144 in combination with  
mFOLFOX6.  
The selec tion of patients with FGFR2 -positive tumors for treatment with FPA144 is supported 
by [CONTACT_412309] 1, first- in-human study of FPA144-001.  Confirmed responses 
have only been reported in patients having tumors with FGFR2b overexpression, validating the strategy of selecting these patients for treatment with FPA144  based on FGFR2 status.  
Additionally, since GC is heterogeneous, the use of ctDNA has been incorporated to identify 
tumors that shed FGFR2 into the blood stream, but whose tumors do not overexpress FGFR2b (due to tissue sampling error).   Allowing patients to enroll who either test positive for FGFR2b

3.1 Study Overview 
The Phase 2 portion of this study was initially designed as a Phase 3 with overall survival as the 
primary endpoint. The study design has been changed considering the findings of a higher proportion of FGFR2 positive tumors in patients in the front- line gastric cancer setting than 
expected (~ 30% vs the expected rate of 10%)   and that the vast majority of tumors are positive 
via IHC analysis for FGFR2b overexpression rather than by [CONTACT_412315]2 amplification. The randomized, double-blind study design will be maintained through the primary analysis of the Phase 2 study.
 
This is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter Phase 1/ 2 study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK of FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 versus placebo + mFOLFOX6.  Patients may enroll into either Phase 1 or Phase 2 but may not enroll in both phases of the study. 
This study includes a Phase 1 safety run -in portion and a Phase 2 portion.  The Phase 1 safety 
run-in is an open- label dose- escalation of FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 in patients with GI tumors 
(not FGFR2 selected).   Provision of tissue for retrospective FGFR2b overexpression testing by 
[CONTACT_4658], and blood for FGFR2 gene amplification by [CONTACT_412316], are not required for enrollment in Phase 1, but will be tested retrospectively if available (refer to Section  6.1). 
The Phase 2 portion of the study (to follow the Phase 1 safety run- in) is a global, randomized, 
double-blind, controlled, study to evaluate the efficacy of FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 versus placebo  
+ mFOLFOX6 in patients with FGFR2 -selected GC.  FGFR2b overexpression will be
determined  by [CONTACT_412317]/or a ctDNA blood assay demonstrating FGFR2 gene
amplification.   The duration of the study is expected to be approximately 43 months to complete;
this includes Phase 1 (6 months for completion) and Phase 2 (13 months for accrual and24 months of long term follow up (LTFU) from the last patient enrolled).
In Phase 1, the starting dose level of FPA144 is 6 mg/kg per dose. Subsequent dose escalations between cohorts in Phase 1 are described in Section  3.2.1.  The  dose of FPA144 for Phase 2 will 
be determined by [CONTACT_412318] 1 of the study, as described in Sections  3.2.3 
and 3.2.4. 
Additional study design details are provided below for each study phase.   The study s chemas are 
provided in Section  3.4.

3.2.1 Dose Escalation 
In Phase 1, dose cohorts are planned at proposed doses beginning at an FPA144 dose level of 
6 mg/kg per dose Q2W , and enrollment will depend on safety and tolerability.  Phase 1 includes 
a 3+[ADDRESS_519797] of FPA144 to be administered in combination with 
mFOLFOX6 in Phase 2 is determined.  A mi nimum of 2 dosing cohorts of FPA144 + 
mFOLFOX6 will be included in Phase [ADDRESS_519798] of FPA144 in combination with 
mFOLFOX6 . 
Patients enrolled in Phase 1 will be treated with escalating doses of FPA144 in combination with 
a fixed -dose chemotherap y regimen of mFOLFOX6 in 2- week cycles, as outlined in Table  1.  
Intra -patient dose escalation will not be permitted.  
Additional details regarding dose escalation and the DLT period are provided in Section  3.2.3.  
Proposed dose levels are outlined in  Table  1 and also in Section  5.1.2 and Section  5.2 of the 
protocol; guidance for dose modification is  provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
Decisions on how to next proceed will be based on safety, tolerability, and PK data, and will be determined by [CONTACT_10186]. 
Administration of FPA144 will be over approximately 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) Q2W ± 3 days 
on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle. FPA144 will be administered prior to mFOLFOX6 
chemotherapy.  Patients treated in Cohort 2 (only) will receive 1 additional dose of FPA14 4 on 
Day 8 of Cycle 1 (mFOLFOX6 will not be administered on this day).

3.2.3 Observation  of Dose- Limiting Toxicity  (the DLT Period)  
Beginning on the first day ( Cycle 1  Day 1 [ C1D1 ]) of treatment with FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 , 
each patient will be observed for 28 days ( the DLT period) for safety, PK, and occurrence of 
DLTs . DLTs are defined in Section  3.2.2. 
FPA144  dose escalation will occur as follows (refer to  Table 2 for the dose escalation 
algorithm):  
• Cohort 1 begins with a FPA144  dose of 6 mg/kg per dose in a 3+3 design. 
• If Cohort 1 at 6 mg/kg (3+3 design) clears the 28-day DLT period, then Cohort 2 at 15 mg/kg 
Q2W  with 1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day 8 (C ycle 1 only) will be  tested in a rolling  6 design 
and enroll 6 patients. 
• Upon initiation of enrollment in Cohort 2, 6 patients will be enrolled to explore the safety, 
tolerability and PK  at this dose level.  
• If ≥ 2 DLTs are observed in Cohort 2, then a dose level between Cohorts 1 and 2 may be 
evaluated in a rolling 6 design (this cohort will be Cohort 1a 15 mg/kg Q2W).  
• If ≥ 2 DLTs are ob served in Cohort 1a, then a dose level lower than Cohort 1a, but higher 
than Cohort 1 may be evaluated in a rolling 6 design (this cohort will be Cohort 1b at a dose to be determined). 
Dose escalation decisions will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_10186], consisting of the Sponsor and 
investigators.  Dose escalation decisions will be based  on an assessment of DLTs, overall safety, 
and tolerability, and will be made after the last patient enrolled in each cohort has completed the 28-day DLT period (completion of 2 treatment cycles of FPA144 and mFOLFOX6).  Review of 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 58 of 139 Confidential  safety and  PK parameters may inform decisions to add cohorts with alternative dose levels to 
reach an optimal target exposure.  
No additional doses of FPA144 or more than 2 doses of mFOLFOX6 should be administered 
during the 28- day DLT period.  The doses of FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 on Day 1 of Cycle 2 do 
not need to be synchronized.  For example, if mFOLFOX6 is delayed due to an AE that is deemed related only to mFOLFOX6 and not to FPA144, FPA144 shoul d be administered as 
described in Section 5.1 for Cycles 1 and 2 regardless of delays in the mFOLFOX6 dosing 
schedule.  
DLTs are defined in detail in Section  3.2.2.  The algorithm shown in Table 2 will be used for 
Phase 1 dose escalation decisions.

Cohort 1a , then Cohort  1a or Cohort 1b will open respectively and  6 patients  will be 
enrolled.  
Ab breviations: DLT = dose -limiting toxicity.  
Upon completion of the DLT period  (starting with Cycle 3) , patients may continue to receive 
FPA144 + mFOLFOX6.  Additional doses may be administered Q2W (1 cycle ) until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient meets any of the other protocol- specified 
withdrawal criteria (refer to Section  4.0).  There is no maximum number of doses of FPA144.  
Ongoing administration of the mFO LFOX6 regimen beyond the DLT period will be according to 
local standard of care. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_519800] of FPA144 for Phase 2 will be identified by [CONTACT_412322], tolerability, and PK and will not exceed 15 mg/kg administered IV Q2W  with 
1 dose of 7.5 mg/kg on Day [ADDRESS_519801] may be a 
different, though not higher, dose than the MTD. 
The MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which < 33% of patients experience a D LT during 
the DLT period.  If a DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients in Cohort 1, then 3 additional patients 
will be enrolled at that same dose level.  Dose escalation may continue until 2 of 3 to 6 patients 
treated at a dose level experience a DLT (dose lev el not to exceed the highest dose level tolerated 
in Phase 1).  The next lower dose w ill then be considered the MTD.  
3.2.5 Phase 2 Dose of FPA144 
There  were no DLTs  observed during the Phase 1 safety run -in and an MTD  was not reached . 
Based on an assessment of overall safety, tolerability, and PK of FPA144 in combination with 
mFOLFOX6 by [CONTACT_10186], the dose of 15 mg/kg Q2W with an additional dose of 7.5 mg/kg on 
Cycle 1 Day 8 will be used for the Phase 2 portion of the trial. 
3.2.6 Patient Replacement  
Any patient who does not receive the total number of doses of FPA144 defined by [CONTACT_412323] 
2 complete  doses of mFOLFOX6 during the DLT period due to a reason that is not a DLT or an 
AE related to FPA144, will be considered unevaluable and the patient wi ll be replaced.  The 
replaced patient may continue on study at the i nvestigator ’s discretion and after d iscussion with 
the Sponsor.  
3.2.7 Number of Doses 
There is no protocol- mandated maximum number of doses for FPA144 or mFOLFOX6.  
Ongoing administration of the mFOLFOX6 regimen beyond the DLT period will be according to 
Section  3.2 or 5.2 with dose adjustments as detailed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  Initiation of a new cycle 
of mFOLFOX6 following a dosing delay may be synchronized with a dministration of an 
FPA144 infusion but is not a study requirement.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_519802] dose of FPA144 or mFOL FOX6 .  For these patients, the end of FPA144 
treatment is the end of study  (EOS)  and no further follow-up will be conducted. 
If mFOLFOX6 is discontinued for any reason other than investigator- assessed disease 
progression, or any of the other protocol- speci fied withdrawal criteria, FPA144 may be 
continued as a single agent therapy at the investigator ’s discretion, and administered Q2W  until 
investigator- assessed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient meets any of 
the other protocol- specified withdrawal criteria.

required for pre-screening  by [CONTACT_412290]2 amplification.  FGFR2 positive status by  1 of 
these testing methods is required for enrollment in Phase 2.  The  results of the centralized 
FGFR2 testing may take approximately 2 weeks; patients are permitted  to receive up to 1 dose of 
mFOLFOX6 du ring this interim time period (pre -screening) at the discretion of the investigator.   
This 1 dose of chemotherapy is not a requirement of the study a nd is not considered part of this

Enrolled patients may continue treatment in 2-week  cycles of mFOLFOX6 with or without 
FPA144 until investigator- assessed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient 
meets any of the other protocol- specified withdrawal criteria .  There is no protocol-mandated 
maximum number of doses for FPA144  or mFOL FOX6 . 
Discontinuation of any component of the study (mFOLFO X6, a component of mFOLFOX6, 
or FPA144) for any reason other than disease progression, does not necessarily  mandate 
discontinuation of the other components.  An exception is the permanent discontinuation of 5- FU 
for any reason, which requires concurrent discontinuation of oxaliplatin and leucovorin. 
The first 3 cycles of FPA144 should be adm inistered as scheduled (±  3 days) regardless of delays 
in mFOLFOX6 treatment.  After the first 3  cycles , FPA144  may be delayed up to 7 days to be 
synchroni zed wi th administered mFOLFOX6 .  However, synchronization of FPA144 and 
mFOLFOX6  is not a protocol requirement.  If after 7 days, the patient is still unable to receive 
mFOLFOX6, FPA144  should continue as monotherapy Q2W .

outcomes between Eastern and Western populations, with better OS reported in Asian 
populations and i n particular Japanese patients (Ohtsu 2011, Davidson 2016) .  The cause of the 
different outcomes is unknown, but has been hypothesized to be driven by [CONTACT_412327], biology or subsequent treatment (Ohtsu 2006) .  Historically, large global trials have not 
included a significant proportion of patients from China, so it is unknown if the outcome is more 
similar to US and EU or the rest of Asia  (Davidson 2016) .  As it is anticipated that 
approximately hal f the enrollment in this clinical trial will be from China, China will be a 
separate geographic region from the rest of Asia and accordingly, stratification  will be  by

liquid protected from light which is diluted for administration according to instructions provided 
in a separate Pharmacy Manual.  
FPA144 will be supplied in a sterile vial for dilution in  an IV bag for administration by [CONTACT_188528].  
5.1.2 Administration  (Phase 1 and Phase 2)  
The FPA144 proposed doses  were  outlined above in Table  1.  In Phase 1  the starting dose level 
of FPA144 is 6 mg/kg per dose in combination with a fixed dose chemotherapy regimen of 
mFOLFOX6 ( Section  5.2).  In Phase 2, the dose of FPA144 in combination with a fixed dose 
chemothera py regimen of mFOLFOX6 w ill be determined by [CONTACT_412318] 
1 of the study. 
FPA144  will be administered only to patients in this study using procedures described in this 
protocol.  The dose of FPA144 is based on body weight at C1D1 and should be recalculated only 
if the weight changes > 10% from the C1D1 weight.  If the dose is recalculated due to a >10% 
weight change from C1D1, the weight used for the recalculated dose should function as the new baseline for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations.  Doses should be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_519824] (or other responsible person) will prepare FPA144  for administration .  After 
calculating the number of vials based on the patient’s weight, FPA144  will be diluted in a 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution .  Prepared FPA144 should be administered ≤ 8 hours after pr eparation 
(ambient temperature).  FPA144  will be administered under medical supervision over 
approximately 30- minute (± 10 minutes) IV infusion via a peripheral vein or central v enous 
catheter .  The IV administration set for FPA144  infusion must contain a 0.[ADDRESS_519825] be stopped, reduced, interrupted, or discontinued according to  
Sections  3.2.2 and [IP_ADDRESS].  If a patient experiences an infusion reaction , the patient’s vital signs 
(temperature, blood pressure [BP] , heart rate [HR], and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] [RR] ) should be 
monitored during the infusi on as well as every 30  minutes after the infusion for a minimum of 
2 hours and until resolution of the infusion reaction. 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 72 of 139 Confidential  Patients may continue receiving FPA144  administered in 2-week cycles until investigator-
assessed disease progression ( Phase 2 only), unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient meets any 
of the other protocol- specified withdrawal criteria .  There is no maximum number of doses of 
FPA144 . 
Further instructions on drug preparation and administration are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.1.3 FPA144 Dose Modifications 
Dose modifications discussed in this section include intrapatient dose modifications. D ose 
escalations/modifications  between cohorts in Phase 1 are described in Section  3.2.1.  The dose of 
FPA144  for Phase 2 was  determined by [CONTACT_412318] 1 of the study, as 
described in Section s 3.2.3 and 3.2.4. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Escalation  
In Phase 1, intrapatient dose escalation wi ll not be permitted.  In Phase 2, patients will be treated 
at the MTD and/or RD as determined from Phase 1 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight  
A complete physical examination including height and weight will be performed at Screening.  
The dose of FPA144 will be based on body weight at C1D1 and should be recalculated only if the weight changes > 10% from the C1D1 weight.  If the dose is recalculated due to a >10% 
weight change from C1D1, the weight used for the recalculated dose should function as the new baseline for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion or Hypersensitivity Reactions  
If a patient experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_519826] protocol until complete resolution of the event.   Signs and symptoms of infusion or hypersensitivity reactions may 
include, but are not limited to fever, c hills, rigors, urticaria, hypotension or hypertension, 
headache, wheezing, shortness of breath, hypoxia, and pulmonary infiltrates.  Appropriate intervention s include,  but are not limited to antihistamines , corticosteroids, bronchodilators, 
and/or IV fluid s. 
If a patient experiences an infusion reaction, the patient’s vital signs ( temperature, BP, HR, and 
RR) should be monitored every 30 minutes af ter the infusion has been discontinued for a 
minimum of 2 hours or resolution of the infusion reaction, whichever takes longer. 
At the investigator’s discretion, the infusion of FPA144 may also be stopped if a less severe AE 
(Grade  1 or 2) occurs during the infusion. 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 73 of 139 Confidential  If the infusion reaction resolves, at investigator discretion the infusion may be restarted at half 
the previous infusion rate.  If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_412270], signs or symptoms of a 
hypersensitivity/infusion reaction recur, the infusion should be discontinued, and no further 
dosing of FPA144 will occur without consultation with the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee. 
After experiencing a Grade 3 or higher infusion or hypersensitivity reaction, all subsequent 
infusions of FPA144 for the patient should be administered at the reduced rate (over 60 minutes) with premedication.  Pre -medication may include  medications such as corticosteroids, 
antihistamine and/or acetaminophen in accordance with local standard of care.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Toxicity : FPA144 Dose Modific ation Guidelines   
Dose reductions for FPA144 may be permitted for patients on treatment beyond the DLT period in Phase 1 or any patient in Phase 2 and are based on local laboratories and clinical assessment.  
If a patient in Phase 1 requires a dose reduction or is unable to receive FPA144 during the DLT period, their reported toxicity is considered a DLT and be permanently discontinued from FPA144.  Doses may be held or reduced for FPA144-related AEs following the guidelines outlined in Table 5 (Phase 2 FPA144 dose levels for dose reductions), Table 6 (non-corneal 
toxicities), and Table 7 (corneal toxicities).  
Any patient with a corneal event which occurs within [ADDRESS_519827].  Any patient with FPA144-related retinal toxicity should permanently discontinue FPA144.  If dose reductions or interruptions that do not fall within these guidelines are being considered by [CONTACT_093], these will require discussion with and approval by [CONTACT_16015]. Patients may resume the FPA144 if the event returns to baseline or ≤ Grade 1 in accordance with the guidelines outlined in Ta ble 6, and Table 7. 
Patients who require FPA144 dose reductions will receive the reduced dose for the remainder of 
the study. C ycles may be delayed to manage toxicity.   Cycle  delays of longer than 28 days 
should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to reinitiation .

Patients should be closely monitored for mFOLFOX6 toxic ity.  In Phase 1, any patient who does 
not receiv e 2 complete  doses of mFOLFOX6 during the DLT period due to a reason that is not a 
DLT or an AE related to FPA144, will be considered unevaluable and the patient will be replaced.  Beyond the DLT period in P hase 1 , or at any time in Phase 2, dose adjustments for any 
component of mFOLFOX 6 are permitted according to the guidelines outlined below. 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 77 of 139 Confidential  The dose of mFOLFOX6 is based on body weight at C1D1 and should be recalculated only if the 
weight changes > 10% from the C1D1 weight. If the dose is recalculated due to a >10% weight change from C1D1, the weight used for the recalculated dose should function as the new baseline for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations.  
  
Patients should be counseled to avoid e xposure to cold weather during and for approximately 
[ADDRESS_519836] hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia prior to initiating oxaliplatin.  
Evaluation for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency should be considered if the 
following event s occur after 5-FU: s evere diarrhea, mucositis, and myelosuppression. 
The l eucovorin dose is given for d, l- racemic mixture .  Use half the dose for levo-leucovorin 
(l-leucovorin).  Leucovorin will stay at a fixed dose of (400 mg/m2 and or as deemed appropr iate 
by [CONTACT_093] ) will be given prior to each 5-FU dose.  If 5 -FU is delayed, leucovo rin will be  
delayed.  If leucovorin is not available, levo-leucovorin (200 mg/m2 or as deemed  appropriate by 
[CONTACT_093] ) may be administered.  Leucovorin or levo -leucovorin may be omitted from 
study treatment in the event that they are both unavailable.  
Patients who require chemotherapy dose reductions will receive the reduced dose for the remainder of the study.  The only exception to this practice will be in  the case of nausea/  
vomiting.  If nausea and/or vomiting occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_412272], the chemotherapy dose 
should be reduced by 25% for the next dose.  If tolerated, an increase back to a 100% dose may be allowed at the investigator’s discretion.  Any patient who required [ADDRESS_519837] dose reduction will be discontinued from all chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy cycles may be delayed to manage toxicity.  Cycle  delays of 
longer than 28 days should be dis cussed with the medical m onitor prior to reinitiation of 
treatment.  
Dose adjustments at the start of each 14 -day cycle will be based on nadir hematologic counts or 
maximum non-hematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Dose adjustments of each agent may be made independently based on the specific types of 
toxicities observed. 
Recommended dose adjustments for mFOLFOX6 toxicity are shown in  Table 8.

270 mM sucrose, and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. Placebo will be administered in a 
method that matches the administration of FPA144 to maintain blinding. 
5.4 Unblinding Treatment Assignment  
The Pha se 2 portion of this study is double -blind .  Placebo will be matched to FPA144. 
Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations.  With the exception of unblinding for the analysis (to be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP] ), all individuals 
involved in the conduct of the study (eg, all site staff and participants, monitoring personnel, Sponsor personnel) will be blinded to randomize d treatment assignment.  The decision and 
ability to unblind the treatment code in emergency situations resides with the investigator.   
The i nvestigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature u nblinding 
(eg, accidental unblinding or unblinding because of a serious adverse event). 
5.5 Drug Accountability  
The investigator or appropriately qualified staff is responsible for maintaining accurate study 
treatment accountability records throughout the study. 
The investigator is responsible for destroying or returning all unused study treatment to the 
Sponsor (or designee), and must verify that no remainin g supplies are in the investigator ’s 
possession .  The study site is permitted to destroy unused, used or partially used study treatment 
vials according to the site policy once Sponsor (or designee) approval of their documented 
destruction procedure has been obtained.  On completion of the study, the number of FPA144 
vials shipped, destroyed, and returned must be reconciled. 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519839] Compliance  
Only qualified trained study center personnel may administer FPA144 .  Pharmacy personnel 
trained in the study requirements will monitor compliance with the treatment assignments.

6.1.2 Phase 2 
Provision of archival (or fresh biopsy if archival tissue is not available) for Pre-Screening  
FGFR2b overexpression testing by [CONTACT_412324]; a blood sample is also required for Pre-Screening by [CONTACT_412290]2 gene amplification.  FGFR2 positive status by [CONTACT_412332] 2.  R esults of the centralized FGFR2 testing 
may take approximately 2 we eks; patients are permitted  to receive up to 1 dose of mFOLFOX6 
during this interim time period (p re-screening ) at the discretion of the investigator.  This [ADDRESS_519842] consent to tumor tissue analysis and blood sample analysis.  
Patients will be selected for enrollment based on FGFR2 b overexpression and/or FGFR2  gene 
amplification, as determined by a validated IHC or ctDNA blood assay, respectively , using the 
central laboratory .  Patients who do not demonstrate either FGFR2b overexpression using IHC or 
FGFR2  gene amplification using a ctDNA blood assay will not be elig ible for enrollment.  
However, positivity based on 1 or both of the assays is adequate to meet eligibility requirements 
(eg, positive by [CONTACT_412307], but negative by [CONTACT_4658], and vice versa) (refer to Table 4).  It is 
the responsibility of each investigator to obtain an adequate tumor specimen for analysis of FGFR2 positivity for enrollment.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_519843] be collected prior to any study- specific procedures 
(including pre- screening) .  Patients who have fully consented to participation  in the main study 
will undergo s creening  assessments wi thin [ADDRESS_519844] be completed prior to enrollment in 
accordance with the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 2).  During the s creening period, the 
patient will und ergo protocol- specified  screening procedures to ensure all eligibility criteria are 
met.  
6.3.1 Phase 1  
For Phase 1, a ll patients will undergo screening  assessments within 28 days (as outlined in  
Appendix 2).  After a ma ximum 28- day screening period, eligible patients will initiate study 
treatment as described in Section  5.0.  Patients  who screen fail may undergo repeat screening 
procedures one time, but all procedures must be done within the 28-day s creening  window, 
inclusive of informed consent. 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519845] 2  additional doses of 
mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy (there is no upper limit on the number of previous mFOLFOX6 
doses that patients may have received, nor is there a requirement for prior treatment with mFOLFOX6 in Phase 1).  
Patients should have tumor tissue collected  from arc hival material (if available) for analy sis of 
FGFR2b overexpression by [CONTACT_412333]. 
6.3.2 Phase 2 
For Phase 2, all patients will undergo screening  assessments within 28 days.  After a maximum 
28-day screening period, eligible patients will initiate rando mized study treatment as described 
below.  Patients who screen fail for Phase 2 may repeat screening procedures one time (not 
applicable to pre -screening  when tissue or blood sample is determined to be evaluable and 
FGFR2 negative), but all procedures must be done within the 28-day screening window, 
inclusive of informed consent. 
The description of testing for FGFR2 positivity is described in Section  3.3.  Eligibility for 
Phase 2 will be evaluated in 2 steps:  • Step 1: Patients will provide informed consent to allow testing for FGFR2b overexpression 
by [CONTACT_412334] a blood sample for FGFR2 amplification by [CONTACT_412316].  
The time between providing informed consent and site notification of the resu lt of the test is 
considered the pre -screening period ( refer to Section  3.3).  
• Step 2: Pre -screening allows for collection of blood and tissue to determine FGFR2 positivity 
using ctDNA and IHC assays.  Once a pa tient is  confirmed to have a positive result based on 
central testing, the screening period initiates, allowing for evaluation of all other eligibility 
criteria  (refer to Section  4.2).  Patients who test negativ e for FGFR2b overexpression or 
FGFR2 amplification will be considered pre-screen failed.  Patients who test positive and 
enter the screening period, but do not enroll, will be considered s creen failed .

throughout the entire treatment phase (as prescribed in the DMC Charter) in Phase 2 (refer to 
Section  8.10.2). 
6.6.1 Vital Signs  
Vital sign s (BP, HR, RR , and temperature) are to be measured  in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in 
accordance with the Schedules of As sessments ( Appendix 2, Appendix 3, Appendix 5).  
6.6.2 Physical Examinations , Height, and Weight 
A complete physical examination including height and weight will be performed at Screening.  Limited physical examinations (eg, symptom- directed exam ination of specific organ 
systems/body area)  should be conducted in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 in  accordance with the 
Schedules of Assessments ( Appendix 2, Appendix 3) and include weight and examination of the 
oropharynx. 
The dose of FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 is based on body weight at C1D1 and should be 
recalculated only if the weight changes > 10% from the C1D1 weight.  If the dose is recalculated 
due to a > 10% weight change from C1D1, the weight used for the recalculated dose should function as the new baseline for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations.

In Phase 2, the EQ -5D- 5L QOL  questionnaire and the EORTC QLQ- C30 will be administered in 
accordance with  Appendix 3.  
The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire was developed by [CONTACT_131492], which is a standardized 
measure to provide utilities for clinical and economic appraisal.  It uses a descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS) .  The descripti ve system has 5 dimensions: mobility, self- care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, and each dimension has 5 levels consisting of no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.

 P age 91 of 139 Confidential  The EORTC  QLQ is an integrated system for assessing the health -related quality of life of 
cancer patients participating in international clinical trials.  The EORTC uses a modular 
approach to QOL assessment, consisting of a co re questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) to be 
admi nistered, if necessary with a module specific to tumor site, treatment modality or a QOL  
dimension ( eg, GC- specific module is QLQ -STO22).  
6.17 Adverse Events  
Assessment of AEs will follow the guidelines provided in th e NCI CTCAE  version 4.03 in Phase 
1 and version 5.0 in Phase 2.  AEs  will be assessed as outlined in Section  6.17.3.  Abnormal 
laboratory results that lead to a change in patient treatment management (eg, dose delay, 
requirement for additional medication  or monitoring) are considered clinically significant for the 
purposes of this study and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF.  Events meeting SAE criteria must be reported as SAEs (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
6.17.1 Collection of Adverse Events  
In Phase 1, any new symptoms, injury, or worsening of symptoms that occur during the screening period (ie, following signing of the ICF, but prior to first infusion [C1D1] ), will be 
considered pretreatment events and reported on the Medical History page of the eCRF, unless 
they directly correlate to a study -related procedure in which case they will be reported on the AE 
eCRF page .  Otherwise, AE reporting will begin at the time of infusion of C1D1  (day of first 
infusion) and continue until completion of the EOT  visit or 4  weeks (28 days) after the last dose 
of FPA144 .  
In Phase 2, AEs should not be reported during the pre -screening period unless they are related to 
a pre-screening  procedure, as patients are not yet enrolled on the study at that time .  The worst 
grade of AEs occurring during the s creening period should be reported as described above for the 
Phase [ADDRESS_519862] a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product.  Abnorma l laboratory 
findings that are not considered clinically significant will be recorded only on the laboratory eCRF pages and not on the AE pages.  Abnormal laboratory results that are considered clinically significant in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_412274].  Relationship 
(reasonable causal relationship) to drug therapy and counter measures undertaken will be noted on the eCRF. 
All AEs including intercurrent illnesses that occur during the study, from the time of 
administration  of study treatment, will be documented on the AE eCRF.  Concomitant illnesses, 
which existed prior to the day of the first study infusion, will not be considered AEs unless they worsen by [CONTACT_2669] 1  grade during the treatment period .  Intensity (severity) g rade will be defined 
according to the NCI- CTCAE, version  4.[ADDRESS_519863] 1 dose of study treatment (FPA144 and/or mFOLFOX6) has been administered.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, will not be 
reported as an AE, but the procedure and/or therapeutic treatment should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF .  The medical condition for which the procedure was performed must be 
reported as a n AE (or as part of the patient’s medical history, if the procedure precedes the 
initiation of study- prescribed treatment) .  Signs and symptoms associated with disease 
progression itself should not be reported as an AE or SAE if the diagnosis is available. Disease progression itself is an endpoint and not an AE or SAE. 
6.17.[ADDRESS_519864] to seriousness, intensity (severity), 
causality , and the outcome and action taken.  All AEs, regardless o f the relationship to study 
treatment, will be recorded on the AE eCRF.  This includes potential end-organ toxicity, eg, 
renal (proteinuria), hepatic, and cardiovascular (increased BP) effects, and effects on wound 
healing.  All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date of onset, ongoing or 
date of resolu tion, intensity, treatment required, relationship to study treatment , action taken with 
the study treatment, outcome, and whether the event is classified as serious as described below .

• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (formal admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979]) or 
prolongation of existing hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Medically significant events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition .  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is considered 
medic ally significant or serious and whether expedited reporting is appropriate.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412275].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_412276] a pre -existing condition is not

 P age 94 of 139 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS].2 Intensity (Severity)  
Investigators need to assess the severity of AEs according to the guidelines provided in 
NCI-CTCAE, version 4.03 in Phase 1 and version 5.0 in Phase 2. 
CTCAE v 4.03 and v 5.0 Severity Grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated; mild AE 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated ; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living; moderate AE  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant, but non -immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self- care 
activities of daily living; severe AE  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Fatal AE  
If the AE is not specified in the CTCAE or the study protocol, the grading of severity will be assessed as mild (Grade 1), moderate (G rade 2), severe (Grade 3), life -threatening  (Grade 4), 
or death due to the AE (Grade 5) using the following definitions: 
• Mild: The patient is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily 
tolerated.  
• Moderate: The patient experiences suf ficient discomfort to interfere with or red uce his or her 
usual level of activity.  
• Severe: Significant impairment of functioning: the patient is unable to carry out usual activities.  
• Very severe (life- threatening): The patient’s life is at risk from the ev ent. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  
The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study treatment  and the AE 
and record that assessment on the eCRF.  
The most likely cause of an SAE (eg, disease under treatment, concomitant disease, concomitant medication,  other) will be indicated on the eCRF with details of the concomitant disease or 
medication or other cause.  
The causal relationship of the AE to study treatment  will be assessed by [CONTACT_3553] a question: 
‘Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may hav e been caused by [CONTACT_104841] ?’

assessments.  
In Phase 2, after discontinuation of study treatment for reasons other than disease progression or 
withdrawal of consent, tumor assessments will continue until the patient initiates additional 
anticancer therapy or progresses.  
Symptomatic corneal and all retinal even ts are considered of special interest and should be 
reported up to [ADDRESS_519873] dose of FPA144.

LTFU  assessments are outlined in Appendix [ADDRESS_519874] of clinic visits,  telephone calls, or patient registries  (in line with national 
legislation and prevailing data protection laws) approximately every 3 months (± 1 month) after 
the EOT visit until up to [ADDRESS_519875] patient is enrolled in the study, or until death, 
loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by [CONTACT_1034] (whichever occurs 
first), which will be considered the EOS .  During the Follow-up Period, if the patient undergoes 
anticancer therapy, this should be documented. 
During the first 6 months of the LTFU  Period (for patients in Phase 2), and for the first 6 months 
after the EOT visit (for  patients in Phase 1), any known pregnancy that occurs should be reported

7.1 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations are defined for the study: 
• Safety Population: all enrolled  patients who have received any porti on of at least 1 dose of 
study treatment (FPA144 + mFOLFOX6  or placebo + mFOLFOX6 ).  
• DLT -evaluable Population: all patients enrolled in Phase [ADDRESS_519877] 
2 doses of FPA144 (except for Cohort 2 [must have received 3 doses of FPA144] ) and 
mFOLFOX6 and completed Cycles 1 and 2 of treatment, or who experienc ed a DLT in 
Cycle  1 or Cycle 2.  
• PK-evaluable Population: all patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_519878] 
had adequate PK assessments drawn for determination of the  FPA144 concentration.  
Adequacy will be determined on a case-by- case basis and will be assessed prior to analysis of 
the blood samples.  
• Intent- to-treat (ITT) Population: all randomized patients (Phase 2).  
• Efficacy -evaluable Population: all patients who met eligibility criteria, received at least 
1 dose of study treatment (FPA144 + mFOLFOX6  or placebo + mFOLFOX6 ), and have at 
least 1  postbaseline disease assessment and no major protocol deviation that could introduce 
bias in any efficacy assessment.  
7.2 General Considerations  
The total enrollment planned for this study is approximately  167 patients .  12 patients evaluable 
for DLT were  enrolled into Phase 1. 
For Phase 2, efficacy and tolerability will be examined by [CONTACT_412342] 
155 patients with FGFR2 -selected GC, randomized 1:1 to receive FPA144 + mFOLFOX6 or 
placebo + mFOLFOX6 .  Eligible patients will be stratified acc ording to geographic region, prior 
treatment status (de novo versus adjuvant/neo-adjuvant), and administration of a single dose of 
mFOLFOX6  prior to enrollment (yes or no). 
7.[ADDRESS_519879] ratio (HR) of PFS for FPA144 + mF OLFOX6 
compared with placebo + mFOLFOX6. It is planned to observe 84 PFS events in order to 
achieve 71% power to detect an HR of 0.67 for PFS, at the 1-sided alpha of 0.1. Assuming an 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 100 of 139 Confidential  exponential distribution, this corresponds approximately to an 50% increase in median PFS (e.g. 
from 5 months to 7.5 months).  S tatistical significance (at 1 -sided alpha of 0.1) for PFS will 
occur with an observed HR=0.756, corresponding approximately to a 32.3% increase in observed median PFS (e.g. from 5 months to 6.6 months ). 
One hundred fifty- five patients have been randomized (1:1) during 13 months of accrual. It is 
projected to observe 84 PFS events with approximately 11 additional months of follow-up. 
There is no planned interim analysis for this study.  
Statistical signi ficance for PFS will occur with an estimated HR= 0. 756 a t the final analysis , 
corresponding approximately to an increase of 32.3% in median  progression- free survival of 
from 5 months to 6.61 months.  
Approximately 155 patients will be randomized (1:1) during 13 months of accrual, with 
approximately 12 additiona l months of follow-up in order to achieve the targeted number of 
primary events with 1 5% dropout. 
Power and sample size estimates were estimated using EAST
®(V6.4). 
7.4 Efficacy Analyses  
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In Phase 2, the primary efficacy an alysis  is the comparison of PFS in patients treated with 
FPA144  + mFOLFOX6  versus placebo + mFOLFOX6 .  
The primary endpoint, PFS , is defined as time from randomization  until the date of radiological 
disease progression based on investigator assessment (usi ng RECIST v1.1) or death from any 
cause, whichever comes first .  A clinical deterioration determined by [CONTACT_412343] a progression event. Data will be censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment for subjects:  
• who do not have documented progression or die, or 
• who start new anticancer therapy before documented progression or death without documented progression, or 
• who have ≥ [ADDRESS_519880].  The stratification factors will be the same used to stratify the 
randomization schedule as documented in the interactive voice and w eb response system (IXRS).  
The median PFS and t he associated 95% CI for each treatment arm will be estimated using the 
Kaplan -Meier method .  The hazard ratio (HR= λ FPA144+ mFOLFOX6 / λplacebo+mFOLFOX6 ) will be 
estimated using a Cox regression model with treatment group as the only main effect and 
stratifying by [CONTACT_412344]-rank test .  
An unstratified HR will also be presented.  
The detailed sensitivity analyses of PFS based upon different definitions of progression events and censoring rules will be provided in a SAP to address the following: 
• To correct for potential ascertainment bias in follow -up schedules between the 2 treatment 
groups; 
• To evaluate PFS based upon investigator claims: progression events will include investigator 
assessment of disea se progression and initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy 
7.4.[ADDRESS_519881] date that they were known to be alive. Overall survival will be analyzed in the similar manner as for PFS.  
The analysis of ORR will be performed based on the ITT population.  In the analysis of ORR, patients who don’t have any postbaseline adequate tumor assessm ents will be counted as non-
responders.  Formal hypothesis testing of ORR will be performed using the stratified Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test  at a one-sided level of 0.1.  The stratification factors will be the same used 
to stratify the randomization sched ule as documented in the IXRS.  In addition, the analysis of 
ORR will be performed  based on Efficacy -evaluable Population as sensitivity analysis.

The analysis of PROs (assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaires) will be performed 
according to t he EORTC Scoring and Reference Values Manual.  The details of the analyses will 
be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  The respective subscales from the EORTC 
QLQ- C30 will be used to evaluate and compare the time to deterioration in abdominal pain, 
reflux, eating restrictions (premature safety), weight loss, appetite loss, and fatigue between 
treatment arms.  All scores and subscales will be assessed through descriptive summary 
statistics.  
7.5 Safety Analyses 
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Version 20.1 
(MedDRA v 20.1).  The investigator will classify the severity of AEs using the CTCAE v 4.03 in 
Phase 1 and version 5.0 in Phase 2. A treatment- emergent  adverse event (TEAE) is defined as 
any event with an onset date on or after date of first dose of study treatment, or any event present before treatment that worsens after treatment.  Only TEAEs with an onset date prior to [ADDRESS_519883] .  The number and 
percentage of patients who experience abnormal ( ie, outside of reference ranges) and/or 
clinically significant abnormal laboratories  after study treatment  administration will be presented 
for each clinical laboratory me asurement .  For each c linical laboratory measurement, descriptive 
statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent posttreatment scheduled visits.  
Changes from baseline to the posttreatment visits will also be provided .  Descriptive statistics of 
vital signs will also be provided in a similar manner.  In addition, shift from baseline in CTCAE

7.5.1 Safety Analyses in Phase 1 
Safety analyses wil l be performed for patients included in the safety population.  The incidence 
of DLTs, incidence of TEAEs, clinical laboratory abnormality (eg , shift table), vital signs, 
corneal and retinal findings, and ECGs will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_15994].  Additionally, incidence of TEAEs leading to dosing reduction or dose discontinuation will be tabulated and summarized   
7.5.2 Safety Analyses in Phase 2 
The analyses of safety will include all patients who receive any study treatment  (FPA144 + 
mFOLFOX6, or placebo + mFOLFOX6) throughout the study and provide any posttreatment 
safety information .  The incidence of TEAEs, clinical laboratory abnormality ( eg, shift table), 
vital signs, corneal and retinal findings, and ECGs will be tabulated and sum marized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
No formal comparisons of safety endpoints are planned. 
7.6 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
PK blood samples will be collected to measure the concentration of FPA144 in serum. Immunogenicity blood samples will be collected to measure the level of anti-FPA144 antibodies 
in serum. Samples for PK and immunogenicity assessment will be drawn from each patient at the time points outlined in Appendix 6 (for Phase 1) and Appendix 7 (for Phase 2).  These samples 
will be collected and processed according to the instructions provided in a separate Laborator y 
Manual.  
Individual and mean (± SD) serum FPA144 concentration-time data will be tabulated and plotted by [CONTACT_15994] .  FPA144 PK parameters will be estimated from the serum FPA144  concentration -
time data from Phase 1 using a non -compartmental analysis met hod with IV infusion input.  
Alternative methods may be considered.  The C
max and C trough of FPA144 will be estimated  from 
the serum concentration -time data for Phase 2.  The time to achieve steady state, dose linearity , 
and accumulation  ratio will be evaluated as data allow .  Estimated individual and mean (± SD) 
PK parameters will be tabulated and summarized by [CONTACT_2715] l evel.  Other descriptive statistics 
might be reported for serum FPA144 concentration- time data and estimated PK parameters.  
The impact of immunogenicity on FPA144 exposure will be assessed , tabulated, and summarized 
by [CONTACT_412345].

The investigator or study center must inform study patient s that their personal study -related data 
will be use d by [CONTACT_412347].  In addition, each patient  must be informed that his/her medical 
records may be examined by [CONTACT_412348], by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC members of the study center, and by [CONTACT_91061].  
The Sponsor (or designee) may conduct a site visit prior to study initiation at a site to verify the qualifications of each i nvestigator, inspect the site facilities, and inform the investigator of 
investigator’s responsibilities for ensuring study compliance and procedures for preparing and maintaining adequate and correct eCRFs.  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 106 of 139 Confidential  8.3 Electronic Case Report Forms and Source Documen tation  
All data obtained during this study should be entered in  the eCRFs promptly .  All source 
documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the patient’s medical 
records.  eCRF fields for which source documents will typi[INVESTIGATOR_412277] d include laboratory 
assessments,  physical examination reports, nursing notes, ECG recordings, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
CT scans, and/or MRI)  reports.  
The eCRFs for each patient will be checked against source documents at the study site by [CONTACT_25007].  
Instances of missing or uninterpreta ble data will be discussed with the investigator  for resolution.  
8.4 Access to Source Data  
During the study, a monitor will perform routine site visits to review protocol compliance, compare eCRFs and individual patient’s medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation .  The review of medical records will be performed in 
a manner to e nsure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
In accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP ) guidelines, the i nvestigator  must ensure 
provision of sufficient time, reasonable space, and adequate qualified personnel for the monitoring visits .  The  purpose of the visits is verifying adherence to the study protocol and t he 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data entered on the eCRF and other documents.  Moreover, regulatory authorities, IRBs, IECs, and/or the Sponsor’s Quality Assurance group may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or on -site audit inspe ctions.  Direct access to 
source data will be required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality .  The investigator must assure that 
the Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designee will receive the necessary support to complete these activities.  
All participating centers should take particular care in ensuring that original imaging source data (e.g., CT imag es, MRI images, echo images, etc.) are maintained and accessible for moni toring, 
and that these original source data are then archived on a long- term basis in compliance with 
ICH GCP Section 8.  These images must be stored in a secure location until the Sp onsor or 
Sponsor’s designee authorizes their destruction and must be retr ievable by [CONTACT_412349]. 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021  
 P age 107 of 139 Confidential  8.5 Data Processing  
The Data Management Plan, to be developed during the initiation phase of the study, will include 
specificatio ns for consistency and plausibility checks on data and will also include data -handling 
rules for obvious data errors.  All processes for data processing and query handling will be described in the Data Management Plan.  
8.6 Archiving Study Records  
Each study site will maintain a study file, which should contain, at minimum, the IB, the protocol 
and any amendments, the protocol for tissue sampling, drug accountability records, correspondence with the IEC/IRB and the Sponsor (or designee), and other study- related 
documents. 
The investigator agrees to keep records and those documents th at include (but are not limited to) 
the identification of all participating patients, medical records, study -specific source documents, 
source worksheets, all original signed and dated ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], query responses, and 
detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or audits from regulatory authorities and the Sponsor or its designees.  
The investigator shall retain records required to be maintained for a period of [ADDRESS_519886] 5 years after the investigation is discontinued.  
However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_8146](s) or if needed by [CONTACT_1034]. In addition, the i nvestigator  must make 
provision for the patients’ medical records to be kept for the same period of time.  
No data should be destroyed without the agreement of the Sponsor.  Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the Sp onsor must 
be notified in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location, as applicable.  
Patients’ medical records and other original data will be archived in accordance with the 
archiving regulations or facilities of the investigational site.  
8.7 Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this study protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and investigator abide by [CONTACT_412350] (1989).  The study also will be carried out in compliance w ith local legal requirements.  
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519887] be approved along 
with the study protocol by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and be acceptable to the Sponsor before any patient is 
enrolled on the study.  W ritten informed con sent will be obtained from each patient according to 
applicable regulatory and legal requirements .  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_412278] ’s study center file, unless otherwise 
agreed  by [CONTACT_412351] c enter .  The  investigator will not un dertake any investigation 
specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  The terms 
of the consent and when it was obtained must be documented in the source documents and in the eCRF.  
If a protocol amendment is req uired, the ICFs may need to be revised to reflect the changes to 
the protocol .  If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_19821]/IEC 
and the revised version signe d by [CONTACT_412352].  
8.9 Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, in acc ordance with local legal requirements .  The Sponsor, Sponsor’s agents, 
and investigator must ensure that all ethical and legal  requirements have been met before the first 
patient is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly .  To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC approval prior to 
implementation (if appropriate).  Following approval, the protocol amendment will be submitted to the IND application under which the study is being conducted. 
8.[ADDRESS_519888] a CRC consisting of representatives from the 
Sponsor, the Medical Monitors  and 1 or more investigator s from  actively participating sites. 
The CRC will assess the safety of the dose escalation ( Phase 1) on a regular basis.  All dose 
escalation decisions will be based on assessment of DLTs, overall safety and tolerability , and 
will be made after the last patient enrol led in each cohort has completed the first 2 treatment 
cycles.  In addition, when selecting the dose(s) to be developed further, consideration will be made of toxicities observed both during and beyond the DLT  evaluation period and assessment 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519889] a DMC  that will operate independently from the Sponsor and the clinical 
investigators.  T he primary responsibilities of the DMC are to review the accumulating safety 
data from the Phase 2 study on a regular and ad hoc basis.  In addition, the DMC will  review the 
unblinded results of the OS interim analysis along with safety data to balance risk and benefit, 
and make recommendations to the Sponsor based on the data totality.  Safety data from the 
Phase 2 study will be provided at regular intervals to the DMC in the form of unblinded 
summary reports and/or data listings from an independent statistical center designated by [CONTACT_429]. 
The first meeting of the DMC is planned to occur after a minimum number of patients 
(ie, 50 patients) have had the opportunity to complete a cycle of study treatment.  Subsequent 
meetings are planned to occur periodically  (eg, quarterly) and ad hoc at the request of the DMC 
members or the Sponsor .  Details regarding DMC membership, schedule and format of meetings, 
format for presentation of data, access to interim data, method and timing of providing interim 
reports to the DMC, and other issues relevant to committee operations will be described in the DMC charter.  
8.[ADDRESS_519890] to patients if the study continues, the study may be terminated. The study may also be terminated early at the Sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a 
finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination  includ e, but are not limited to:  
• Discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in the 
study 
• Failure to enroll patients at an acceptable rate  
• Decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the drug 
8.12 Confidentiality  
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The investigator  and 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the Sponsor. 
FPA144 -[ADDRESS_519891] be maintained .  Patients will be identified on 
eCRFs and other documents submitted to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee by [CONTACT_412353], initials, and/or birth date .  Study patients are not to be identified by [CONTACT_2300], and any 
informa tion sent to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee should have patient identifiers redacted 
and replaced with patient numbers.  Documents that include the name [CONTACT_73150] (e.g., the 
signed informed consent) must be maintained in confidence by [CONTACT_1188].  The investigator 
will take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_145447].  
8.13 Other Ethical and Regulatory Issues  
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individual case report or review of aggregate data, then the Sponsor will issue prompt notification to applicable regulatory authorities and investigator s.  Investigators will then notify local IRB/IECs as deemed 
appropriate based  on individual IRB/IEC policy. 
A significant safety issue is one that has a significant impact on the course of the clinical trial or program (including the potential for suspension of the trial program or amendments to protocols) or warrants immediate update of informed consent.

 graded). 
Selection of dyes: 
A list dyes and filters can be found in the original paper. 
With fluorescein, staining must be graded as quickly as 
possible after instillation, since the dye then diffuses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_412279]. 
Staining after rose bengal or lissamine green, persists at high 
contrast and may therefore be observed for a considerable 
period. This is convenient for both grading and photography. 
Fluorescein sodium 
1. Quantified drop instillation 
eg 2 µI of 2 % sterile fluorescein instilled into each 
conjunctiva! sac with a micro-pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462] (using a sterile tip). In 
very dry eye, larger volumes risk the possibility of 
inadequate dilution into the fluorescent range. 
2. Unquantified instillation -impregnated paper strips 
This is a convenient approach in the clinic using the 
following method of application: 
• A single drop of unit dose saline is instilled onto a 
fl uorescein-impregnated strip. 
• When the drop has saturated the impregnated tip, the 
excess is shaken into a waste bin with a sharp flick. 
• The right lower lid is then pulled down and the strip 
is tapped onto the lower tarsal conjunctiva. A 
similar procedure is carried out on the left. 
If too large a volume is delivered then the concentration in 
the tear film will be too high, and the tear film and staining 
pattern will be non-fluorescent. 
3.Timing 
The fluorescein break -up time (FBUT) is usually performed 
prior to grading. Since fluorescein diffuses rapi[INVESTIGATOR_310957], punctate staining blurs after a short period. It is 
therefore essential to assess staining rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] , in sequence, in 
the right and then the left eye, so that the staining patterns 
observed are equally crisp. 
If it is intended to photograph the staining pattern for 
grading , then photography should follow immediately after 
each instillation. 
Exciter and Barrier Filters 
The absorption peak of fluorescein sodium occurs between 
465 -490 nm and the emission peak between 520 -530 nm 
A suggested filter pair for detection of fluorescein staining is 
a yellow, Kodak Wratten 12 barrier filter (transmitting above 
495 nm) or an orange Wratten 15 filter (transmitting above 
510 nm) in combination with a blue Wratten 4 7 or 4 7 A 
exciter filter. The 4 7 A shows greater transmittance than the 
Wratten 47 over the absorption range. The 'cobalt' filter of 
many slit-lamps is suitable to use with a Wratten 12 or 15 
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 4  10 Mar 2021

                   banier. 
Where more light is required for photograph ic purposes , 
narrow band-pass, inte1ference filters can be used. 
The use of both exciter and banier filters allows both the 
cornea and conjunctiva to be assessed using a single stain. 
This is a major advantage in clinical trials where it is 
otherwise customary to employ fluoresce in to grade corneal 
staining and rose bengal or lissamine green t.o grade 
conjuncti val staining. 
Disadvantage s of Fluorescein Staining 
Blurred pattern if reading is delayed. Delay in photographing 
fluorescein staining results in blw-red images of the staining 
pattern. 
Rose Bengal 
The intensity of rose bengal staining is dose dependent. If 
drop size or concentration is reduced to minimize stinging , 
the amount of staining is also reduced. Use of impregnated 
sllips will give weaker staining than use of a full drop o f 1 % 
solution . Best results are achieved with, eg. 25 ~ti I%, 
instilled into the conjunctiva ! sac. Because rose bengal stings , 
instillation is best precede d by a topi[INVESTIGATOR_412280]. 
Instillation Technique 
I) eg. A drop of Proxymelaca ine is in s tilled into the 
conjunctiva\ sac followed, after recove,y , by; 
2) A drop of rose bengal 1.0%. This is instilled onto the 
upper bulbar conjunctiva with the upper lid retracted and 
the patient looking down . 
3) Since both anaesthetic and drop may stimulate reflex 
tearing , the test should follow measurement of the FB UT 
and of the Schirmer test. (Conjunctiva! staining due to 
insertion of the Schirmer paper can usually be 
distinguished from that due lo dry eye disease ). 
Both eyes may be stained prior to grading, since U,ere is no 
1isk of the staining pattern in the first eye being obscured by 
[CONTACT_412360] . 
The cited paper gives advice about avoidance of overspi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. 
Visibility 
Rose bengal staining on the conjunctiva shows up well 
against the sclera and may be enhanced using a red-free 
(green ) light. source. Cornea l staining may show up well 
against a blue iris, but is diffic ult to see against a dark brown 
iris. 
Phototoxicity

heavy staining . This post-instillation pain can be minimised

 P age 138 of 139 Confidential  APPENDIX 9:  FLUORESCEIN STAIN GRADING SYSTEMS  (CONTD)  
 by [CONTACT_412362]. 
Lissamine green stains the eye in a similar manner to rose 
bengal but is as well tolerated as fluore scein. Visibility and 
dose-dependenc y are the same as rose bengal and staining is 
persistan t so that photograph y need not be pe rformed 
imme diate ly after instillation. 
Lissamine green is available as impre gnated strips or may be 
ordered as a pre-pr epared solution. A 25 µI 1 % drop will give 
more inten se staining. Because the drop is well tolerated , no 
anaesthetic is required. 
Visibility 
As with rose bengal, lissamine green staining is easily visible 
on the conjunctiva . On the cornea , stainin g is seen well 
against a light blue iris background but is poorl y visible 
again st a dark brown iris background. For both rose bengal 
and lissamine green, because the dyes are poorly seen within 
the tear film, the dye in the t ear film does not obscure the 
staining pattern. Also , since both dyes do not diffuse into the 
substantia propria of the conjuncti va, the staining pattern is 
retain ed for longer. 
Visibility of staining may be enhanced using a white light 
source and a red barrier filter, to give a black pattern on a red 
ground. A suitable filter is a Hoya 25A, or a Kodak Wratten 
92.

•The Phase 3 statistical design assumed incidence of FGFR2b
positivity in front -line gastric cancer to be ~10%.   Over the conduct
of the study, the true incidence has been 30%.
•Two methods of testing for FGFR2b status were utilized to captureeligible patients: IHC and ctDNA.   Although the expectation was
that majority of positive tumors would be identified by [CONTACT_412363] ,
the vast majority of tumors have been identified by [CONTACT_412288],
resulting in  a question of adequate study power.

in Section 3.2.5. This change was previously communicated in a Protocol Clarification Memo dated 30 April 2018.  
Protocol Sec tion  
[IP_ADDRESS]  If there is a change in body weight of >10% compared 
to baseline or to the weight at the time of the most 
recent dose, doses should be recalculated. The dose of 
mFOLFOX6 is based on body weight at C1D1 and should be recalculated only if the weight changes > 10% from the C1D1 weight. If the dose is 
recalculated due to a >10% weight change from 
C1D1, the weight used for the recalculated dose 
should function as the new baseline for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations  Clarified when and h ow dose recalculations for mFOLFOX6 should be 
performed to be consistent with general consensus in the weight -based 
administration of cancer therapy.

Protocol Section  Change  Rationale  
Protocol Section [IP_ADDRESS]  In the event that  oxaliplatin administration is 
discontinued for any reason prior to disease progression, 
5-FU/leucovorin therapy may continue on an every 2 -
week schedule until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or other cause for study withdrawal. In the case 
5-FU/leucovorin therapy is permanently discontinued 
then oxaliplatin must be discontinued.  
Patients who require chemotherapy dose reductions will 
receive the reduced dose for the remainder of the study. The only exception to this practice will be in the case of 
nausea/ vomiting. If nausea and/or vomiting occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_412283], the chemotherapy dose 
should be reduced by 25% for the next dose. If tolerated, 
an increase back to a 100% dose may be allowed at the investigator’s discretion. Any patient w ho required [ADDRESS_519919] the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. The decision and ability 
to unblind the treatment code in emergency situations resides with the investigator.   To specify that the investigator has th e prerogative and ability to break the 
treatment code in the case of a medical emergency without a requirement to contact [CONTACT_1152].  
FPA144 -004 Clinical Protocol  Amendment 2  19 November 2018  
Five Prime Therapeutics  7 of 11 Confidential   
Protocol Section  Change  Rationale  
Protocol Section 6.3.2  Step 1: Patients will sign a Pre-Screening ICF  provide 
informed consent to allow testing for FGFR2b 
overexpression by [CONTACT_412334] a blood sample for FGFR2 amplification by [CONTACT_412316]. The time between signing the Pre -Screening ICF (for 
enrollment/participation)  informed consent  and site 
notification of the result of the test is considered the pre -
screening period (refer to Section 3.3).  Language has been clarified to avoid inconsistency as applies to informed 
consent process introduced by [CONTACT_99439]/or site requ irements. Informed 
consent framework for pre -screening and screening is unchanged.  
 
Protocol Section 6.6.2  After Cycle 1, the FPA144 dose will be recalculated at 
each infusion visit only if the patient’s weight has 
changed > 10% from either C1D1 or from t he time of 
the most recent dose of FPA144, whichever change in 
dose is greater. 
The dose of FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 is based on body weight at C1D1 and should be recalculated only if the weight changes >  10% from the C1D1 weight. 
If the dose is recalculated due to a > 10% weight change from C1D1, the weight used for the 
recalculated dose should function as the new baseline 
for subsequent evaluation of dose recalculations.   Clarified when and how dose recalculations for FPA144 and mFOLFOX6 
should be performed to be consistent with general consensus in the weight -
based administration of cancer therapy.  
 
Protocol Section 6.6.3  During Phase 3, comprehensive ophthalmologic 
examinations will be conducted at Screening, at 8  weeks 
from C1D1 ( ± 7 14 days) , at the EOT visit ( ± 7 days ), 
and at any time there are ophthalmologic symptoms up to [ADDRESS_519920] dose of FPA144.  Revised the allowable window for comprehensive ophthalmologic exams at 
8 weeks from C1D1 to ± 7 days.

Five Prime Therapeutics  8 of 11 Confidential   
Protocol Section  Change  Rationale  
Protocol Section 6.8, 
Appendix 2, Appendix 3, and 
Appendix 4 Urinalysis i ncludes dipstick for  protein, glucose, blood, 
pH, and ketones on Day 1 for both FPA144 and 
mFOLFOX6  of odd cycles (every other cycle). If 
dipstick findings are clinically significant,  2+ or 
greater , then a microscopic evaluation will be performed 
to assess the abnormal findings  per institutional 
standard. Removed requirement of dipstick use as long as analyte testing is 
performed per institutional standard.  
Protocol Section 6.18  Added language for reporting of corneal and all retinal 
events to this section of the protocol referring to end of 
treatment procedures.   To align with language already included in Section 6.17.1.  
Protocol Section 7.1  Intent -to-treat (ITT) Population: all randomized patients 
(Phase 3). The final analysis of efficacy outcomes will 
be conducted in the ITT population.  Simplified language on  the definition of ITT population. Second sentence 
is redundant to information already contained in statistical analysis section.  
Protocol Section 7.4.[ADDRESS_519921].  As described 
above in Section 7.4.1, there will be 1  planned interim 
analysis and a final analysis for OS; both analyses (the interim and the final) will be event -based analyses. The 
O’Brien -Fleming monitoring boundary will be used to 
preserve the 2.5% false -positive error rate (1 -sided), 
with a Lan -DeMets implementation to allow flexibility 
in the number and timing of the interim analysis. The 
hypothesis of OS will be tested at α1=0.01 (1- sided) at 
the interim, and α2=0.022 (1- sided) at final.  This information  will be contained more appropriately in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).

Five Prime Therapeutics  9 of 11 Confidential   
Protocol Section  Change  Rationale  
Protocol Section 7.4.3  If the testing for OS is significant, PFS will be tested 
further. This analysis will be based on 350  PFS events. 
Statistical significance for PFS at 1 -sided p=0.025 will 
occur with an estimated HR=0.81, corresponding 
approximately to an improvement of 23.4% in median 
PFS from [ADDRESS_519922]. 
The stratification factors will be the same used to 
stratify the randomization schedule as documented in 
the IXRS.  
The PFS analysis will be event -driven analysis and 
conducted based on the ITT principle, in which the final 
analysis of PFS will i nclude only radiographic 
progression events as determined by [CONTACT_093]’s 
assessment per RECIST v1.1 and deaths. A clinical 
deterioration determined by [CONTACT_412343] a progression event in the final analysis .  Clarified la nguage with regards to secondary endpoint of PFS such that 
language is consistent with prior regulatory feedback.  
Protocol Section 7.4.3  Included additional details for ORR analysis.  
In addition, the analysis of ORR will be performed 
based on Efficacy -evaluable Population as sensitivity 
analysis.  Specified that a sensitivity analysis will be performed for the secondary 
endpoint of ORR by [CONTACT_412364] -evaluable 
population.  
Protocol Section 7.5  Included language around capturing treatment emergent 
adverse events beyond an onset date of +[ADDRESS_519923] dose.  This language was previously in the Protocol Synopsis and has been moved 
to this section for clarity and ease of reference.  
Protocol Sec tion 8.2  Added Section 8.2 on Data Protection.  Added language to address privacy and data protection.

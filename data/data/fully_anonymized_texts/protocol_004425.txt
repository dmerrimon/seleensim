Objective:
 
Retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) are significant sources of vision loss, affecting mostly 
healthy people over 55 years of age. The common source of vision loss is the macular edema 
accompanying 
the retinal injury. Very recently, studies employing monthly an
ti
-
vascular 
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments have demonstrated a benefit to this line of treatment; 
however, the duration of effectiveness appears to be short lived and the length of time needed for 
these monthly injections remains unknown. 
A hi
stologic study of human retinas with 
RVO
s found 
the presence of activated microglia.
 
Microglia are capable of migrating through the retina to sites 
of inflammation to associate closely with neurons and the vasculature, and are key cellular players 
in the m
ediation
 
of processes of chronic inflammation. For these reasons, microglia represent a 
promising cellular target for forms of therapy that limit the deleterious inflammatory changes 
found in vein occlusions. Minocycline, a second
-
generation tetracycline, 
has been shown to exhibit 
anti
-
inflammatory properties, including microglial inhibition. The objective of this study is to 
investigate the safety and potential efficacy of minocycline as a microglia inhibitor in participants 
with central
 
retinal vein occlu
sion (CRVO).
 
Study Population:
 
A minimum of 
10
 
and a maximum of 
20 participants who meet the eligibility 
criteria may be enrolled. 
Eligibility criteria include: foveal center
-
involved macular edema 
secondary to a CRVO, retinal thickness in the 
central subfield >
 
350 microns as measured by 
[CONTACT_7349] (OCT); and visual acuity (VA) between 20/
32 and 20/200 in the 
study eye.
 
Design:
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], double
-
masked, randomized 
multi
-
center study
, participants will receive 
monthly bevac
izumab injections for the first three months, followed by [CONTACT_214605]. In addition, 
participants will take an oral dose of [ADDRESS_257831] testing to measure retinal thickness. A
t the 
Month 3 visit and thereafter, participants will be 
evaluated for “improvement” and “worsening” and will be eligible for additional bevacizumab 
treatment and/or investigational product 
(
IP) 
depending on which criteria they fulfill. 
 
Additionally, at Month 12, participants will also be evaluated for “no improvement.”

Outcome Measures:
 
The primary outcome is the difference in mean change in best
-
corrected 
visual acuity (BCVA), as measured
 
in ETDRS letters, between the minocycline and placebo 
groups in the study eye at [ADDRESS_257832] at 
6, 12, 18 and 24 months compared to baseline, number of participants improving 
≥ [ADDRESS_257833] scale 
step at 12 and 24 months compared to baseline, as well as and changes in fluid leakage in the 
macula as demonstrated by [CONTACT_214606] 12 and
 
24 months compared to baseline. 
Safety outcomes include the number of participant withdrawals, number and severity of systemic 
and ocular toxicities and the number of adverse events
 
(AEs)

Central Retinal Vein 
Occlusions
 
Retinal vein occlusions are a significant source of vision loss, affecting mostly healthy people over 
55 years of age. The common source of vision loss is the macular edema accompanying 
the retinal 
injury. The two main types of retinal vein occl
usions are central retinal vein occlusions (CRVO) 
and 
branch
 
retinal vein occlusions (BRVO). 
The pre
valence of CRVO is approximately 0.1%.
1,[ADDRESS_257834] not been 
successfully proven in a large randomized clinical trial. Very recently the Cent
ral Retinal Vein 
OcclUsIon Study: Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety (CRUISE), a phase III multicenter trial, 
reported 
six
-
month outcome results demonstrating efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab injections 
for the treatment of CRVO.
3
 
The CRUISE study, while encouraging, only has 
six
-
month r
esults 
published and requires monthly intravitreal injections with no clear treatment endpoint. 
Ranibizumab has very recently gained FDA approval for the indication of vein occlusions and the 
labeling includes recommendations for monthly intravitreal injec
tions
.
 
The fundamental cause of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusions is not understood 
completely, but it is increasingly clear that its pathophysiology extends beyond microvascular 
disease to involve immune mediators in the retina. While 
hydrostatic stress following the 
 
break
-
down of the blood
-
retinal barrier (BRB) can partly contribute to retinal edema, tissue 
responses to hypoxia are also likely to play a role. In the aftermath of a retinal vein occlusion, 
tissue hypoxia induces the exp
ression of several cytokines, including monocyte chemoattractant 
protein (MCP
-
1), leading to the activation of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and 
microglia, which are then attracted to the hypoxic retinal areas.

A study on 
patients with BRVO examined the concentrations of VEGF and interleukin

n the aqueous 
humor and found that these cytokine levels were increased in the setting of retinal vein occlusion.

Further, a histologic study of human r

Microglia function has been investigated in a diabetic 
animal model where diabetes was induced in rats with the inj
ection of streptozotocin (STZ).
 
Animal models of diabetes have indicated a role of microglia activation in diabetic retinopathy. 
 
In a
 
histologic study of microglia in eyes with diabetic retinopathy,
 
Zeng et al. reported that 
microglia increase in number and exhibit hypertrophic features
 
as well as an up

markers in diseased states and marked microglia surrounding the retinal vasculature, labeled 
“microglia perivasculitis” in further stages of disease.

Minocycline
 
Minocycline is a second

Minocycline is used widely and has been shown 
to be well tolerated when used at the

reported between 1998 and 2003, and the number of prescriptions for minocycline, the rate of AEs 
has been reported as 72 A
Es per million prescriptions averaging to 
13 per million per year.

microglia agent include a large clinical trial of 
 
152 patients wit

five
 
days had 
a significantly better neurological outcome compared with placebo.
27
 
Other ongoing clinical 
studies include the use of minocycline to decrease symptom progression in Huntington’s disease 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and to provide neuroprotective effects in Parkinson’s disease (NCT0006319
3) 
and in ALS ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
 
A current clinical trial, conducted by [CONTACT_214610], is commencing 
recruitment to examine the effects of a related tetracycline, doxycycline, in its ability to slow the 
deterioration or improve ret
inal function and/or induce regression, or slow progression, of diabetic 
retinopathy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

e
ligibility. The participant must have 
an active signed consent for one of the above mentioned protocols on file for baseline examinations 
to occur. Baseline examinations will be performed as outlined in Appendix 2. Laboratory measures 
may be performed with
in 42 days of enrollment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), color 
fundus photography and 
fluorescein angiography 
may be performed within seven days of the 
baseline visit. All other baseline examinations must occur on the day the participant reviews and 
s
igns this protocol’s consent form, unless specified in Appendix 2. Treatment with the 
IP
 
(minocycline or placebo) cannot occur until the participant has reviewed and signed this protocol’s 
consent form.
 
Potential participants from the BRC sites will be screened under this study protocol. 
 
The participant must have signed this protocols consent form for any study examinations to occur. 
For the BRC sites, it
 
is expected that 
the baseline examinations
 
can be
 
completed in one clinic visit 
over one day. 
If the baseline
 
examinations cannot be performed in one clinic visit over one day, it

September 19, [ADDRESS_257849] be 
confirmed before a participant is randomized. 
P
articipants will be 
randomized to one of two groups with equal probability of equal numbers of participants in each 
group: minocycline or placebo. 
Participants must continue to receive the same treatment regim
en 
to which they were assigned for the duration of the study.
 
All clinic staff and participants will be masked to group assignments. Only designated pharmacy 
personnel, select individuals at the 
Emmes
 
Corporation, and the NEI Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) will have access to the group assignments.

an assessment of safety variables. A complete ophthalmologic examination will be performed at 
each visi
t to measure outcome variables.
 
During each clinic visit, 
participants will have their visual acuity measured and will undergo OCT 
testing to measure 
retinal thickness.
 
For the BRC Sites

The study duration will be
 
approximately
 
24 months. During this period, 
p
articipants will be instructed to take the 
IP
 
(either placebo or minocycline 100 mg capsule) twice 
daily. The primary outcome will be assessed at Month 12, and secondary outcomes will be assessed 
at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. Visits will occur at baseline, and then monthly or as clinically indicated. 
T

Treatment Prior to Month 3
 
At baseline, the particip
ant will receive an injection of 1.25mg bevacizumab, an anti
-
VEGF agent, 
and also start the randomized 
IP
. At Months 1 and 2, the participant will again receive bevacizumab 
injections in the study eye and continue the rando

Treatment Beginning at 
Month 3
 
Visual acuity and macular edema will be evaluated at study visits to determine further treatment. 
Starting at Month 3 and at every visit thereafter, the following scenarios will be considered. 
 
(Also refer to Figure 1.) The participant will be rein
jected with bevacizumab unless the participant 
meets the “improvement,” “worsening
,
”
 
“new steady state”
 
or “no improvement” criteria defined 
in Appendix 
3
.
 
Scenario 1: 
If the participant meets the “improvement” criteria defined in Appendix 
3
, the 
participant will continue to take the 
IP
, but the bevacizumab injection 
will be withheld at that visit.
 
Scenario 2:
 
If the participant meets the “worsening” criteria defined in Appendix 
3
, the participant 
will be offered any therapy available at the 
discretion of the treating investigator, including:
 
a.
 
Anti
-
VEGF Treatment
 
b.
 
Intravitreal or Periocular Steroid Injections
 
Scenario 3:
 
If the participant does not meet the “improvement” or “worsening” criteria, but meets 
the “new steady state” criteria defined 
when the central subfield thickness remains 
≥
 
[ADDRESS_257852] but has not changed > [ADDRESS_257853] three consecutive injections (also defined 
in Appendix 
3
), the treating investigator physician will have the discretion to hold bevacizumab 
inje
ctions until the OCT changes (worsens) by > 25 microns from this “new steady state” level.

Reporting of Expected Events
 
It is anticipated that participants in this study will occasionally miss or fail to complete an assessment, 
procedure or study visit. These omissions will be considered expe
cted events and not protocol 
deviations provided they are infrequent and do not include data needed to assess safety or the primary 
study outcome. 
If such an event is identified, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a report to the IRB within two weeks 
using PTMS.
 
Cumulativ
e proportions of these missed events in the study population will be presented to the IRB 
annually. In addition, these rates will be 
calculated and 
monitored 
biannually 
by [CONTACT_6802].
 
The following are considered deviations:
 

 
An individual misses more 
than 15% of the required study assessments/procedures,
 

 
An individual misses more than 15% of the required study visits,

There are risks associated with the procedures required for participants in this study. 
 
However, these are all standard procedures that are performed as part of a normal eye and medical 
examination. Some of the discomforts associated wit
h the ocular examination include the 
following:
 
1.
 
Dilating drops or anesthetic drops may sting. They can cause an allergic reaction, or if 
contaminated, can cause an infection, but neither of these problems is very likely to occur. 
Dilating drops can also ca
use a sudden increase of pressure (acute glaucoma) in eyes that 
are already predisposed to develop this condition. There is little risk of glaucoma being 
triggered in this way, but if it is, treatment is available. The participant’s intraocular

The fluorescein dye used in fluorescein angiography can make a participant’s skin turn

Due to oral minocycline’s virtually complete absorption, side effects to the lower bowel, 
particularly diarrhea, have been 
infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed 
in patients receiving tetracyclines.
 
Gastrointestinal: 
Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
pancreatitis, inflammatory lesions (with monilial over 
growth) in anogenital region and increases 
in liver enzymes. Rarely, hepatitis and liver failure have been reported. Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients taking the tetracycline

Renal toxicity: 
Elevations in BUN have been reported and are apparently dose related. While this 
is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired 
fu
nction, higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia and 
acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive 
systemic accumulations of the dr
ug and possible liver toxicity.
 
Hypersensitivity reactions: 
Urticaria, angioneurotic edema, polyarthralgia, anaphylaxis, 
anaphylactoid purpura, pericarditis, exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus and rarely 
pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia have been reported. A transient lu
pus

also been reported.
 
Blood: 
Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and eosinophilia have been reported.
 
Central Nervous System: 
Central nervous side effects including light

headedness, dizziness, or 
vertigo have been reported 
with minocycline therapy. Serious neurologic events reported include 
b
ulging fontanels in infants and benign intracranial hypertension (Pseudotumor cerebri) in adults. 
Headache and blurred vision have also been reported.
 
Other: 
When given over prolonged pe
riods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce 
 
brown

black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid glands. Very rare cases of abnormal thyroid 
function have been reported. Thyroid cancer has been reported in the post
-
marketing setting in 
association 
with minocycline products. Decreased hearing has been rarely reported in patients on 
minocycline hydrochloride. Tooth discoloration in children less than eight years of age and also, 
rarely, in adults has been reported. Use is not recommended for individua
ls of either gender 
attempting child conception. There is a risk of impaired spermatogenesis. Because tetracycline can 
reduce the amount of beneficial forms of bacteria in the body, participants will be counseled to 
include probiotics in their diet while p

does not require participant withdrawal from the study. If the participant 
agrees to continue in the study after disco
ntinuing 
IP
, s/he will continue to return for his/her 
subsequent study visits and undergo the required examinations. Otherwise, the participant will exit 
the study and continue his/her ophthalmic care either with an outside ophthalmologist or at the

Pregnancy Monitoring
 
If the staff becomes aware that a female study participant has become pregnant during the study, 
the investigator will advise the part
icipant to stop taking the 
IP
 
immediately. The investigator 
and participant will determine whether to continue any remaining study visits or to exit the study
.
 
If the staff becomes aware that a male study participant has impregnated his partner 
during the 
study, the investigator will remind the participant of the potential r
isks to the unborn fetus.
 
For the NEI site, i
n either case of reported pregnancy, the 
NEI 
participant (and/or partner) will 
be referred to the NIH OB/GYN consultation service 
for evaluation and counseling.

Pregnant or lactating women are not eligible for

One of the known risks of minocycline is that it can cause permanent 
discoloration of the teeth (yellow

the last half of pregnancy. Minocycline also passes into breast milk and can cause permanent 
discoloration of the teeth of a nursing infant. 
Given the known and unknown effects on pregnancy 
outcome
s, two forms 
(one form for BRC sites) 
of contraception will be required for female 
participants of childbearing potential (see Appendix 1 for definition). In addition, female 
participants of childbearing potential will undergo urine pregna

VEGF agent. Additionally, participants who are randomized to minocycline may benefit 
directly from this study, as we hypothesize that minocycline may result in resolution or reduction 
of macular edema or improved visual acuity or need for fewer i

Health (NIMH) Human Subject’s Protection Unit (HSPU) “Elements of Successful Informed 
Consent” training. 
All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their 
comprehens
ion of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study. The participants must 
have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent form, which must be signed prior to 
enrollment. The participants will have an opportunity to carefully revie
w the consent and ask 
questions regarding this study prior to signing and they will be informed that they may withdraw 
from the study at any time without penalty to themselves or benefits lost.
 
If the participant requires the consent to be in larger font i
n order to read it well, this will be 
provided. If participants are visually impaired to the point of being unable to read the consent, they 
can take the consent back with them to read it over with a family member or with the use of 
magnifying devices. If 
the participant chooses, the investigator can also read the consent verbatim 
to the participant and answe
r any questions that may arise.
 
An
 
investigator 
present during the
 
consent 
process 
will document the consent process in the 
participant’s medical recor
d. A signed copy of the informed consent form will be provided to the 
participant to take home.

the participant will be provided with the 
CC Short Written Consent Form for Non

Speaking Research Subjects
 
in the participant’s native language and a verbal explanation of the 
purpose, procedures and risks of the study. The IRB
-
appr
oved English consent form will serve as 
basis for the verbal explanation of the study. The investigator will obtain an interpreter unless the 
investigator is fluent in the prospective participant’s language. Preferably, the interpreter will be 
someone who 
is 
not related to
 
the participant (i.e., not a family member). Interpreters provided by 
[CONTACT_79849]. The interpreters will 
interpret
 
the IRB
-
approved English 
consent form and facilitate discussion between the participant and inves
tigator.
 
The IRB
-
approved English consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_83194] 
a witness to the oral presentation. The CC Short Written Consent Form will be signed by [CONTACT_25955] a witness who observed the presentation of i
nformation. The interpreter may sign 
the consent document as the witness and, in this case, will note “Interpreter” 
with his/her
 
signature. 
If not also serving as the witness, the interpreter will be separately identified on the short form in 
the space pro
vided.
 
A copy of both signed forms 
(the long form serving as the script and the short 
form)
 
will be provided to the participant.
 
The short form process, including the use of an 
interpreter, will be documented in the medical record in accordance with NIH 
policy.
 
A
ll instances of use of the CC Short Written Consent Form will be reported to the IRB at the time 
of annual review. If the CC Short Written Consent Form is used three times or more for the same 
language within an IRB approval period, this will be r
eported to the IRB immediately.
 
Interpreters will also be present for other protocol procedures as necessary.

routine monitoring of study participants’ data. Monitoring visits will occur on a schedule 
depending on the status of the study. More frequent monitoring visits will be performed at the 
beginning of the study whe
n enrollment is open. Monitoring will decrease as enrollment closes 
and as participant follow

informed consent process. In addition, the protocol monitor will review source documentation
 
for 
the data collected throughout the trial to ensure that the data points are collected and reported.

childbearing due to a medical condition 
 
(i.e., participant has previously undergone a hysterectomy) does not need a 
pregnancy test, 
Follicle
-
stimulating Hormone (FSH) test or contraception.
 
If a female participant is considered non
-
childbearing due to menopause, it must be in accordance 
with the CNS IRB/NIH Ob
-
Gyn guidance on the definition of menopause. This guidance d
efines 
menopause as:
 

 
Women over age [ADDRESS_257900] or contraception.
 

 
Women between [ADDRESS_257901] an FSH 
tes
t. If their FSH level is 
≥ 20 mIU/mL, they will be considered menopausal and do not 
need pregnancy testing or contraception. If their FSH level is < 20 mIU/mL, they will need 
pregnancy testing and contraception as required by [CONTACT_760].
 

 
Women between [ADDRESS_257902]. If they are not pregnant and their FSH level is 
≥ 20 mIU/mL, 
they will be considered menopausal and will not require contraception or additional 
pregnancy testi
ng. If their FSH test is < 20 mIU/mL, they will need pregnancy testing and

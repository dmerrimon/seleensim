   1.0 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Introduction and Context  
Tobacco use causes more than 7 million deaths per year worldwide (WHO , 2022 ) and continues to be 
the leading modifiable risk fa ctor for cancer globally (Tran et al ., 2022). In the [LOCATION_002], it remains 
the single largest preventable cause of disease, d isability, and premature death with an estimated life 
expectancy of 10 years shorter than that of a non -smoker . Unfortunately, in the year 2020, 12.5% of 
U.S. adults (30.8 million people) continue to smoke cigarettes (CDC, 2022 Aug) despi[INVESTIGATOR_630304] . While the forms of tobacco use are changing, such as the 
increasing use of e -cigarettes, a [ADDRESS_840730] (CDC , 2020).  
 
Among individuals who currently smoke cigarettes, over 2/3 (68%) have reported a desire to quit (CDC, 
2022 Mar) . In 2018, 55.1% of smokers reported making at least one quit attempt in the past year,  
however, only 7.5% of people who tried to quit succeeded (CDC, 2022 Mar). Overall, those who use 
smoking cessation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as counseling and medications, had a higher succe ss rate than 
those who did not. For example, abstinence rates were 15% in p eople who used assistance versus 7% 
in those who did not at 12 month follow up  (Shu -Hong, 2000) , however , the rate of sustained abstinence 
continues to be low (Babb  et al., 2017). While the proven benefit of both non -pharmacological and 
pharmacological therapy in many patients is encouraging, there is a need for additional treatments.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_840731] year of use, a net benefit remains at 12 months . Specifically, a meta -analysis 
reported an abstinence rate of 20% in people who attempted smoking cessation with medications 
versus 11% without medications at 12 months (Rosen  et al., 2018). Common medications studied 
include nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT) , varenicline, and certain antidepressants. These  
medications have a variety of mechanisms proposed to t reat the associated nicotine dependence of 
cigarette smoking. Varenicline is  classified as a selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist, a pathway 
thought to affect the release of dopamine in the midbrain. A meta -analysis showed varenicline  having a 
two- to threefold increase chance of successful long -term smoking cessation compared with 
pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts (Cahill  et al., 2012). The most common antidepressant 
studied for smoking cessation is bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].  Nortriptyline has also shown to be efficacious, however, 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors have not been shown to be helpful ( Hughes et al ., 2004 ). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_630305]. A Cochrane review showed bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_630306] (Hughes  et al. , 2004 ). NRT replaces the form of nicotine by [CONTACT_630320], showing to be helpfu l when compared to no treatment . A Cochrane review 
reported NRT helps to increase the rate of quitting by 50 -70% (Stead  et al., 2012). When comparing 
these medications , there have been studies showing more participants quitting successfully with 
varenicline  than with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_630307]. There have been a 
small number of studies directly comparing bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_630308] (Hughes  et al., 2004 ). This may suggest that if varen icline is more efficacious than 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], it may also more efficacious than NRT.  
 
Behavioral treatments have also been shown to increase quit rates at 6 months even in the abstinence 
of pharmacotherapy. Specific interventions include, but are not limited to, motivational interviewing, 
CBT, and mindfulness -based therapy. A Cochrane review showed motivational interviewing resulted in 
improved quit rates when compared to brief advice (Lindson -Hawley et al ., 2015) . When looking at 
mindfulness -based therapy, a meta -analysis concluded it did not have a significant improvement in 
abstinence over other behavioral interventions (Maglione  et al., 2017). A  Cochrane review looking at 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, 2023   Page 5 of 22 
  
   various interventions showed benefit with any form of counseling ( Hartmann -Boyce  at al., 2021)  and 
there has been  no current consensus favoring one form of behavioral intervention.  Additionally, when 
combining the results of studies in a meta -analysis, individual counseling compared to minimal 
intervention could increase the chance of quitt ing by 50 -80% ( Lancaster &  Stead, 2017).  
 
It is well established that pharmacotherapy and non -pharmacotherapy can both individually help with 
smoking cessation,  however, combining pharmacotherapy and behavioral support has shown to further 
increase smoking  cessation success ( Patnode et al ., 2021; Stead et al ., 2016; Lancaster &  Stead, 
2017 ). Combined pharmacotherapy and behavioral intervention improved quit rates from an average of 
8.6% in those receiving usual care to 15.2% (Patnode et al ., 2021).  While these interventions can have 
substantial clinical benefit, the rate of people who continue to smoke indicates a need for novel 
treatments.   
 
1.3 Clinical trials for substance use and the rational for treatment with ketamine  
Ketamine has shown early evidence of efficacy in the treatment of multiple types of substance use 
disorders. One study evaluating the adjunctive use of ketamine in heroin use disorder showed that a 
single -session of high -dose (2 mg/kg IM) ketamine demonstr ated one -month abstinence rates of 85% 
compared to 55% abstinence in the low dose group (0.2 mg/kg IM), and one -year abstinence rates of 
24% in the high dose group as compared to 6% in the low -dose control group (Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729] ., 2002) . In 
a fo llow-up study comparing three repeated sessions of ketamine infusions with concurrent 
psychotherapy to single -session treatment, abstinence rates were increased to 50% in the 3 session 
group as compared to the single session rate of 22% (Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729] ., 2007) . Related studies found that 
ketamine is useful as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_25195] & 
Grinenko, 1997)  with one -year complete abstinence rates of 65.8% in the ketamine -assisted 
psychotherapy group compared to 24 % in the control psychotherapy group.  Additionally, m otivational 
enhancement therapy combined with just one ketamine infusion was shown to improve likelihood of 
abstinence from alcohol  when compa red to midazolam  (Dakwar et al ., 2020).  Ketamine has also been 
studied in cocaine use disorder and found to improve levels of motivation to quit using and reduce cocaine 
craving (Dakwar  et al., 2014)  as well as reduce rates of cocaine self -administration by 67% relativ e to 
baseline (Dakwar  et al ., 2017 ). When ketamine was combined with mindfulness -based relapse 
prevention therapy  for cocaine use disorder , it was shown that 48% of subjects who had the addition of 
one ketamine infusion were abstinent after 2 weeks compared to 10% of those who received a m idazolam 
infusion (Dakwar et al ., 2019) . The benefit of ketamine treatment across several different substance use 
disorders as well as the synergistic effect of adding ketamine to various methods of psychotherapy 
suggests there may be an underlying mechanism and therefore a role for ketamine  in the treatment of 
other substance use disorders such as tobacco dependence.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_840732] targeted, 
including both the sensitization of nicotinic receptors in the ventral tegmentum area (VTA) after a period 
of abstinence as well as conditioned stimuli throughout the  day after the nicotinic receptors have been 
desensitized (Fagerström  & Balfour , 2006). The main areas of study have involved the mesocorticolimbic 
dopamine system, specifically the VTA projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Nicotine stimulates 
the mes ocorticolimbic dopamine system via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the VTA causing 
increased firing of dopamine in the NAc (Mahajan  et al. , 2021). However, preclinical studies have also 
shown other critical interactions contributing to nicotine depend ence with influences not only of dopamine 
and acetylcholine but also glutamate and GABA in the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and 
hippocampus (Markou, 2008). There is also another neurobiological pathway thought to be involved in 
aversive proc essing and nicotine withdrawal. This consists of the projection from the medial habenula to 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, [ADDRESS_840733] a role in limiting drug intake ( Fowler  et al. , 2019). Furthermore, tobacco 
smokers have shown to have both structural and functional connectivity changes within the brain. For 
example, smoking can reduce gray matter volume in the orbitofrontal circuit (Li et al. , 2015) and nicotine 
can t emporarily increase fMRI signal in the striato -thala mo-orbitofrontal circuit (Bruijnzeel et al. , 2015 ). 
The underlying mechanisms of these changes are multifactorial and likely involve multiple frontal -cortical 
inhibitory and excitatory balancing systems i nvolved in nicotine dependence. While there has been past 
focus on the development of smoking cessation medications targeting the nicotinic system and 
dopaminergic system, the complexity of nicotine dependence shows there are other potential 
neurobiologica l targets for pharmacologic intervention.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_840734] studies of ketamine in the treatment of other substance use 
disorders ( Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729]., 2002; Krupi[INVESTIGATOR_9729]., 2007; Dakwar  et al., 2014; Dakwar  et al.,  2017) . Given 
these studies, the neurobiological similarity between various substance use disorders (Uhl  et al.,  2019), 
and the potential influences of ketamine on the underlying neurological circuitry (Ezquerra -Romano et 
al., 2018), it would be beneficial to assess the role of ketamine in nicotine dependence. There has been 
one animal study showing reduction of nicotine self -administration in rats given ketamine, suggesting 
there may be an underlying mechanism of ketamine help ful in reducing nicotine use (Rezvani et al. , 
2018), however, there are currently no past studies in humans studying the effects of ketamine on 
smoking cessation.

3.5 Baseline Assessment Procedures  
After completing study informed consent, participants will undergo a comprehensive evaluation to assess 
for inclusion and exclusion criteria.  This will include self -reports and clinician assessments as shown in 
Table 1.  The comprehensive exam will also i nclude a history and physical exam by [CONTACT_9154] (pulse 
oximetry measurements will be a component of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_191272]) and baseline medication 
evaluation for potential harmful interactions.  Urine pregnancy tests will be completed for every wom an 
of childbearing potential  at the initial assessment and prior to each treatment session . Urine drug screens 
will be completed for all participants at the initial assessment  to detect use of recreational psychoactive 
substances other than nicotine . Saliv a cotinine levels will be measured at baseline, prior to each ketamine 
session and at [ADDRESS_840739]’s short and long term smoking -related 
goals will be discussed with the study physician. The study physician will then disinfect the subject’s 
shoulder using an alcohol wipe , and the study physician will then administer the medication by 
[CONTACT_630321]’s deltoid muscle. Only individuals who are properly 
licensed will perform the injection of ketamine. Vital signs will be monitored prior to treatment and post -
treatment.  If during the post -administration observation period, ketamine administration causes an 
increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure >30 mm Hg from baseline, or an increase in pulse rate

evaluate the  effects of the 3  weekly interventions in 2  follow up sessio ns. Participants will return for f ollow -
up assessments 4 and 8  weeks following final medication session. Follow -up visits may be conducted by 
[CONTACT_223938].  If the follow up is done via telehealth, participants will be given their saliva cotinine tests in 
advance either at an in person visit or by [CONTACT_630322].  
 
4.0 INTER VENTAL PRODUCTS   
4.1 Overview of Study Medication  
Ketamine was originally FDA approved in 1970 for pain control in conjunction with general anesthesia  
(Ketalar, 2021 ).  The drug has since been evaluated in academic settings for the treatment of pain and a 
multitude of psychiatric indications.  Ketamine has been increasingly studied in academic settings and 
used off -label in private practice settings over the past 10 yea rs (Wilkinson et al., 2017) .  Ketamine 
undergoes extensive hepatic first pass metabolism, with an oral bioavailability of approximately 16% 
(Mathew et al., 2012) . For induction of anesthesia, doses of 1 to 4.5 mg/kg  IV or 6.5 to 13 mg/kg IM  are 
recommended (Ketalar, 2021 ).   
 
4.[ADDRESS_840742] been shown to be  approximately 100 times the average human 
intravenous dose (Ketalar, 20 21).  Repeated, d aily intravenous in jections have been studied in rats, and 
dogs for as long as 6 weeks with excellent tolerability  (Ketalar, 20 21). Similarly, twice weekly treatments  
in monkeys over a four - to six -week period were well tolerated  (Ketalar, 20 21).  At sub -anesthestic doses 
in human clinical trials  for depression , the most clinically significant physical adverse event from ketamine 
is a transient increase in blood pressure , which was experienced by 29.8% of participants with a mean 
systolic blood pressure increase of 19.6 mmHg (p<0.001) and a mean diastolic blood pressure increase 
of 13.4 mmHg  (p<0.001, (Wan et al., 2015) ).  Small, but statistically significant changes in perception 
(including dereali zation, depersonalization, distortion of time and space, and sense of illusion) were 
categorized as “feeling strange or unreal” and were experienced by 11.7% o f participants . The average 
peak score of 4.5 on the Brief Psychotic Rating Scale is consistent w ith very mild symptom severity (Wan 
et al., 2015) . 
 
4.3 Study Drug, Dose, Mode of Administration  and Justification  
Ketamine is concentrated at a dose of 100 mg/ ml and will be administered by [CONTACT_630323]  0.71mg/kg . The participants will be weight for proper injection dosage at each treatment 
visit. This dose of 0.71mg/kg is  consi stent with previous studies  using intravenous ketamine showing 
improvement in substance use  (Dakwar  et al.,  2020 ; Dakwar  et al.,  2019 ). Recent studies have also shown 
that intramuscular ketamine may be as effective as intravenous ketamine when studied for depression 
and may be more p ractical clinically (Chilukuri et al., 2014; Xu et al ., 2016) . When given intramuscularly, 
ketamine has a peak time of 5 -30 minutes following injection and a bioavailability of 86 -97% (Grant  et al. , 
1981) . Of note, ketamine elimination clearance is high with a half -life of 2 -3 hours and clearance in women 
that is up to 20% higher than men (Mion & Villevieille, 2013) .

   Recruitment will be con ducted through  online (i.e. craigslist) and  flyer advertisements throughout the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630310], for example primary care clinics, relevant pulmonology clinics, 
smoking cessation clinic.  
 
Initial screening eligibility will be conduc ted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_630311].  Subjects with self -
reported current tobacco use will be eligible to complete informed consent and baseline evaluation.  
 
 
6.0 STUDY ENDPOINTS   
6.1 PRIMARY OUTCOMES  
• The primary outcome of this study will be the f easibility  of using ketamine -assisted treatment for 
smoking cessation, which  will assess  the number of people selected for randomization that complete 
the full treatment . This will help determine if the treatment of ketamine in tobacco use would be 
beneficial for further study.  
6.2   SECONDARY OUTCOMES  
• Saliva  cotinine levels will be collected prior to each ketamine session and at each follow up  to 
detect smoking over approximately the past 6 days. Salivary cotinine levels of <15ng/mL have 
been considered as biological verification of non -smoking status ( Benowitz et al., 2020 )  
• Time -line Follow Back (TLFB) (Sobell & Sobell, 1992 ) will be assessed at baseline, each treatment 
session, and at follow -ups. TLFB is a self -report calendar completed retrospectively by [CONTACT_630324] (Sobell and Sobell, 1992). The TLFB yields 
consistently h igh test -retest correlations and correlates well with other self -reports and collateral 
reports. Use of other drugs of abuse, including prescription drugs, will also be assessed using the 
TLFB.    
 
 
6.3   EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES  
Exploratory  outcomes will include changes in characteristics related to cigarette use  including craving for 
cigarettes  (QSU, SASE, WSWS, FTND ) and related areas of psychiatric functioning.  
• Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence  (FTND) : a 6-item questionnaire used to measure  the 
level of dependence of cigarette smokers ( Fagerström  et al. , 2012 ).  
• Questionnaire on Smoking Urges  (QSU) is a multidimensional assessment of smoking craving 
with de monstrated sensitivity t o smoking cessation (Tiffany &  Drobes, 1991). It will be assessed 
at baseline, during interventional visits, and at each follow -up visit.  
• Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale  2 (WSWS 2): measures severity of smoking withdrawal 
and exhibits good validity and reliability in smoking cessation studies (Shiffman et al., 2004; 
Welsch et al., 1999 ; Smith et al., 2021 ). It will be assessed at baseline, during interventional 
visits, and at each fo llow-up visit.  
• Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener  (GAD -7) (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_584714]. , 2006) ): The GAD -7 is a 7 -item 
self-report  instrument that will assess generalized anxiety symptomology. It will be assessed at 
baseline, during interventional visits, and at each follow -up visit.  
• Insomnia Severity Index  (ISI):  found to be a reliable and valid tool to quantify perceived insomnia 
severity and can be useful as an outcome measure in research studies (Bastien, 2001).  
• Mystical Experience Questionnaire  (MEQ). This 30 -item self -report questionnaire was developed 
and validated through factor analysis of retrospective accounts of profound experience with 
psilocybin -containing mushrooms. It includes four factors: transcendence of time and space, 
ineffability, positive mood and mystical (internal unity, external unity , noetic quality, and

   sacredness)  (Barrett  et al. , 2015; Maclean  et al. , 2012) . It will be assessed at baseline, during 
interventional visits, and at each follow -up visit.  
• Five Facets of Mindfulness Questionnaire  (FFMQ ) (Baer et al. , 2006 ): The FFMQ 
assesses five components of mindfulness including observation, non -judgement of 
experience, non -reactivity to inner experience, acting with awareness, and description of 
experience. It will be assessed at baseline, during interventional visits, and at each follow -
up visit.  
• Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA ) (Stephens et al., 2004): The URICA is a 
questionnaire designed to measure stage of change in psychotherapy  with f our scale 
scores derived corresponding to the precontemplation, contemplation, action and 
maintenance stages . It will be assessed at baseline, during interventional visits, and at 
each follow -up visit.  
• Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996 ). A widely used [ADDRESS_840747] completed (or will complete upon hiring) the Miami Collaborative IRB Training 
Initiative (CITI) course and its associated tests in research ethics.  Only the PIs or Co -I’s will obtain 
informed consent.   
 
7.[ADDRESS_840748] reviewed the informed consent 
document, participants will be asked to relay their understanding of key elements re lated to the study 
procedures (i.e. voluntary nature of participation, basic study visit procedures, duration of study, 
anticipated risks and benefits) to ensure their understanding of the study prior to obtaining informed 
consent.  Consent content will be  reviewed as necessary to ensure that subjects have an adequate 
understanding to provide initial and ongoing consent.  The participant’s signed and dated informed 
consent will be obtained before conducting any study tests or procedures that are not related  to their 
routine care.  The Investigator will maintain the original, signed informed consent document.  A copy of 
the signed informed consent document will be given to the participant.  
 
7.4 Capacity of Participants to Give Informed Consent  
No vulnerable p opulations (e.g. children, cognitively impaired individuals, incarcerated individuals, or 
pregnant women) will be included in the study, and informed consent must be obtained directly from the 
participants.   
 
8.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
8.1 Data Analysis Plan  
Baseline demographic characteristics will be collected, and descriptive statistics will be used to 
characterize participants. Data will be collected and managed using the secure REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) database . 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, [ADDRESS_840749] successfully employed in similar previous, as well as ongoing related studies.  
All study  data related to mental health outcomes (i.e., the participant responses to questionnaires) and 
demographics will not have any unique identifying data attached.  There will be only one master list of 
participants (not linked to participant responses).  Thi s list will be kept locked separate from other data 
and will be available only to the PI, her  mentors, and approved study personnel.  All data will be 
confidentially stored (i.e., in locked files  or on encrypted servers) to protect the confidentiality of p articipant 
information. Access to research records (paper and computerized) will be restricted to the project staff, 
and to sponsor audit personnel and MUSC IRB auditors when indicated.  All study personnel have 
completed (or will complete upon hiring) a c ertified program of instruction in the protection of human 
subjects in research, such as the University of Miami CITI course.  These courses in the responsible 
conduct of research and the protection of human subjects will be completed in compliance with MU SC 
regulations.  
 
8.3 Data Quality Control Procedures  
Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_630325].  
 
8.4 Study Documentation and Data H andling  
Any clinical study event that is judged to be an AE will be recorded on the AE form during the course of 
the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or trained Research Assistant will ensure this information is captured during every 
study visit.  Whenever a study partic ipant has reported an AE, the study coordinator will discuss the event 
immediately with the PI (if possible while the study participant is there) who will evaluate the event.  If the 
AE is not serious, the information will be recorded, managed medically as  appropriate, and the event will 
be followed until resolution. SAEs will also be recorded on the AE Form, managed medically as 
appropriate, and the event is followed until resolution.  In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630312] n of SAE. All SAE reports will be sent to the MUSC IRB within 24 hours of learning 
of event occurrence.  
 
AEs/SAEs will be documented and reported as per IRB requirements. Research staff will identify AEs and 
obtain all available information to assess sever ity, seriousness, study relatedness, expectedness, 
outcome and the need for change or discontinuation in the study intervention.  Adverse events will be 
documented on AE Logs and additional relevant AE information, if available, will be documented in a 
progress note in the research record as appropriate to allow monitoring and evaluating of the AE. If the 
AE meets the definition for Serious, appropriate SAE protocol specific reporting forms will be completed 
and disseminated to the appropriate persons and w ithin the designated timeframes as indicated above. 
For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will follow the AE/SAE until resolution, stabilization or until 
the participant is no longer in the study.  When a reportable SAE is identified, the research a ssistant will 
initiate an SAE form, and the following individuals will be notified within 24 hours of the site’s initial 
notification of the SAE:   
1. The PI ([CONTACT_630331] ) will provide oversight, consultation, assessment , and documentation as 
appropriate of the SAE.    
2. The research staff will notify the MUSC IRB, and complete the AE report form in conjunction with 
the PI. Communication with the MUSC IRB is through email, memos, official IRB forms, and online 
reporting.  
 
If complete information is not available when the initial 24 -hour SAE report is disseminated, follow -up 
information will be gathered to enable a complete assessment and outcome of the event.  This information 
may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139257], autops y reports, clinic records, etc.  The research staff will attach 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, [ADDRESS_840750] names will 
remain confidential and all study data related to outcomes (i.e., the participant responses to  
questionnaires) and demographics will not have any unique identifying data attached in any way. There 
will be only one master list of participants (again, not linked to any participant responses) which will be 
kept locked separate from all data and will b e available only to the PI, Co -Is and approved study personnel.  
All data will be stored in a confidential manner (i.e., in locked files or on encrypted computers) to protect 
the confidentiality of participant information. Access to research records (paper  and computerized) will be 
restricted to the project staff.  Access to de -identified study data will be limited to named PI, co -Is and 
MUSC IRB auditors.  
 
8.6 Data Sharing  
The data collected from study participants, including PHI, will be entered into and securely stored in the 
database on a secure server by a member of the research study team.  Electronic data will be stored, 
managed, and analyzed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_630313].  
 
 
9.0 PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS  
Ongoing Clinical Monitoring: The research team will closely monitor for any increase in substance use or 
psychiatric distress at every study intervention  visit. The P I will be responsible for assessing potential 
participants for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and for assessing for adverse effects (AE's) throughout 
the trial. AE's will be collected, documented, and reported. If the AE is not serious, the information will be 
recorded, managed medically as appropriate, and the event will be followed until resolution. Serious 
adverse effects (SAE)  will also be recorded on the AE Form, managed medically as appropriate, and the 
event is followed until resolution.  In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630314]. All SAE reports will be sent to the MUSC IRB within [ADDRESS_840751]'s best interests. Mental health symptoms will be monitored using 
standardized measures at each visit to detect any worsening  symptoms.  Additionally, participants will be 
advised to observe any signs of worsening substance use or psychiatric  symptoms, and to discuss these 
with the research team.  All participants will be informed at the initial visit that they may terminate 
participation at any point.  If a participant experiences distress or other problems between visits, he or she 
will be encouraged to contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Amador  or his/her outpatient mental health provider.  If a participant 
needs or desires immediate attention, arran gements will be made for an appointment with an experienced 
mental health provider.  The informed consent document will provide direction to contact [CONTACT_630326]/or go to the Emergency Room at any time for worsening of symptoms.  In addition, 
participants will have access to urgent care services at MUSC.  If any of the research personnel believes 
that a participant is medically or psychiatrically compromised by [CONTACT_73764], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_630315] : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, [ADDRESS_840752] staff, a national hotline, or 911.  The Mobile Crisis unit of Charleston County, which involves a 
team of police and psychiatric workers, or the EMS unit may be dispatched to the participant’s home to 
assure safety.  The investigative team has a long h istory of ensuring participant safety using similar 
methods in these populations.  
 Pre-Intervention  Assessment: A comprehensive exam will be conducted as part of the baseline 
assessment to minimize risks from study participation.  This will include assessm ent of anxiety severity . 
The comprehensive exam will also include a history and physical exam by [CONTACT_9154] (pulse oximetry 
measurements will be a component of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_191272]), baseline medication evaluation for 
potential harmful interactions , and electrocardiogram  to ensure safe study participation.   
 Peri-Intervention  Monitoring: Subjects will be continuously medically and psychiatrically monitored 
throughout the course of the intervention  and until return to medical and psychiatric baseline.   Subjects 
will be instructed not to eat for at least [ADDRESS_840753] themselves after the interventional visits , and alternative 
transportation will be arranged if needed.  
 
10.0 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
All potential participants will be thoroughly screened for eligibility after completing informed consent.  The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_630316], is felt to be at risk of  harm to themselves or to others, or is otherwise unable to 
complete the study protocol.  Referrals to university and community resources will be made as indicated 
for all participants withdrawn from the study.  The trial will be stopped under any of the f ollowing conditions: 
1) there is clear evidence of harm; 2) there is no likelihood of the intervention demonstrating  benefit, or 3) 
there is overwhelming evidence of the benefit of the intervention . 
 
11.[ADDRESS_840754]  significan t physical adverse event from ketamine is a transient increase in blood pressure, 
which in previous studies was experienced by 29.8% of subjects  with a mean systolic blood pressure 
increase of 19.6 mmHg +/- 12.8 mmHg and a mean diastolic blood pressure increase of 13.4 mmHg +/-  
9.[ADDRESS_840755]-treatment  (Wan et al., 2015) . Participants experiencing clinically significant hypertension ( greater 
than 180 mmHg SBP or greater than 105 mmHg DBP , or greater than 30 mmHg SBP or DBP from 
baseline values ) will be treated with standard of care hypertensives (e.g. clonidine) and monitored until 
symptom resolution.    
 
The most prevalent physical adverse effect was transient sedation and occur s in approximately 16% of 
patients receiving ketamine.  Sedation w ill be monitored via continuous clinical observation during 
interventional sessions.   A medical emergency team will be called for participants that are unable to be 
PROTOCOL TITLE : Ketamine -assisted Motivational Enhancement Therapy for the Treatment of 
Tobacco Use Disorder    
Version Date:  February 28, 2023   Page 17 of 22 
  
   aroused with painful trapezius squeeze or that experience hypoxia (i.e. a pulse oximeter reading of 92% 
or less) , although i n the investigative team’s extensive experience using ketamine clinically for depression 
at these doses, such serious events have never occurred.   Vital signs will be routinely monitored during 
treatment and emergency air way equipment will be immediately available.  Subjects will be monitored 
post-dose by [CONTACT_630327] ( e.g. PI, co -I, or study nurse). Due to transient cognitive 
impairment associated with sedation, participants will not be allowed to drive  themselves following the 
interventions . Subjects who do not have transportation and live within 20 miles will receive compensation 
for taxi, Uber or Lyft transportation to and from medication sessions up to $[ADDRESS_840756] risks associated with intramuscular injections  including  temporary local pain, 
irritation, or redness at the site of the injection.  There is a very small (<1%) risk of infection, muscle 
fibrosis, or persistent muscle or nerve damage at the site of injection.  
 
Other rare risks of ketamine include cystitis which are likely due to repeated use of ketamine. There is 
also a small risk of anaphylaxis.  
 
11.3 Psychological Risks  
Ketamine  commonly causes transient dissociation  (including derealization  and depersonalization) and 
perceptual changes (e.g. distortion of time and space, sense of illusions).  Based on prior studies  these 
effects  occur in 42% of subjects receiving ketamine.  Anxiety occurs  in 15% of subjects receiving 
ketamine.  Psychological  distress will be minimized with pre -treatment relaxation exercises and 
psychological reassurance as needed. In prior trials with ketamine for depression, these measures are 
sufficient to manage dissociation and anxiety in the overwhelming majority of participants.  However, 
standard of care medications for agitation (e.g. benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ) will be available in the e vent that 
participants develop severe anxiety psychological distress unmitigated by [CONTACT_630328] .  Psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_630317], in the unlikely event of severe or 
prolonged psychiatric symptoms (e.g. lasti ng greater than four hours or the business day).  Participants 
may also have emotional distress from answering the questionnaires, although this is mild in the 
investigators’ experience with these instruments.   
 
11.[ADDRESS_840757]  abuse liability.  Ketamine  is classified 
as Schedule III controlled substances (CIII).  While there have been no randomized controlled trials 
evaluating the risk of subsequent illicit or recreational use of ketamine following medical administration 
(either for induction of sedation in conjunction with general anesthesia or in monitored off-label use for 
depression or pain management), in the extensive sub -anesthetic trials of ketamine for depression, there 
have been no published reports of illicit use developi[INVESTIGATOR_630318].  
None of the previous studies  using ketamine in the treatment of substance use disorders reported illicit 
ketamine use following the ketamine interventions  (Jones et al., 2018) .  Animal mod els using intracranial 
self-stimulation have demonstrated that ketamine fails to progress to self -administration, also suggesting 
a lack of abuse liability.  Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) evaluates the overall risks and 
abuse liability of k etamine; in their most recent report, the WHO affirmed that ketamine does not pose a 
global health risk, and again recommended its continued use (WHO, 2016) . Substance use will be 
assessed at each visit throughout the study, and participants will be referred for ongoing care if they 
develop new or worsening substance u se.  If participants report illicit use of ketamine between 
intervention  sessions, they will be withdrawn and referred for substance abuse treatment.

   11.5 Social Risks: Adverse social consequences may arise if the participants’ medical history or 
psychiatric history (including substance use history as well as psychiatric comorbidities) are inadvertently 
communicated to others.   
 
11.6 Legal Risks:  Legal risks may arise if  individuals are homicidal or suicidal and make these intentions 
known to the PI [CONTACT_60551], who may then be required to notify authorities and the target of homicidal 
intent.  There is also a legal and physical risk if participants were to drive or ope rate heavy machinery 
while cognitively impaired . Subject  will be advised against operating heavy machinery following 
treatment.  
 
11.7 Economic Risks:  Subjects will be reimbursed for travel expenses including taxi, Uber or Lyft fare 
within 20 miles of study  site as well as for any medical care related to study -related injuries.   
 
11.8 Other Risks: While  every possible effort will be made to protect the privacy of study participants, 
there is a  risk of loss of confidentiality.  There may also be unknown risks associated with the study 
procedure or intervention.

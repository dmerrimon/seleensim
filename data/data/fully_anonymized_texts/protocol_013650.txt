Confidential  Methodology  This is a multi -center, single -dose, randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled, parallel group study in approximately 1140 subjects with acute 
migraine (ages 18 to 65 years).  
After establishing initial eligibility, the study participants will document 
their headache attacks for 28 days in an e lectronic diary. Attack frequency, 
duration, pain severity, presence of symptoms (nausea; photophobia, 
phonophobia) and impact on functional status will be documented. Study 
participants must have 2 to 8 migraine attacks, and fewer than 15 headache 
days during the 28-day screening period to be eligible for randomization . 
After establishing full eligibility, the study participants will be trained in 
the use of the STS101 device and randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of 
three treatments:  
• 3.9 mg STS101 (equivalent to 4.5 mg of DHE mesylate  USP) 
• 5.2 mg STS101 (equivalent to 6.0 mg of DHE mesylate  USP) 
• Placebo (matching nasal powder)  
After randomization, the study participants will treat their next qualifying 
migraine attack of at least moderate pain severity with the allocated 
blinded study medication at home.  The subjects will be instructed to treat 
a qualifying migraine attack within 8 hours of the onset of the attack.  
The study participants will document the pain severity  of their treated 
migraine attack, presence of symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, 
nausea), presence of allodynia  and functionality status over the 48 -hour 
period after study drug administration in an e -diary. Headache pain 
severity and symptom data will b e collected at the onset of the migraine 
attack, immediately before drug administration (time 0), at 15, 30, [ADDRESS_665370] study drug administration data collection timepoint. The 
use of triptans or other DHE mesylate  products as rescue medications 
should be avoided for 24 hours after study drug administration. The study 
participants will return to the stu dy site within one week of the treated 
migraine attack. 
Adverse events, objective nasal evaluation data, safety laboratory data, 
vital sign data and ECGs will be recorded before and after treatment to 
evaluate the tolerability and safety of STS101.  
Number of 
subjects (planned)  A total of approximately 1140 evaluable adult male and female subjects 
aged 18 to 65  years with acute migraine headaches.

Confidential  Statistical methods  Sample Size Determination  
A total of approximately 1140 evaluable subjects is planned for the study. 
Given the 1:1:[ADDRESS_665401] dosing of investigational drug , a therapeutic gain 
of 15% is considered clinically meaningful and targeted. This is assuming 
a 30% responder rate for STS101 and 15% for the placebo. Based on these 
assumptions, 380 subjects per arm can provide 9 9% power to detect the 
target treatment difference . For the co-primary endpoint of MBS  freedom 
at [ADDRESS_665402] investigational drug , a therapeutic gain of 12.5%, assuming 
a 47.5% responder rate for STS101 and 35% for the placebo is targeted. 
Based on these assumptions, 380 subjects per arm can provide 9 5% power 
to detect the target treatment difference . The sample size calculation is 
based on a chi -square test with a significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_665403] 9 4%. 
Efficacy 
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) including the final hierarchy of 
testing of primary and secondary endpoints will be created before data base 
lock and study unblinding.  
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846].  
Unless otherwise specified, for numeric dat a (e.g., age, weight), descriptive  
statistics will include the number of subjects with data to be summarized 
(n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) and maximum  
(max). All categorical/qualitative data (e.g., gender, race) will be presente d 
using absolute and relative frequency counts and percentage.  
Data from all investigational centers will be pooled for analysis. For the 
primary analysis of the co -primary endpoints, missing data will be imputed  
based on a single -imputation method. Subjec ts who do not have evaluable 
assessments at the [ADDRESS_665404] of missing data will be further investigated in a number of 
sensitivity an alyses with other single and multiple -imputation approaches.   
A study-wise Type I error of 0.05 will be used for the study. A multi -family 
gate-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_513603] -wise Type 
I error rate at alpha=0.05. There are [ADDRESS_665405] will be used to

Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -002, April 9, [ADDRESS_665406] will be used. The Kaplan -Meier method 
will be used for time to use of rescue medications. Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment factor and baseline scores as a covariate, will 
be used for the analy sis of FIS . The 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life 
Questionnaire assessments will be analyzed with the Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) models.  The chi-square test will be used to analyze the Patient 
Global Impression ratings.  
Subgroup analyses of the key effica cy endpoints will be conducted to gain 
insight of the nature and consistency of the treatment effect.  
Safety 
Safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least one dose of 
study medication.  
All adverse events reported or observed will be listed, documenting 
severity, start and stop date  and time, possible relationship to study 
medication, action taken, and outcome. Treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events recorded after dosing of the 
investigational product. Verbatim terms will be classified to preferred 
terms (PT) and related system organ class (SOC) using the MedDRA 
dictionary. The preferred terms and system organ classes will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_1570]. All reported adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_513612], system organ class, preferred 
term, severity and relationship to study drug.  
Safety labs including complete blood count (CBC), chemistry and 
urinalysis will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. A tabul ation of 
by-subject abnormal/out -of-range findings and changes from pre -dose 
(baseline at Visit 2) to post-dose in all laboratory variables will be provided.  
Vital signs, objective and subjective evaluations of nasal irritation and

Confidential  1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
1.1. Introduction  
Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Satsuma) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_56660]101 (dihydroergotamine nasal 
powder), a drug-device combination of a dihydroergotamine ( DHE) mesylate dry powder 
formulation prefilled in a single use delivery device for nasal administration . DHE mesylate  is 
currently indicated for the acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura and the 
acute treatment of cluster headache epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  DHE mesylate  is available as a solution for 
subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), or intravenous (IV) administ ration and as a nasal spray 
(IN) (DHE 45® Prescribing  Information 2017 ; Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ). 
DHE mesylate  is a semi-synthetic derivative of ergotamine tartrate that has been used effectively 
to treat migraine since 1945 ( Silberstein  2003) and was first approved in U. S. in 1946. The 
antimigraine activity of DHE mesylate  is likely related to the agonist activity at 5 -HT1B, 5-HT1D, 
and 5-HT1F receptors ( Dahlöf 2012 ). Additionally, DHE mesylate  can cause vasoconstriction via 
CGRP release by [CONTACT_56678] α 2A/2c and 5-HT2A receptors and may  inhibit neurogenic 
inflammation in peripheral meningeal tissues and nociceptive neuronal transmission centrally in 
the trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( Hoskin 1996 ; Burstein 2004 ; Silberstein  2003; Dahlöf 2012 ; 
González -Hernández 2018 ). The DHE mesylate -related side effects of nausea and vomiting are 
likely related to activation of central 5 -HTlA receptors and dopamine D 2 receptors 
(Silberstein  2003). 
DHE mesylate is listed as first -line treatment in migraine treatment guidelines from the American  
Academy of Neurology ( Marmura 2015 ). The effectiveness of DHE mesylate via intravenous, 
intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal and orally inhaled administration routes has been 
demonstrated ( Raskin 1986 ; Winner 1996 ; Gallagher 1996 ; Carleton 1998 ; Edwards 2001 ; 
Aurora 2011 ). In these studies, treatment with DHE mesylate has consistently resulted in 
headache relief in 50 to 70% of the treated patients at 2 hours after administration . 
However, p atient acceptance of DHE mesylate has been limited due to these shortcomings:  
• D.H.E.45® (Injectable DHE mesylate  solution) 
o Inconvenience and  side effects of administration  by [CONTACT_17838]  (IV, IM, SC)  
o DHE mesylate-related side effects, especially nausea, which is likely related to rate of 
administration (IV) and C max and has been reported to occur less frequently when 
plasma concentrations remain below 6 -10 ng/mL  (Cook 2009 ) 
• Migranal® (DHE mesyla te intranasal spray) 
o Inconvenient multi -step procedure of vial opening, spray device -to-vial assembly, and 
priming (Migranal® Administration  Instructions 2017 ) 
o Inconvenient administration procedure requiring four 0.125 mL sprays (two  in each 
nostril, repeated after 15 minutes) ( Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ) and 
Migranal® Administration  Instructions 2017 ) 
STS101 ( Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder) Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -002, April 9, 2019 Page 22 of 72 
Confidential  o Low and variable bioavailability ( Tfelt-Hansen 2013 ; 
Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ) 
o Slow onset of action ( Tfelt-Hansen 2013 ) 
o Drug run off into the pharynx and out of the nose ( Djupesland 2013 ) 
o Side effect of bad or altered sense of taste ( Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ; 
van der Kuy 1999 ). 
STS101 (DHE nasal powder) is designed and being developed to address the shortcomings of the 
injectable  and intranasal DHE mesylate  formulations:  
• STS101 is designed to be easy and convenient for patients to quickly self -administer 
during a migraine attack.  
• STS101 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_56661] T max, Cmax and AUC values falling 
within ranges that have previously been established to be effec tive for DHE mesylate. 
• Consistent with DHE mesylate effectiveness data reported in multiple studies, STS101 
treatment is expected to be effective in early and late treatment of migraines, in attacks 
with and without allodynia, and to result in high [ADDRESS_665419] consisting of a powder formulation of DHE 
mesylate prefilled in a single use delivery device for intranasal (IN) administration.  
1.2.1.  STS101 Device  
STS101 will be delivered by a pre -filled single use devic e, which is a manually operated and air 
driven device specifically designed for IN drug delivery (Figure 1).

1.2.2.  STS101 Powder Formulation  
STS101 is a white to off -white powder formulation containing DHE mesylate , microcrystalline 
cellulose (MCC), hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, HPMC), and mannitol.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  DHE Mesylate Information  
DHE mesylate  is a semi-synthetic derivative  of ergotamine tartrate and is known chemically as 
ergotaman -3´,6´,18-trione,9,10 -dihydro-12´-hydroxy-2´-methyl-5´-(phenylmethyl) -,(5´α)-
,monomethanesulfonate. Its molecular weight is 679.[ADDRESS_665420] activity at 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 
and 5-HT1F rec
eptors (Dahlöf 2012 ). Additionally, DHE can cause vasoconstriction via CGRP 
release by [CONTACT_513613] α2A/2c and 5-HT2A receptors and may inhibit neurogenic 
inflammation in periphera l meninge
al tissues a nd nociceptive neuronal transmission c entrally in 
the trigeminal nucleus caudalis ( Hoskin 1996 ; Burstein 2004 ; Silberstein 2003; Dahlöf 2012 ; 
González-Hernández 2018). The DHE mesylate-related side effects of nausea and vomiting are 
likely related to activation of central 5-H TlA receptors and dopamine D2 receptors (Silberstein , 
2003). Because of slow diffusion from the receptor biophase, the effects of DHE mesylate last 
far longer than can b
e expected from plasma concentrations ( Dahlöf 2012 ; Tfelt-Hansen 2013 ). 
1.2.4. STS101 DHE Pharmacokinetics 
In a 
2-part, three period, cross-over Phase 1 study, 15 healthy subjects were dosed with 
ascending doses of 1.3, 2.6 and 5.2 mg STS101 (equivalent to 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg DHE 
mesylate USP). STS 101 demonstrated dose dependent plasma conc entrations. Table 1 shows 
selected PK parameters of Part 1 of the study.

1.2.6.  DHE Mesylate  Pregnancy Category  
DHE mesylate  may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant wom an. There are no 
adequate studies of DHE mesylate  in human pregnancy, but developmental toxicity has been 
demonstrated in experimental animals. DHE mesylate  possesses oxytocic properties and, 
therefore, should not be administered during pregnancy. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or 
if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. DHE mesylate  is designated Pregnancy Category X in the U.S  
(DHE 45® Prescribing  Information 2017 ; Migranal® Prescribing  Information 2017 ). 
1.3. Summary of Nonclinical Data  
The nonclinical toxicology program for STS101 was designed to supplement the known 
nonclinical studies in support of the general safe use of DHE mesylate . In a GLP [ADDRESS_665422] Level (NOAEL) of DHE mesylate  dose given to dogs (the most 
sensitive species) was approximately [ADDRESS_665423] clinical dose of 
STS101 on a dose/weight (mg/kg ) basis and [ADDRESS_665424] feasibl e concentrations possible. The large safety multiples based on the NOAEL provide 
reassurance that the proposed human clinical dosing is reasonable and safe.  The study is 
summarized in detail in the STS101 Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.4. Rationale for the study  
In the Phase 1 Study STS101-001, STS101 showed DHE plasma concentrations and PK 
parameters comparable to those previously reported for other DHE mesylate  formulations and 
routes of administration ( Schran 1994 ; Humbert 1996 ; Shrewsbury 200 8). Based on the reported 
clinical efficacy data for these other DHE mesylate  formulations and routes of administration, 
the PK profile of STS101 is assume d to be predict ive of at least comparable clinical efficacy 
(Gallagher 1996 ; Winner 1996 , Aurora 2011 ). 
This study follows the FDA Gui dance1 and the Guidelines of International Headache Society for 
acute migraine studies ( Diener 2019 ) and is being conducted as part of the clinical development 
program for STS101 to demonstrate the efficacy , safety and tolerability of STS101 in the 
treatment of acute migraine attacks with or without aura .

Confidential  3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multi -center, single -dose, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group 
study in approximately 1140 subjects with acute migraine (ages 18 to 65 years). 
After establishing initial eligibility, the study participants will document their headache attacks 
for 28 days in an e lectronic diary. Attack frequency, duration, pain severity, presence of 
symptoms (nausea; photophobia, phonophobia) and impact on  functional status will be 
documented. Study participants must have 2 to 8 migraine attacks, and fewer than 15 headache 
days during the 28 -day screening period to be eligible for randomization.  
After establishing full eligibility, the study participants wi ll be trained in the use of the STS101 
device and randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of three treatments:  
• 3.9 mg STS101 (equivalent to 4.5 mg of DHE mesylate  USP) 
• 5.2 mg STS101 (equivalent to 6.0 mg of DHE mesylate  USP) 
• Placebo (matching nasal powder) 
After randomization, the study participants will treat their next qualifying migraine attack of at 
least moderate pain severity with the allocated blinded study medication at home.  The subjects 
will be instructed to treat a qualifying migraine atta ck within 8 hours of the onset of the attack.  
The study participants will document the pain severity of their treated migraine attack, presence 
of symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea ) presence of  allodynia and functional status over 
the 48-hour period after study drug administration in an e -diary. Headache pain severity and 
symptom data will be collected at the onset of the migraine attack, immediately before drug 
administration (time 0), at 15, 30, [ADDRESS_665426] study 
drug administration data collection timepoint. The use of triptans or other  ergot-containing  
products (including DHE mesylate and ergotamine) as rescue medications should be avoided for 
24 hours after study drug administration. The study participants will return to the study site 
within one week of the treated migraine attack. 
Adverse events, objective nasal evaluation d ata, safety laboratory data, vital sign data and ECGs 
will be recorded before and after treatment to evaluate the tolerability and safety of STS101.

before drug administration (time 0), at 15, 30, [ADDRESS_665446] Bothersome Sympt om 
The study participants will be prompted to document the presence of three symptoms,  photophobia, 
phonophobia and nausea during the treated migraine attack by [CONTACT_56689]:  
For photophobia:  “Do you have sensitivity to light?”  
For phonophobia:  “Do you h ave sensitivity to sound?”  
For nausea:  “Do you have nausea?”  
For each of the three symptoms, the subject will respond with “Yes” (if symptom present) or 
“No” (if symptom absent).  
Immediately before study drug administration  (time 0), the study subjects wil l be prompted to 
declare the most bothersome symptom among the symptoms present by [CONTACT_56690]: “Please 
indicate which of the symptoms that you have  at (sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or 
nausea) bothers you the most  at this time .” 
The presence  of the three symptoms will be recorded at the onset of the migraine attack, 
immediately before drug administration (time 0), at 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 
24, and 48 hours after study drug administration.  
6.1.3.  Evaluation of Allodynia  
The presence of allodynia (painful cutaneous sensations) will be assessed by [CONTACT_513618]  (Ashkenazi 2007 ; Tepper 2011 ):

6.1.5.  Evaluation of Function  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Functional Impairment Scale  
The study subjects will be prompted to record their functional status using the Functional 
Impairment Scale (FIS): “Please rate how much your current migraine headache impacts your 
ability to function  right now .” 
The subject’s rating will be documented on a four -point scale from no impairment ( =0; able to 
function normal)), mild impairment (= 1 ; able to perform all activities of daily living but with some  
difficulty), moderate impairment (= 2 ; unable to perform certain activities of daily living ) to severe  
impairment (= 3 ; unable to perform most to all activities of daily living o r requiring bed rest ). 
The FIS will be recorded at the onset of the migraine attack, immediately before drug 
administration (time 0), at 1, 2, 4, 24, and 48 hours after study drug administration.

7.2. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessari ly have to 
have a causal relationship with this treatment.”  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether  or not related to the  investigational 
product. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) are defined as adverse events recorded after 
dosing of the investigational product.  
STS101 ( Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder) Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -002, April 9, [ADDRESS_665451] qu estioning.  
AE collection will begin a fter the Randomization Visit (Visit 2) and continue until the follow -
up/early termination visit.  
AEs will be solicited at the times indicated in the schedule of assessments by [CONTACT_7939] a question 
such as: “Since you were last seen, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any way?”  
AEs may also be reported spontaneously . 
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal la boratory values) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a 
diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded as an AE(s). Changes in 
laboratory values are only considered to be AEs if they are judged to be clinically significa nt 
(i.e., if some action or intervention is required or if the Investigator judges the change to be 
beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). If abnormal laboratory values are the 
result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (e. g., increased liver enzymes in 
hepatitis), the diagnosis only should be reported as an AE.  
Any adverse events, signs, and symptoms will be fully recorded on the AE form including date 
of onset, date of resolution, frequency, severity, seriousness, relation ship to the drug, treatments 
administered and outcome.  AEs may also be reported spontaneously at any time.  
All AEs must be recorded in the source data  and the CRF . Any AE will be followed, whenever 
possible, until it returns to the baseline condition, is declared medically stable with no further 
change expected  or the subject is lost to follow up . 
7.2.1.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
An AE will be considered ‘related” or “not related” to the use of the investigational product 
based on the criteria listed in  Table 4. Assessment of the causal relationship between any Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE) and study drug administration will be performed by [CONTACT_56694].  If at least one of the  parties assesses the event as related, it will be reported 
expeditiously as required to the appropriate authorities.  
Table 4. Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
 Related: There is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_56695] (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible causality).  
Individual AE reports will be considered “related” to the use of the product if the “not related” 
criteria are not met.  
Not 
Related: There is an unreasonable temporal relationship between administration of the product and the onset 
of the AE (i.e., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration of the product for it 
to be considered product -related); 
The causal relationship be tween the product, and the AE is biologically implausible (i.e., death of a 
passenger in an automobile accident);  
There is a clearly more likely alternative explanation for the AE (i.e., typi[INVESTIGATOR_56664] a 
concomitant drug and/or typi[INVESTIGATOR_5194] -related event).

Confidential  7.2.2.  Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
Table 5 shows the  guidelines for rating severity of AEs may be used:  
Table 5. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity  
Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of time from 
normal activities; symptoms would  not require medication or  a medical evaluation; signs and 
symptoms may be transient, disappearing during continued treatment with study medication.  
Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with or modification of usual activities.  
Severe: Incapacitating , with inability or notable impairment in  work or usual activities; signs and symptoms 
may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation; the study drug may be stopped, and 
treatment for the  event may be required.  
 
7.2.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Recording and Reporting  
The Investigator must decide whether each AE meets the definition of a n SAE. An SAE is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life-threatening.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6. Is considered medically significant by [CONTACT_56696].  
For fatal events, the cause of death is reported whenever known. If an autopsy was performed, an 
autopsy report should be provided. Death should be reported as the outcome of a specific SAE.  
Life-threatening, in the definition of serious, refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.   
Reports for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56665]/symptoms or worsening of the pre-existing condition that necessi tated the 
procedure.  However, SAEs must be reported for any medical complications that prolonged the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Medically significant events are those events considered important in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_56666]-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513607].  These will also usually be considered serious.  
STS101 ( Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder) Satsuma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: STS101 -002, April 9, [ADDRESS_665452] complete the required information fields for SAE documentation and 
reporting i n the electronic CRF (AE eCRF and SAE eCRF) and provide any supportive documents  
available (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56668], diagnostic test results, laboratory test results, etc.) . Any subject 
identifying information must be redacted  prior to uploading . The investigat or should not wait for 
these supporting documents in order to notify the medical monitor if doing so would place the 
notification outside the 24 -hour window. All SAEs will also be reported on the AE eCRF and 
SAE eCRF  and concomitant medications (CM) admini stered in association with the serious AE 
will be documented on the CM eCRF. 
For any information not available at the time of the first report that becomes available later, 
the Investigator should add this information to both the source documentation and t he initial 
SAE section of the eCRFs, and provide any additional written documentation to the Safety 
Group immediately or within 1 working day of receipt.  
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for notifying regulatory agencies of SAEs that require 
reporting as per the governing regulations . 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report to the relevant IRB/EC in accordance with the 
IRB/EC’s reporting specific reporting requirements for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be followed up until the event is resolved, returns to the baseline condition, or is 
declared medically stable with no further change expected or the subject is lost to follow up.  
SAEs Occurring after the Follow -Up Visit: If an SAE comes to the attention of the 
Investigator after study termination within [ADDRESS_665453] dose of study drug(s), and it is 
considered related to study dru g, it must be re corded and followed up in the same way as the 
SAEs occurring during the study.  
Any report of pregnancy identified for any female subject or for a female partner of a male 
subject should be reported immediately (within 24 hours of being info rmed) to the medical 
monitor. Pregnancies will be considered ‘events of special interest’ and will not be captured as 
serious adverse events (SAEs). The Pregnancy Report Form will be utilized to obtain follow -up 
information. Pregnancies will be followed to  termination or eight weeks post - delivery for 
determination of resolution to the event. Subjects who become pregnant during treatment must 
immediately be withdrawn from the study (classified as ET).

Confidential  8. STATISTICS  
8.1. Sample Size Determination  
A total of approxim ately 1140 evaluable subjects is planned for the study. Given the 1:1:1 
randomization ratio, approximately 380 subjects will be randomized to each treatment group.  
For the co -primary endpoint of pain freedom at 2 hours  after drug administration , a therapeu tic 
gain of 15% is considered clinically meaningful and is targeted. This is assuming a 30% 
responder rate for STS101 and 15% for the placebo. Based on these assumptions, 380 subjects 
per arm can provide 9 9% power to detect the target treatment difference . For the co -primary 
endpoint of MBS  freedom at 2 hours after drug administration , a therapeutic gain of 1 2.5%, 
assuming a 47.5% responder rate for STS101 and 35% for the placebo is targeted. Based on 
these assumptions, 380 subjects per arm can provide 9 5% power to detect the target treatment 
difference. The sample size calculation is based on a chi -square test with a significance level of 
0.[ADDRESS_665454] 9 4%. 
8.2. Subject Populations  
The analysis populations to be used in the study are defined below.  
8.2.1.  Intent-to-Treat Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects who reported a qualifying  
migraine attack, received the study drug, and reported any post -treatment efficacy evaluation. 
Data will be analyz ed according to the treatment group each subject is randomized to.  
8.2.2.  Modified Intent -to-Treat Population  
For the purposes of efficacy data analysis, the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) population will be 
the primary analysis population . This population will include all randomized subjects who 
reported a qualifying migraine attack, received the study drug, and reported a post -treatment 
efficacy evaluation for at least [ADDRESS_665455] is randomized to.  
8.2.3.  Per-Protocol Population  
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all mITT subjects who do not have protocol 
deviations that could significantly affect the interpretation of the results for the primary 
endpoints. Subjects’ inclusion/exclusion from the PP population will be determined and 
documented prior to the database lock and unblinding.

8.3. Statistical Analysis  
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846]. Unless otherwise 
specified, for numeric data (e.g., age, weight), descriptive statistics will include the number of 
subjects with data to be summarized (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min) 
and maximum (max). All categorical/qualitative data (e.g., gender, race) will be presented using 
absolute and relative frequ ency counts and percentage.  
All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual subject data listings described below will be 
completed using Version 9.3 or later of the SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be provided in a separate document. The SAP 
will include the final hierarchy for testing of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints and 
will be finalized prior to database lock and unblinding of the stud y. 
8.3.1.  Demographic and Baseline Variables  
Demographics and baseline characteristics (including HIT -6 and triptan response information) 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_143498], the ITT Population,  
the Per-Protocol Population,  and the Safety Population. Exploratory hypotheses testing may be 
performed to assess the comparability of demographics and baseline characteristics among the 
treatment groups. No multiplicity adjustment will be applied to these tests.

groups are significant at 0.05 level, the secondary endpoints family of hypotheses will be tested 
according to a pre -specified hierarchy at the 0.05 significance level. If both co -primary endpoints 
are significant for only one of the two dose groups, the  secondary endpoints family of hypotheses 
will be tested according to a pre -specified hierarchy at the 0.025 significance level.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling of Missing Data  
For the primary analysis of the co -primary endpoints, missing data will be imputed based on a 
single-imputation method. Subjects who do not have evaluable assessments at the [ADDRESS_665481] of missing data will be further investigated in a number of 
sensitivity analyses with other single and multiple -imputation approaches.  The details of the 
sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP.

For both co -primary endpoints, the Chi -square test will be used to compare the active treatment 
groups and placebo. Chi -square test will also be used to test secondary endpoints consist of 
proportion of responders. For analyses st ratified by [CONTACT_513621], timing of treatment, the 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used for time to 
use of rescue medications. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment factor and 
baseline scores as a cov ariate, will be used for the analysis of FIS . The 24-hour Migraine Quality 
of Life Questionnaire assessments will be analyzed with the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 
models. The chi-square test will be used to analyze the Patient Global Impression ratings.  
To fully describe the treatment benefit of STS101, the proportion of subjects achieving “no 
headache pain” at various time points following treatment will be tested between the active 
treatment groups and placebo. The results will also be displayed graphica lly to show the time 
course of effect. To address the onset of efficacy, treatment difference vs. placebo will be 
examined from the 2 hour -timepoint towards the baseline in a sequential manner (i.e. 2 hours, 
1.5 hours, 1 hour, 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 mi nutes). A significance level of 0.05 will be used

time point in hematology, serum chemistry and quantitative urinalysis test results will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
For hematology  and serum chemistry including calculated creatinine clearance, normal ranges 
for each parameter will be used to categorize the test result as low (value lower than the lower 
limit), normal (value within the normal range), or high (value higher than the up per limit). For 
urinalysis, test results will be categorized as normal and abnormal. Frequency counts and 
percentages will be presented over time by [CONTACT_513623].  In 
addition, shifts from baseline (shift to maximum value, shi ft to minimum value) to each post -
baseline time point and to any post -baseline time point for each parameter will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_1570].  
If a continuous laboratory value is reported as either below or above the limits of quantification, 
the qualifiers should be dropped and the numeric value used in the analysis (e.g., “< 1” should be 
“1” and “> 100” should be “100”).

acceptable. 
 
 
1.2 Objective Assessment of Nasal Irritation (Appendix C)
 
All five nasal symptoms should be evaluated based on visual inspection of the nose. Please note 
that the information marked with an asterisk under 3. Rhinorrhea (“Assessment for this 
question will be based on the subject record of the number of nose blows as recorded in 
worksheet”) does not apply in this study. The number of nose blows should be based on the 
information provided by [CONTACT_423].
- 2 - 2. Contraception
 
Study Protocol Inclusion Criterion # 5: 
 
“Female subjects will be included if they are post-menopausal (at least [ADDRESS_665497] menses) 
or surgically sterilized; or if they are of childbearing potential, they are not breastfeeding, have a 
negative pregnancy test, have no intention of becoming pregnant during the course of the 
study, and are using adequate contraceptive drugs or devices during the course of this study. 
Medically acceptable methods of contraception that may be used by [CONTACT_3184]/or her 
partner are:
a. Simultaneous use of male condom and intra-uterine contraceptive device placed at least [ADDRESS_665498] 4 weeks prior 
to Screening Visit  
d. Surgical sterilization of their partner(s) at least 6 months prior to Screening Visit” 
 
 
Interpretation and documentation 
 
1) Hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation fulfil the criteria “surgically sterilized” 
2) All subjects of child bearing potential must agree to use one of the options listed, even if 
they practiced abstinence before the study, have a same sex partner or no sexual partner. 
The spi[INVESTIGATOR_513608] a medically acceptable method of contraception is 
practiced when the potential of pregnancy exists.  
3. Cardiovascular Risk Factors 
Study ProtocolExclusion Criteria # 7
“Presence of two or more of the following cardiovascular risk factors: 
a. Receiving antihypertensive medication for treatment of hypertension  
b. Hypercholesteremia (LDL >159 mg/dL) or receiving cholesterol lowering medication 
c. Obesity (BMI > 31) 
d. Diabetes mellitus  
- 3 - e. Family history of premature coronary artery disease (in male first-degree relatives < [ADDRESS_665499]-degree relatives < 65 years) 
f. Females who are surgically or physiologically postmenopausal  
g. Males over age 45”  
 
Interpretation
Criterion 7b, is considered presentif:
a) a subject is taking any kind of cholesterol lowering medications
b) a subject has an LDL >159 mg/dL in the screening or randomization visit labs
c) a subject has the diagnosis of hypercholesteremia in the medical history, regardless if the 
subject is currently taking drugor other cholesterol loweringtreatments, or has no LDL 
>159 mg/dL. The presence of the diagnosis constitutesthe risk factor. 
4. Nicotine Use& Beta-blockers
Study Protocol Exclusion Criteria # 19
“Concomitant use of peripheral and central vasoconstrictors including propranolol and nicotine 
(from smoking, vapi[INVESTIGATOR_56659])” 
Interpretation
If subjects have been using nicotine products in the past, they must have discontinued those for 
at least one year before screening to be enrolled in the study.The rationale is resumption of 
nicotine is common and a long enough period of abstinence must be achieved before the 
subject can be allowed into the study. 
Additional note: beta-blockers other than propranolol such as metoprolol are allowed.
5. Serum HCG tests
a)All females  are required to have serum HCG tests at Visits 1, 2, and 3 regardless of results.
b) Females who are surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, or total 
hysterectomy) and who have serum HCG results of “Inconclusive” at Visit 1, DONOTneed 
to repeatthe test; however, serum HCG tests at Visits [ADDRESS_665500] still be done.  
- 4 - c) All other “Inconclusive” HCG test results except as noted in “b” need to be repeated at least 
one week after the first HCG test and the results need to be sent to the Medical Monitor for 
confirmation.
d) Surgical sterilization must be documented in medical records/medical history/source 
documents and eCRFs.

Reg.:    STS101-002 – Administrative Change Letter #3 (20 Feb 2020) 
           Protocol Section 5.1 – PBO Filled Devices 
         
 
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter 
Study to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Single Doses of STS101 
(Dihydroergotamine Nasal Powder) in the Acute Treatment of Migraine 
 
Protocol Section 5.1.1 – Description of Investigational Product and 
Packaging (P. 39) 
The non-investigational product used for subject training during the Screening and 
Randomization Visits currently are STS1010 devices filled with microcrystalline cellulose(MCC).
Clarification 
In addition to the MCC filled STS101 Training Devices, Satsuma will utilize Placebo filled STS101 
Training Devices.  Additional information regarding this change:
1. In the Study STS101-002 currently devices filled with microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) are 
used for training and demonstration of the study drug administration.
2. Due to a shortage of MCC filled devices, Satsuma needs to use placebo filled devices for 
training and demonstration.  These placebo-filled devices contain mannitol and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) in addition to the MCC.
3. Please note that these training devices are used for demonstration only and no 
administration of powder into the nose occurs during training with the subject.

Study no: ALA -AK-CT015  
IND no: IND 115412  
NTC:  Clinical Phase: I (in diseased subjects)  
 
 
Study design: non-randomized, open -label  
Study purpose and objectives  
To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the parent drug 5 -aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and 
its active metabolite protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) during photodynamic therapy applying  3 
tubes of BF -200 ALA 10  % gel (Ameluz®) in combination with the BF -RhodoLED® lamp 
in the systemic circulation of diseased individuals presenting with actinic keratosis (AK) on 
the face/scalp or in the periphery (neck/trunk/extremities) along with subjects’ 
safety/toler ability during and after treatment. Disease severity and drug dose are supposed 
to represent conditions of maximal use in line with the Guidance for Industry on Topi[INVESTIGATOR_402361] (May 2019; docket no. 2019 -[ZIP_CODE])  provided by [CONTACT_402411]  (FDA ). 
Primary objectives

single PDT treatment applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA  in conjunction with the BF -
RhodoLED® under maximal use conditions in subjects with mild to severe actinic 
keratosis.  
• Assessment of baseline -adjusted plasma concentration -time curve s for PpIX after a 
single PDT treatment applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA in conjunction with the BF -
RhodoLED® unde r maximal use conditions in subjects with mild to severe actinic 
keratosis.  
Secondary objectives  
• Evaluation of baseline -adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA . 
• Evaluation of baseline -adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters of PpIX . 
• Assessment of safety and tolerability of PDT with BF -200 ALA under maximal use 
conditions  
Tertiary objectives  
• Evaluation  of unadjusted plasma concentration -time curve for ALA and evaluation 
of unadjusted  pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA . 
• Evaluation  of unadjusted plasma concentration -time curve for PpIX  and evaluation 
of unadjusted  pharmacokinetic parameters of PpIX .

One Phase I unit in the  [LOCATION_002] of America (US) will participate in this study where 
all study visits and procedures will be conducted. Subjects will be screened and upon 
eligibility subjected to PDT and PK blood sampling. Study site will consider the two 
strata (face/scal p versus periphery (neck/trunk/extremities)) for enrolment.  
 
Investigational medicinal product (IMP) and medical device  
IMP:  BF-200 ALA  
• Description:  BF-200 ALA is a gel formulation of 10  % 5-aminolevulinic acid 
hydrochloride, corresponding to 7.8  % 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). It is FDA -
approved and marketed in the US as Ameluz® for the lesion -directed and field -
directed treatment of AK of mild to mod erate severity on the face and scalp, in 
combination with BF -RhodoLED® lamp. The IMP will be packed in tubes, 
containing 2  g each (medication is identical to the marketed formulation).  
• Route of administration : topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], field -directed treatment in a film of  1 mm 
thickness over treatment field(s) of approximately 60  cm2 in total.  
• Dose : Three tubes, each containing 2  g gel. Each tube contains 156  mg ALA, 
resulting in a total exposure of 468  mg ALA (free base).  
 
Investigational medical device  (IMD) : BF-RhodoLED® 
The study treatment requires illumination of treatment fields with the BF -RhodoLED® 
lamp (red light with emission at ~635  nm). The applied light dose of ~37  J/cm² will be 
achieved with a 10  min illumination. Please refer to the BF -RhodoLED® user manual f or 
detailed lamp operating and safety instructions.  
Subjects and lesions  
Eligible subjects will be of all genders, between [ADDRESS_507166] 12 clinically confirmed AK lesions of mild to severe severity (according to 
Olsen et al., 1991) with a diameter of ≥  4 mm each, either in the face/scalp (including 
forehead, excluding eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth) or on neck/trunk/extremities. AK 
lesions must be located in one or several treatment fields with a combined area of 
approximately 60  cm2. Treatment fields m ay be discontinuous, but up to 2 illumination 
areas with the BF -RhodoLED® lamp (6  cm x16  cm each) should be sufficient to 
illuminate the treatment fields.  
 
Number of subjects  
32 subjects (16 subjects in each stratum)  
Study Duration and Dates  
Screening of subjects, including diagnosis and safety analyses, will be conducted at Visit 1. 
The study will include two further visits (Visit 2 where the photodynamic therapy (PDT) is 
performed with PK blood sampling and Visit 3 for final safety assessmen t). The time 
interval between Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2 (treatment) will be no longer than [ADDRESS_507167]. After three 
hours of incubation, subjects will receive PDT illumination with the BF -RhodoLED® lamp. 
In terms of the PDT procedure (preparation of treatment field(s), drug application, 
incubation, illumination), the treatment will be done a ccording to the labels of BF -200 ALA 
and BF -RhodoLED® with the exceptions that [ADDRESS_507168] and the

will be taken from subjects starting 0.5  h prior to BF -200 ALA application and then for up 
to 10  h afterwards. Subjects will be called by [CONTACT_402412] 7  (± 3) days 
post Visit 2. The final Visit 3, 28  (± 7) days after Visit 2, will entail safety assessment.  
Recruitment period           approx. 6 months

LSLV/end of study           approx. Oct 2020  
Sample size  
The suggested sample size for the study is 32 subjects, stratified int o two groups of 16 
subjects each. One of the groups will receive PDT applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA on the 
face/scalp, the other group will receive PDT applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA on the 
neck/trunk/extremities. A previous PK Phase I study under maximal use conditions in AK 
subjects with 1 tube of BF -200 ALA (ALA -AK-CT006) had revealed homogeneous 
baseline -adjusted levels of ALA and PpIX in 12 subjects, with a coefficient of variation of 
53-73% in the key pharmacokinetic parameters after drug application.  As statistical 
evaluation of PK and safety is intended to be performed as descriptive statistics only, no 
calculation of predictive power is required.

Procedures  
• Screening  
• Assessment of eligibility along inclusion/exclusion criteria including 
vital signs, and physical examination  
• Blood sampling for safety laboratory and PK -baseline parameters  
• PDT  
• Field -directed application of BF -200 ALA on face/scalp or 
trunk/neck/extremities (3  x 2 g BF -200 ALA) subsequent to degreasing 
and lesion preparation on a total skin area of about 60  cm², which may be 
discontinuous, as long as it can be covered by [CONTACT_402414]-RhodoLED® lamp (6  cm x 16 cm).  
• Occlusive, light -blocking dressing of treatment fields during incubation 
with BF -200 ALA.  
• PDT -illumination is performed 3  h after topi[INVESTIGATOR_402371]. If two illumination areas  are nee ded, two BF -RhodoLED® lamps 
are used simultaneously. Thus, for the entire 60  cm² treatment only one 
illumination step is performed.

4.1 Introduction  
(Solar)  actinic keratosis (AK) , also known as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in situ , 
represents the most common neoplasia affecting fair -skinned subjects and  develops in 
chronically sun -exposed skin areas. It is assumed that AK is the result of the accumulation of 
damage in keratinocytes caused by [CONTACT_402416] (UV) light. Lesions of different 
sizes are found in affected subjects, characterized by [CONTACT_402417], scaly and erythematous patches. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_402373], parakeratosis, dyskeratosis, acanthosis, or 
keratinocyte atypia. In one prospective study by [CONTACT_402418].  (1), 72 % of 208 subjects 
with invas ive SCC had AK contiguous to the SCC. It was concluded that the SCC arose in 
these AK lesions. Today, it is generally accepted that AK represents an early stage of a 
malignant condition (carcinoma in situ) that can progress into SCC. Between 0.025  % and 
16 % of the AK lesions develop into SCC (2). Therefore, it is highly recommended to treat 
lesions of AK before they evolve to skin canc er. However, the line of progression from mild 
AK lesions to lesions of moderate or severe phenotype and further progression into SCC was 
counteracted by [CONTACT_402419] h the histopathological classification according to Röwert -Huber (3). 
This reinforces the need to treat even AK lesions of mild clinical phenotype and cancerous 
fields as they could histopathologically present forms of early in situ SCC type II or in situ 
SCC type III already (3). In addition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_402374] , as 
an indicato r for chronic sun  damage,  are a reliable marker for people who are most 
predisposed to the development of an invasive SCC (4). 
Based on these observations , early and field -directed treatment is advised by [CONTACT_402420], including subclinical 
manifestations (5–10). Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is one of several  treatment options 
available for the  field-directed  treatment of cutaneous neoplasm s and non -neoplastic lesions . 
It requires three  components: a photosensitizer, light with sufficient energy at suitable 
wavelengths , and oxygen.  
Kennedy et al. (11) discove red that the topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ), an 
endogenous metabolite found in essentially all eukaryotic cells, as a prodrug is convenient for 
PDT of subjects with a variety of neoplastic and non -neoplastic cutaneous diseases. This 
precursor in the porphyrins’ synthetic pathway is converted by [CONTACT_402421]  (PpIX) , an effective natural photosensitizer. Anomalous cells in dermal 
lesions seem to be metabolically different from normal cells resulting in a higher 
accumulation of PpIX. Eventually, these target cells will be selectively destroyed by [CONTACT_402422] (12–16). 
PpIX can be activated by [CONTACT_402423], ranging from blue 
to red light. PpIX shows a maximal excitation at around 410  nm (Soret band) with four 
smaller peaks in the visible range around 510, 530, 580, and 630  nm. Illumination with red 
light (e.g. by [CONTACT_402424] (LED) devices around 630 nm) may be advantageous for the 
treatment of deeper lesions because it penetrates tissue better when compared with light at 
shorter wavelengths. The use of LED devices results (as shown in several Phase III studies) in 
high c learance rates but is accompanied by a high frequency of adverse events (AE), in

pain.  
In ALA PDT, luminous energy is transferred by [CONTACT_402425] , leading 
to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) , eventually causing cell death. The light -
induced damage depends on the applied doses and incubation periods. Preneoplastic and 
neoplastic cells are eliminated,  and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_402375]. Since the penetration of ALA is mostly prevented by [CONTACT_402426][INVESTIGATOR_402376], no scar formation is observed.  
Due to ALA  PDT ’s mode of action, AEs are mainly local application site reactions such as 
erythema, pain, edema, and irritation which are transient and self -limiting, normally within [ADDRESS_507177] 25 years, the use of ALA 
PDT was extended from  the treatment of dermal lesions to the identification and eradication 
of neoplastic or preneoplastic cells in additional tissues/organs such as vagina, bladder, 
gastrointestinal tract, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], and brain. For non -dermal indications, systemic 
applications of ALA are commonly used.  
Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH has developed a nanoemulsion -based gel formulation of ALA 
(development code: BF -200 ALA; brand name: [CONTACT_402475]®). BF -200 ALA gel contains 10  % 
ALA hydrochloride, equivalent to 7.8  % ALA in a nano emulsion formulation  and was shown 
to improve skin penetration and uptake of ALA in the target area due to the lipophilic 
component of the nanoemulsion (17,18). Thus, as a result of the better penetration capacities, 
the amount of ALA in the marketed formulation could be reduced to 7.8  %, half of 
comparable formulations on the market . Furthermore, this formulation significantly enhances 
the shelf -life as well as in -use stability of the active ingredient. This is considered a relevant 
advantage, given the instability of ALA  in aqueous formulations.  
In the US, Ameluz® in combination with the red-light BF-RhodoLED® lamp has been 
approved for the lesion -directed and field -directed PDT  of actinic keratoses of mild  to 
moderate severity on the face and scalp by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) on May 
10th, 2016 (NDA 208081).  
In the European Union (EU), t he European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a  centralized  
Marketing Authorization for Ameluz® for the treatment of mild  to moderate AK on the face 
and scalp in December 2 011 (EU/1/11/740/001). In November 2012, the BF -RhodoLED® 
medical device was CE -marked and subsequently launched in the European market. In 
September 2016 the approval was extended to the indication of field cancerization, and in 
January 2017 to the treatm ent of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ). In 
March 2018, the EMA granted extension of the posology to the treatment of mild  to moderate 
AK on the face and scalp and field cancerization with daylight PDT.  
Ameluz® furthermore received marketing approval in Switzerland for the treatment of mild  to 
moderate AK on the face and scalp with conventional PDT in November 2015 (Swissmedic 
number: [ZIP_CODE])  and for the treatmen t with daylight PDT in September 2018. Subsequently, 
Swissmedic  approved Ameluz® for the treatment of field cancerization and BCC in May 2018 
(Swissmedic number: [ZIP_CODE]). In Israel, Ameluz® was granted marketing registration approval 
for the treatment of mi ld to moderate AK on the face and scalp in May 2016. Subsequently,

well.  
In a dose-finding clinical study (ALA -AK-CT001) in vivo pharmacokinetics of BF -[ADDRESS_507178]  dose levels 
were increased in comparison to the naturally occurring pre -dose levels, suggesting the 
absence of relevant systemic absorption after topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086].  
Further pharmacokinetic data with BF -200 ALA were collected in one previous 
pharmacokinetics ( PK) Phase I study  (ALA -AK-CT006) . This maximal use study , in which 
one tube of BF -[ADDRESS_507179] and thus regarded as uncritical for the subjects  (19–22). Systemic absorption of 
ALA after application of a dose of 7.8  mg ALA/cm² to  treatment fields >20 cm² has not been 
investigated so far.  
A recent  European study (ALA -AK-CT010) compared the efficacy of BF -200 ALA with 
placebo for the field -directed treatment of AK located on extremities and trunk/neck  
(periphery)  with PDT when using the BF RhodoLED® lamp. This study demonstrated 
significant efficac y on extremities, trunk and neck that compare favorably with other  
treatment options. Thus, it can be assumed that Ameluz® in conjunction with BF -RhodoLED® 
may provide a new, safe and effective treatment op tion for mild to moderate AK on the 
extremities, trunk and neck as well.  
The Marketing Authorization Holder (Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH) intends to perform a 
Phase I study to obtain pharmacokinetic profiles of ALA and its metabolite PpIX in a single 
PDT applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA (458 mg ALA  in total ) in conjunction  with the BF -
RhodoLED® lamp in diseased subjects presenting with AK on the face and scalp as well as 
the periphery under maximal use conditions.  
4.2 Study rationale  
Given that extension of field s with chronic actinic sun damage can exceed the usually  treated 
area size of 20 -25 cm² (23), particularly when also taking  AK in the periphery into 
consideration, safe and efficient options for the treatment of these expanded AK areas are 
needed.  
FDA -approved tr eatment options for field -directed AK treatment comprise formulations 
containing ingenol mebutate or diclofenac/hyal uronic acid (3  %/2.5  %), most of which require 
repeated applications for up to several months  or lead to side effects related to cytotoxic 
and/or inflammatory reactions induced by [CONTACT_402427].  
Compared with other methods like surgery, abrasion, cryotherapy, and alternative topi[INVESTIGATOR_73211],  use of PDT is advantageous especially due to  the high selectivity of the treatment, 
but also based on  the short treatment period  that can be entirely controlled by [CONTACT_099] ,

relative clinical efficacy  of 10 different treatment modalities for mild to moderate AK on the 
face and scalp , including PDT products as well as formulations containing  cryotherapy,  5-
fluorouracil, imiquimod, ingenol mebutate or diclofenac/ hyaluronic acid , has shown that 
ALA  PDT using BF -[ADDRESS_507180] efficacious  treatment option  (25). 
Today, besides Ameluz®, one further  PDT product  containing ALA is available in the US 
market. Levulan® Kerastick® contains ALA at a concentration of 20  % and is provided as a 2 -
component system . Consequ ently, ALA has to  be dissolved immediately before use.  By [CONTACT_342529], 
use of Levulan® Kerastick® is restricted to lesion -directed treatment  of minimally to 
moderately thick AKs located on the face and scalp  as well as on upper extremities . Thus, 
Ameluz® is the only PDT product available in the US market which has been approved for the 
field-directed treatment of AKs.   
So far, availability of clinical data  for the treatment of large  AK areas is limited. However, 
several studies for treatment of AK area s >[ADDRESS_507181] indicat ed good 
efficacy and tolerability  (26–29). Therefore , PDT may represent an adequate option for the 
treatment of extended cancerous fields preventing long treatment duration  with sequential  
treatment sessions .  
For these reasons, t his exploratory study aims at obtaining pharmacokinetic profiles of ALA 
and its metabolite PpIX after a single PDT treatment with BF -200 ALA in subjects with 
actinic keratosis in an expanded treatment field of 60  cm² located on the face/scalp or in the 
periphery , applying approx. 458 mg ALA in total (7.8 mg ALA/cm²) . In addition , subjects’ 
safety/tolerability during and after treatment  will be assessed .  
4.3 Risk /benefit analysis  
This open -label  Phase I s tudy will include diseased subject s presenting with at least 12 AK 
lesions with diameter of ≥ 4 mm  within the 60 cm2 treatment field . All participa nts will 
receive active BF-200 ALA treatment  - already marketed for the treatment of AK in the US, 
EU, Switzerland and Israel under the brand name [CONTACT_402475]® - in combination with  
conventional red-light PDT  illumination . 
Clinical efficacy and safety of BF -[ADDRESS_507182] s comprising 462 subjects  (2674 lesions) exposed to BF -200 ALA  
(7.8%  ALA) (30–32). Additional ly, one confirmatory intra -individual study (ALA -AK-
CT010) with 50 subjects was performed for the assessment of clinical efficacy and safety of 
BF-200 ALA for the  treatment of AKs located on extremities  or trunk/neck . In these pi[INVESTIGATOR_402377], complete clearance of subjects [ADDRESS_507183] PDT  with BF -200 ALA 
was shown  to be up to 61.8 % and total lesion clearance was up to  84.2 % (30–32). Thus, we 
expect that a comparable percentage  of participating subjects  will benefit from the single PDT 
treatment which will be administered  in the current study . 
In previous clinical trials with BF-200 ALA , local application site  reactions were observed in 
84-100 % of the subjec ts. These reactions are expected, given the therapeutic principle of 
PDT, which is based on phototoxic effects. The most common signs and symptoms were 
application site erythema , pain/burning , irritation, and edema. Most adverse reactions

- confidential    -                                              page  25 of 84 occur red during illumination or shortly afterwards. Symptoms were  usually of mild or 
moderate intensity (investigator’s assessment on a 4 -point scale ) and  lasted for [ADDRESS_507184] cases; however , in some cases, they  persist ed for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer. It is 
known that t he intensity of AEs depend s on the type of illumination used for PDT and 
correlate s with the higher clearance rate achieved by [CONTACT_402428], e.g. 
BF-RhodoLED®. In rare cases, adverse reactions may require interruption or discontinuation 
of the illumination.   
Common adverse effects of PDT with BF-200 ALA include headache and reactions at the 
application site, such as abnormal sensation, increased sensitivity to pain,  discomfort , erosion , 
and discharge . More detailed information on known adverse reactions is provided in the 
prescribing information (PI)  for Ameluz® (19). This drug is co ntraindicated in subject s with 
known hypersensitivity to ALA, to porphyrins or to any excipi[INVESTIGATOR_402378]®, and in 
subject s with porphyria or photodermatoses.  
It is assumed that local adverse reactions in more extended treatment fields  will be similar to 
those known from treatment of AK lesions as well as cancerous fields  described previously . 
Nonetheless, an appropriate form of pain management has to be considered  as PDT pain may 
be related to  the size of the treatment field( s) (33). For this reason, pain management will be 
performed according to est ablished guidelines (34,35) but restrictions for co -medication 
described in this protocol must be taken into  consideration.   
In this study, inclusion and exclusion criteria have been chosen to minimize possible risks due 
to the administration of BF-200 ALA , and to ensure  a uniform study population. BF-200 ALA 
and the PDT lamp BF -RhodoLED® will be handled by [CONTACT_402429]. 
For maximal comparability to previous studies, up to two BF-RhodoLED® lamp s will be used 
simultaneously, such that the light dose of 37  J/cm2 will be applied to the entire 60 cm2 
treatment field in 10  min.

5.1 Primary objective s 
The primary objective s of the study are:  
• Assessment of baseline -adjusted plasma concentration -time curve s for ALA after a 
single PDT treatment applying 3 tubes of BF -200 ALA  in conjunction with the BF -
RhodoLED® under maximal use conditions in subjects with mild to severe actinic 
keratosis.  
• Assessment of baseline -adjusted plasma concentration -time curve s for PpIX after a 
single PDT treatment applying 3 tubes of BF -200 ALA in conjunction with the BF -
RhodoLED® under maximal use c onditions in subjects with mild to severe actinic 
keratosis.  
Data will be analyzed  overall and according to strata ( treatment area : face/scalp or periphery 
(neck/ trunk/ extremities) ). 
5.2 Secondary objective s 
The secondary objective of this study is to  calculat e pharmacokinetic parameters based on 
baseline -adjusted plasma concentration data of ALA and PpIX  (if data permits ) and to 
evaluate  the safety  and tolerability of PDT with BF-200 ALA under maximal use conditions . 
Pharmacokinetics:  
The secondary objectives of the study regarding pharmacokinetics include:  
• Evaluation of baseline -adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters of ALA . 
• Evaluation of baseline -adjusted pharmacokinetic parameters of PpIX .

subject last visit.  
6.3 Definitions  
Definition of treatment area : 
For this study , the treatment area  is a body region to be treated with PDT . The following 
treatment areas will be investigated:  
• Face/scalp: the whole face (except the upper and lower eyelids, the lip area (not past 
the vermilion border) and the nostrils) and the bald scalp  
• Periphery: any p art of the extremities and/or trunk/neck excluding the genitalia 
(minimal  distance of about 1 cm)  
Definition of illumination area:  
The illumination area is the area effectively illuminated by [CONTACT_402415] -RhodoLED® lamp  
(6 cm x 16 cm) in one illumination session . In this study, up to two illumination areas can be 
illuminated simultaneously  using two BF -RhodoLED® lamps . 
Definition of treatment field(s)  
The treatment field is defined as the field to which medicinal product is applied .  
In this study, at least 12 distinctive AK lesions (each with a diameter of ≥ 4 mm) within one 
or several treatment field(s) located either within the treatment area face/scalp or within the 
treatment area periphery will be treated with PDT.  
The treatment field(s) may be discontinuous and several patches within the same treatment 
area can be combined to form a total area of approximately 60 cm2. In case of discontinuous 
treatment field(s), all patches must be located within up to two illumination areas of the BF -
RhodoLED® lamp (6 cm x 16 cm each). Lesions included in the study should be entirely 
located within the treatment field(s), leaving a minimal distance of ≥ 0.5 cm of the lesion 
margin to the treatment field border.  
The location of all treatment field(s) and suggest ed illumination area(s) should be clearly 
marked in the graphic templates (cartoon and grid foil) for re -identification during the course 
of the study. The investigator will also describe treatment field(s), illumination area(s) and 
lesions in source data and the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
  
Clinical Study Protocol    17-Jan-[ADDRESS_507191] s 
The suggested sample size for the study is 32 subjects, stratified into 2 groups of 16 subjects 
each.  Based on the results of a previous PK study, a group  size of 12 subjects is considered to 
be sufficient  for proper pharmacokinetic evaluation  which is also in agreement with FDA 
guidance  (36). In order to compensate for  poten tial drop -outs of subjects as well as potentially  
higher variability  of data due to combined investigation of two treatment area s, the stratum  
size was adapted from [ADDRESS_507192] meet the following criteria:  
1. Subjects with at least 12 distinctive and clinically confirmed mild to severe AK lesions 
(according to  Olsen  et al. 1991  (37)) with a diameter of ≥ 4 mm each, on either the 
face/scalp (including forehead, excluding eyes, nostrils, ears, and mouth) or the 
neck/trunk/extremities, within treatment field (s) of about 60  cm² in total.  Treatment 
field(s) may be discontinuous but must be within 2 illumination areas of the BF -
RhodoLED® lamp (6  cm x 16 cm each).  
2. All genders 18 -85 years of age (inclusive).  
3. Willingness and ability of the subject to provide  informed consent and to sign the

have to be immediately announced to the monitor and the sponsor, and study medication 
cannot be used unless sponsor’s release for this specific event was given.  
Transport of study medication  to the study site will be temperature -controlled. Th e control of 
correct transport and measures to be taken in case of deviations are in the responsibility of 
Biofrontera Pharma GmbH. Each delivered study medication cannot be used unless released 
by [CONTACT_3211].  
The BF -RhodoLED® study lamps must  be stored  inacc essible  to unauthorized persons.  
8.3 Application of BF-200 ALA  
Treatment field(s)  will be localized and documented as described in Section  6.3. A treatment 
field does not necessarily have to be continuous, but  (discontinuous) treatment field (s) should 
cover a total area of approximately [ADDRESS_507202] allow illumination in a single step (see 
Section  7.3 and 8.4). 
AK lesions located outside the specified treatment field(s) will not be considered for treatment 
in this  study . For treatment of these AK lesions, subjects will be referred to a licensed 
dermatologist after the end of the clinical trial for follow up care.  
Treatment field (s) should be prepared for drug application by [CONTACT_402433] (using ethanol or 
isopropanol), removal of all scabs and crusts, and if appropriate roughening of the surface, 
(e.g. by [CONTACT_402434])  within 1  h before application of the study 
medication . Care should be taken to avoid bleedings. Therefore, special care has to be taken 
when screen ed subjects  report non -significant acquired or inherited coagulation defects and/or 
receive treatment with e.g.100  mg acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. ASS) per day or warfarin . 
After this preparation, 3 tubes of BF-200 ALA  will be administered  to the entire  60 cm² 
treatmen t field(s), covering the skin with a film of approximately 1  mm thickness. The 
application will be performed  using glove -protected fingertips or a spatula . Care should be 
taken to avoid that the study medication is applied to the upper and lower eyelids, t he lip area 
(not past the vermilion border), in the nostrils or near genitalia (keep a distance of about 1cm).  
In case of accidental contact [CONTACT_402435] -[ADDRESS_507203] 5  min will be performed.  
The gel will be allowed to dry for approximately 10  min, before a n occlusive,  light-blocking  
dressing (e.g. TegadermTM dressing plus aluminum foil) will be placed over the treatment 
field(s) . The subject  should stay in a n environment with comfortable temperatu re during 
incubation time. It is particularly important to ascertain that extremities will not be cold 
during the 3  h incubation. After the incubation time of 3  h ± 10 min, the occlusive, light-
blocking dressing will be removed and the rem aining  gel should  be wiped off.  
The following information  concerning  this procedure will be documented  in the subjects ’ 
eCRF : 
• preparation of treatment field(s) including lesions within one hour prior to dosing  
• occurrence of bleedings in the application area  
• unique I MP number (on subject package  and allocated tube s)

8.4 Illumination with BF -RhodoLED® 
After removal of remaining gel, the entire treatment field (s) will be illuminated using  BF-
RhodoLED®, until a total light dose of approximately 37  J/cm2 is achieved. During 
illumination, the lamp (s) will be positioned at a distance of 5 -8 cm from the skin surface as 
indicated in the user manual.   
In case of  discontinuous treatment field(s) that may not be covered by [CONTACT_941] 96 cm² 
(6 cm x 16 cm) illumination field of a singular device , two BF -RhodoLED® lamps are used 
simultaneously, such that for the entire 60 cm² surface only one illumination step is 
performed.  
The calibration of the lamp e nsures that the skin area illuminated receives a total light dose of 
37 J/cm2 (an illumination time of 10  min) at a distance of [ADDRESS_507204] be 
confirmed and documented that the specified  illumination time  and distance between the lamp 
and th e treatment field(s)  have been met. Otherwise, reasons for not meeting the requirements 
must be provided. The lamp is programmed to automatically provide a total illumination time 
of [ADDRESS_507205] two BF-
RhodoLED® lamp s. All site personnel handling the lamp will be instructed properly on the 
handling a nd usage of the lamp, according to the user manual.  
During illumination, subjects and medical personnel must wear suitable protective eye 
goggles, even if PDT is performed in areas where little light reaches the subject’s eyes.   
Detailed handling and operating instructions as well as a list of warnings and precautions 
when handling BF -RhodoLED® can be derived from the user manual.  
Discomfort and pain during PDT are caused by [CONTACT_402436] . Although 
the emitted  light is in the visible  red spectrum and has no emission  in the (heat -transmitting)  
infra -red spectrum , subjects may have the feeling of being burned. The latter is caused by a 
generally harmless, but in some subjects very unpleasant, biochemical reaction during PDT  
which may be  enhanced by a strong psychological component.  
As pain experienced during PDT will be evaluated by [CONTACT_402437], the PDT 
should be started without measures to relieve pain. In cases where the pain is regarded as 
unbearable by [CONTACT_70579] t, pain relieving measures as outlined in Section 9.[ADDRESS_507206] should be informed about restrictions  defined in  Table 4 and in Section 9.2. 
A surgical dressing of the treated area is normally not required  and should be avoided

o Severe cases of pain  might require to briefly  interrupt illumination, e.g. to 
inject a local, fast -acting anesthetic, such as xylocaine  or to cool briefly with 
cooling packages . 
• Treatment of pain and discomfort after PDT  
o Cooling the illuminated area(s) with wet or refrigerated  compresses  
o Analgesic treatment with acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol®) 
Cooling compresses and acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol®) should be offered by [CONTACT_402444].  
Further treatment s are also allowed for the management  of pain and discomfort but should be 
used as a second line treatment option : 
o Topi[INVESTIGATOR_11977] s 
o Topi[INVESTIGATOR_402390] 2.5  % outside  the treatment field(s)  
All concom itant treatments  underwent/ taken during the study must be documented in source  
data and on the appropriate pages of the eCRF along with the indication, single  dose, route of

The fo llowing informations will be obtained as demographic data  from all participants  at 
screening visit : 
• Gender  
• Age 
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Height  
• Weight  
• BMI  
 
10.2.2  Clinical criteria for diagnosis of AK  
Lesions will be considered AK if they present clinically as rough, crusted, flesh -colored to 
reddish -brown papules, or with an adherent scale in a field of sun -damaged skin  (39–41). 
AK lesion severity will be evaluated according to the Olsen Severity Grading  (37) as follows:  
• No AK/grade 0  i.e. no AK lesion present, neither visible nor palpable  
• Mild/ grade  1 AK lesions  should present flat, pi[INVESTIGATOR_402395]. The  lesions should be slightly palpable, with AK better 
felt than seen.  
• Moderate/ grade  2 AK lesions  should present as pi[INVESTIGATOR_402396]. These AK lesions should be 
moderately thick and can be easily seen and felt.  
• Severe/ grade  3 AK lesions  should present as very thick plaques with hyperkeratotic 
surface. These AK lesions should be very thick and/or obvious.  
10.2.3  Assessment of target lesions  
In this clinical trial,  AK lesions of mild to severe intensity (according to  Olsen  et al. , 1991  
(37)), of which at least 12 lesions are of a diameter of ≥ 4 mm at screening , will be treated 
with (field -directed) PDT.  AK lesions should be distinguishable; however, no distance 
restrictions between lesions  will be applied.  
All lesions within the treatment field(s) have to be counted. For circular or almost circular 
lesions with a diameter of ≥ 4 mm its location, (e.g. upper arm, forehead), severity and size 
(diameters) must be documented. For non -circular lesions, the largest diameter and the 
corresponding perpendicular diameter will be measured and the mean diameter will be 
calculated and documented.

A seru m pregnancy test ( β-human chorionic gonadotropin  (β-hCG ) test) will be performed at 
screening ( Visit  1) and Visit 3 . At PDT -visit (Visit 2 ), a urine dip -stick pregnancy test  will be 
performed . 
 
Adverse events  
During the study, all (S)AEs have to be recorded  as outlined in Section 11. If possible, each 
subject should be assessed by [CONTACT_31722]/sta ff personnel  throughout the study .  
 
Assessment  of pain at the application site during PDT  
At Visit 2, s ubject s will assess the pain experienced during PDT  using an 11 -point Numeric 
Rating Scale (NRS -11) ranging from 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst possible pain). This score 
should reflect the subject ’s respective maximum pain during PDT (see Appendix B). 
Importantly, pain during PDT has to be documented in pain eCRF (as result of NRS -11) and 
also as AE (see 11.1.1 ). 
For document ation  on the AE eCRF page , the NRS -[ADDRESS_507231] should 
be transformed as follows: pain 1 -3 = mild, 4 -7 = moderate, 8 -10 = severe.  
 
Application site reactions  
The term application site reaction encompasses all reactions occuring in the treatment field(s) 
after starting PDT treatment and can be subclassified into the more specific categories 
applica tion site discomfort and application site skin reactions.  
  
Application site discomfort  
At Visit 2, application site  discomfort during  and after PDT , and at the phone call and V isit 3 
application site  discomfort after  PDT  will be assessed  asking non -leading q uestions like 
“Have you noticed anything in the treatment surrounding areas since we last saw you?” Any 
signs or symptoms reported by [CONTACT_402446] 11.1.1 .

• Burning  
• Pain 
• Itching

Application site skin reactions  
Application site  skin reactions in the treatment field(s) will be evaluated separately by [CONTACT_1275] (or equally qualified physicians) in source and on the AE eCRF page  at the 
clinical  visit after PDT  (Visit 3). The AE intensity grading should be used (see section 
11.1.1 ). In addition to the investigator assessments  of application site  skin reactions during  
and after  PDT  at Visit [ADDRESS_507232] ’s treatment field (s) by a designated member of the study team  during  
Visit  2 and Visit 3 (and documented in source data and on AE eCRF page).  Intensity 
assessment will follow the AE intensity  grading  (see section 11.1.1 ).

The consumption of alcoholic beverages should be moderate. In this study, moderate alcohol 
consumption is defined in accordance to the “Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015 -2020 ” 
(42) as drinking up to 1 drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.  One 
alcoholic drink -equivalent is defined as containing 14 grams (0.6  fl oz) of pure alcohol.  
Subjects should not smoke more than 10 cigar ettes/day  or equivalent . The use of certain 
concomitant medications is restricted. For further information see Section s [ADDRESS_507233] me dical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. This includes any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness that develops or worsens during the clinical  
study whether or not related  to the investigational products and the study procedures.  
For the purpose of the study, c linically significant  abnormal results of diagnostic procedures 
including abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. requiring unscheduled diagnostic procedures or 
treatment measures or resulting in withdrawal from the study) discovered at screening will be 
related to medical history or are considered to be AEs  if they are detected post screening . Any 
AEs first occurred or worsened in severity post treatment are considered as treatment -
emergent adverse event (TEAE) .  
 
Maximum severity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:  
• Mild : For example, an AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate : For example, an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
• Severe : For example, an AE which is incapacitating and prevents normal everyday 
activities.  
Worsening of a sign or symptom of the condition under treatment  will be recorded as AE and 
if this worsening  matches  any criterion for an “SAE”, it must be recorded as such ( see Section 
11.1.2 ). 
Examples of AEs include one of the following or a combination of two or more of these 
factors:  
• A new sign, symptom, illness, or syndrome.  
• Worsenin g of a concomitant or pre -existing illness.  
• An effect of the I MP or concomitant medication . 
• An effect of the IMD , if applicable  
• An effect of an invasive procedure required by [CONTACT_760].  
• An accident or injury.  
AEs can be categorized as “non -serious” and “serious” ( see Section 11.1.2 ). 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to 
these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was (were) known before the study period  (see 
Clinical Study Protocol    17-Jan-2020  
ALA -AK-CT015  Version 2.0

reported as medical history.  
11.1.2  Serious adverse events  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it resul ts in 
any of the following outcomes : 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
“Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
This means that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402397], or that they occurred as a consequence of the 
event.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant 
and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions”.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above 
occurred.  
Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402398]. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasia, or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
A diagnosis of a second cancer during a treatment should be considered as medically 
important.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itse lf, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that

regulatory reporting obligations.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_507234] to reporting as alert terms in this study.  
For details on known adver se reactions see Ameluz® PI (19) and c orresponding IB . 
Although not regarded as an SAE, any pregnancy in a subject occurring d uring treatment with 
the investigational products  must be reported to the sponsor immediately. Information related 
to the pregnancy must be given on a “Pregnancy report form” that will be provided by [CONTACT_103]. This information must be provided regardles s of the decision to withdraw the subject 
from the study or discontinue the treatment.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_507235] be reported to the sponsor.  
11.1.5  Investigational medical device complaints  
All AEs reported in  previous studies  were not directly related to BF -RhodoLED® but rather  to 
the medication or PDT. Therefore, we do not expect any AEs affecting subjects or third 
persons (e.g. study personnel)  that relate directly to BF -RhodoLED® also referred to as 
Medical Device Effects (ADEs), provided that it is properly used as described in the user 
manual.  
Nevertheless , if occurring  ADEs as well as technical complaints associated with the medical 
device BF -RhodoLED® must be reported to the sponsor  and IRB (in cases of (U)SADEs)  
ADEs reported by [CONTACT_941] t reated subject must be reported via the eCRF and on the AE log.  
11.2 Period of AE collection  
Collection of AEs starts with signing the informed consent documents until the end  of the 
study. AEs will be discriminated as AEs and TEAEs.  
• AEs developi[INVESTIGATOR_402399] 2 with a suspected causal 
relationship to any study procedures will be considered and documented as an AE.  
• Collection of TEAEs extends from Visi t 2 (baseline) until end of the study at Visit 3.  
• If the investigators detect an SAE in a subject after end of study, and considers the 
event possibly related to prior study treatment or procedures, they should report this 
event to the pharmacovigilance department of the sponsor (see section 11.3.1 ). 
11.[ADDRESS_507236] be documented in 
accordance with the instruc tions for the completion of AE reports in clinical studies. If 
possible, AEs should be assigned to be either unrelated (corresponding to unrelated or 
unlikely related) or related (corresponding to probably, possibly or definitely related)  to the

or the PDT lamp.  
The following approach will be taken for documentation:  
• All AEs  (whether serious or non -serious ) must be documented throughout the study . 
• If the AE  is serious ( see Section 11.1.2 ), the investigator must complete, in addition to 
the “Adverse Event” page in the eCRF, a “ SAE report ” form at the time the  SAE is 
detected. This form must be marked as “initial” and be sent immediately (within 24  h) 
to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance department by [CONTACT_71345] (according to 
Biofrontera’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)). SAEs must be identified as such 
in eCRF by [CONTACT_402449].  
• When a “significant overdose” of I MP occurs without an AE or in other situations 
where the sponsor requires an expedited report without an AE ( see Section 11.1.3 ), the 
investigator should only complete a “Serious Adverse Event/Expedited Report from a 
Clinical Trial for Combination products” form. It should be clearly stated that no 
adverse even t was observed. Instructions on where to send this form will be provided. 
In this case, there is no need to complete the “Adverse Event” page in the eCRF.  
• The following details regarding AEs are required:  
- confirmed medical diagnosis  or symptoms (if applic able)  
- location (inside/outside treatment field(s))  
- time frame (by [CONTACT_402450]/stop date and time)  
-  intensity ( see Section 11.1.1 )  
- outcome  
- seriousness criteria (if applicable), and  
- if the AE is related to I MP only, IMD  only, or cannot be ambiguously assigned 
to one of both.  
• The causality/relatedness of AEs has to be assessed:  
- UNRELATED : AEs that are judged to be clearly and incontrovertibly due to a 
cause other than the I MP/IMD  and study procedure (concurrent illness etc.).  
- UNLIKELY RELATED : the temporal sequence is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], and the AE does 
not follow a known pattern  of response to I MP/IMD  another causative factor is 
present but causal role of the study drug cannot be excluded.  
- POSSIBLY RELATED : either an event that is temporally associated with the 
use of the I MP/IMD  or a known pharmacological effect/associated react ion, 
which is also recognized with another concomitant therapy/illness or other 
external cause.  
- PROBABLY RELATED : appropriate temporal association, known 
pharmacological effect, recognized to be an associated I MP/IMD  reaction and 
for which no other possibl e cause is evident.

previously (i.e. positive re -challenge) and there is an appropriate temporal 
relationship between therapy and reaction; and the reaction follows a known or 
expected respons e pattern to the suspected drug.  
The investigator should use medical judgment to determine whether he/she assumes a 
reasonable causal relationship, including into his/her evaluation all relevant factors and 
factual evidence such as  
- temporal course and late ncy 
- results from re -challenge  
- pattern of the reaction  
- known pharmacological properties of the product  
- and alternative explanations (e.g. other drugs, medical history, concomitant 
diseases).  
Every attempt should be made to describe the AE in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear diagnosis 
has been made, individual signs and symptoms will not be recorded as separate AEs unless 
they represent atypi[INVESTIGATOR_49197], in which case they should 
be documented as separate events. In the case of SAEs or SARs, respectively, component 
signs and symptoms may be recorded in addition to a diagnosis if they further clarify the 
clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be 
recorded individually.  
All s ubjects who have AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the I MP and/or the 
IMD  or not, should be monitored to determine the outcome. The clinical course of the AE will 
be followed up according to accepted standards of medical practice, even aft er the end of the 
study , until a satisfactory explanation is found, or the investigator considers it medically 
justifiable to terminate the follow -up. Should the AE result in death, a full pathologist’s report 
should be supplied, if possible.  
11.3.1  Immediate rep orting  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of SAEs  to sponsor  
SAEs observed throughout the study  must be documented on a n “SAE report” form  in 
accordance with instructions for completing the “SAE report” form . This form and the 
instructions will be provided in the investigator file and must be completed and supplied 
immediately (within 24  h) to the sponsor (21CFR§ 312.32, 21CFR§ 312.64).  
Any SAE that occurs throughout the study , whether or not related to the I MP or the medical 
device, must be reported by [CONTACT_19452] [ADDRESS_507237] data : 
Email:

The initial report must be as complete as possible, including detai ls of the current illness and 
(serious) AE, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the IMP or 
IMD  or study procedures.

laboratory values  received after the report) must be documented on a n “SAE report” form , 
with the box “Follow -up”/”Final report” . 
The instructions for completing the “SAE report” form  give more detailed guidance on the 
reporting of SAEs, and AEs initially reported as non -serious that become serious. In the latter 
situation, when a non -serious event becomes serious, details must be forwarded immediately  
(within 24  h) to the sponsor on a n “SAE report” form . 
Pregnancies occurring during a subject's participation in the study, although not typi[INVESTIGATOR_402400], must be notified to the sponsor within the same timelines as an SAE (within 
24 h after becoming aware of the pregnancy) on a pregnancy notification form. Further 
treatment will be addressed on a case -by-case basis wi th the treating physician and the 
investigator.  
Any pregnancy should be followed up until completion. If relevant, the development of the 
newborn will be monitored for an appropriate time post -delivery.  
The drug safety department of the sponsor or designee  has to be notified by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail.  
The sponsor will ensure that all legal reporting requirements to the competent authorities and 
the IRB(s) are met.  
Note:  
For regulatory reporting purposes, events which are assessed by [CONTACT_3174] “unrelated” or 
“unlikely related” to the study medication will be considered as having no reasonable causal 
relation and will not be reported on an expedited basis.  
Events assessed by [CONTACT_3174] “possibly, probably or definitely related” will be considered 
as having a p lausible causal relation to the study medication and will be reported if they are 
also considered unexpected and serious.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of [LOCATION_003]DEs to the sponsor  and to IRB 
Events which can be clearly assigned to the IMD  and which are assessed by [CONTACT_402451] “possibly, probably or definitely related” to the IMD  and which are both serious and 
unanticipated will be considered as unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE). A 
report of any [LOCATION_003]DE  occurring during an investigation shall be submitted t o the reviewing 
IRB and the sponsor within [ADDRESS_507238] (21 
CFR §812.150).  
In case a serious and unexpected event cannot  be clearly assigned to the IMD , it should be 
treated as an SAE ( see S ection  11.1.2 ). 
Note: Reporting of [LOCATION_003]DEs to the sponsor is equal to SAE reporting described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of expeditable adverse events to IRB  
The investigator will promptly forward IND safety reports received from sponsor (see section 
11.4.2 ) and report all un anticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others, and 
changes in the research activity to the IRB.

Expectedness of serious AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_402452] (RSI). Any updates or substantial amendments will be 
considered accordingly. The RSI for the investigational products will be included in the IB 
‘ALA -AK-CT015 -IB’ in section 7.2.  
Unexpected: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed 
in the RSI or is not listed with the specificity or severity that ha s been observed. Unexpected, 
as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned 
in the RSI as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the drug, but are not speci fically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug 
under investigation.  
11.4.2  Reporting of expeditable  adverse events to competent authorities and 
investigators  
The sponsor will report all serious and unexpected AEs, which are judged by [CONTACT_402453] a reasonable suspected causal relationship (suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction - S[LOCATION_003]R) as IND safety reports to the FDA and all participating investigators 
according to applicable law.  
The sponsor will also report [LOCATION_003]DEs to the FDA, all reviewing IRBs and to all investigators . 
11.4.3  Periodic reporting of adverse events by [CONTACT_3211]  
A summary of all Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety reports will be incl uded in the 
progress report submitted annually to the competent authorities within [ADDRESS_507239] (14 June, in agreement with authorities). The 
same report will also be submitted to the IRB(s) to ensure a conti nuing review of the project.

following reasons:  
• At their own request (withdrawal of informed consent).  
• If, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
subject’s well -being.  
In all cases, the reas on for and date of withdrawal must be documented. Subjects can 
withdraw consent at any time of the study without being obliged  to specify a reason for their 
withdrawal. In case of an AE causing the withdrawal of consent , the AE has to be 
documented as caus e of withdrawal.  
As far as possible, all examinations scheduled for the final study day should be performed on 
all subjects who receive the I MP but who do not complete the study according to protocol.  
For subjects that may not be treated due to screening failures or who decide to terminate the 
study prior to treatment , at least the following parameters must be documented in the eCRF:

Any decision for exclusion of individual subjects  from an analysis population will be made 
before database lock in a data review meeting; Documentation concerning which subjects are 
to be excluded from an  analysis population will be prepared and reported, i.e., as data review 
minutes.  
Enrolled set  
All subjects enrolled in this study i.e. that provided informed consent to participate in the 
study.  
Treated  set  
All subjects that received IMP treatment  (including subjects whose PDT treatment was 
terminated for any reason without illumination) . This set is the analysis set for the summary 
of subject discontinuation.  
Safety set  
The safety set (SAF) will include all subjects who undergo at least o ne of the following 
treatment procedures: preparation of the treatment field(s) , application of BF -[ADDRESS_507243]  dose pharmacokinetic sample (i.e., samples taken after the application of BF -
200 ALA)  for the resp ective analyte . A post  dose sample is regarded evaluable if the plasma 
concentration is at or above LLOQ .  
As plasma concentration data of ALA and PpIX are considered separately, e.g., a subject can 
be in the pharmacokinetic set for evaluation of PpIX but not for evaluation of ALA.  
Subjects who develop bleeding during preparation of the treatment area are not to b e excluded 
from the pharmacokinetic set.  
14.[ADDRESS_507244] dev iation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) (if 
appropriate), median as well as minimum and maximum.  
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters and plasma concentrations for ALA and 
PpIX additionally included the geometric mean , geometric SD, and geometric CV . If a zero 
occurs in a sample, the corresponding geometric mean and geometric SD will be computed, 
omitting this value.  
Clinical Study Protocol    17-Jan-[ADDRESS_507245] s in each analysis set such as the enrolled set, the treated set, 
the SAF, the pharm acokinetic set for ALA and PpIX, respectively,  will be presented.  
Premature discontinuation from the study and completion of the study will be summarized. 
Reasons for discontinuation will be tabulated.   
PDT details (e.g. incubation time of the IMP, duration of illumination, interruptions/pauses, 
interf erences) and sampling time points for PK blood samples will be presented  overall and 
by [CONTACT_1534] . 
Demographics and background characteristics  
All variables concerning demographic and background characteristics will be summar ized to 
describe the study population.   
Concomitant medications will be coded according to Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
Classification System (ATC) and number and frequency of subjects with previous or 
concomitant medication will be summarized.

All safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively and in an exploratory way. These safety 
analyses will be performed  for the safety set.  Safety analyses will be conducted overall and 
according to strata.  
AEs will be coded according to the latest M edical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version available at the day of database closure. The analysis will focus on the 
TEAEs. TEAEs will be summarized and tabulated according to primary system organ class 
and preferred term. TEAEs leading to  death and TEAEs resulting in discontinuation of study 
will be tabulated using frequency tables if a reasonable number of AEs of this type are 
observed.   
A listing of subject s with AEs will be provided for all AEs reported and all subjects  enrolled.  
The f requency of application site  skin reactions and of application site  discomfort will be 
presented overall and per strata. The mean and the maximal pain score (NRS -11) and the 
respective confidence intervals (CIs)  will be presented overall and per strata.  
All laboratory values will be classified as normal or abnormal according to the laboratory’s 
normal ranges and indicated as clinically significant or non-clinically siginificant  by [CONTACT_1275]. Out of range laboratory values that are considered clinic ally significant will be 
documented in the medical history (Visit 1) or as AEs (Visit 3) and listed as such.  
The analyses of variables for vital signs will focus on the evaluation of the change from 
baseline to the scheduled time point after baseline. Des criptive analysis (number of subjects, 
mean, median and SD, minimum, maximum) of the time course and of changes from baseline 
to post  baseline time point will be presented.

lymph nodes, thorax including heart and lung , abdomen, and musculoskeletal, peripheral 
vascular and nervous system . All clinically significant abnormal physical findings will be 
listed. Details of further analyses will be specified in the statisti cal analysis plan ( SAP).  
Pharmocokinetics  
Descriptive statistics of unadjusted and baseline -adjusted plasma concentrations for ALA and 
PpIX by [CONTACT_402457].  
The following graphics will be provided for ALA and PpIX:  
• Geometric mean concentrations (unadjusted and baseline -adjusted) will be given on 
linear and logarithmic concentration scale.  
• Individual concentrations (unadjusted and baseline -adjusted) will be provided overall 
for each subject  on linear and logarithmic c oncentration scale (by -patient plot).  
• Individual concentrations (unadjusted and baseline -adjusted) will be provided according 
to strata for each subject on linear and logarithmic concentration scale (by -patient plot).   
For unadjusted concentrations, the  mean overall  baseline concentration will be  presented as a 
dotted line in the overall graphic, and the respective average  baseline of all subjects will be 
presented in  the corresponding  by-patient plots . 
Descriptive statistics of calcu lated PK parameter for ALA and PpIX will be provided overall 
and according to strata.  
14.4 Handling of missing data  
Missing data of safety or pharmacokinetics variables will not be replaced.  Details on the 
handling of missing data will be specified in the SAP.   
14.5 Interim analysis  
No formal interim analysis will be performed.  
14.6 Sample size justification  
Thirty -two (32) subjects  will be included in this study , stratified into two groups of 16 
subjects each. One of the groups will receive PDT applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA in the 
face/scalp, the other group will receive PDT applying  3 tubes of BF -200 ALA on the 
neck/trunk/extremities.  
A previous PK Phase I stu dy under maximal use conditions in AK subjects with 1 tube of BF -
200 ALA (ALA -AK-CT006) had revealed homogeneous baseline -adjusted levels of ALA and 
PpIX in 12 subjects, with a CV of 53 -73% in the key pharmacokinetic parameters after drug 
application. As s tatistical evaluation of PK and safety is intended to be performed as 
descriptive statistics only, no calculation of predictive power is required.  
Based on the results of a previous PK study  (ALA -AK-CT006) , a group size of 12 subjects is 
considered to be sufficient for proper pharmacokinetic evaluation  and in agreement with the 
findings from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_27041] . In order to compensate for potential drop -outs of subjects as 
well as potentially  higher variability of data due to combined investigation of two treatment

15.1 Good clinical practice  
This study is to be conducted according to globally accepted standards of GCP (as defined in 
the ICH E6 (R2) Guideline for GCP), in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki in its 
current version  and in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_266738] r egulations.  
15.[ADDRESS_507246] information sheet will be made available. In addition, a n investigator/subinves tigator 
will carry out an oral information session during which the subjects will be given ample time 
and opportunity to clarify remaining questions.  
Afterwards, the subject or their legal representative and the investigator /subinvestigator  will 
sign the i nformed consent  form  (ICF). To grant direct access to the subject's original medical 
records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or data, without violating the 
confidentiality of the subject, the subject/legal representative will also sign an  agreement. 
Depending on the local leg al requirements this agreement can be part of the ICF or a separate 
form, such as the HIPAA form . The original signed ICF and, if applicable, HIPAA forms  will 
be archived in the ISF. The subject will receive a copy of these documents. The investigator 
will acknowledge instruction of every subject in accordance with the clinical  study protocol 
(CSP) and the existence of a signed consent and HIPAA form.  
Before valid consent has been ob tained  the subject will not undergo any study related 
procedures.  The investigator should inform the subject’s primary physician about the 
subject’s participation in the trial if the subject agrees to this.  
During the course of the trial, ICF may need to be updated and thus, requires re-consenting of 
subjects. The investigator /subinvestigator will inform every active trial participant in a timely 
manner and obtain updated  ICF in line with above mentioned obligations.  
15.[ADDRESS_507247]’s data will be collected for the clinical data base and 
analysis in a strictly pseudonymous form, i.e. using a subject number instead of the subject’s 
Clinical Study Protocol    17-Jan-[ADDRESS_507248]’s name 
[CONTACT_402478] [CONTACT_402458]’s name [CONTACT_402479].  
The investigator will maintain a personal subject identification lis t (subject numbers with the 
corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified.   
Subject identity and personal data will be safeguarded according to national requirements on 
data protection.  
The sponsor adheres to data protection regulations.  
15.[ADDRESS_507249] to be documented and explained by [CONTACT_1755] /or the 
sponsor. Major protocol deviations have to be escalated to the sponsor. If there is a legal 
requirement, the investigator needs to report major proto col deviations to the responsible 
ethics comm ittee ( EC)/IRB.  
The sponsor is obliged to report serious breaches (severe violations of GCP regulations as 
well as all events that affect to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental health of 
the subjects of the trial or the scientific value of the trial) to the IRB(s) and the applicable 
authorities.  
15.6 Protocol amendments  
The investigators cannot alter the protocol without the sponsor’s approval . If the sponsor 
amends the protocol all principal investigators need to agree to adhere to the amended 
protocol.  
In case of protocol changes that might affect the subjects ’ safety and well -being or the validity 
and integrity of the study data, the amendment is deemed substantial. Minor changes to the 
protocol, such as administrative changes, correction of typos  and inconsistencies  etc. stipulate 
a non -substantial amendment.

appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB(s) in charge. If applicable, the documents 
will also be submitted  to the authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements.  
All ethical and legal requirements must be met  before the sites can start enrolling subjects.  
A protocol amendment has to be submitted to the IEC/IRB and, if required, to the regulatory 
authority(ies). In case of a non -substantial amendment these bodies only will be notified but 
they need to approve any substantial amendment to the protocol before it can be implemented. 
Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether the subject informatio n leaflet and 
informed consent form should also be revised.  
The investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB(s) and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616](s). This also applies to any communication 
between the investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and the authorities.

Fitzpatrick´s Skin Type Test  
Fitzpatrick´s Skin Type according to Fitzpatrick , 1988 (38) 
 
One of the important parameters for the success of your treatment is the correct typi[INVESTIGATOR_402409].  
Skin type is often categorized according to the Fitzpatrick skin type scale, which ranges from 
very fair (skin type  I) to very dark (skin type  VI). The 2  main factors that influence skin type 
and the treatment program devised by [CONTACT_402471]:  
• Genetic disposition -Skin types I to III should add one level when you have blood 
relatives with darker skin type  IV or higher.  
• Reaction to sun exposure and tannin g habits.  
Skin type is determined genetically and is one of the many aspects of your overall appearance, 
which also includes color of eyes, hair, etc. The way your skin reacts to sun exposure is 
another important factor in correctly assessing your skin ty pe. Recent tanning (sun bathing, 
artificial tanning or tanning creams) have a major impact on the evaluation of your skin color.  
So, please help us determine your skin type to assist us in your treatment.

bacterial metabolite of dietary fiber (butyrate) may reduce colon tumor formation, and that the two in 
combination are even more effective than either alone. Several different mechanisms of action have been suggested. In humans, some epi[INVESTIGATOR_790742]-fiber

2. BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE 
Diet is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC) and several dietary constituents implicated in 
CRC are modified by [CONTACT_790764]. Microbial fermentation of dietary fiber produces short 
chain fatty acids (SCFA), e.g., acetate, propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847], and butyrate. Dietary fiber has been shown to reduce 
colon tumors in animal models and, in vitro , butyrate influences cellular pathways important to cancer 
risk. Further, work from our group suggests that the combined effects of butyrate and long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) found in cold-water, oily fish, may enhance the 
chemopreventive potential of these dietary constituents. We postulate that the relatively low intakes of n-
[ADDRESS_1089985] not 
been detected consistently in prospective cohort studies . We hypothesize that the combined effects of n-
3 PUFA supplementation and supplemental highly fermentable fiber will alter critical pathways important 
to CRC prevention, particularly intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated programmed cell death resulting from 
the accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ferroptosis), cell proliferation, and the 
eicosanoid/inflammation pathways.  
Gut bacteria ferment dietary fiber to butyrate and other SCFA.
1-[ADDRESS_1089986] 
synergistically  to enhance the chemopreventive potential above and beyond the contribution of butyrate 
alone, in part, by [CONTACT_790765]-4 (GPX-4)-dependent redox environment in the cell 
and increasing programmed cell death (ferroptosis).20-30   These results agree wi th a recent prospective, 
nested case-control study demonstrating significant CRC risk reduction among pescovegetarians, 
whose diets were high in both dietary fiber and n-3 PUFA-rich fish (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.82).31  We 
hypothesize that the combined effects of 35 g supplemental fiber, high in soluble fibers, and 6 g 
supplemental long chain n-3 PUFA (DHA + EPA) will alter pathways important to CRC prevention.  
This is a randomized, controlled crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] 40 healthy men and women (50-75 y) to 
compare supplemental soluble fiber (35 g/d) + supplemental n-3 PUFA (6 g/d EPA+DHA), in quantities 
mirroring mean daily intakes associated with lower CRC risk, with a maltodextrin and corn oil control 
(placebo). Stool samples will be collected at the beginning, middle (day 15), and end of each of the two 
30-day intervention periods. Using a novel, cost-effective, non-invasive approach, we will evaluate 
differences in global gene expression signatures in the stool exfoliome (i.e., sloughed colonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_790744]) using RNA-Seq.32  We will focus on pathways related to colonic cell proliferation and 
apoptosis/ferroptosis , cell phenotype, and inflammatory response. Further, we will evaluate changes in 
gut microbial functional genes involved in butyrate production using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The 
collection of multiple samples over the intervention periods will provide a critical measure of longitudinal 
changes in response to the supplemental n-[ADDRESS_1089987]-
effective, non-invasive approach to studying effects of interventions on the human gut.  
3. SPECIFIC AIMS, OBJECTIVES, ENDPOINTS: 
Aim 1: To test in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8688], in humans, effects of supplemental dietary fiber (35 g) and 
EPA+DHA (6 g) vs placebo on mRNA expression in exfoliated colonic cells. We hypothesize that fiber 
and n-3 PUFA supplementation will uniquely influence colonocyte proliferation and programmed cell 
death-related gene expression and signaling pathways. 
Aim 2:  To test whether response to the intervention differs by [CONTACT_790766]. We hypothesize that changes in colonocyte gene expression will be modified by [CONTACT_790767] x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 3 of 18 gut microbial capacity to ferment dietary fiber (i.e., SCFA-producing pathways), measured as 
butyrogenic potential EXW\U\O -CoA:acetate CoA-transferase ( but) + butyrate kinase ( buk) genes)/(total 
bacterial load 16S rRNA gene) assayed using digital drop PCR. 
Objectives and Endpoints:  
1. To determine whether the combination of supplem ental dietary fiber and EPA+DHA vs placebo 
affects mRNA expression in exfoliated colonic cells. The endpoint is mRNA expression profiles in 
the exfoliome. 
2. To determine whether gut microbial functional capacity related to fiber fermentation, as measured 
by [CONTACT_790768]-fermenting genes in stool bacteria, alters exfoliome mRNA expression 
response to the intervention on. The endpoint is mRNA expression profiles in the exfoliome. 
Implications:  This proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_790745] n-3 PUFA and prebiotic fiber exposure that modulate 
programmed cell death/CRC-related cell-signaling pathways through changes in the gut microbiome. Results of this human mechanistic controlled intervention will help to translate the current mechanistic 
knowledge from preclinical animal models to humans and to inform approaches for CRC prevention. 
Also, importantly, we will further evaluate the utility of interrogating the exfoliome as a novel, non-
invasive approach to studying effects of interventions on the human gut.  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
The study is designed as a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled dietary intervention of 
supplemental soluble fiber and supplemental n-[ADDRESS_1089988] a 60-day washout period between treatments.  
Stool samples will be collected at the beginning, middle (day 15) and end of each of the two 30-day intervention periods.  
 
 
 

Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version [ADDRESS_1089989] 4 months to complete the trial. Details of the activities and timeline:
4.a. Fiber and Fat Supplements The active treatment period will include supplemental soluble fiber (35 
g/d) + supplemental n-3 PUFA (6 g/d EPA+DHA).  
Supplemental Fiber: The soluble fiber with known ferment ation profiles will be provided by [CONTACT_790769] & Lyle, a 
well-established food and beverage ingredient company.  For placebo, we will use maltodextrin provided 
in the same packaging and by [CONTACT_81363]. 
Supplemental n-3 PUFA: We will use a commercial fish oil supplement (Omega Cure, Omega3 
Innovations), consumed as 2 vials daily. Each vial (11.75 g oil) delivers 3 g EPA +DHA in a 1:1 ratio. 
For placebo, we will use equivalent amounts of corn oil in visually identical packaging provided and by 
[CONTACT_81363].
All study supplements will be in packaged as daily doses.  At the study visits at the beginning and mid-
point of each study period, participants will receive a box with all the supplements needed to cover the 
time in between visits along with instructions regarding proper storage conditions (ie. the fish oil is to be 
refrigerated for better preservation.)  
4.b. Safety and Adverse Effects  Supplemental fiber (30-45 g/d) has been well-tolerated in short and 
long-term interventions (4 wks to 1-10 y).33-36In a study specifically designed to evaluate tolerance, 
individuals were given 10, 30 and 60 g/d of supplemental fiber for [ADDRESS_1089990] we propose to use, PROMITOR® Soluble Corn 
Fibre (SCF), has been well tolerated by [CONTACT_790770] 65 g/d.38, 39SCF, a glucose 
ROLJRVDFFKDULGHFRQWDLQLQJDPL[WXUHRIĮ -6, 1-4, 1-3, and 1-2 glucosidic linkages, has demonstrated 
prebiotic effects.40, 41Testing of SCF in an in vitro SHIME method that mimics human digestion showed 
that SCF is well fermented in the distal colon leading to positive effects on the GMC, and that these 
effects are translated to immunomodulatory properties and improved gut barrier.42Long-term trials (6-27 
months) designed to evaluate safety of supplemental n-3 PUFA up to 7 g/d have reported no adverse in 
general, and in bleeding complications specifically, even among patients at higher risk,43, 44  There is 
insufficient data to establish a tolerable upper intake for n-3 PUFA for any population group.45
4.c. Length of intervention periods and washout: Description and rationale.   Intervention Periods:  
Crypt turnover is 3.5 d and 4.2 d for the colon and rectum, respectively46and dietary n-3 PUFA are 

Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 5 of 18 incorporated into colonic cell membranes within 7 d.47 1-mo interventions with diet or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_790746]48 and down-stream colon biomarkers.49 Gut 
microbiome changes occur in 2-3 wks.3, 50, 51 Changes in gut mucosal cancer-risk biomarkers, the 
microbiome, and microbial metabolites were also seen in a short-term 2-wk intervention of fat and 
fiber.52 We hypothesize that changes in the gut microbiome influence colonic gene expression, thus 
conservatively we are using a 30-d period to allow sufficient time for both outcomes to change, while 
considering participant burden. Washout: The 60-d was hout will ensure that residual intervention effects 
from the previous period are eliminated. As mentioned, the gut epi[INVESTIGATOR_790747], but blood DHA+EPA clearance requires 45 d.53 
4.d. Monitoring and assessing adherence.  Participants will meet with study staff routinely to assess 
any difficulties with study adherence. n-3 PUFA are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_790748].54, 55 and 
there is high correlation between membrane PUFA and plasma phospholipid (PLFA) PUFA.56, 57  We will 
assess adherence to n-3 PUFA supplementation using plasma PLFA profiles ( Section C.4.a ) and by 
[CONTACT_790771], calculating adherence % (vials supplied - vials returned/days elapsed).58 
Adherence to supplemental fiber will be monitored by [CONTACT_464]. Participants will be instructed to return 
unconsumed fiber packets for weighing and consideration in intake determination. During the 
intervention, participants will complete daily forms to monitor adherence to the supplements.32

7.c. Questionnaires: Dietary Assessment  We will use an established, validated food frequency 
questionnaire (FFQ) to characterize food and nutrient intakes of the study participants over the 3 months prior to baseline to characterize habitual diets (typi[INVESTIGATOR_790749] n-3 PUFA and fiber and high in n-6 
PUFA).    Health and Demographics  will also be collected. A General Symptoms and Bowel Habits 
Questionnaire  will also be provided every time participants collect stool- this is a useful tool to 
determine intervention effects.  
8. LABORATORY PROCEDURES 
8.a. Plasma n-3 PUFA Assays  To confirm adherence to n-3 PUFA exposure, we will isolate total 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_790750] 0 and 30, trans-esterify, and measure EPA and DHA by 
[CONTACT_27199]/MS.[ADDRESS_1089996]. Robert Chapkin at [LOCATION_007] A&M. 
8.b. Host Gene Expression Using RNA-Seq  Poly A+ RNA will be isolated for exfoliated cells in stool 
as we describe.48, 60, 63 An Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer will be used to assess integrity of fecal poly A+ RNA  
as we described.64, [ADDRESS_1089997]. Robert Chapkin at [LOCATION_007] A&M. 
8.c. Fecal Microbiome Analysis Using ddPCR  We will extract genomic DNA from stool samples and 
use the QX200 ddPCR system (Bio-Rad) to quantify bacterial genes from the two major butyrate 
synthetic pathways, butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase ( but) and butyrate kinase ( buk) and total 
bacterial load (16S rRNA genes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and primer and probe set 
optimized for the selected genes.66-[ADDRESS_1089998] chosen this assay because it is more reliable, accurate, 
precise, and less prone to inhibition than qPCR. Butyrogenic potential of the microbiome will be defined 
DVEXW\U\O -CoA:acetate CoA-transferase ( but) + butyrate kinase ( buk) genes)/(total bacterial load 16S 
rRNA gene). 66-69 This work will be performed in the JLampe lab at Fred Hutch.  
9. DATA ANALYSIS 
9.a. Data entry and quality assurance procedures. We will code and enter data from questionnaires, 
tracking forms, etc., and integrate with laboratory data, and monitor adherence to protocols for data entry, sample processing, storage, and analysis.   
9.b. Aims testing, Overview: In Aims 1 and 2 our analyses will investigate the response to the fiber 
and n-3 PUFA intervention at levels of  a) individual genes or variables and b) pathways and 
networks.   At the individual marker level (a) we will test genes and the butyrogenic potential (Aim 1 and 
2) for differences due to intervention using univariate models, adjusting for appropriate covariates. At the pathway/network level (b), analysis will focus on hypothesized CRC pathways and employ gene-set 
(“global”) enrichment analysis tests to evaluate changes in host gene pathways (Aim 1). When prior 
genetic/metabolic network structure is known within a pathway, the analysis will account for this.  
Models: a)  For single-gene/variable  analyses (Aims 1 and 2), we use linear mixed models with a 
random effect for participant to account for the repeated measures of marker y
 during and at the end of 
each intervention. Fixed effects will include an indicator, I, for intervention as well as demographic 
covariates (e.g., age, sex, BMI) which will be tested by [CONTACT_790774]. 
Although randomization to intervention sequence should alleviate the potential for differential  carryover 
effects between periods, models will include an indicator S RIUDQGRPL]DWLRQVHTXHQFH(UURUWHUPVࣅ ik 
are assumed to be correlated within, and independent between, participants. In summary, models take 
the form y ik = Di + Iik + S i İ ik, where Di is a random effect for subject. Robust standard errors will be used 
to test for differential effect of intervention, and all p values will be corrected for multiple testing by 
[CONTACT_790775]-Hochberg71.  b) For pathways, we will apply kernel association 
testing (KAT) procedures.72, [ADDRESS_1089999],
74 used in genomics studies, and perMANOVA,75-77 common to 
microbiome analyses. Network or structural relationships (e.g., metabolic) between genes in a pathway 
Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 8 of 18 are easily incorporated into construction of a similarity/kernel matrix on which KATs are based72, 78. 
These known (or estimated) interactions can enhance the KAT testing procedure to increase power.79, [ADDRESS_1090000] 
modification by [CONTACT_52886] (time*intervention) will be added to this model if the data support 
autocorrelation within a measure across time. For longitudinal analyses of multivariate data (i.e., 
pathways/ gene-sets), we will test for longitudinal differences due to intervention by [CONTACT_34058] a repeated-
measures KAT82, 83 and a variant of GSA.84 We will consider effects of butyrogenic potential (defined as 
above and below the median; Aim 2 ) on host gene expression responses ( Aim 1 ). 
9.c. Power and sample size. This is a randomized, controlled crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_755318] [ADDRESS_1090001] gene expression changes with 
the fiber + n-3 PUFA intervention. Aim 1:  In our FlaxFx study32 with a similar cr ossover design, we 
detected differential expression of [ADDRESS_1090002] (FDR<0.05) in 
exfoliated cells (n=42 participants). Given the impact of dietary fiber on multiple pathways in animal 
models,85 we anticipate similar or better power in the current study. In addition, we also considered 
power for single-gene analysis in this crossove r study (n=30). Using a 2-sided paired t-test at 
significance level alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1090003] sizes, conservative estimates are: power of at least 
80% for effect sizes larger than 0.5.  Aim 2:  a power estimate for ddPCR data, based on differences in 
but gene abundance with low- (4.96*1011 ± 3.22*1010 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/g feces) and high-fiber diets (1.37*1012 
±1.47*1011) in healthy individuals (n=30),86 at significance level alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1090004] 95 % to detect diet-related differences in this gene. We anticipate a 
similar distribution for buk.  
 
10. PROJECT TIMELINE 
 
 
11. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF PROJECT   
The strengths are: (i) translation and testing of a hypothesis in humans that has been well characterized 
in animal models and is supported by [CONTACT_790776]; (ii) a robust, randomized crossover 
study design with within-person pairwise comparison; (iii) feeding of n-3 PUFA and prebiotic dietary 
fiber40, 41 at levels relevant to CRC prevention; (iv) pathway-based evaluation; (v) novel, non-invasive 
approach to measure gene expression using the stool exfoliome; (vi) targeted measures of butyrogenic potential; and (vii) extensive experience and expertise of our research team in all aspects of the 
proposed work.  Limitations relate to the inherent challenges of short-term human dietary interventions 
without disease as an outcome and the R21 budget constraints. The latter limits the sample size, number of treatments (e.g., no test of n-3 PUFA and fiber individually), and comparison of exfoliome and 
biopsy gene expression. However, our cost-effective, robust study design, relevant dosing, and pathway-related outcomes will inform the utility of further work in this area. Further, we focus on 

Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 9 of 18 pathways that show, in animal models, that fish oil/fermentable fiber-containing diets protect against 
colon cancer by [CONTACT_25764]-regulating ferroptosis/apoptosis and suppressing proliferation and inflammatory 
mediators.21, 23, 24, 87-89 
 
12. ANTICIPATED RESULTS, ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES AND FUTURE RESEARCH  
We anticipate generating strong pi[INVESTIGATOR_790751] y of n-3 PUFA + fermentable fiber to affect colonic 
pathways relevant to CRC prevention. With our experience in conducting human intervention studies and analyzing the proposed specimens, we do not anticipate any difficulties completing this small, pi[INVESTIGATOR_49152].  Furthermore, an understanding of the inter-individual differences in butyrate and n-3 PUFA 
disposition may inform development of tailored diet strategies for CRC-risk reduction. Specimens 
collected as part of this study will also be stored for additional microbiome and metabolomic analysis as 
future funding permits. 
 
13. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN 
Oversight for this study will be provided by [CONTACT_5844], Drs. Johanna Lampe and 
Meredith Hullar (Fred Hutch) and Robert Chapkin ([LOCATION_007] A&M), with delegation of responsibilities to 
designated study personnel. They will ensure all entry criteria are met prior to the initiation of the 
protocol, and all study procedures and reporting of adverse events are performed according to the IRB-approved protocol.    
[CONTACT_790790], a board certified gastroenterologist at SCCA and UW Medical Center and a health 
services researcher with the Fred Hutchinson Instit ute for Cancer Outcomes Research will serve as 
medical advisor for the study.  She will be available for consult in adverse events cases.        
All adverse events related to the study procedures will be fully documented on the appropriate case 
report form(s) and entered in a study database.  For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the 
onset, duration, intensity, treatment required, and outcome, including documentation of need for 
premature termination of any study procedures. 
Anticipated adverse events related to this study are: 
Blood Draws  Participants may experience a little discomfor t or have a temporary bruise from having 
blood drawn.  Occasionally a participant may feel lightheaded or feel faint when having blood drawn.  
Blood will be taken only by [CONTACT_790777].  The participants will be sitting down when the blood is 
drawn.  If a participant feels faint, they will be instructed to lie down until the feeling goes away.   
Dietary Supplements  We will provide two dietary supplements during the active intervention and similar 
controls during the placebo periods.  All participants  will go through both intervention periods.  Fiber:  
~35 g highly-soluble, well-tolerated commercial fi bers. Supplemental fiber (30-45 g/d) has been well-
tolerated in short- and long-term interventions (4 wks to 1-10 y).  Control:  We will use maltodextrin (a 
food-ingredient polysaccharide made from partially hydrolysed starch) provided in the same packaging.  
Mild bloating and abdominal distension might occur wh ile on the fiber treatment since the fiber content 
will be higher than their habitual diet.  Participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_5984].  Most people 
adapt to the higher fiber intake within 3-5 days.  Fish Oil: n-3 PUFA: We will provide a daily dose of 6 g 
EPA+DHA, consumed as 2 vials daily for 30 d. Control: We will use equivalent amounts of corn oil in 
visually identical packaging. Although generally safe, high amounts of EPA and DHA may thin the blood 
(increase clotting time) and slightly lower blood pressure. Fish oil may cause belching, bad breath, 
heartburn, nausea, loose stools.  Participant will be instructed to report all symptoms.  Study staff will 
contact [CONTACT_790778].  Study staff will see the participants after [ADDRESS_1090005] with them.  They fill out a daily form that includes space for 
commenting about symptoms or issues; thus, we ar e able to address the issues as they present 
themselves and are able to suggest ways to ways to minimize these effects.  Fish Oil - Risk of allergic 
Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 10 of 18 reaction will be minimized through eligibility questions addressing history of medication, food allergies / 
intolerances. Taking fish oil supplements with meals can often decrease gastrointestinal side effects. 
Participants will keep a daily study log which will include questions on health status and possible 
adverse experiences. A general symptom questionnaire will be administered at baseline and each 
subsequent visit.  If there are any indications that a participant has a food allergy that was not previously 
known, we immediately have them stop the intervention.  The study coordinator has an emergency cell phone and can be reached 24/7 by [CONTACT_19288].  
Adverse event grading scale, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 
(Publish Date: November 27, 2017):  
Grades Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for eac h AE based on this general guideline:  
Grade 1 Mild ; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
Grade 2 Moderate ; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate 
instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3 Severe  or medically significant but not immedi ately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8942]; disabling; limiting self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
Grade 5  Death related to AE. 
Activities of Daily Living (ADL) *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_422856], using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing 
and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
Plan for unanticipated AE reporting:  All unanticipated AEs related to the study procedures that are 
severe or serious will be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Johanna Lampe the IRB within 10 days of notification of the 
investigator.  We will use as a guide the Adverse Events Relatedness Reference Sheet (Cancer 
Consortium Clinical Research Support) see Appendix 2.  And we will follow:   
Hutch IRB Policy 2.[ADDRESS_1090006] be submitted to the IRB within 10 
calendar days. 
x Unexpected:  An adverse event is unexpected when its nature (specificity), severity or frequency 
are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, informed consent document and other relevant sources of information such 
as product labeling and package inserts; and are al so not consistent with (b) the characteristics 
of the subject population being studied, including the expected natural progression of any 
underlying disease, disorder or condition, or any predisposing risk-factor profile for the adverse 
event. 
x Related or possibly related to the research:  An adverse event is related or possibly related to 
research procedures if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439], it was more likely than not caused by [CONTACT_118689]. Adverse events that are solely caused by [CONTACT_113363], disorder 
or condition or by [CONTACT_790779], 
disorder or condition are not "related or possibly related." If there is any question whether an 
adverse event is related or possibly related to the research, report the adverse event. 
Serious:  An adverse event is serious when it results in any of the following outcomes: death, risk of 
death, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity/or change in psychosocial status , a congenital anomaly or the requirement of an 
Fat x Fiber Protocol  Version 1    p. 11 of 18 intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  Plan for anticipated AE reporting : All 
serious anticipated AEs related to the study procedures will be reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Johanna Lampe to the 
IRB within 10 days of notification of the investigator.  
Plan for ongoing review of results:  The PIs will be notified within 24 hours by [CONTACT_790780].  
Plan for safety review: the PI [INVESTIGATOR_172155] a cumulative review of all adverse events and premature 
terminations review every 6 months after study initiation or after completion of 50% of participant visits, 
whichever occurs first.  
Plan for annual reporting:  A summary of the investigation including all adverse events and how they 
were handled, enrollment, drop-outs and reason for discontinuation and any protocol modifications will 
be provided to the IRB on an annual basis.  
Annual Reports will contain:  
x The number of adverse events and an explanation of how each event was handled  
x The number of complaints and how each complaint was handled  
x The number of subject withdrawals and an explanation of why the subject withdrew or was 
withdrawn  
x The number of protocol deviations and how each was handled  
The occurrence of any serious and unexpected event may prompt changes in study protocol. Any such 
change will be approved by [CONTACT_4881].   
Monitoring for data integrity and safety  will be the responsibility of all the investigators. The following 
will be included:  
Validity and integrity of data: Data are checked for missing, unusual, or impossible records when 
they are entered into the study’s computer database.  The investigators may consider modifications 
to the data-collection protocol with permission from IRB if they deem the change(s) is necessary to ensure the validity and integrity of data collected. 
Enrollment rate relative to expectation: Early lags in recruitment will be rectified with increased 
recruitment efforts so that recruitment will be completed on time.  The investigators will monitor this 
closely to ensure full enrollment of appropriate participants.   
Retention of participants and adherence to protocol: The investigators will monitor retention and 
adherence to study protocol. Adherence to the study supplements will be monitored via the Daily 
Record that includes a calendar where parti cipants mark daily capsules consumed.  
Oversight for this study will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Johanna Lampe (corresponding MPI [INVESTIGATOR_790752]) with 
delegation of responsibilities to the Study Manager, Lisa Levy. They will ensure all entry criteria are met 
prior to the initiation of the protocol, and all study procedures and reporting of adverse events are 
performed according to the IRB-approved protocol.  All adverse events related to the study procedures 
will be fully documented on the appropriate case report form(s) and entered in a study database.  For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset, duration, intensity, treatment required, and 
outcome, including documentation of need for premature termination of any study procedures.

METHODOLOGY  
This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel groups, multicenter trial 
assessing the efficacy and safety of  the rFSH preparation FE 999049  in subjects aged 35-42 years 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF / ICSI following a gonadotropin -releasing 
horm one (GnRH) antagonist protocol. The primary endpoint is the cumulative ongoing pregnancy 
rate after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved cycles initiated within [ADDRESS_1893] iance with the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. On day 2 -3 of the menstrual cycle, subjects will be randomized in a 10:[ADDRESS_1894] four stimulation days. Based on ovarian response , the dose may be adjusted by 
3 µg, with d ose increases implemented not more frequently than once every 2 days and dose 
decreases implemented per investigator’s judgement. The minimum daily dose is [ADDRESS_1895] the injection pen dialed to the 
same value (dose) as if administered FE 999049. Subjects can be treated with FE [ADDRESS_1896] or any other drug to prevent early 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) with the  exception of GnRH agonist for triggering  of 
final follicular maturation , are not allowed.  
During stimulation, subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_2158] [ADDRESS_1897] every second day. When the leading foll icle reaches a diameter of ≥14  mm, 
transvaginal ultrasound will be performed daily. To prevent a premature luteinizing hormone (LH) 
surge, [ADDRESS_1898] (ganirelix acetate, GANIRELIX, [COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme) will be

and embryo development will be assessed. For subj ects who undergo triggering of final follicular 
maturation with hCG and have <20 oocytes retrieved, transfer will be performed on day 5 (blastocyst 
stage) after oocyte retrieval. Subjects will have one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality 
(i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -
quality blastocyst is available. Remaining blastocysts will be cryopreserved by [CONTACT_2160]. For 
subjects with ≥[ADDRESS_1902] who fails to  reach the triggering criterion due to poor ovarian response or who has

STATISTICAL METHODS  
The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of FE  999049 in 
controlled ovarian stimulation . 
 
Sample Size  
The proposed sample size of 550 subjects (FE  999049:placebo = 500:50) can adequately address 
both the efficacy and safety objectives of the trial:  
• The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the FE  999049 -treated subjects aged 35 -42 years 
is estimated to be approximately 30% according to results from clinical trials conducted in

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  the U.S. By [CONTACT_2163], the pregnancy rate in the placebo arm is expected n ot to exceed 3%, 
the monthly spontaneous pregnancy rate in infertile women. Therefore, the proposed sample 
size of 550 (FE 999049: placebo = 500:50) will provide at least 99% power for the primary 
efficacy comparison.  Based on the estimated cumulative ongoi ng pregnancy rate, the 
cumulative live birth rate from the fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles is estimated to be 
approximately 27%, resulting in a power for the comparison of the cumulative live birth rate 
to be at least 99%.  
• A key pharmacodynamic parameter  in subjects aged 35 -42 years is cycle cancellation due to 
poor follicular development, which may occur in approximately 5% of the population 
exposed to gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115].  
• The safety and tolerability of daily rFSH preparations as part of an ART treatment cycl e have 
been well documented for the population  studied  in previous clinical trials. OHSS was 
reported to occur in 1.7% to 3.7% of the subjects, with moderate/severe OHSS occurring in 
1.4% to 2.2% of the subjects. Other adverse events were pelvic pain, pelv ic discomfort and 
headache, with those assessed to be related to trial treatments reported in 1.5% to 7.1% of the 
subjects.

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL   Primary Endpoint  
The hypothesis to be tested for the primary endpoint , cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate,  is: 
H0: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  ≤ [ADDRESS_1926] the alternative H A: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  > 0, 
where π FE [ADDRESS_1927] the alternative H A by [CONTACT_2164]  a two -sided 95% confiden ce interval for 
the difference in the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups using the 
traditional Wald interval. If the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval is greater than 
0, the null hypothesis H 0 will be rej ected. In the case that the number of pregnancies observed in the 
placebo group is small (<5), then the one -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used.  
The primary endpoint  will be determined as soon as the subject has achieved an ongoing pregnancy, 
or when al l cryopreserved blastocysts have been exhausted, or after assessment of ongoing 
pregnancy status in cryopreserved cycles initiated within 12 months from  the start of controlled 
ovarian stimulation.  
The efficacy analysis will be based on the modified intention -to-treat (mITT) analysis set, defined as 
all subjects who were  randomized and received at least one dose of IMP (FE  999049 or placebo).

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
FE 999049 is a hum an recombinant follicle -stimulating hormone (rFSH) belonging to the 
pharmaceutical class of gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. The current trial is intended to support the following indication  
being pursued for FE 999049 in the [LOCATION_002] ( U.S.): “Development of multiple follicles and 
pregnancy after fresh and/or cryopreserved embryo transfer in ovulatory women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technology (ART)”.  
FE [ADDRESS_1946] cell line of human fetal retinal origin (PER.C6®). The PER.C6® 
cell line is well -characterized , and bio -testing of the master cell bank has demonstrated safety and 
consistency. FE  999049 is a glycoprotein which is composed of two non -covalently bound polypeptide 
chains, denoted alfa (α) and beta (β). The  α-subunit contains 92 amino acid residues with 5 intrachain -
disulphide bonds. The β -subunit contains 111 amino acid residues with 6  intrachain -disulphide bonds. 
Each subunit is N -glycosylated at two positions, and about 40% of the total mass is carbohydra tes. 
Ferring received marketing authorization approval for FE  999049 for the indication “Controlled 
ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation  (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm 
injection (ICSI) cycle”  from the European Commission in 2016 . As of early 2018, FE 999049 is 
approved in 37 countries also including countries outside the Europe an Union  (EU) such as Australia, 
Switzerland , and Canada . 
Ther e are no commercially available rFSH products derived from human cell lines in the  U.S. The 
rFSH products currently approved in the U.S. for controlled ovarian stimulation in ovulatory women 
undergoing ART, e.g. follitropin alfa (GONAL -F, EMD Serono) and f ollitropin beta (FOLLISTIM, 
[COMPANY_006]), are derived from a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The amino acid sequence of 
FE [ADDRESS_1947] more complex carbohydrate structures found in humans, the glycosylation 
profile of FE  999049 is more complex. In addition, FE  999049 contains both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation 
patterns, while CHO -derived rFSH produ cts exclusively carry 2,3 linked sialic acid; this difference 
further contributes to the observed differences in glycosylation profiles between FE  999049 and CHO -
derived rFSH products.  For the purpose of clinical trials, FE 999049 is being treated as a new  
molecular entity (NME)  by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) .

 Follitropin Delta, FE 999049  Trial C ode:  [ADDRESS_1948] been completed as part of the development program for 
FE 999049, covering four phase 1 trials, two pha se 2 trials (one conducted in EU and one in Japan) and 
two phase  3 trials. A total of 1,927 subjects were included in these trials, of whom 1,112 subjects were 
exposed to FE  999049, in a range from a single dose up to exposure in three consecutive stimulat ion 
cycles. During the phase 3 trials, 665 IVF/ICSI patients were treated with FE  999049 in 1,012 
treatment cycles. In addition, two phase 3 trials are currently ongoing; one in Japan and one in Pan -
Asia.  
The two completed phase 3 trials support the effic acy and safety of FE  999049 (ESTHER -1 / 
ESTHER -2: Evidence -based Stimulation Trial with Human rFSH in Europe and Rest of World). 
ESTHER -1 (Trial 000004)1 was a randomized, controlled, assessor -blind trial conducted in 11 
countries in women 18 -40 years und ergoing IVF/ICSI  followed predominantly by [CONTACT_2166] . The trial was designed to demonstrate non -inferiority of FE  999049 versus an approved 
recombinant FSH preparation (GONAL -F) with ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate 
as co-primary e ndpoints and also to prospectively evaluate the outcome of an individualized 
FE 999049 dosing regimen based on the serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration 
(measured by [CONTACT_2167]® AMH Immunoassay, [COMPANY_002] Diagnostics) and body weight. The E STHER -1 
trial demonstrated non -inferiority of FE  999049 to GONAL -F for ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing 
implantation rate for both the per -protocol (PP) and modified intention -to-treat (mITT ; randomized and 
exposed ) populations. For the overall trial pop ulation randomized and exposed to FE  999049, the 
ongoing pregnancy rate was 30.7% and the ongoing implantation rate was 35.2%. Among the women 
aged ≥35  years, the ongoing pregnancy rate with FE 999049 was 26.9% and the ongoing implantation 
rate was 30.9%. ESTHER -2 (Trial 000071)2 was a safety immunogenicity trial covering up to two 
repeated treatment cycles in subjects who did not achieve an ongoing pregnancy in ESTHER -1. The 
trial confirmed the low immunogenicity  potential with incidences of ant i-FSH antibodies after 
exposure to FE 999049  of 0.8% in cycle 2 and 1.1% in cycle 3, which was not higher than the 
incidence of 1.1% in cycle 1 (ESTHER -1) or the incidence of pre -existing anti -FSH antibodies before 
exposure to FE  999049 , which was 1.4% .[ADDRESS_1949]’s last 
stimulatio n cycle  were followed and showed good efficacy  of FE 999049 in cryopreserved cycles with 
an ongoing pregnancy rate of 32.3%  per initiated cycle .

Clinical Trial Protocol  
Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1.2 Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial  
A clin ical development program for FE  999049 has been conducted outside the U.S. applying an 
individualized dosing regimen based on the patient’s serum AMH concentration and body  weight , and 
with a fixed dose throughout stimulation . As per FDA recommendations, the FE  999049 dosing 
regimen in phase  3 in the U.S. will not be based on AMH and body weight. Consequently, a phase 3 
program is required for the U.S. to document the effica cy and safety of FE 999049 in the dosing 
regimen applied in the present trial (see section  3.5.4 ). The present phase 3 trial will be conducted in 
the U.S.  and will meet the FDA requirements of exposure in the intended target population in the U.S.  
The trial is designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of FE  999049 in women aged 35-42 years 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy 
after fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles.  
Cryopreservation  of surplus embryos for potential use after the fresh cycle is standard practice in ART 
treatment, and serves to improve chances of pregnancy from a single stimulation cycle. The 
development of the vitrification method for freezing of embryos has resulted in significant 
improvement in post -thaw embryo survival4,[ADDRESS_1950] years, with a doubling from 
26.6% in 2011 to 52.4% in 2015.8,[ADDRESS_1951] s an 
increase of “cryo -all” cycles (ovarian stimulation cycles with cryopreservation of all embryos), which 
when coupled to a gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist trigger improves patient safety, by 
[CONTACT_2168] (OHSS).[ADDRESS_1952] common safety concern s.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects  
Benefits  
Subjects who participate in this trial will undergo fertility screening procedures useful for their future 
clinical management. They will also be closely monitored and may benefit by [CONTACT_2169].  If 
subjects exh ibit poor response to therapy (pre -established protocol criteria) , they will be offered 
medication and financial support for an ART cycle with an approved gonadotropin preparation outside 
of the trial.  
 
Risks  
The risks associated with ART treatment, including the risks associated with controlled ovarian 
stimulation and clinical and laboratory procedures, are explained to the subjects as part of the 
counselling prior to starting tre atment.  
FE 999049  
In the completed clinical trials of the de velopment program for  FE 999049, covering four phase  1 
trials, two phase 2 trials and two phase  3 trials, a total of 1,927  subjects  were included. Of these, 
1,112  subjects were exposed to FE  999049 in a range from a single dose up to exposure in three 
consecutive stimulation cycles. During the phase 3 trials, 665  IVF/ICSI subjects were treated with 
FE [ADDRESS_1953] frequently reported adverse drug reactions during 
1,012 treatment cycles with FE  999049 in the phase 3 program were  headache, pelvic discomfort, 
OHSS, pelvic pain, adnexa uteri pain, nausea and fatigue (all reported as common, i.e. 1% to <10%). 
Uncommon adverse drug reactions reported with FE  [ADDRESS_1954] serious risk associated with 
gonadotropin treatment is O HSS. OHSS manifests itself with increasing degrees of severity. 
Moderate/severe OHSS is associated with marked ovarian enlargement, fluid accumulation and other 
complications. The incidence of early OHSS can be minimized by [CONTACT_2170][INVESTIGATOR_2115], 
withh olding human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or administering GnRH  agonist for triggering of 
final follicular maturation. In the current trial , a GnRH agonist will be administered for triggering of 
final follicular maturation in subjects who might be at risk of OHSS (as per defined criteria) , and 
transfer in the fresh cycle will be cancelled . In addition, subjects with excessive ovarian response after 
triggering with hCG (as per defined criteria) will also have transfer in the fresh cycle cancelled  to

 Follitropin Delta, FE 999049  Trial C ode:  [ADDRESS_1955] been reported after injection of 
gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]. Concerning immunogenicity, the risk of trea tment -induced anti -drug-antibodies 
following FE  999049 treatment is very low . In the ESTHER -1 and ESTHER -2 trials, the observed 
incidence of anti -FSH antibodies after treatment with FE  999049 was  1.1%  in cycle 1 , 0.8% in cycle 2 
and 1.1% in cycle 3 , which was not higher than the incidence of pre-existing anti-FSH antibodies of 
1.4% before exposure of FE  999049.[ADDRESS_1956] . Use of progesterone can cause 
skin reactions, fluid retent ion, somnolence, and arterial and venous thromboembolic events, including 
retinal thrombosis. Furthermore, the vaginal progesterone has been associated with vulvovaginal 
disorders and uterine spasms (at a frequency of 1 -2%). Intramuscular  progesterone can cause injection 
site reactions and sterile abscesses. Estrogen can cause breast tenderness, nausea, vomiting, skin 
reactions, headache, anaphylactic reactions, increase in blood pressure, and arterial and venous 
thromboembolic events, including retinal thr ombosis.  For detailed information on  adverse events , 
please refer to the respe ctive  products Prescribing Information . 
Procedures  
Subjects will undergo standard ART treatment procedures (e.g. transvaginal ultrasound, blood 
sampling, oocyte retrieval and transfer). The transvaginal ultrasound examinations may be associated 
with mild discomfort and a very rare risk of infection. The blood sampling might be associated with 
mild discomfort, bruising and a very rare risk of infection. The oocyte retrieval procedure is associated 
with discomfort and very rarely infections and bleeding. The transfer procedure is associated with mild 
discomfort and very rarel y infections and mild bleeding.  
Pregnancy -related Events  
Oocytes will be inseminated using IVF or ICSI and subsequently cultured to blastocyst stage  (day 5 or 
later depending on embryo development ). Although the frequency of cancellation of transfer is higher 
when culturing to blastocyst stage compared to cultur ing only to cleavage stage, the pregnancy rates 
per started cycle are at least as good with blastocyst transfer as with cleavage embryo transfer11 and 
may even be higher.12 A serious concern associated with ART cycles is the frequency of multiple

gestations, a restrictive transfer policy guided by [CONTACT_2171] d cycles is mandatory in this trial. The 
incidence of miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy is higher in women undergoing controlled ovarian 
stimulation than in women conceiving spontaneously, though the risk of ectopic pregnancy is mainly 
higher in women with  a history of tubal infertility. Furthermore, the prevalence of congenital 
malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions; this is thought to 
be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age , maternal and paternal genetic 
background,  and sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies.  
 
Benefits / Risks  
Participation in this trial does not create extra risks for the subjects  compared to routine controlled 
ovarian stimulation . The majority of subjects w ill receive active treatment, with an expected likelihood 
of conceiving similar to that in standard clinical practice. Subjects who exhibit poor response to 
therapy as per pre -established protocol criteria will be offered medication and financial support f or an 
ART cycle with an approved gonadotropin preparation outside of the trial . In conclusion, the 
evaluation of benefits and risks indicate that participation in this trial is associated with a favorable  
benefit -risk ratio.

 Overall Design and Control Methods  
This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel groups, multicenter trial assessing 
the efficacy and safety of the rFSH preparation FE  999049 in subjects aged 35-42 years undergoing 
controlled ovarian stimulation for IVF / ICSI following a GnRH antagonist protocol. The primary 
endpoint is the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved cycles 
initiated within 12  months from the start of control led ovarian stimulation. Thereby, the trial is 
designed to capture the clinical efficacy of a single controlled ovarian stimulation cycle in a more 
complete manner by [CONTACT_2174]. 
Secondary end points include pharmacodynamic parameters of FSH action as well as efficacy and 
safety parameters related to controlled ovarian stimulation from the fresh cycle and subsequent 
cryopreserved cycles.  
 
Controlled Ovarian Stimulation and Fresh Cycle

stage) after oocyte retrieval. Subjects will have one blastocyst transferred if at least one good -quality 
(i.e. grade 3BB or above) blastocyst is available, or one or two blastocysts transferred if no good -
quality blastocyst is av ailable. Remaining blastocysts will be cryopreserved by [CONTACT_2160]. For

to [ADDRESS_1994]  potential of the blastocysts derived from a single 
controlled ovarian stimulation cycle.  
Positive βhCG, clinical pregnancy and vital pregnancy are included as secondary  endpoints in the trial. 
Additional secondary endpoints include total dose of gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2126] , such as ovarian response in terms of follicular development, endocrine profile and oocytes 
retrieved, and also oocyte / blast ocyst quality , including blastocyst survival and re -expansion in the 
cryopreserved cycles . Follicular development and endocrine profile will be evaluated after the initial 
4 days of ovarian stimulation (i.e. before any potential IMP dose adjustments and before start of the 
GnRH antagonist) as well as at the end of stimulation. The endocrine profile consists of AMH, FSH, 
LH, estradiol, progesterone, inhibin A and inhibin B.  
Clinical safety endpoints cove r adverse events, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters,  local 
tolerability,  immunogenicity , OHSS and pregnancy -related events (i.e. multi -fetal gestations, 
biochemical pregnancies, spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies and vanishing twins). Pr e-
defined local tolerability reactions, i.e. redness, pain, itching, swelling and bruising, will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_2176] 
[ADDRESS_1995] 
administration of FE  999049 for assessment of a potential immunoglobulin M (IgM) response and a 
fully mounted immunoglobulin G (IgG) immune response, respectively.15 Technical malfunction of the 
pens used for administration of FE 999049 and placebo will also be monitored.  
Live birth is the ultimate objective for couples starting infertility treatment. Nevertheless, it can be 
justified to use ongoing pregnancy rate as an endpoint indicative of the final  treatment outcome as few 
pregnancy losses occur after confirmation of ongoing pregnancy.16 In the ESTHER -1 trial, the absolute 
difference between live birth rate and ongoing pregnancy rate was -0.7% among the women aged ≥35 
years.  In the present trial, ongoing pregnancies in the fresh and cryopreserved cycles will be followed 
until live birth , allowing for evaluation of cumulative live birth rate. Neonatal health data at birth, 
4 weeks and 1 year after birth will be collected for infants born after the fresh cycle and cryopreserved 
cycles to provide  additional safety information.  
In conclusion, the primary and secondary endpoints are appropriate for a phase 3 trial designed to 
document the efficacy  and safety of a gonadotropin intended for controlled ovarian stimulation .

ovarian response , the dose may be  adjusted by 3  µg, with dose increases implemented 
not mo re frequently than once every 2  days and dose decreases i mplemented per 
investigator’s judgement . The minimum daily dose is 6 µg, and the maximum daily 
dose is 24 µg.  
Subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen . 
Placebo  to 
FE 999049  Pen will be dialed to the same value (dose) as if administered FE 999049.  
Subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen.  
 
The investigational medicinal products ( IMPs ) will be  self-administered by [CONTACT_2180] a daily 
subcutaneous injection in the lower part of the abdomen using a pre -filled injection pen. The start and 
end dates as well as daily dose of IMP will be recorded by  [CONTACT_2181] a diary.  To minimize local 
injection site reactions, it is advisable to change the injection site regularly, i.e. between the right and 
left lower part of the abdomen.  
Administration of IMP after reaching the triggering criterion is not all owed.

5.5 Blinding / Unblinding  
 Blinding  
The pr e-filled injection pens with FE  [ADDRESS_2017] Treatment   
An emergency decoding possibility  will be available to the investigator and designated persons at 
Ferring. It is the investig ator’s responsibility to decide whether it is medically necessary to know the 
investigational product the subject receives (i.e. unblinding) to ensure the subject’s welfare and safety. 
Breaking of the blind for individual subjects in emergency situations c ould b e required in case of 
suspected  unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) or in case of other important adverse events 
when the knowledge of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for the management of 
the subject.  
As far as t he emergency permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed by [CONTACT_2183].  Where the event requires immediate unblinding by [CONTACT_093], Ferring must be informed 
of the unblinding as soon as possible and provided with the ration ale for unblinding. The 
investigator/person who unblinds a treatment will use the eCRF in which he/she is required to enter a 
password and record the reason for unblinding before the treatment code can be broken. The e CRF 
automatically records when and by [CONTACT_2184].  The investigator must record the event of 
unblinding in the subject’s medical record, including the reason for unblinding, but not the treatment 
allocation if this can be avoided.  
In case of accidental unblinding, the same procedur e as for emergency unblinding must be followed, 
i.e. the person who is accidentally unblinded  will enter a password in the e CRF and must record the 
reason for unblinding, while the eCRF records when and by [CONTACT_2184].  In addition the 
event mus t also be recorded in the subject’s medical record.

enter a password and the reason for unblinding before the trea tment code can be broken. The e CRF 
records when and by [CONTACT_2185]. The code break will occur according to corporate 
standard operating procedures for unplanned unblinding of trial subjects. It may be necessary to 
unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of ex pedited reporting to the relevant health 
authorities and/or IRBs. In that situation, every effort will be made to maintain blinding of Ferring 
personnel involved in data analysis and interpretation. Other personnel may be unblinded for S[LOCATION_003]Rs, 
including tr ial site staff as well as staff acting on behalf of Ferring.  
Information on whether the blind has been broken for any subjects is available in the e CRF and must 
be collected before the database is declared clean and is released to the trial statistician.  
In case the e CRF cannot be accessed by [CONTACT_093], and hence the emergency unblinding c annot 
be performed within the e CRF system, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_2186].

5.6 Treatment Compliance , Dispensing and Accountability  
The IMP will only be dispensed to subjects who meet the eligibility criteria and are randomized to a 
treatment group in the trial. The investigator (or his/her designated staff, e.g. trial nurse) will maintain 
a drug -dispensing log detailing the dates and quantities of  IMPs/NIMPs dispensed to, and used by, 
each subject, as well as the batch numbers, IMP/NIMP numbers or other identifier used in the trial.  
The monitor will verify the drug accountability during the trial and if applicable document any 
discrepancies.  
In or der to monitor compliance, the subjects are to return empty, partially used, and unused vials , pens, 
syringes, tablets  or inserts to the investigator at each visit. The investigator (or his/her designated staff, 
e.g. trial nurse) will reconcile and document the return on the drug accountability log. Any 
discrepancies should be discussed with the subject at the time of the return.

Each of the items in the Adverse Event Log is described in detail in the following sections.  
 
Adverse Event  
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and symptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.  
If a subject suffers from the same adverse event more than once and the subject recovers in between 
the events, the adverse events should be recorded separa tely. If an adverse event changes in intensity, a 
worst -case approach should be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity and the longest 
duration of the event.f 
Note : a procedure is not an adverse event; the reason for conducting the proc edure is. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2137]; the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138]. Death is not an adverse event, but the cause of 
death is (an exception is sudden death of unknown cause, which is an adverse event).  
 
 
f  Exception: if an adverse event with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e. a pre -treatment adverse event) 
worsen s in intensity, this must be recorded as two separate events. The initial adverse event should be recorded with 
outcome “not recovered” and the date and time of outcome is when the intensity changed. The second adverse event 
should be recorded with date an d time of onset when the intensity changed.

is an abnormal clinically significant laboratory test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was performe d. 
 
Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event must be classified using the following 3 -point scale:  
Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity.  
Moderate:  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing).  
Severe:  Inabi lity to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable).  
 
Causal Relationship to IMP  
The possibility of whether the IMP caused the adverse event must be classified as one of the following:  
Reasonable possibility :  
There is evidence or argument to suggest a  causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse event. 
The adverse event may occur as part of the pharmacological action of the IMP or may be unpredictable 
in its occurrence.  
Examples:  
• Adverse events that are uncommon but are known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure.  
• Adverse events that are not commonly associated with IMP exposure, but the event occurs in 
association with other factors strongly suggesting causation, such as a strong temporal 
association or the event recurs on rec hallenge with the IMP.  
 
No reasonable possibility : 
There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the 
adverse event.  
Examples:  
• Known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation.

frequency during the course of the trial, regardless of IMP exposure.  
 
Action Taken to IMP  
The action taken to the IMP in response to an adverse event must be clas sified as one of the following:  
• No change (medication schedule maintained or no action taken)  
• Discontinued  
• Interrupted  
• Dose reduced  
• Dose increased  
 
Other Action Taken  
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical car e to protect 
the health and well -being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be 
available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
If medication is administered to treat the adverse event, this medic ation should be entered in the 
Concomitant Medication Log . 
 
Date and Time of Outcome  
The date and time the subject recovered or died.  
 
Outcome  
The outcome of an adverse event must be classified as one of the following:  
• Recovered (fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at initiation of 
trial treatment)  
• Recovered with sequelae (resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity)  
• Recovering (the event is improving)

 Spontaneous abortion:  Positive βhCG test but all intrauterine gestational sacs are without 
fetal heart beat as documented by [CONTACT_2207], or there are no 
viable fetuses observed by [CONTACT_2208]:  Spontaneous disappearance of at least one intrauterine gestational 
sac with or without heart beat in a pregnancy where one viable 
fetus remains as documented by [CONTACT_2209]:  Extrauterine gestational sac with or without fe tal heart beat as 
documented by [CONTACT_2210], a pregnancy loss occurring before ongoing pregnancy (i.e. a positive βhCG test but 
no ongoing pregnancy at 8 -9 weeks after transfer) will be defined as an early pregnancy loss, while  a 
pregnancy loss occurring after ongoing pregnancy (i.e. at least one intrauterine viable fetus at 
8-9 weeks after transfer but no live birth) during the post -trial follow -up will be defined as a late 
pregnancy loss.  
 
8.4 Events Requiring Special Handling  
 Injection Site Reactions  
Injection site reactions after administration of IMP (FE 999049 or placebo) are only to be reported as 
adverse events if they require active management, i.e. discontinuation of IMP, additional investigations 
or treatment of the inject ion site reaction. Local tolerability of IMP constitutes a secondary endpoint 
and will be evaluated in detail based on the subjects’ recordings in the diary.  
Local tolerability reactions after administration of NIMP are to be reported as adverse events if  they 
fulfil the definition of an adverse event.

This section details the planned statistical analyses for the primary endpoint and outlines the analysis 
plan for the secondary endpoints. All analyses and further descriptions of the statistical methodology 
for the primary and secondary endpoints will be included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The 
SAP will be available before the first subject is randomized in the trial. A separate SAP will be 
prepared to cover the post -trial information.  
 
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The proposed sample size of 550 (FE 999049:placebo = 500:50) can adequately address both the 
efficacy and safety objectives of the trial:  
• The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate in the FE  999049 -treated subjects aged 35 -42 years is 
estimated to be approximately 30% according to results from clinical trials conducted in the 
U.S.33 By [CONTACT_2163], the p regnancy rate in the placebo arm is expected not to exceed 3%, the 
monthly spontaneous pregnancy rate in infertile women.34 Therefore, the proposed sample size 
of 550 (FE 999049: placebo=500:50) will provide at least 99% power for the primary efficacy 
compa rison.  Based on the estimated cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate, the cumulative live 
birth rate from the fresh and/or cryopreserved cycles is estimated to be approximately 27%, 
resulting in a power for the comparison of the cumulative live birth rate to be  at least 99%.  
• A key pharmacodynamic parameter in subjects aged 35 -42 years is cycle cancellation due to 
poor follicular development, which may occur in approximately 5% of the population exposed 
to gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115].  
• The safety and tolerability of daily rFSH  preparations as part of an ART treatment cycle have 
been well documented for the population studied in previous clinical trials.1,35 OHSS was 
reported to occur in 1.7% to 3.7% of the subjects, with moderate/severe OHSS occurring in 
1.4% to 2.2% of the subjects. Other adverse events were pelvic pain, pelvic discomfort and 
headache, with those assessed to be related to trial treatments re ported in 1.5% to 7.1% of the 
subjects.

9.7 Efficacy Endpoints Assessments  
 General Considerations  
Primary Endpoint and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Upon achieving statistical significance about the primary endpoint at the 0.05 alpha level, the 
cumulative live birth rate will be formally tested at the 0.05 al pha level for inferential conclusions.  
The secondary endpoints related to pregnancy and implantation parameters are considered supportive 
of the primary endpoint  (cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate) . The secondary efficacy endpoints related 
to ovarian respo nse and embryo development parameters are intended to provide additional 
characterization  of FE  999049.  
 
Analysis and Presentation of Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Summary tables and treatment comparisons for the primary endpoint will be presen ted for both the 
mITT and PP analysis sets. In case that the mITT and ITT analysis sets are not identical (i.e. at least 
one subject is randomized  but not exposed) the summary tables and treatment comparisons will also be 
presented for the ITT analysis set . As applicable for the secondary endpoints, summary tables and 
treatment comparisons may be presented for the mITT and PP analysis sets.  
All tabulations will be present ed by [CONTACT_1570]. Continuous variables will be presented with 
number of subjects,  mean, standard deviation, median, inter -quartile range, minimum, and maximum. 
Categorical variables will be presented with number and percentage of subjects within each specific 
category.

differences will (where appropriate) be presented with 95% confidence intervals and p -values 
corresponding to the statistical test of the hypothesis of ‘equal effect’ against the alternative of 
‘different effect’.  
Visual displays will be produced as appropriate. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
listed. Listings will only be produced for the mITT.  
 
Multiplicity  
In order to handle the formal testing procedures for the primary endpoint of cumulative ongoin g 
pregnancy rate and the key post -trial endpoint of cumulative live birth rate, the overall type -I error will 
be controlled by [CONTACT_2224] a hierarchical inferential approach. Statistical significance of the primary 
endpoint at the 0.[ADDRESS_2111]-
trial endpoint of the cumulative live birth rate. This fixed hierarchical approach will ensure a strong 
control of the overall type -I error rate at the 0.05 level.  
All additional analyses of the  primary endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints are considered as 
supportive. Adjustments for multiplicity will therefore not be applied.  
 
Missing Data  
Missing observations for the primary endpoint of cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate will be imputed 
as ‘negative’ irrespective of the reason why data are not recorded. Similarly, for other pregnancy 
endpoints (βhCG, clinical pregnancy and vital pregnancy) missing data will be imputed as ‘negative’ 
with the exception of a later observation in that cycle co nfirming that an earlier missing observation 
was in fact ’positive’, e.g. in case of a missing βhCG test result and a confirmed clinical pregnancy in 
the same cycle then the βhCG test result will be imputed as ‘positive’.  
For subjects with transfer but mi ssing observations on the number of viable fetuses 8 -9 weeks after 
transfer the number of viable fetuses will be imputed as zero irrespective of why data is not recorded. 
For subjects with transfer but missing information on the number of gestational sacs 5-6 weeks after 
transfer, the number of gestational sacs will be imputed as the number of viable fetuses 8 -9 weeks after 
transfer.  
For subjects with cycle cancellation, the numbers of oocytes retrieved, metaphase II oocytes, fertilized 
oocytes, and blasto cysts on day 5 will be imputed as zero.

 Primary Endpoint  
The hypothesis to be tested for the primary endpoint, cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate, is:  
H0: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  ≤ [ADDRESS_2112] the alternative H A: πFE 999049  – πPlacebo  > 0, 
where π FE [ADDRESS_2113] the alternative H A by [CONTACT_2164] a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the 
difference in the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates between the two treatment groups using the 
traditional Wald interval. If the lower limit of the two -sided 95% confidence interval  is greater t han 0, 
the null hypothesis H 0 will be rejected. In the case that the number of pregnancies observed in the 
placebo group is small (<5), then the one -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used.  
The primary endpoint will be determined as soon as the subject has achieved an ongoing pregnancy, or 
when all cryopreserved blastocysts have been exhausted, or after assessment of ongoing pregnancy 
status in cryopreserved cycles initiated within [ADDRESS_2114] one dose of IMP (FE  999049 or placebo).  
 
Sensitivity Analyses  
The primary analysis will be repeated for the subjects in the PP analysis set as se nsitivity analysis, as 
well as in the ITT analysis set if the ITT analysis set differs from the mITT analysis set. The outcomes 
of these analyses are considered supportive.  
The primary analyses described above will be repeated restricted to subjects with o ocytes retrieved and 
to subjects undergoing blastocyst transfer.  
Missing data for the primary endpoint is expected to be limited due to the trial design, but may occur if 
the subject is lost to follow -up before ongoing pregnancy is assessed. If one or more  such subjects have 
a positive pregnancy test result (βhCG test, clinical pregnancy or vital pregnancy) prior to lost to 
follow -up, the impact of imputing the ongoing pregnancy will be investigated in a sensitivity analysis.

Clinical Trial Protocol Amendment  – Summary of Changes #[ADDRESS_2147] to their health and safety and is implemented immediately   
 
 
DOCUMENT INFORMATION : 
Protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects.  
 
REASON FOR CHANGE TO THE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL:  
• The COVID -19 pandemic has caused extensive restrictions on the movement of local 
populations in countries worldwide and recommendations to focus health c are resources on 
essential activities only. Subsequently, clinical trial participants are experiencing increased 
difficulty in attending scheduled visits and trial sites are operating at reduced capacity.  
 
• On 17 March 2020, t he American Society for Reprodu ctive Medicine (ASRM) issued a 
guidance on patient management and clinical recommendations, including: “Suspend 
initiation of new treatment cycles…. Strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers 
whether fresh or frozen… Continue to care for patien ts who are currently “in -cycle” ”.  
 
• On 18 March 2020,  the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a guidance on conduct 
of clinical trials of medicinal products during the COVID -19 pandemic, including general 
considerations for how to ensure the safety o f trial participants, maintain compliance with 
GCP and minimize risks to trial integrity.  
Ferring has conducted a risk assessment, which led to this change to the clinical trial protocol. This 
document outlines the deliberations and decisions.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  SUMMARY OF MAIN CHANGES TO CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL : 
Recruitment to the trial has been completed and all fresh cycles have been completed up to the 
ongoing pregnancy visit. The current activities are cryo preserved cycles initiated within [ADDRESS_2148] for management of subjects  included in the trial  
• Cryo preserved cycles :  
o Cycles not yet initiated :  
do not initiate until th is COVID -19 related temporary deferral of cryo preserved  cycles 
has been lifted  
o Cycles already initiated and where transfer has not occurred:  
continue per protocol and document any deviations  
o Cycles where transfer has occurred:  
continue per protocol and docu ment any deviations  
o Note:  timelines for cryo preserved  cycles will be extended by [CONTACT_2256]  
• Pregnancy follow -up:  
continue per protocol and document any  deviations   
 
In case subjects are prevented from attending scheduled visits, the investigator (or designee) will 
attempt to contact [CONTACT_2257].

Ferring Pharmaceuticals  CONFIDENTIAL  IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGE:  
The implications of the se changes to the protocol are summari zed below. The actions are 
considered urgent safety measures due to COVID -[ADDRESS_2149] to their health and safety and are there fore implemented immediately .  
 
• Trial sites, regulatory authorities and independent research boards will be informed.  
• Subjects will be verbally informed by [CONTACT_2258], as applicable for the individual subject. This will be documented in the subject’s 
medical records.  
• Protocol deviations (including deviations to the aspects described in this ‘change to 
protocol’) should be avoided whenever possible except where necessary to eliminate an 
immedi ate hazard to the subject. If deviations occur they will be documented as per 
standard practice, with additional specification whether they were related to the COVID -19 
situation.  
• Ferring will continuously monitor the situation and will resume the trial a ctivities as per 
protocol when it is judged that the situation allows for this. Ferring will notify sites, 
regulatory authorities and independent research boards accordingly.

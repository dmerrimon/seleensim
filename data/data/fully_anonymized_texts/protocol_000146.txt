V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 III. Study Objectives  
This protocol outlines the research procedures for Phase II of “Addressing violence and HIV 
cascade of care outcomes among transgender women” (1R21-MH -121974-01). Phase I of this 
study included the systematic adaptation of the Seeking Safety Program (SSP) for transgender 
women of color (TWOC) living with HIV  to improve engagement in the HIV Cascade of Care, 
using the ADAPT-ITT model. The objectives of Phase II of this study are: (1) to examine the 
feasibility, acceptability, and prel iminary efficacy of the adapted behavioral intervention by 
[CONTACT_14664] a one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_61724]  30 transgender women of color ( TWOC ) living with HIV who 
have a history of trauma ; and (2) to identify strategies for large-scale rigorous implementation of 
intervention research with transgender women through exit interviews with pi[INVESTIGATOR_798].  
IV. Specific Aims  
HIV disproportionately affects transgender women (TW; individuals with a feminine and/or 
female gender identity who were assigned male at birth). Evidence suggests that TW have [ADDRESS_583549] rates of new diagnoses by [CONTACT_547], with TW of color (TWOC) representing a 
majority of these cases.2 The HIV Continuum of Care (HIV -CoC ) framework emphasizes rapid 
diagnosis of HIV upon seroconversion, linkage to care, and ultimately, maintaining viral load suppression; however, there is substantial drop- off at each step of the HIV -CoC among TWOC 
with significant disparities in rapid diagnosis and linkage to and retention in care.
3,4 
TWOC experience frequent discrimination and oppression due to their gender identity and/or 
expression, often in the form of violence from partners, strangers, law enforcement, and in 
public accommodations.[ADDRESS_583550]-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and substance use, which is also a major issue among some 
communities of TWOC.9-11 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_456605], violence, and substance use are concurrent and 
mutually reinforcing, constituting a “syndemic” or synergistic interaction that contributes to 
documented inequities in HIV -CoC outcomes among TWOC.12-[ADDRESS_583551] to violence and 
HIV.19 Currently there are few evidence-supported, trauma-informed strategies for meeting the 
unique needs of TWOC living with HIV. The “Seeking Safety Program” (SSP) is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_142408], flexible, empowering, and trauma-informed group-level intervention designed to reduce 
PTSD symptoms and substance use among a variety of populations.
20 Primary acceptability 
data of an adaptation of this program with TW in San Francisco lends support to the relevance 
of the i ntervention with TWOC living with HIV.21 Guided by [CONTACT_2296]’s expertise working with 
TWOC and SSP, we respond to RFA -MH-20-2010 (Addressing the Role of Violence on HIV 
Care and Viral Suppression) by [CONTACT_456630] (the adapted intervention 
will be referred to as “Trans Sistas of Color Project Seeking Safety Program ( TSoCP SSP).” 
TSoCP SSP  will include individual and group sessions that will address unique experiences of 
violence, power, and gender affirmation needs of TWOC living with HIV, with a specific focus on engagement in HIV care and PTSD symptoms.  
There are three specific aims of the parent study  (1R21-MH -121974-01) . Aim 1 was completed 
in Phase I. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed in Phase II, the current study:  
IV-1. Aim 1 : To conduct a systematic adaptation of SSP for TWOC living with HIV, with a focus 
on addressing trauma caused by [CONTACT_456631], gender 
affirmation needs, and engagement in HIV care.  
Page 8 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 In Phase I of this study, the ADAPT -ITT model22 was be used to systematically adapt this 
intervention. To achieve this aim, we c onducted interviews with TWOC (n=15-20) and key 
stakeholders (n=5-10; i.e., organization leaders, healthcare providers) to inform the adaptation. 
Our community advis ory board of TWOC living with HIV will review all adapted materials.  
IV-2. Aim 2 : To examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted 
SSP intervention on engagement in care (primary outcome), PTSD symptoms (secondary 
outcome) , viral load (tertiary outcome) and the potential mediating roles of gender affirmation, 
empowerment, self-efficacy, and collective self-esteem. 
To address Aim 2, we will conduct a feasibility and acceptability one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_456606] [ADDRESS_583552] 
feasibility, acceptability data related to identifying, recruiting, enrolling, intervening with, and 
retaining participants (i.e. length of recruitment period, screening procedures , feasibility of 
conducting group sessions, acceptability of the intervention, rates of retention, feasibility of 
verifying self-reported and medical chart review data on retention in care and viral load) and conduct exit interviews with participants and s taff at program conclusion. Preliminary efficacy 
data will be collected at baseline, end of program, and [ADDRESS_583553]-intervention follow -up.  
IV-3. Aim 3 : To identify strategies for large-scale rigorous implementation of intervention 
research with TW. 
To address Aim 3, we will gather information from one-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_456607]-knit communities and limited-resources settings.  
The proposed study has the potential for high public health impact by [CONTACT_456632], 
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an adapted, evidence-based program to address violence and HIV CoC outcomes among a highly vulnerable and overlooked population 
disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_10840]. Our focus on TWOC is in line with the prioritization of 
sexual and gender minority communities for health disparities research,
23,24 as well as the “treat” 
and “respond” strategies of the new HHS plan for ending the U.S. HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901].[ADDRESS_583554] the potential to provide a “blueprint” to guide 
future research efforts with TWOC who are often embedded in close-knit communities with few 
culturally -responsive services.

V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 V. Background Information  
HIV disproportionately affects TW (i.e., individuals with a feminine and/or female gender identity 
who were assigned male at birth). TW have [ADDRESS_583555] of all risk groups.27 Treatment as Prevention (TasP) involves preventing new 
infections by [CONTACT_456633], immediate initiation of 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and maintaining viral load (VL) suppression 28-[ADDRESS_583556] promising HIV prevention strategy.32 TasP is estimated to be highly 
beneficial —in both simulation work and population-based data, achieving and maintaining high 
levels of VL suppression w ithin a community has been shown to lead to substantial reductions 
in HIV transmission.29-31,[ADDRESS_583557] extremely 
high burden of violence among trans gender  populations, with prevalence estimates of 58-89% 
in the US.5,[ADDRESS_583558]-traumatic stress 
disorder symptoms, stress, anxiety, and depression among TW.12-17,46 Among people living with 
HIV, violence is linked to avoiding care, suboptimal ART adherence,  and a lower odds of viral 
suppression, via pathways including chronic stress, immune inflammatory response, PTSD, and 
substance use.47-51 These epi[INVESTIGATOR_456608], constituting a “syndem ic” that contributes to documented inequities in HIV -CoC 
outcomes among TW.8,17 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_456609] -CoC outcomes, there are few public health strategies for meeting the unique needs of 
TWOC  living with HIV. 
 
Gender affirming, trauma-informed, and culturally -responsive HIV interventions are critically 
needed for TWOC. Gender affirmation refers to “an interpersonal, interactive process whereby a 
person receives social recognition and support for their gender identity and expression”.52 For 
TW, positive gender affirmation is a source for positive identity development, self-esteem, and 
self-efficacy ;52,[ADDRESS_583559] be 
developed in partnership with and led by [CONTACT_456634]. Health and counseling services that are 
gender affirming and are responsive to TWOC’s intersectional identities and unique experiences 
are warranted to reduce internalized transphobia/racism, enhance feelings of self-efficacy, and 
build collective-self-effic acy and empowerment.60-62 Thus, to be maximally effective, 
interventions designed to address HIV -CoC outcomes with TWOC  need to incorporate gender 
affirmation, address the role of violence, and be responsive to the unique needs and 
experiences of TWOC .  
Page 10 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 Seeking Safety Program (SSP) is an evidence-based intervention that represents a promising 
approach to improving HIV -CoC outcomes and PTSD symptoms among TWOC. Our formative 
qualitative data with 32 TWOC in Detroit highlighted the need for gender affirming group-based 
interventions that address trauma and mental health concerns TWOC experience as a result of 
violence and intersectional oppression.63 They also expressed the need for individual sessions 
focused on personal needs and referrals to gender affirming healthcare and social services, and 
emphasized the importance of programs for TWOC being led by [CONTACT_456634].63 SSP is a  trauma-
informed manualized, group-based intervention conceptually grounded in Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy,64 and includes modules focused on: PTSD; Taking Back Your Power; Detaching from 
Emotional Pain; Taking Good Care of Yourself; Compassion; Commitment; Setting Boundaries 
in Relationships; Respecting Your  Time; Healthy Relationships; and Healing from Anger. This 
psychoeducational approach helps participants understand the links between trauma (including 
violence), substance use, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_456610] a focus on the present and future, discouraging 
detailed discussions of past trauma.[ADDRESS_583560]. Dawson -Rose, again conducting the SSP with TW 
living with HIV, but focusing on co-occurring HIV and PTSD symptoms, shifting the primary 
outcome of focus from substance abuse to engagement along the HIV -CoC. This adaptation will 
also be specific to TWOC living with HIV in settings where there are limited resources for TW, 
like Detroit. Intervention content will be adapted to prioritize HIV -CoC outcomes and enhance 
the cultural relevance and contextual depth of the program for TWOC living with HIV. We will 
retain the general SSP structure, but adapt individual sessions (# of sessions to be determined) 
to assist TWOC to access gender affirming care for HIV, mental health, and substance use, as 
well as gender -related care and other needed social services. Finally, program facilitation and 
individual sessions will be provided by [CONTACT_456635]  (PHEs ).  
 
This study develops a foundation for rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCT) addressing 
violence and HIV with TW in limited- resource settings. Consistent with RFA (MH -20-2010), this 
R21 exploratory/ developmental grant application will provide essential understandings about 
the community readiness for rigorous efficacy trials addressing the dual issues of violence and 
HIV treatment outcomes in this highly vulnerable population. RCTs  in bio-behavioral research 
are the “gold standard” in evaluations of interventions ; however, the responsible and ethical 
conduct of RCTs in vulnerable populations requires consideration of the target community’s perspectives about methodological criteria and standards that are valued by [CONTACT_456636] . For example, community perspectives are needed to inform the selection and 
delivery of a control condition, which will be essential in larger efficacy trials. Moreover, i t has 
long been noted that cross -contamination, or the interchange of information among participants 
from different study conditions, may be a source of considerable bias.
66 Although procedures 
are often adopted to reduce these threats the validity (e.g., blinding to study condition), TWOC  
have close- knit communities and often live in limited-resource settings such that there is  the real 
potential for differential effects of cross -contamination vis -à-vis sharing intervention content 
between conditions . Compounding these methodological issues  is the deep rooted mistrust of 
researchers by [CONTACT_456637]  – which affects recrui tment, retention, and engagement of 
participants in intervention research.67,68 As such, the adaptation of promising and urgently 
needed interventions requires input from community members to identify solutions to implement 
rigorous research designs .

V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 In summary,  violence is a public health priority for TWOC and has been consistently linked with 
avoiding car e, suboptimal ART adherence, and lower odds of viral suppression among TWOC 
living with HIV. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_456611], constituting a 
“syndemic”  that contributes to documented inequities in HIV -CoC outcomes among TWOC . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_456612] -CoC, there are few 
evidence-supported and trauma-informed strategies for meeting the unique needs of TWOC  
living with HIV. SSP is a promising,  flexible , empowering, and trauma-informed group-level 
intervention that has had positive effects on PTSD symptoms and substance use among a 
variety of populations  with a history of violence, incl uding TW. The intervention developed 
through the proposed research will be based in a gender affirmation framework on engagement 
in care and PTSD symptoms . Findings will also provide critical insights into solutions to 
overcome challenges to implementing R CT designs (e.g. mistrust, contamination, control 
conditions ) in geographical loca les with limited resources for TWOC .

comfort that PHE’s use for navigation sessions. Information is provided to health 
care and mental health providers to facilitate 
“warm hand -offs”. There is a need to expand 
beyond intimate partners to be inclusive of experiences of violence from dates, family, 
and strangers. Violence also took on 
psychological forms (e.g., controlling 
behaviors, partners keepi[INVESTIGATOR_456613] “down low”). The s creener would also be 
most useful if it included gender affirmation 
needs (i.e., legal and medical) to assist with

two hour group sessions that are 
approximately 1 week apart 
focused on teaching effective, 
concrete c ognitive and behavioral 
skills.  PHE’s need to be TWOC and deliver the 
intervention. The intervention needs to be condens ed to 8  sessions maximum for TWOC 
to complete the entire program. After reviewing the content of all of the SSP 
sessions, the team decided on the following 
sessions: 1) Prioritizing Safety , 2) 
Understanding trauma and PTSD ; 3) Getting 
support from yourself and others ; 4) Taking 
care of your whole self; 5) Knowing your 
triggers and how to handle them; 6) Setting boundaries in relationships; 7) Healthy

people to healthcare systems and 
identify and reduce barriers to

include working together to create 
an individualized health behavior

navigation services, which is key to building 
trust and safety planning based on shared 
experience. PHE’s will need to provide 
assistance with identifying trans -friendly HIV 
prevention and care services , as well as 
gender affirmation services (e.g., name 
[CONTACT_178486], hormones). Individualized health 
behavior change plans will also identify and 
work to address barriers to reducing HIV 
transmission risk (e.g., violence from dates) 
and engagement in HIV services.

V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 VII. Study Design  
In this R21, w e propose to adapt, integrate, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a culturally -relevant multicomponent 
trauma-informed intervention, which includes peer -led individual sessions, an adaptation of SSP 
group-level intervention (the TSoCP SSP), and a GBV and gender affirmation needs s creening 
aimed at improving HIV Care  Continuum outcomes.59-[ADDRESS_583564] conducted interviews with TWOC (n=10) and key stakeholders (n=5-10; i.e., 
organization leaders, heal thcare providers) to inform the adaptation and implementation 
process. Phase I of the parent study included “ADAPTT-ITT Phases 4-7” (see Table 2 below).  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_583565].67 Phase

sessions, participants will have 1-on-1 sessions with a PHE  as part of the intervention. 1-on-1 
intervention sessions will focus on identifying health-related needs and linking participants to 
affirming healthcare referrals and community resources, as well as individualized follow -up from 
group sessions  (see Appendix Y. Resource and Referral List).  During enrollment visit study 
procedures, partici pants will complete a Violence and Gender Affirmation Screener (see 
Appendix XII-3. Violence & Gender Affirmation Screener ) that PHEs will access that collects

attending optional additi onal 1-on-1 sessions with a PHE during the 8 weeks they are attending 
group sessions, up to once a week.  
VII-2. Assessing Acceptability and Feasibility  
To assess feasibility, we will monitor rates of outreach, recruitment, eligibility, enrollment, 
attendance, retention, and assessment completion. PHEs will complete a structured 
“intervention log” after each session to assess fidelity to intervention, time needed, and feasibility of delivering the intervention curriculum as designed (see Appendix XII-4 . Intervention 
Log). To assess  acceptability, we will use a modified version of the Client Satisfaction 
Questionnaire ( see Appendix XII-5 . Adapted Client Satisfaction Questionnaire), which 
participants will complete at the end of each group and individual sess ion. We will also assess 
acceptability using data on participants’ reactions to various program components gathered 
from PHEs “intervention logs”. We will also explore the feasibility and acceptability of verifying 
HIV care engagement and viral load data by [CONTACT_456639]/or clinic for verification of their self-reported health care behaviors. Feasibility will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_456640]. Acceptability of our verification methods by [CONTACT_456641] (90% or higher will be considered acceptable) and wi ll be explored during exit interviews  with participants a nd staff.  Finally, we will 
conduct 30- minute exit interviews at the conclusion of the program with both participants and 
program staff to gather qualitative feedback about the structure, content, and experience of the intervention. Participant exit interviews will also explore barriers to RCT designs and 
implementation. (See Appendix XII-6 . Exit Interview Guide – Participants, Appendix XII-7 . Exit

in Phase I indicated that many from the focus population had a strong preference for study 
activities to occur in-person when possible, and that certain activities (specifically, individual and 
group intervention sessions and the exit interview) are anticipated to provide greater potential benefit to participants if delivered in person. Given this, if we are able to do conduct activities in-

Before conducting any in-person interaction, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_456616] -19 safety procedures that 
will be followed during all in-person interactions between study staff and/or participants, based 
on current guidelines. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_456617] -19 safety procedures 
for in-person activities. No in-person research activities will occur until both approvals are received.   
VIII-2. Recruitment  
Consistent with our ongoing and prior studies, w e will employ a multi -pronged outreach strategy  
to recruit trans women of color , including 1) Online recruitment: Banner ads and digital flyers will 
be placed social media platforms used by [CONTACT_456642], such as the Trans Sistas o f Color Facebook 
page; 2) Print Ads: Flyers will be placed in healthcare and social service agencies in the Detroit 
Metro Area where transgender women seeks services; 3) Outreach: If safe and approved to do 
in-person, study staff will also conduc t outreach in areas where transgender women congregate. 
Through decades of experience, the Trans Sistas of Color Project has identified optimal sites, 
days, and times to reach transgender women including the bars, clubs, street corners, mini 
markets, restaurants, boutiques, wig shops, and nail salons. Recruitment and promotional 
activities and materials wil l be discussed at Community Advisory Board  (CAB ) meetings.  
 
VIII-3. Eligibility Screening  
Those interested in the study will call the study RA, who will provide more information about the 
study (see Appendix XII- 11. Screener Script). Interested potential participants will complete an 
eligibility survey programmed into Qualtrics. The same eligibility survey will be utilized for the 
current study (focused on engagement in HIV care  for transgender women of color who are 
living with HIV ) as for our concurrent study, which will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and 
initial efficacy of the TSoC P SSP for transgender women of color who are HIV -negative or have 
an unknown status , with a goal of improving engagement in HIV prevention services  (“A 
multicomponent intervention to address gender -based violence in HIV prevention for women: 
Phase 2”; HUM0 0190671). Potential participants who meet el igibility criteria outlined in Section 
X-2.1 Inclusion Criteria will be informed that they are eligible for the study and given the choice 
to continue to the informed consent. Potential participants who are ineligible for this study but who are eligible for the concurrent study focused on HIV care  (HUM00190671) will be informed 
they are eligible for that study, and will be given the choice to continue to that study’s informed consent, following the HIV prevention study’s protocol. Potential participants who are ineligible 
for both studies will be informed that they are ineligible to participate and thanked for their time. (See Appendix XII-1 2. Eligibility Survey .)  
VIII-4. Enrollment Procedures  
The enrollment study visit will consist of 4 components: informed consent, locator form, baseline survey, and violence and gender affirmation screener. All 4 components will be programmed 
into Qualtrics and completed by [CONTACT_456643]. If the enrollment visit occurs in person, 
she may complete the Qualtrics surveys on a tablet with assistance from the study RA as 
needed. If the enrollment visit occurs virtually, the study RA will send participants a link to 
complete the Qualtrics surveys on their own personal device.  
Page 17 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 VIII-4.1. Informed Consent . Eligible participants who indicate they are interested will be linked to 
the Informed Consent ( see Appendix XII-9 . Consent Form ), which will be programmed into 
Qualtrics and linked to their Study ID. Given the sensitive nature of data collected we will 
request a waiver of documentation of informed consent. After providing informed consent, 
participants will be asked if they are willing to provide a medical release; if willing, participants 
will be directed to a separate Qualtrics survey to complete the medical release, so that their 
medical information will not be linked to the consent form. Participants will also be asked to 
provide contact [CONTACT_456644] a release of information. This information will be used to facilitate obtaining data 
related engagement in HIV treatment  services , including lab test results indicating viral load. 
Participants may decline to provide a medical release and still participate in the study.  
VIII-4.[ADDRESS_583570] sources including but not limited to email, 
social m edia (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat)  usernames . Participants will also 
be asked to provide valid contact [CONTACT_19297] a family member and/or friend who can be 
called in the event the participant cannot be reached by [CONTACT_61529], as well as locations 
where they typi[INVESTIGATOR_456618]. Participants will be asked if 
messages can be left at the numbers provided. Staff will not leave messages unless expressly permitted to do so by [CONTACT_2299], which will be documented on this form. If permission is 
given to leave messages, study staff will assure participants that messages left with a family 
member or friend will only ask that the participant contact [CONTACT_456645] (PHI) or information related to study participation. (See Appendix 
XII-13. Locator Form.)  
VIII-4.3 Baseline Survey . After completing the Locator Form, participants will be linked to the 
Baseline Survey on Qualtrics (see Appendix XII- 8. Survey Measures ). The baseline survey will 
take approximately [ADDRESS_583571] the 
participant and send her  a link to complete the survey at a later date.  
VIII-4.4 Violence & Gender Affirmation Screener . Immediately after completing the baseline survey, 
participants will be linked to the Violence and Gender Affirmation Screener (see Appendix XII-3 . 
Violence and Gender Affirmation Screener ). Participants will be infor med that their PHEs will 
receive the information entered into this screener.  
VIII-5. Intervention Procedures  
VIII-5.1 1-on-1 Sessions . Once a participant has completed enrollment procedures , she will be 
connected to one of the Peer Health Educators (PHEs) . The PHE will reach out and schedule 
an initial individual session with the participant. In the initial individual session, the PHE will get 
to know the participant and answer any questions she may have about the TSoCP SSP 
intervention, including group sessions. The PHE will review the participant’s responses on the 
Violence and Gender Affirmation Screener ( see Appendix XII-3 . Violence and Gender 
Affirmation Screener ) and discuss immediate safety and referral needs with the participant. 
Once immediate needs are addressed, the PHE will discuss other needs related to healthcare, 
gender affirmation, and community resources; together the PHE and participant will determine 
which referrals to prioritize. Participants may choose how frequently they would like to have 
Page 18 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 additional individual sessions throughout the intervention period (through the end of the group 
sessions), up to once a week. Individual sessions may be delivered in-person in a private space 
at the Ruth Ellis Center, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_62141]. Mode of contact/interaction for individual 
sessions will be dependent on current guidelines and approvals related to COVID -19; if/when in-
person research activities are not perm itted, all sessions will be virtual and occur by [CONTACT_456646]. If/when in-person research activities are allowed, then PHEs will defer to the participant’s preference. Regardless of the location/format of individual sessions, PHEs will 
ensure they are in a location that maintains the participant’s privacy. PHEs may follow up with 
participants in between individual sessions to facilitate referrals and connection to community 
resources. ( See Appendix XII-16. Individual Sessions Guide, and Appendix XII-[ADDRESS_583572].)   
VIII-5.[ADDRESS_583573] been enrolled and had an 
initial individual session with their PHE, weekly group sessions will commence. Group sessions 
will include pa rticipants in this study, as well as another study our research team has running 
concurrently, “ A multicomponent intervention to address gender -based violence in HIV 
prevention for women: Phase 2”  (HUM00190671); that study involves testing the feasibility, 
acceptability, and initial efficacy of the TSoCP SSP intervention on engagement in the HIV 
prevention continuum of care and mental health outcomes among transgender women who are 
HIV negative or have an unknown HIV status  in the Detroit Metro Area. Group sessions will be 
held once a week for eight weeks (see Appendix XII-1. Group Sessions Manual). Group 
sessions will either occur in-person in a private room at Ruth Ellis Center or virtually via Zoom, 
depending on current guidelines and restrictions related to COVID -19. It is possible that due to 
inclement weather or an emergency situation, session(s) may need to be rescheduled. In this 
event, a group session may be rescheduled for a later time that week or postponed to the 
following week; if a session is postponed by [CONTACT_185883], this would delay the end of the 
intervention (as well as follow up assessments and exit interview) by [CONTACT_185883]. Participants will 
be encouraged to attend all group sessions; however, if a participant misses session(s), she will 
still be allowed to remain in the intervention and attend future sessions. If a participant misses a 
group session, whenever feasible, she will be offered the opportunity to review the group 
session content with a PHE in an individual session before the next group.   
VIII-6. Follow Up Visits  
The preferred timeframe for all follow -ups is within [ADDRESS_583574] 
approximately 30 minutes, and will be audio-recorded. Exit interviews may occur in-person at 
the Ruth Ellis Center, by [CONTACT_648], or by [CONTACT_62141] (See Appendix XII -6. Exit Interview Guide –  
Participants ).  
Page [ADDRESS_583575] -Intervention Follow Up Survey . After completion of the final group session, participants 
will receive a link to complete a follow up survey on Qualtrics. The follow up survey will take 
approximately 30 minutes to complete. If in person, the Qualtrics survey may be completed on a 
study tablet; otherwise the participant will receive a link to complete the survey on her own 
personal device.  
VIII-5.[ADDRESS_583576] -Intervention Follow Up Survey . One month after the final group sessi on, 
participants will receive a link to complete a second and final follow up survey on Qualtrics. The 
follow up survey will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. If in person, the Qualtrics 
survey may be completed on a study tablet; otherwise the par ticipant will receive a link to 
complete the survey on her own personal device.  
VIII-7. Participant Incentives  
To incentivize participation, participants in the one-arm trial will receive  $40 for baseline, $[ADDRESS_583577]-intervention, and $50 for the 1-month pos t-interventions follow -up surveys , as 
well as $[ADDRESS_583578]. Participants will also be compensated for their travel for 
assessments (transportation provided through Uber or Lyft or a $[ADDRESS_583579]) and intervention 
sessions that are conducted in person, and provided a meal at in-person group sessions. To 
receive an i ncentive, participants will complete a brief incentive survey programmed into 
Qualtrics . (See Appendix XII-14. Incentive Survey .)  
VIII-8. Retention Strategies  
Our team has extensive experience in retaining transgender women of color in research studies. Much of our success can be attributed to our community -engaged approach to research efforts, 
including TSoCP serving our community partners located at the Ruth Ellis  Center, which 
provides services for young adults and is in close proximity to Corktown Heal th Center , which 
provides healthcare services  for all study participants  regardless of age . Using these methods, 
our prior studies with transgender women of color have regularly yielded follow -up rates above 
80%-90%. We will apply our rigorous multi -pronged approach to ensure high rates of follow -up.  
 Study  staff are trained to emphasize several times throughout the enrollment process that it is 
critical that we be able to reach participants for follow -up. Participants will complete a detailed 
Locator Form  with multiple methods of contact [CONTACT_456647], 
which will aid in follow up. Staff will inquire about and update any changes to contact [CONTACT_456648]. We also request that participants inform study staff if any of their contact 
[CONTACT_60565]. Participants are told that it is important that we reach them to see how 
they are doing, regardless of whether they respond to the intervention components, whether or 
not they engage in HIV care, whether or not they are doing well or poorly; that their participation 
in the study could increase scientific knowledge about whether this program is meaningful to the community ; that their research information will be confidential; and that we are grateful for their 
contribution to the study. When participants are seen in-person, they will be given [CONTACT_456685]’s business card, which is filled in with their approximate follow -up appointment date 
and the incentive amount.   
Follow -up status and challenges will be r outinely reviewed at weekly staff meetings. If follow -up 
rates fall, we will use a proactive management approach to identify the root source of the challenges and troubleshoot potential solutions. This may include meetings with our CAB to 
brainstorm soluti ons or modifying procedures.

V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021  
IX. Data Collection and Management  
IX-1. Data Collection Methods  
Data collection is the responsibi lity of the study trained staff under the supervision of the PI. 
Data will be collected on study specific electronic forms (templates) in a study specific database.  
These forms will be completed on an ongoing basis during the study. Additional data elements 
will be abstracted from medical records and entered directly into a study designed database. 
Additional participant data will be collected using computerized self-report surveys, therefore, 
participants will enter their own data (except in the case when the PI [INVESTIGATOR_456619] a research staff person to enter data for a participant, e.g. when a participant is physically unable 
or is illiterate). Finally, qualitative data will be collected in the form of an in-depth interview.  
IX-2. Storage and Security  
We will utilize Qualtrics and a study designed REDCap  database for secure remote data 
collection. Interested potential participants will contact [CONTACT_456649]; the RA will 
assign the potential participant a unique Study ID, and enter her contact [CONTACT_456650]. The Study RA will then send the potential participant a unique link to 
a Qualtrics eligibility screener survey, which will not contain/gather any personally identifiable 
data but will include the unique study ID. For those potential participants who screen eligible 
and provide informed consent to enroll in the study, their screener data will be linked to the rest 
of their longitudinal data (by [CONTACT_456651]). The 
purpose of linking screener data to baseline data is to reduce participant burden by [CONTACT_456652]-
asking questions multiple times (e.g., rather than asking about experiences of trauma in 
childhood and adulthood in the screener and then again at baseline, this allows us to only ask 
once). For those potential participants who screen ineligible and those who screen eligible but do not provide informed consent to enroll in the study, we will remove the identifier (study ID) 
from the screener data and we will delete their contact [CONTACT_456653], 
both within 2 weeks of screening ineligible. De-identified (and unlinked to study ID) screener 
data will be kept for ineligible/not enrolled potential participants in order to report on reasons for 
ineligibility at the end of the study. 
 
The surveys completed by [CONTACT_456654] a University of 
Michigan Qualtrics account or the study designed REDCap  database. Participants will receive 
an individual link to access the survey on either Qualtrics or REDCap . Par ticipant surveys will 
be coded by [CONTACT_456655]. Participants cannot access or change previously entered data through the web-based 
application. No data are stored on the local personal c omputer, but are transmitted in real time 
to the secure server at the University of Michigan. Study staff will enter data into the study 
designed REDCap  database. Logging in to the application requires a unique User ID and 
password. As with participant-entered data, no data entered by [CONTACT_456656], but are transmitted in real time to the secure server at the University of Michigan. All data will be identified by a unique study ID number. Study staff will enter data from 
a private location (office at Ruth Ellis Center, School of Public Health, or from home while 
working remotely) where the information cannot be seen by [CONTACT_456657].  
 
Page [ADDRESS_583580] protected Box folder and 
deleted from the recording device. The audio files will be retained until  the interviews are 
thematically analyzed; this will be completed and the audio files del eted within 6 months of 
completing data collection. Because the audio files contain identifying information (the participant’s voice), and because the exit interviews do not need to be linked to participants’ 
surveys or other longitudinal data, we will rem ove even the participants’ unique study ID from 
the files when storing them in order to maximally protect the participants’ privacy. Participants will also be instructed not to share their name [CONTACT_456671].  
 
Data will be stored in a password-protected database on University of Michigan computer that 
requires a separate ID and password. We will take the following additional steps to protect subjects from the risk of a breach in confidentiality. 1) All project staff will sign a confidentiality 
agreement requiring them to keep private the information obtained in this study. 2) All data will 
be collected using coded ID numbers; no surveys or other data that we collect will contain 
identifying information. 3) All hard copy materials (e.g., signed consent forms, tracking 
information) will be stored in a locked file cabinet in the office of [CONTACT_456673] or the Project  
Director (as appropriate). 4) Only aggregate data that cannot be used to identify individuals will 
be included in any reports released to other agencies or for publication. Identifying information 
linking participants to their study ID number will be stored in a separate location from data 
including the participants’ study ID number and separate from any i nformation including the 
participants’ names (such as the contact [INVESTIGATOR_56905]), and will be password-protected accessible only to authorized members of the study team . Confidentiality policies and procedures are 
reviewed with all new staff and reviewed annual ly with current staff.

V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 X. Human Subjects Research Protections  
X-1. Protection of Human Subjects  
This human subjects’ research meets the definition of “Clinical Research.” All procedures will be 
conducted in accordance with 45 CFR Part 46 and will be approved by [CONTACT_456658]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The study 
will also be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
X-2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
X-2.[ADDRESS_583581] be (1) at least 18 years old; (2) assigned male 
at birth; (3) identifies as female, transgender woman, or another feminine gender identity; (4) 
self-identifies as a person of color (any racial/ethnic identity except non-Hispanic white); (5 ) self-

Page 23 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 X-4. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
X-4.1. Potential Risks .  
Potential risks to subjects are considered minimal and include: (1) potential discomfort during 
the assessment/data collection process; (2) breaches of privacy and confidentiality; and (3) 
potential coercion.  
Potential discomfort during the assessment/data collection process.  It is  possible that 
participants may experience some discomfort in responding to questions duri ng completion of 
the interviews. It is also possible that participants will experience distress in responding to 
quantitative questions about violence, mental  health, substance use, and HIV -related behaviors. 
 
Potential breach of confidentiality. One of the primary potential risks to participants is breach of 
confidentiality. It is possible that data collection could result in breach of confidentiality. For 
participant s in the proposed project, breach of confidentiality in self-report data could reveal they 
are engaging in illegal behavior (i.e., breaking laws against drug use possession and use of 
controlled substances). However, the risk of breach of confidentiality i s also modest, given the 
safeguards protecting participants’ data. Given the nature of the group-level intervention, there 
is also the possibility that confidentiality can be broken. However, the informed consent and the 
Peer Health Educators will continually reinforce the importance of confidentiality at the 
beginning and throughout each session.  
  
Potential Coercion. The risk of coercion is also low, as the total amount of compensation during 
the study is modest in comparison to the amount of effort requi red by [CONTACT_4317] . See Section 
VIII-7. Participant Incentives for more information.  
 
X-4.2. Protection Against Risk .  
We have made every attempt to minimize risks to participants throughout the study protocol, 
including loss of privacy or confidentiality and psychological and physical discomfort. Based on 
our prior experiences, we believe that our planned procedures (desc ribed below) will be highly 
effective for minimizing risk.  
Minimizing Discomfort or distress during research.  All study staff will follow an aggressive set of 
safety procedures to make sure that participants receive a high level of monitoring which will 
meet IRB standards. Because there is potential for psychological discomfort due to the research 
topic, we will make every effort to create a secure and trustworthy environment prior to conducting study visits at the Ruth Ellis Center  or virtually . Participants will be reminded often 
that they may refuse to answer any question and that they may end their participation at any point during the interview , during the intervention sessions , exit interview, or survey 
assessments . Participants experiencing mild dist ress during the session, interview , or 
assessments will be offered to take a small break or to reschedule the assessment or session at 
a later date. In the unlikely event that a participant experiences considerable distress, they will be offered a voluntar y suicide risk  assessment (see Appendix XII-10. Suicide Risk Assessment)  
and appropriate referral . If any person is judged by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a danger to self or others, or judged 
to be in grave danger due to medical or other conditions, the decision will be made to break 
confidentiality in order to inform law enforcement authorities to intervene in order to prevent an 
adverse event. All staff will receive yearly training for identifying suicide/homicide risk and/or 
dangerous intoxication, and de-escalation of agitated or angry persons and are trained to 
appropriately evaluate and respond to these circumstances. In addition, our resource l istings will 
include emergency housing shelters, programs, clinicians, and support groups specializing in 
Page 24 of 34 
 
V2 - HIV Care   22 June 2021 relationship abuse and violence. All participants will be informed that they can withdraw at any 
point in time.  
Minimizing the risks to privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data.  The study consent form 
will inform participants of confidentiality guidelines and standards. Given the nature of the 
group-level intervention, there is also the possibility that confidentiality can be broken. However, 
the informed consent process and the Peer Health Educators (PHEs) will continually reinforce 
the importance of confidentiality at the beginning and throughout each session. Strict confidentiality will be maintained and all data will be coded by a unique in dividual study number. 
Personal identifier records will be kept in a secure password-protected location accessible to only authorized members of the study team, and any files with identifying information will be 
stored separately from other study data. Rec ords will be kept confidential to the level allowed by 
[CONTACT_456660]-anonymous records. 
Information provided by [CONTACT_456661].   
All research data will be kept in locked cabinets. Screening ID numbers will be used to identify 
specific forms. Any files that link participant’s names with an ID number will be stored separately 
in a locked file. No relea sed presentation or publications will identify study participants 
individually. The exceptions to confidentiality are those defined by [CONTACT_267061][INVESTIGATOR_456620], elder abuse, and threat of imminent action on suicidal or homicidal ideation. 
Participants will be informed of the exceptions to confidentiality in the consent process. The 
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board  and NIH representatives will have limited 
access to records (i.e. the IRB may request a review of the associated chart). Prior to any 
sharing of data sets, all personal identifiers will be removed. Data will only be shared with other 
researchers who have received IRB approval and who have agreed not to identify specific study 
participants and who will destroy or return dataset information after completing their analyses . 
All assessment and intervention procedures will be closely supervised by [CONTACT_978]. All audio 
recordings will be erased upon completion of data analysis. All  in-person  study activities will be 
conducted in a private room  at the Ruth Ellis Center  or virtually by [CONTACT_456662].     
This study involves a group-level intervention. Before potential participants are screened and in 
the informed consent document, participants will be informed that the study will  involve 
participating in group sessions with other community members. Participants will be informed 
that given the nature of the group-level intervention, there is also the possibility that 
confidentiality can be broken. However, the informed consent proc ess and the Peer Health 
Educators (PHEs) will continually reinforce the importance of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_456621]. This will include reviewing a set of "ground rules" established and agreed to during the first group 
session, which includes keepi[INVESTIGATOR_456622]. At the start of 
group sessions, participants will also be reminded that they do not have to share any personal 
information dur ing the group and may decline to answer any questions. If group sessions are 
able to occur in-person, they will occur in a private room at the Ruth Ellis Center. If group sessions must occur virtually, they will occur using a secure Zoom platform. Participants will be 
instructed to join the Zoom group from a private location where the group conversation will not 
be overheard by [CONTACT_2312]. Participants will also be asked to utilize headphones with a microphone 
to join the Zoom group session, so that if other people are nearby a participant during a Zoom 
group session, they are unable to hear things said by [CONTACT_48780]. Headphones with a 
microphone will be provided to participants who need them at the start of the study.  
Page [ADDRESS_583583] many studies, and would shortchange participants who provide time and energy, and 
may incur costs suc h as bus , Lyft/Uber , taxi, or car fares. The resolution of this problem is to 
insure that stipends are not inappropriately large, to probe potential subjects to make sure they 
have not been coerced, and to give persons who may have been coerced the opportunity not to 
enroll in the study in a manner that will protect them from retribution by [CONTACT_456663]. See Section VIII-7.  Participant Incentives for amounts. The visit stipends proposed are in 
use in similar HIV prevention studies and have been reviewed by [CONTACT_456664].  
X-4.3. Potential benefits of the proposed research to the subjects and others  
Potential benefits include the following. First and foremost, all participants will receive a referral 
list of ser vices in Southeastern, Michigan. Participants may improve in care as a result of their 
participation in the study, which could have a positive impact on their health. Participants are also provided with the opportunity to spend time talking about feelings and experiences, and 
they may gain insight into violence and HIV prevention. Participants in our previous studies 
have indicated that they benefited from this opportunity and that the prospect of providing 
information for the possible future benefit of tra nsgender women of color  was motivating for 
them. Furthermore, participants in our prior research projects have indicated a desire to be 
contact[CONTACT_7678], indicating the positive opportunities participation may provide. 
Given that the risks to s ubjects are considered to be minimal, the risk -benefit ratio is deemed 
favorable. Study procedures are carefully developed and followed to minimize risks. The potential social and psychological risks to participants described are reasonable given the need to adapt and pi[INVESTIGATOR_456623] -relevant evidence-based violence prevention interventions to 
improve engagement in the HIV  care continuum among transgender women. 
 
X-4.4. Importance of the knowledge to be gained  
The proposed study has the potential for high public health impact by [CONTACT_456632], acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an adapted, evidence-based prevention program to 
address violence and HIV engagement in care outcomes among a highl y vulnerable and 
overlooked population disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_10840] . Our focus on transgender women of 
color is in line with the prioritization of sexual and gender minority communities for health 
disparities research, as well as the strategies of the new HHS plan for ending the U.S. HIV 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. Study findings will provide the necessary groundwork to examine the efficacy of 
intervention in a future, large-scale clinical trial.  Findings also have the potential to provide a 
“blueprint” to guide future research efforts with transgender women of color  who are often 
embedded in close-knit communities with few existing services. Given the substantial health 
risks associated with documented inequities in violence and HIV outcomes and the relatively minority  risks to participants, the importance of the potential knowledge to be gained relative to 
the subject risk is favorable. 
 
X-9. Study Withdrawal and Discontinuation  
A participant may be discontinued from  the study at any time if the participant, the investigator, 
or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue. All participants are 
free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and 
without prejudice. Reasonable attempts will be m ade by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for 
participant withdrawals. The reason for the participant’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the study records.

• Participant withdrawal of consent.  
• Participant is not compliant with study procedures. 
• Participant relocates outside of study geographic area.  
• Adverse event, inclusive of participant distress, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_456624].

policies.  See protocol Section IX. Data Collection and Management for procedures to ensure 
data security and integrity. See protocol Section X -4.[ADDRESS_583586] (DSMB) unless asked to establish one by [CONTACT_4289]. However, in any 
case we will monitor for any serious adverse events caused by [CONTACT_456665]’s IRB and NIH as appropriate and as described below. We 
will have several mechanisms to ensure data integrity. 
XI-2. Contents of Monitoring  
Monitoring is done of all procedures to ensure that they conform to the approved protocol; of 
unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect s afety; of all reports of serious adverse 
events as defined in 38 CFR 46 and the FDA 312.32 (death, life-threatening experience, new or 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant disability/incapacity); of other significant 
adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by [CONTACT_456666], or medical treatment needed to prevent withdrawal); of unexpected adverse events resulting from the study; of expected adverse events; unanticipated problems involving risk to 
participants, serious or continuing non-compliance, and protocol violations.  
 
XI-3. Frequency of Monitoring  
Data and safety monitoring will be a component of regularly -scheduled weekly meetings with 
the study team. Meetings will involve a review of collected data (including adverse events, unanticipated problems, and participant withdrawals) to determine whether there is any change 
to the anticipated benefit-to-risk assessment of study participation and whether the study should 
continue as originally desi gned, should be changed, or should be terminated. [CONTACT_456673] will 
ultimately be responsible for participant safety , protocol violations, and ongoing evaluation of the 
study’s progress. If necessary, [CONTACT_456673] will make appropriate recommendations for 
changes in protocol. The University of Michigan IRB will conduct the monitoring at the 
continuing reviews as scheduled, whenever modification requests are considered, and upon 
receiving reports of SAEs and AEs  from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215717]. The NIMH PO will monitor  the 
study upon receipt of annual progress reports and whenever other information is received.   
 
XI-4. Adverse Events  
We define adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) as follows: An AE is any 
unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at 
baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to worsen. AEs will be reported regardless of their 
Page [ADDRESS_583587]. Gamarel deem to represent significant hazards.  
 
XI-5. Reporting Plan  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported regardless of their relationship to the study intervention. The study team will document all adverse events and unanticipated pr oblems (see Appendix XII-15. 
Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems Log). We will detect AEs and SAEs during 
participant visits and via survey respons es. Any serious adverse events that are observed 
and/or reported will be immediately reported to [CONTACT_456673]. We will report all AEs and SAEs by 
[CONTACT_456667]. The Research Director will prepare the appropriate IRB 
documentation, and review it with Drs. Gamarel and Harper and determine severity and relation 
to study participation. As for all clinical trials, these events will be classified along the following 
dimensions: 1) severity; 2) whether it was expected or not; and 3) the extent to which it was 
related to study participation. A report detailing all AEs and SAEs will be submitted to the 
University of Michigan IRB. SAEs will require expedited reporting (i.e., within 24 hours of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_456626]). For events that are judged to be ongoing, the Project Director will 
make weekly calls to the participant to collect updated data regarding the event. This process 
will continue until the PI [INVESTIGATOR_456627], at which time a follow -up report 
will be submitted to the University of Michigan IRB .  
 PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gamarel will promptly inform the NIM H PO and IRB of any changes in recruitment or in 
the protocol relevant to safety as the study is being performed. [CONTACT_456673] will notify the NIMH PO of any actions taken by [CONTACT_456668]. Such changes would 
include but are not limited to: amendments to the protocol, temporary su spension of parti cipant 
accrual  or of the protocol, any changes in informed consent or IRB approval status, termination 
of participant accrual or of the protocol, or other problems or issues that could affect the human 
subjects in the study. SAEs, unanticipated problems involving risk to participants or others, and 
AEs will be reported the NIMH PO within [ADDRESS_583588]. Gamarel  to the NIMH PO. Any serious or continuing noncompliance concerns will 
be reported to the NIMH PO within 10 business days of the IRB determination and suspension or termination of IRB approval will be promptly reported to the NIMH PO within 3 business days  
of receipt. The NIMH PO  will be provided copi[INVESTIGATOR_456628] a result of such events. As mandated by [CONTACT_2371], we will notify officials  if a 
participant reports intentions to harm him/herself or others, or reports child abuse or abuse of an 
elder. Co-I [CONTACT_456675] is a clinical psychologist  who will be available on call in case of any 
psychological adverse events. In the event a participant were to report a need or interest in 
treatment for psychiatric disorder , or distress, an appropriate referral to resources will be 
provided based on an extensive list of referral resources maintained at the Ruth Ellis Center. All 
events and protocol violations related to the study will be reported annually in the P rogress 
Report sent to the NIMH PO.   
Page [ADDRESS_583589] to authorize in- person research activities. All research procedures will adhere to 
current University guidelines and IRB -approved procedures; if/when University COVID -[ADDRESS_583590] procedures accordingly, obtaining IRB approval as 
appropriate.   
The informed consent process will not accessed online via a Qualtrics su rvey; instead, informed 
consent be led by [CONTACT_456669], Zoom, or in-person in a private office (in alignment 
with current COVID -19 guidelines). The Study RA will call potential participants who are 
identified as eligible in the eligibility survey. She will read the consent form to the participant, 
answer any questions she may have, confirm the participant understands the study procedures, 
and obtain verbal informed consent. The Study RA will document the informed consent process 
and whether the par ticipant consented to study procedures in the study database.

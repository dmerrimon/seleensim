Background  
 
Knee osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability worldwide.1,[ADDRESS_1063784] widely 
studied orthobiologic is platelet -rich plasma (PRP).[ADDRESS_1063785] stem cells to treat knee OA would be ideal.  Adipose (fat) is a known source of 
mesenchymal stem cells and it can be easily and safely aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774562].11  The 
adipose ti ssue aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774563] a simple process.  
After local anesthesia to the site of adipose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (lower abdomen or buttock), 30ml 
of adipose is aspi[INVESTIGATOR_38466] a cannula.  That adipose is then processed in 
accordance with FDA guidelines  including minimal manipulation (adipose only goes 
through a short, simple centrifugation to remove oils and leave s behind the fraction that 
contains mesenchymal stem cells) .12  Using of minimally manipulated, adipose derived 
stem cells has been shown safe for  use as injection the rapy for knee OA for 3 years.13,14    
 
Aim: To conduct a randomized trial comparing the clinical outcomes of PRP  (standard 
intervention)  versus Adipose -derived stem cells (investigational) .   
 
Hypothesis : Both interventions will result in significant improvement in patient -reported 
outcomes.  We hypothesize that adipose -derived stem cells will provide superior 
outcomes.   
 
Methods : 
 
Participants   / Outcome Measures / Sample size : Participants  with symptomatic knee 
OA will be recruited from the sports medicine and orthopedics clinics , as well as 
advertising flyers  within the clinic .

Diagnosis of knee OA  (primary and post -traumatic)  
 (Note: Participant  may have OA in both knees, but only the most symptomatic 
knee will be treated as part of this trial  so that patient reported outcomes are clearly 
defined for a single joint .  The non -study knee may undergo all usual care prior to 
enrollment in the study, but no additional interventions can be performed during the 
course of the trial.   If participant  requires additional treatment, the participant  will be 
unenrolled in the stud y).

Follow -up plan:  
All participants’   first visit will be standard of care  to provide a medical evaluation and 
assess best treatment plan for that  participant  , regardless of candidacy for this study.  
This evaluation includes x -rays of their knees as a standard part of the evaluation.  This 
will be billed through insurance .  If they meet criteria and choose to enroll, their 
procedure and all follow up  visits will be covered by [CONTACT_774574].  The 
schedule  will be as follows (by [CONTACT_19313]):  
 PRP:  
1) Baseline  (at time of enrollment during initial clinical evaluation, billed to 
insurance  as standard evaluation , RedCap surveys  administered in 
clinic ) 
2) Injection (REDCap surveys  in clinic ) 
3) 1 month  (REDCap surveys in clinic)

Primary outcome : KOOS -Pain [ADDRESS_1063789] protected, location secured medical 
center computer.  
This study will utilize REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a software toolset 
and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of clinical and 
research data, to collect and store data. The Ohio State Center for Clinical and 
Translational Science (CCTS) Research Informatics Services will be used as a central 
location for data processing and management. REDCap provides a secure, web -based 
application that provides an intuitive data manipulation interface, custom reporting 
capabilities, audit trail functionality, real -time data monitoring/querying of participant 
records, and variations of data exporting/importing. REDCap is hosted by [CONTACT_774576] ([ADDRESS_1063790]; Room 345)  
REDCap instance is located on an internal OSUWMC network. Remote access to this 
network can be obtained over an encrypted VPN tunnel (AnyConnect). This VPN uses 
Protocol: DTLS and Cipher: RSA_ AES_128_SHA1. Background checks are performed 
on all staff that are on the network or obtaining VPN access.  
 
 
Randomization  
Participants will be randomized  using randomization function available in RedCap.  
 
Statistics  
 
Continuous variables will be checked for normality and subsequently compared using 
either unpaired t -tests (for normally distributed data) or Mann -Whitney U test (for non -
normally distributed data ) at 6 months for the primary outcome.  The variables will be 
analyzed again at 12 months ..  
 
 
After randomization,  participants  , medical staff and research team will note treatment 
arm allocation.  
All participants  will receive the following pre -procedural instructions  
 Avoid non -steroidal anti -inflammatories (NSAIDs) and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87458] [ADDRESS_1063791] venipuncture from the antecubital 
fossa and mixed with 24 mL ACD -A (manufacturer recommends 8 mL ACD -A per 52 mL of 
whole blood).  156ml of w hole blood will be  processed in the FDA Cleared Angel cPRP 
system at 2% hematocrit.   
 
1ml of whole blood and  the resultant PRP will be analyzed in the Sysmex XN-350 for 
complete analysis (platelet, leukocyte  [total and differential], red blood cell counts) .  This 
data will be housed in the same RedCap system.   The PRP left over after the Sysmex 
testing will be frozen in de -identified tubes in the -80C degree freezer on the 2nd floor of 
the Jameson Crane Sports Medicine Institute which is locked and only study staff have 
access to. At the conclusion of the study, this PRP will be thawed and sent for growth 
factor quantification (measuring transforming growth factor, platelet der ived growth factor  
and interleukin -1). This analysis requires that all samples be completed in a single batch.  
For that reason, all samples will be kept in the freezer until the end of the study.     
 
The remaining PRP (estimated 4 -6mL) will be  injected  under sterile technique  using 
ultrasound -guidance through a superolateral approach .  For  participant   comfort, 2mL of 
1% lidocaine can be administered using a 26 -gauge needle (into soft tissues only).   PRP 
will then be  injected using a [ADDRESS_1063792] -
injection precautions and 1 month follow -up scheduled.  
 
Adipose -derived stem cell  
Adipose will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774564]  
(depending on best available specific to each participant  ).  Once the area is prepared 
using standard sterile precautions, the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774565] 10ml 1% 
lidocaine  with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] .  A small poke incision will be made with an 11 -blade scalpel 
(to allow for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774566]).   Then 120ml of Klein solution will 
be injected into the adipose tissue (facilitates ease of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) .  Solution will sit for 15 
minutes to allow for adequate anesthesia.   Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774567] a back and forth  motion for 2 minutes to allow for ease of adipose 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].   Then under continued sterile conditions , 30ml fat will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_11117] 13G 
cannula.   Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774568].  T he aspi[INVESTIGATOR_774569] ™ (Lipogems, Norcross, GA ).  This 
is a FDA cleared  device that efficiently processes adipose to remove oil and leave 
mesenchymal stem cells for injection.  Briefly, the 30ml of adipose is transferred to the 
device , saline is run through the device to remove oils and then approximately 5 -7ml of 
adipose tissue is removed and ready for injection. T his isolates the fraction of tissue that 
contains stem cells .  The adipose derived cells are then injected  in identical fa shion to 
the PRP above (except an 18 -gauge needle will be used for the injection due to higher 
viscosity).      
 
0.5ml of adipose derived stem cells will be analyzed in the comparative orthopedics 
laboratory for total stem cell count and viability.   
 
For both groups, if there is excess synovial fluid (an  effusion ), this will be removed 
(standard of care) prior to in jecting the PRP or ADSC.  This synovial fluid will be 
immediately analyzed for a complete blood count and then frozen in de -identified tubes 
in a locked -80C freezer on the second floor of the Jameson Crane Sports Medicine 
Institute.  Only approved study s taff will have access to this.  At the conclusion o f the 
study, all frozen samples will be analyzed for inflammatory proteins  (IL-1, IL-8, TNF)  
This analysis requires that all samples be completed in a single batch.  For that reason, 
all samples will be kept in the freezer until the end of the study.    
 
After care 
Tylenol and ice are permissible for immediate pain control.  
In the event of a post -injection flare (a possible risk), over -the-counter NSAIDs  will be 
permitted until the flare resolves (standard of care).     
No impact lower limb activity (running, lifting) for the first [ADDRESS_1063793] at the  injection 
visit and the  1,3, 6 month and 12 month follow up visits.

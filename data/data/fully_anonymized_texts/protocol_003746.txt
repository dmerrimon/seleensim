2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
Vitiligo is a common chronic autoimmune disorder of the skin characterized by [CONTACT_61911][INVESTIGATOR_889926] -induced loss of melanocytes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].1  The disease is associated with an 
impaired q uality of life (QoL).[ADDRESS_1245990] on men 
and women.3  Vitiligo manifests as milky -white patches of pi[INVESTIGATOR_889927].  Early depi[INVESTIGATOR_889928].  In 2011, an 
international consensus classified vitiligo into segmental vitiligo and non -segmental vitiligo (NSV), with 
the majority of patients (> 90%) exhibiting the non -segmental variant.4  Segmental vitiligo refers to 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_889929] a segmental or unilateral pattern, whereas NSV lesions 
are distributed bilaterally.4  In general, the term vitiligo is being used to describe all forms of NSV, which 
includes acrofacial, mucosal, generalized, universal, mixed, and rare variants.
The global prevalence of vitiligo is approximately 0.5% to 2%, and patients with vitiligo often have 
psychological and autoimmune comorbidities.2,5,6  Vitiligo has been associated with several 
auto -immune diseases such as thyroid disease (Hashimoto thyroiditis), psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), alopecia areata, pernici ous anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and diabetes mellitus.  It has 
also been associated with inflammatory bowel disease and sometimes ocular and audiological 
abnormalities.7,[ADDRESS_1245991] a decreased risk of melanoma and non -melanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC),9,10clinical practice recommends constant use of sunscreen due to the risks of 
sunburn from direct sunlight on depi[INVESTIGATOR_427409].  Overall, the effect of vitiligo o n QoL impairment 
seem to be associated with the distribution of vitiligo lesions (e.g., face, genital area) but also by [CONTACT_889948], highlighting the unmet need of effective systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
There are few treatment options for vitiligo and these have limited efficacy.  Thus, there is a lack of 
options for patients with vitiligo, particularly those with severe manifestation of the disease, given the 
limited response to currently available topi[INVESTIGATOR_889930].
Impairment or death o f melanocytes is believed to be the direct cause of vitiligo.  Melanocytes produce 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889931], which colors the skin and provides protection from UV radiation.  While several 
theories describe vitiligo pathogenesis, the exact etiology is unknown. The autoimmune theory 
hypothesizes that interferon (IFN) -y is an important cytokine expressed in lesional skin and is required 
for the recruitment of melanocyte -specific, autoreactive CD8+ T cells to the skin via the chemokines 
CXCL9/10 and CXCR3.11,12  Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient for melanocyte 
destruction in the skin of vitiligo patients and therefore serve as the effector arm driving the 
autoimmunity of vitiligo.  The Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 
(STAT) pathway is therefore an attractive therapeutic target due to its direct effect on IFN -y and CXCL10 
levels.

treatment of patients with vitiligo.13  Ruxoliti nib (a JAK1/2 inhibitor), in a topi[INVESTIGATOR_59420], has 
demonstrated efficacy in treating patients with vitiligo in a Phase 2 study14and is currently enrolling 
patients in two Phase 3 studies.15,16  [COMPANY_013] developed a J AK inhibitor, upadacitinib, which, when given 
systemically may address the current needs for patients with vitiligo.  Upadacitinib is a selective and 
reversible inhibitor of JAK1 that recently has received approval for the treatment of RA, psoriatic 
arthri tis (PsA), and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in some countries and is also being developed for the 
treatment of other immune -mediated inflammatory diseases, including dermatologic conditions such as 
atopic dermatitis (AD) and hidradenitis suppurativa.
Clinic al Hypothesis
Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the skin characterized by [CONTACT_889949]/STAT pathway.  Upadacitinib is predicted to provide better efficacy 
compared to placebo and to be well tolerat ed in vitiligo subjects.
2.[ADDRESS_1245992] common therapi[INVESTIGATOR_889932]; nonetheless, treatment can be burdensome to patients as it requires multiple and 
frequent visits to the office or home therapy and is associated with a high relapse rate within the first 
year upon discontinuation (average 40%), highlighting the need for long -lasting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].17
At this time, patients with significant vitiligo, including patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574], are 
commonly treated with oral steroids which are not suitable for long -term use.
The efficacy of upadacitinib has shown promising results in various immune -mediated diseases including 
dermatologic conditions such as AD.18
Adverse events (AEs) such as infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic AEs 
have been observed in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib.  The available long -term 
safety data from the Phase 3 RA studies with upadac itinib showed an increased risk of infection 
including opportunistic infections (e.g., mucosal candida infections) and herpes zoster, as well as 
abnormal laboratory changes have been observed (e.g., elevations of serum transaminases, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
creatine phosp hokinase [CPK], and reductions in hemoglobin and white blood cells [WBCs]) with 
upadacitinib therapy.  The incidence rates of other clinically important AEs such as cardiovascular 
events, malignancies, and mortality reported during the RA studies were with in the expected range for 
the general population or for a population of patients with moderately to severely active RA.19  Events of 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism have been reported in patients receiving JAK 
inhibitors including upadacitinib.  Similar findings of these important AEs were also observed in the 
clinical studies for other indications including PsA and AD.  AEs of acne have been observed more 
frequently with upadacitinib treatment versus placebo in Phase 3 PsA and AD studies.
The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadac itinib is not genotoxic; however, 
upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in

seminal fluid trans fer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects 
who are treated with upadacitinib.
A detailed discussion of the pre -clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, and safety 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator 's Brochure.19
Taken to gether, the safety and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable 
benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib and support the continued investigation of upadacitinib in patients 
with various immune -mediated inflammatory conditions including vitiligo.
In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624] -19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects of upadacitinib 
on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined .

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized , double -blinded, parallel -group, placebo -controlled 
dose -ranging study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib in adult subjects ≥ 18 to 
65years of age with NSV.  The study is comprised of a 35 -day Screening Period, a 24 -week double -blind 
treatment period (Period 1), a 28 -week blinded long -term extension (Period 2), and a 30 -day Follow -up 
Period.
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria at Baseline will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five 
treatment groups:
Group 1:  upadacit inib 22 mg once daily (QD) (N = 40) (Period 1) → upadaci nib 22 mg QD 
(Period 2)
Group 2:  upadacitinib 11 mg QD (N = 40) (Period 1) → upadaci nib 11mg QD (Period 2)
Group 3:  upadacitinib 6 mg QD (N = 40) (Period 1) → upadaci nib 6 mg QD (Period 2)
Group 4:  placebo (N = 20) (Period 1) → upadaci nib 22 mg QD (Period 2)
Group 5:  placebo (N = 20) (Period 1) → upadaci nib 11 mg QD (Period 2)
At Week 24, subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will be switched to either 22 mg 
(Group 4) or 11 mg (Group 5) upadacitinib in a blinded fashion per pre -specified randomization 
assignments.
The [COMPANY_013] study team will be unblinded to perform the Week [ADDRESS_1245993] prematurely discontinued prior to 
Week 24.  Sites and subjects will remain blinded throughout the study.
Information on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is described in Section 6.3.  Information on the 
Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) and gastrointestinal (GI) perforation adjudication are 
described in Section 6.1.
See Section 5.1for information regarding eligibility criteria and Section 5.8for information on 
stratification.

Care should be taken to minimize the pain and discomfort of laboratory procedures.  Use of a butterfly 
needle for venipuncture and/or a needle gauge appropriate for vein size may optimize the comfort for 
some individuals.  Attempts at venipuncture should be limited to the subject 's tolerance of the 
procedure; after more than [ADDRESS_1245995]

2L over a 24 -hour period).
Suitability of Subject Population
The intended study population is adult subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1245996] not been studied 
in other upadacitinib indications (e.g., RA, PsA, AS, and AD).
Patients with vitiligo generally present with a clinically (and biologically) different disease profile 
compared to previously studied indications for upadacitinib.  Although vitiligo significantly impairs QoL, 
it is generally considered an asymptomatic dermatosis (some patients may suffer from skin 
irritation/itching), and is usually associated with lower comorbidities, minimal background and 
concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and less heterogeneous signs and symptoms of the disease.  Hence, the 
upadacitinib dose(s) that may provide optimal benefit risk in patients with vitiligo are yet to be 
determined and may occur at dose levels that have not been previously explored for other indications.
Upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD doses showed significant clinical benefit for treatment of subjects 
with RA, PsA, AS, and AD in Phase 3 studies, with an added clinical benefit of 30 mg compared to 15 mg 
for some (e.g., AD) but not all (e.g., RA, PsA) indications.

discontinued or terminated in case of an unacceptable risk, any relevant toxicity, or a negative change in 
the risk/benefit assessment.  This might include the occurrence of AEs with a character, severity, or 
frequency that is new in comparison to the existing risk profile.  In addition, data deriving from other 
clinical trials or toxicological studies whic h negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment might cause 
discontinuation or termination of the study.  The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if 
he/she has safety concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will promptly 
notify the investigator.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_12899].
Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the study at any time for any reason.  The 
investigator may discontinue any subject 's participation at any time for any reason.  The [COMPANY_013] 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD)/Scientific Director may mandate individual subject 
discontinuation from study drug in case of safety concern.
Subjects must have stud y drug discontinued immediately if any of the following occur:
The subject requests withdrawal from study drug or the study.
The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
Abnormal laboratory results or AEs that either meet the criter ia for discontinuation of study 
drug, as stated in Section 6.2, or rule out safe continuation of the study drug, as determined by 
[CONTACT_226911].
Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequately controlled by [CONTACT_14181] -infective 
treatment or would put the subject at risk with continuation of the study drug.

Discontinuation (PD) Visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study 
drug discontinuation, and preferably prior to initiation of another therapy.  In addition, a 30 -day 
Follow -up Visit or phone call should occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the 
occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
For subjects to be considered lost to follow -up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain 
information on the subjec t's final status.  At a minimum, [ADDRESS_1246016] 's source documentation.
If a subject withdraws from study follow up or withdraws permission for the collection of their person al 
data, the study staff may still use available public records to obtain information about survival status 
only, as appropriate per local regulations.
In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue 
unles s the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped.  When [COMPANY_013] is informed the subject has 
withdrawn and no longer wishes biomarker research to continue , samples will not be analyzed, no new 
biomarker analysis data will be collected for the withdra wn subject or added to the existing data or 
database(s ), and the samples will be destroyed.   A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker 
research at any time and remain in the clinical study.  Data generated from clinical study and/or optional 
biomarker research, before subject withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_31359] ( ≤ 50 and > 50), Baseline disea se severity (T -VASI <15 
and ≥ 15), and status of active vitiligo (Yes/No) defined as follows:
Active:  Showing new lesions or progression (enlargement) of existing lesions within the last 
6months and/or presenting clinical subtypes indicative of progress ing vitiligo (i.e., confetti -like 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_371], trichrome pattern, or Koebner phenomenon).
At Week 24, subjects who were randomized to placebo at Baseline will be switched to either 22 mg 
(Group 4) or 11 mg (Group 5) upadacitinib in a blinded fashion per pre -specified randomization 
assignments.
All [COMPANY_013] personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the 
exception of [COMPANY_013] Drug Supply Management Team) will remain blinded to each sub ject's treatment 
until the Week [ADDRESS_1246019] 's treatment throughout the study.  To maintain the blind, the 
upadacitinib tablets and plac ebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance.  The IRT 
will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency.
In the event of a medical emergency that requires unblinding of the study drug a ssignment, the 
investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_110992].  However, if an 
urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contact[CONTACT_110993], the investigator can dire ctly access the IRT system to break the blind without [COMPANY_013] 
notification or agreement.  Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, 
which is available only to the investigator.  If the IRT system is unavailable, unblindi ng may occur by 
[CONTACT_110994] (preferred) or email 
([EMAIL_2197]).  For country -specific phone numbers, please see the following website:  
http://www.endpointclinical.com/helpdesk/.
In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the [COMPANY_013] TA MD, we request that the 
[COMPANY_013] TA MD be notified within [ADDRESS_1246020] be conveyed to [COMPANY_013] and recorded on appropriate eCRF.
5.9 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol except when necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The investigator is responsible for complying with all 
protocol require ments, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a 
protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic), 
the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and [COMPANY_013].
In Japan, the investigator will record all protocol deviations in the appropriate medical records at the 
site.

product must be reported to [COMPANY_013].
Product Complaint
A product complaint is any complaint related to the drug component of the product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device damage or not 
working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaint s concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the study site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaint s/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatme nt.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally rel ated to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations "such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off-label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AE or not.  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be repor ted as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol -specific criteria (see 
Section 6.2regarding toxicity management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evi dence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly

for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as an 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_1246022] information):

medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any e lective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1246023] signs the study -specific informed consent.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SARs) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational Medicinal 
Product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an S AE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Sa fety 
Information), and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in 
accordance with global and local requirements.
AEs will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend 
or risk to subjects.
Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AESIs will be monitored during each study:
Serious infections
Opportunistic infections (excluding TB and herpes zoster)

(Protocol Section 5.5).
The pregnancy outcome of an electi ve or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is 
considered an SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the 
event.
6.2 Toxicity Management
The toxicity management of the AEs, including AESIs, consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an 
ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safety issues by [CONTACT_3153]), and, if applicable, 
interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management and/or discontinuation of the 
subjects from study drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described 
below.
Serious Infections:   Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection.  Study 
drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop active TB 
must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].
GI Perforation:   Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a GI perforation should be 
evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment.  Subjects with acute, spontaneous perforation of 
the GI tract that requires inpatient medical care or urgent surgical intervention (exce pt for appendicitis 
or mechanical injury) must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix must 
be permanently discontinued from study drug.  Information including histopathological results should be 
queried for confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who 
are at increased risk for skin cancer.
Muscle -related symptoms:  If a subject experiences symptoms suggestive of myositis or 
rhabdomyolysis, consider checking CPK and aldolase with clinical management and/or study drug 
interruption as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1963].

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Thrombosis Events:   Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evalu ated and 
treated appropriately.  If the diagnosis of DVT, pulmonary embolus, or non- neurologic arterial 
thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study drug in subjects with a confirmed diag nosis of COVID -19. Consider 
interrupting study drug in subjects with signs and/or symptoms and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19.  The 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1246026] Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory abnormality, the 
investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment 
following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values 
are described in Table 3and may require a supplemental eCRF to be completed.  For subjects with 
ongoing laboratory abnormalities which require data entry into an eCRF, an additional eCRF related to 
subsequent laboratory abnormalities is only required if the subject has relevant changes in history (e.g., 
new onset signs or symptoms) or laboratory values which have returned to normal reference range or 
its Baseline value followed by [CONTACT_889952] 
(considered a new event).  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_807044] a satisfactory resolution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 3, the 
repeat testing is to occur as soon as possible.  Further, repeat testing may be performed at a local 
laboratory if the subject is unable to use the central lab oratory.
Table 3. Specific Toxicity Management Guidelines for Abnormal Laboratory Values
Laboratory 
Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline
Hemoglobin  If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_556018] a new sample.
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline without an alternative etiology, 
interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111003].
 If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternati ve etiology is 
known or the hemoglobin value remains in the normal reference range , the subject
may remain on study drug at the investigator 's discretion.
 If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to 
normal reference range or its Baseline value.
ANC  If confirmed < 1000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed < 500/μL by [CONTACT_111003].  If 
value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value, restarting study drug 
is allowed if there is an alternative etiology identified; documentation should 
include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe for the subject .  Study drug 
should be discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found.
ALC  If confirmed < 500/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Total WBC count  If confirmed < 2000/µL by [CONTACT_111003], interrupt study drug 
dosing until WBC count returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.

(INR) >1.5.
 A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the 
time of repeat testing for ALT or AST.  A repeat test o f INR is not needed for 
determination if above toxicity management criteria are met.
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by [CONTACT_889953], nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5% increase from 
Baseline). 
 Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by [CONTACT_111006] 2 weeks.
 If ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, interrupt study drug immediately, confi rm by [CONTACT_556018] a new sample, and contact [CONTACT_176454]. 
Subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA PCR testing at 
Screening who develop the following laboratory findings should have HBV DNA PCR testing 
performed with in 1 week (based on initial elevated value): 
 ALT > 5 × ULN OR 
 ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternative cause is not readily identified.
 A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time of 
repeat testing for ALT or AST.
A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study drug 
(unless not acceptable by [CONTACT_111008]) and a hepatologist consultation should occur 
within [ADDRESS_1246028] elevations > [ADDRESS_1246029], complete the appropriate supplemental 
hepatic eCRF(s).
Serum 
Creatinine• If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the Baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for 
serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results.  If the 
results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion, then interrupt study drug and 
restart study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × Baseline value 
and ≤ULN.
For the above serum creatinine elevation scenarios, complete the supplemental renal eCRF.

7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary and secondary analyses.  
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).
The primary analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 24, data pertaining to 
Period [ADDRESS_1246031] been cleaned, and a database lock has occurred for the purpose of efficacy and safety 
analysis in Period 1.   The efficacy analysis performed based on this database lock will be the only and 
final analysis for Period 1.
7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations
The ITT Population includes all randomized subjects.  Subjects will be included in the analysis based on 
treatment as randomized.  The ITT Population will be used for all efficacy analyses.
The following populations will be used for the safety analysis:
The Safety Population (Safety) is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of s tudy drug in the study.
The all upadacitinib treated (ALL_UPA) Population is defined as all subjects who received at least 
1 dose of upadacitinib in the study.  This population will be used to provide a comprehensive 
summary of safety.
7.3 Handling Potential Intercurrent Events for the Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint (Section 3.2) will be analyzed in the ITT Population and no intercurrent events wil l 
be considered.  All data collected, regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug, will be used in 
the analysis.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].7.4 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
The efficacy analysis will be based on the ITT Population and all statistical tests will be perform ed at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.1.  The 95% confidence interval of the treatment effect will be provided.
For continuous variables, comparisons of change and/or percent change from Baseline will be 
made between upadacitinib and placebo based on the Mixed Model Repeated Measures 
(MMRM) adjusting for treatment, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and stratification factor s 
derived by [CONTACT_889954] (age group [ ≤50 and > 50], Baseline disease severity [T- VASI < 15 
and ≥15], and status of active vitiligo [Yes/No]) as fixed factors, and Baseline value as a 
covariate.  The MMRM will be the primary approach to handle missing values for continuous 
endpoints.
For categorical variables, comparisons will be made between upadacitinib and placebo using the
Cochran- Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the stratification factors derived by [CONTACT_889955] :  age group ( ≤50 and > 50), Baseline disease severity (T -VASI < 15 and ≥ 15), and 
status of active vitiligo (Yes/No).  Non -Responder Imputation incor porating multiple imputation 
(MI) to handle missing data due to COVID -19 (NRI -MI) will be the primary approach to handle 
missing values for categorical endpoints.
Summary and Analysis of the Primary Endpoint
Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conduc ted on the ITT Population based on the treatment as 
randomized.  Comparison of the primary endpoint will be made between each upadacitinib dose and 
placebo using the MMRM adjusting for treatment, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, stratification 
factor sderived by [CONTACT_889954] , and Baseline value ata 2-sided significance level of 0.1.
MMRM will be the primary approach to handle missing values .  A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed for the primary efficacy endpoint, using MI to handle missi ng values.  Analysis details for 
MMRM, MI, and other sensitivity analyses (if applicable) will be provided in the SAP.
Summary and Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted on the ITT Population based on the 
treatment as randomized.  The continuous endpoints will be analyzed using the same method as for the 
primary endpoint.  The categorical endpoints will be analyzed using the CMH test.  The null hypotheses 
for all secondary endpoints will be tested ata 2-sided significance level of 0.1.
Summary and Analysis of Additional Efficacy Endpoints
Additional endpoints, as described in Section 3.4, will also be analyzed.  Analysis details will be provided 
in the SAP.
Subgroup Analysis for Efficacy
To evaluate the consistency of the efficacy across demographic and other Baseline characteristics, 
summaries and analyses will be performed for selected subgroups for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The subgroups will be defined in SAP.

AEs leading to discontinuation will be provided as well.
For selecte d laboratory parameters, a listing of all subjects with any laboratory value above Grade 3 of 
Common Toxicity Criteria will be provided.  Mean change from Baseline in laboratory and vital sign 
variables will be summarized.  Additional details for the safet y analysis will be provided in the SAP.
7.6 Interim Analysis
No formal interim analysis of efficacy is planned for this study.  Routine safety reviews will be performed 
by [CONTACT_18656] (see details in Section 6.3).
7.7 Overall Type I Error Control
Multiplicity from multiple comparisons will not be adjusted in this Phase 2 study.
7.8 Sample Size Determination
Assuming a Week 24 percent change from Bas eline in F -VASI of 0% in the placebo arm, a conservative 
estimate based on a prior study in vitiligo,14the planned total sample size of 160 subjects (40 subjects in 
each upadacitinib group, 40 subjects total in the placebo groups) will provide more than 90% power to 
detect the treatment difference of 40% reduction (assuming a standard deviation of 54.8%) in at least 
1upadacitinib group versus placebo using a [ADDRESS_1246032].

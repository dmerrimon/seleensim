a. Long- term abstinence is acceptable when it is in line with the subjects preferred and usual 
lifestyle.  
b. Female subjects using a hormonal contraceptive or intrauterine device must have been 
doing so for at least [ADDRESS_554798]’s package insert instructions including additional protection at times when hormonal contraceptiv e 
doses might be missed.  
c. Female subjects may be enrolled without a negative urine  pregnancy test if they are

Exclusion Criteria:  
A subject will be excluded from the study if the subject meets any of the following criteria:  
1. History of seizure disorder; undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], 
barbit urates or antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006]; or any other condition that increases the risk of seizure such 
as stroke, significant head injury, tumor or infection of the central nervous system, 
arteriovenous malformation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome/serotonin syndrom e, or 
clinically significant, as deemed by [CONTACT_093], metabolic disorders (e.g., clinically significant hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia).  
2. Is considered by [CONTACT_093], for any reason (including, but not limited to, the risks 
described as precautions, warnings, and contraindications in the current version of the 
investigator’s brochure  for AXS -05 tablets), to be an unsuitable candi date to receive AXS -05. 
3. If the subject is currently receiving or plans to use drugs with known bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_437866] (as listed in the Wellbutrin SR package insert ), PI [INVESTIGATOR_437867].  
4. Any current or recent medical, psychiatric, or social condition t hat, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is likely to interfere with the conduct of the study, confounds the interpretation of study results, or endangers the subject’s well -being. This includes (but is not limited to) any 
clinically significant oncologic, hema tologic, endocrine/metabolic, cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, infectious or neurologic disease or has a chronic disease which is unstable or progressive.  
5. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], dextromethorphan,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_162228] (e.g. 
codeine, etc.), or any other ingredient in the study medication.  
6. History of intolerance to bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_437868].  
7. Unable  or unlikely  to comply with the study protocol  or unsuitable  for any other reason, 
including  other  conditions  that might indica te that the subject  is unsuit able for the study  as 
judged  by [CONTACT_437869]. 
8. Previously received treatment with any investigational drug (other than AXS -05) or device 
within [ADDRESS_554800], Dosage, 
and Mode of 
Administration  AXS -05 (105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 45 mg dextromethorphan) tablet, oral

Version Date  (Amendment 3): July 9, 20 20 Page 6  Treatment Regimen  Doses will be titrated as follows:  
• Days 1 – 3: AXS -05 (105 mg bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 45 mg DM) tablet, once daily , in the morning  
• Days 4 – end of study (maximum of 12 months): AXS -05 tablet, twice daily  
All doses should be taken orally on an empty stomach (at least [ADDRESS_554801]-
prandial)  with water. Twice daily doses should be taken at least 8 hours apart, orally on an empty 
stomach (at least [ADDRESS_554802] -prandial) with water.  
Study Duration  The duration of participation will be up to 12 months.  
Criteria for 
Evaluation  Primary Safety Measures : 
• Incidence of treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) following dosing with AXS -05. 
Additional Safety Measure s: 
• Change in vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) over time  
• Change in ECG findings over time  
• Change in clinical laboratory measures  over time  
• Incidence of suicidal behavior, as identified via the C -SSRS  
Efficacy Measures : 
• Change in MADRS over time  
• Change in SDS over time  
• Change in Q- LES-Q-SF over time  
• CGI-S 
• CGI-I 
Statistical Methods  Analysis Populations:  
The foll owing  analysis populat ions are planned for this s tudy: 
 Safety Population—the Safety Population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose 
of the study medication . 
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  Population—the ITT Population will include all subjects who receive at 
least [ADDRESS_554803] 6 months and 100 for 12 months. This sample size will provide an adequate number of 
subjects exposed to assess the long- term safety of AXS -05.

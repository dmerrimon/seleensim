builds on seminal observations from [ADDRESS_707236] [1,2],  
we found:  
▪ Statin  use by [CONTACT_44688] -identical sibling donors  was associated with profound protection 
against severe acute GVHD. GVHD -protection was not offset by [CONTACT_542149].  
▪ Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542101] 100 after transplant was associated with a reduced risk 
of chronic GVHD at the expense of an increased risk of relapse.  
▪ GVHD -protective effects were restricted to patients given CSP -based postgrafting 
immunosuppression and not observ ed among those given TAC.  
▪ GVHD -protective effects were most pronounced in the gastrointestinal tract.  
 
Based on the favorable outcomes associated with donor statin use in the retrospective 
analyses, the present study seeks to confirm these finding prospect ively. Specifically, we 
propose to treat HLA -identical related donors with atorvastatin for [ADDRESS_707237].  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Immunomodulatory effe cts of statins.  
In recent years, 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase inhibitors, or 
"statins", have been shown to alter immune function in ways that may contribute to their anti -
atherosclerotic effects. Statins also appear to reduce immune responses to autoantigens and 
alloantigens [3 -6]. The best characterized activity of statins involves inhibition of mevalonate 
and cholesterol biosynthesis, which is mediated by [CONTACT_542150] -CoA reductase. Blocking 
mevalonate production, ho wever, also inhibits the synthesis of intermediates required for 
isoprenylation of GTP -binding cell signaling proteins such as Ras, Rac and Rho, thereby 
[CONTACT_542151]  [6-9]. Immune functions shown t o be promoted by 
[CONTACT_542152]2 -polarization1 and expansion of regulatory T cells (Treg ) [10]. At the same time 
statins inhibit lymphocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation [11 -13], antigen -presenting cell 
(APC) function [14,15 ], and the development of Th 17 cells [16]. While statin -mediated changes in 
immune function have been studied extensively, the potential immunosuppressive synergism 
between statins and calcineurin inhibitors has not been examined.  
 
2.2 Statins for GVHD -prevention: Preclinical and clini cal studies  
Zeiser et al. observed a significantly reduced mortality related to acute GVHD  when either donor 
or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542102] 10 days before major histocompatibility complex 
(MHC) -mismatched allogeneic HCT [3].  This study also showed that statin -mediated protection 
against GVHD was due to parallel effects on T cells and APC, and that therapy did not simply

In a recent retrospective analysis of 67 patients who received HLA -matched or mismatched 
related or unrelated allografts for treatment of hematologic malignancies, Hamadani et al. found 
a trend towards a decreased risk of grade 2 -4 acute GVHD (10% ver sus 40%; p=0.08) among 
the [ADDRESS_707238], compared to those 
who were not  [17]. In this analysis, however, the authors did not account for donor statin 
exposure, and definitive conclusions were limit ed by [CONTACT_542153].  
Most pertinent to the design of the present study was the observation that  donor statin use 
was associated with protection  against severe acute GVHD after HCT from HLA -identical 
related donors  [1]. In retrospective analysis (n=567), w e found that compared to allografts 
where neither the donor nor recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542107]  a statin at the time of transplant (n=464), statin use 
by [CONTACT_542154][INVESTIGATOR_841] (n=75) was associated with a profoundly decreased risk  of 
grade 3 -4 acute GVHD  (multivariate hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; 95% confidence i nterval [CI], 0.1 -
0.9; p=0.03) ( Table 1 ). Statin use by [CONTACT_542155][INVESTIGATOR_841] (n=12) was suggestively 
associated with a decreased risk of grade 3 -4 acute GVHD (HR, 0.00; 95%  CI, undefined; 
p=0.06), while statin use by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_542108] (n=16) did not confer protection  
against acute GVHD. D onor statin -treatment was associated with significant protection against 
acute GVHD in the gastrointestinal tract (p=0.02) bu t not in the skin.  Surprisingly, statin -
associated GVHD -protection was re stricted to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542109]-based postgrafting immu no-
suppression (n=417; 74% ; HR, 0.0; 95% CI, undefined ; p<0.0001)  and was not observed 
among those given TAC (significance of  effect modifi cation: CSP vs. TAC, p=0.009). The 
unexpected effect asso ciation between statins and CSP raises the question whether the two 
drugs share a cellular target that accounts for the observed immuno suppressive synergism.  
GVHD -protection associa ted with donor statin use was not offset by [CONTACT_542156] . An increased risk of recurrent malignancy and a reduced risk of chronic GVHD 
were only  observed among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22570] -matched related and unrelated grafts (n=1206) 
2546.00  - Nonablative

FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 who were given statins beyond day 100 after transplant [2]. Overall, these results suggest that 
donor statin treatment (without recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542110] ) may be a promising s trategy for 
preventing severe acute GVHD without compromising immunologic control of the underlying 
malignancy.  
The retrospective analysis also showed that favorable outcomes associated with donor statin 
use were not confined to a specific type of conditio ning intensity but seen after both 
nonmyeloablative and myeloablative HCT. Figure [ADDRESS_707239] from HLA -matched donors who has 
CSP-based immunosuppression according to don or statin use. This subgroup analysis shows 
that donor statin treatment has promise to substantially reduce the risk of severe acute GVHD 
and thereby [CONTACT_542157].  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3 Rationale for the Current Study  
 
Based on the favorable outcomes associated with donor statin use in the retrospective 
analyses, the present study seeks to confirm these finding prospectively. Specifically, we 
propose to treat HLA -identical related donors with atorvastatin during 2 weeks prior to collection 
of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) aimed at reducing the risk of severe acute GVHD in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Since the statin -mediated GVHD -protecti ve effect was only seen among patients who 
had CSP -based immunosuppression and not among those given TAC, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542111]. The study may be 
offered either as an independen t protocol that includes donor statin -treatment and the 
nonmyeloablative preparative regimen (low -dose TBI and fludarabine) or in conjunction with a 
designated separate transplant investigational protocol  that uses a nonmyeloablative 
preparative regimen, p rovided the respective transplant protocol does not use acute GVHD as 
the primary endpoint.  
 Figure 1:  Cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 acute GVHD  after 
nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation  at the Fred Hutchinson 
Cancer Research Center (2001 -2007)  according to donor statin use. The 
analysis was restricted to patients who had CSP -based immunosuppression after 
transplant  (n=162) .

PATIENT AN D DONOR REGISTRATION  
 
Eligible  FHCRC  donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542113] (CCO) 
(Intake Office) and assigned UPNs (Unique Patient Numbers). The Data Management Office 
will register donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542114].   For 
patients enrolled at external sites, they will be registered to this study by [CONTACT_465972].  
 
PLAN OF TREATMENT  
 
9.1 Donor Treatment with Atorvastatin   
 
• Eligible donors will be given atorvastatin (generic drug preferred, if available; otherwise 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133]™)  40 mg/day orally starting on day -14. The last dose of atorvastatin will be 
2546.00  - Nonablative  
13 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/[ADDRESS_707249] day of stem cell collection (total of 15 doses).  
• The following guidelines are to be follow ed if the day of transplant must be re -scheduled 
while the donor has already started atorvastatin treatment:  
o Transplant moved up : If the transplant date needs to be moved up by ≤ [ADDRESS_707250] 12 days 
of treatments (40 mg/day) can be given to the donor. If the transplant needs to be 
moved up for > [ADDRESS_707251] to the primary endpoint of this 
study.  
o Transplant delayed : If the transplant date needs to be delayed, an extended 
atorvastatin treatment course is permissible provided the new transplant date is 
already agreed upon and lies within 14 days from the date the decision to re -
schedule was made. If the re -schedule d transplant date lies beyond 14  days from 
the date the decision to re -schedule is made, the donor will discontinue 
atorvastatin treatment and resume statin treatment on d ay -14 before the new 
transplant date.  
 
9.2 Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542100]  (References below to standard practice refer to 
standard practice at site where HCT is being performed.)  
 
• If the patient is enrolled on an investigational nonmyeloablative HCT protocol or a 
treatment plan that uses a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen with 
postgrafting CSP that does not use acute GVHD as its primary endpoint, the 
preparative regimen and immunosuppression after transplant will be according to  
respective protocol or treatment p lan (protocol [ADDRESS_707252] protocol).  
 
• If the patient is not enrolled on an investigational nonmyeloablative HCT 
protocol  or a treatment plan that uses a nonmyeloablative preparative 
regimen , protocol 2546 serves as an independent primary treatment 
protocol. The preparative regimen and immunosuppression after transplant 
will be as follows , see figure 2 : 
Treatment may be initiated in the outpatient department, and patients will be admitted to 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_542115] -related complications or other 
medical issues.  
 
TBI Criteria for 2546 as a Primary Protocol:  
 
*Criteria for 3 Gy TBI (only for patients in Regimen A, Flu/TBI):  
Patients need to fulfill one or more of the following criteria for 3 Gy TBI:  
a) Patients with MDS, MPD, CML, or other hematologic malignancies not 
previously treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  
b) Patients who had a previous allogeneic transplant.  
c) Patients who had a prior syngeneic transplant without subsequent 
myelosuppressive chemotherapy.  
d) Patients who have not had myelosuppressive chemotherapy within [ADDRESS_707253] may be at higher risk of rejection depending on treatment history and 
underlying diagnosis. Confirm TBI dose (2 vs 3 Gy) with PI.

B. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Infusion  
 
G-CSF-mobilized PBSC from an HLA -identical related donor will be the source of 
hematopoietic stem cells. Two 12 -liter leukaphereses on consecutive days, day -1 and 
day 0, will be obtained, and cells will be infused together on day 0 after TBI. Refer to 
institutional practice guidelines for methods of infusion. If the CD34+ cell dose is <5.0 x 
106/kg re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_542116], a third day collection should be 
added, with an extra dose of G -CSF given to the donor before the final collection.  
 
C. Adjustment of Post -grafting Immunosuppression  
 
Immunosuppression after transplant will be wi th MMF and CSP, as described above. 
CSP and MMF doses should be based on adjusted body weight. If actual weight is less 
than ideal weight, then actual body weight will be used. MMF will be initiated on day 0, 
with the first dose given 4 –6 hours after allog raft infusion is complete. In the absence of 
GVHD, CSP and MMF will be tapered and/or discontinued as described above. In the 
presence of GVHD, standard institutional recommendations for acute GVHD therapy 
should be followed. In the event of progression or  recurrence of malignancy, and in the 
absence of GVHD, CSP and MMF may be tapered more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_542117] a graft -vs.-
malignancy  effect, at the discretion of the attending physician. Investigational 
medications aimed at treating relapse or GVHD after tra nsplant are permissible.  
 
• Guidelines for CSP Administration and Monitoring  
If there is nausea and vomiting at anytime during CSP treatment, consideration  should 
be given  to administering CSP  intravenously at the appropriate dose that was used  to Immunosuppression

CSP Dose Adjustments:  Initial high Cyclosporine (CSP) doses are required based on the 
preclinical nonmyeloablative canine studies, which used an equivalent dose to establish 
an allograft.  After day +28, CSP levels typi[INVESTIGATOR_380830] r unrelated HCT will be targeted.  Dose 
reduction should only be made if CSP toxicity is present, and/or levels exceed values 
provided in Table 2. There are two methods for calculating CSP levels.  Table 2 provides 
desired levels for specific methods.  To avoid inadequate immune suppression, dose 
reductions should be conservative.  Therapeutic levels of CSP should be maintained.

D.  Collection of Donor PBSC  
 
• G-CSF Administration to Donors:  
G-CSF will be administered by [CONTACT_542161] -4 to day 0 at a 
dose of 16 µg/kg/day  for 5 consecutive days. The schedule of G -CSF administration and 
PBSC collections should be confirmed with the personnel in the apheresis room. Day 0  
should be scheduled  on a Tuesday -Thursday, if possible  (FHCRC patients only) .  
 
 
 
• PBSC Collection:  
Donors will preferably undergo vein -to-vein collections, or may receive an appropriate 
catheter inserted on or before the day of apheresis. PBSCs will be co llected on the 
afternoon of day -1 and stored in the refrigerator at 4ºC overnight. A second collection 
will be performed the following afternoon and both collections will be infused on day 0. If 
<5x106 CD34+ cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542118], an add itional (third) day of 
collection should be performed. If PBSC cannot be collected by a vein -to-vein technique, 
a percutaneous Mahurkar catheter will be inserted. General procedures will include the 
use of a standard apheresis machine (COBE Spectra, Lakewo od Colo.), and processing 
up to 16 liters of whole blood during the collection.

<500/ μL) persists past day +[ADDRESS_707262] practice.  
 
 
H. Evaluation of Chimerism  
 
Definitions:  For the purposes of this protocol, the following definitions will apply:   
For the purposes of this protocol, mixed chimerism  will be defined as the detection of 
donor T cells (CD3+) and granulocytes (CD 33+), as a proportion of the total T ce ll and 
granulocyte population, respectively, of greater than 5% and less than 95% in the 
peripheral blood. Full donor chimerism is defined as > 95% donor CD3+ T cells. Mixed 
or full donor chimerism will be evidence of donor engraftment. Increasing donor 
chimerism  is defined as an absolute increase of 20% of CD3+ T cells over the previous 
chimerism evaluation. Decreasing donor chimerism  is defined as an absolute decrease 
of 20% of CD3+ T cell chimerism over the previous month. Low donor chimerism is 
defined as < 40% CD3+ T cells after HCT. Low donor chimerism should always be 
confirmed with repeat peripheral blood T cell and granulocyte chimerism analysis.   A 
DNA -based assay that compares the profile of amplified fragment length polymorphisms 
(ampFLP) (or FIS H studies or VNTR) of the patient and donor will be used to quantitate 
chimerism of sorted peripheral blood T -cells (CD3+) and granulocytes (CD 33+). The 
same assay should be used in a given patient for repeated studies of chimerism.  This 
DNA -based analys is will also be performed on the whole nucleated cell fraction from 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]. Therapeutic decisions (i.e. DLI) will be made based on the results of 
sorted T -cell studies of peripheral blood.  For the purposes of this protocol, rejection  is 
defined a s the inability to detect or loss of detection of greater than 5% donor T cells 
(CD3+) as a proportion of the total T cell population, respectively, after nonmyeloablative 
HCT. Also for the purposes of this protocol, graft failure  is defined as grade IV 
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia after day 21 that lasts > 2 weeks and is refractory to 
growth factor support.   
Bone marrow chimerism (unfractionated cells) will be evaluated at day +84 and one year 
after transplant. In peripheral blood, CD3 chimerism will b e evaluated on days +28, +84 
and one year after transplant; CD33 chimerism will be evaluated on day +84; CD56 
chimerism will be evaluated on day +28. Unless clinically indicated (i.e. poor previous 
chimerism, immunotherapy, hematopoietic insufficiency etc. ), further chimerism studies 
will not be performed.  
 
I. Continuation of immunosuppression .  
In the setting of low donor chimerism, immunosuppression may be continued or 
reinitiated at full dose so that DLI can be administered on a separate protocol. If there is 
disease progression in the setting of low donor chimerism, the algorithm for disease 
progression ( below ) should be followed. Patients who reject their graft may be eligible for 
a second allogeneic transplant on other protocols.  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
19 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
  
J. Discontinuation  of immunosuppression.  
Immunosuppression should be discontinued as per protocol unless the patient develops 
GVHD, has falling donor chimerism or has progressive or substantial persistent disease 
(see below ). In the setting of GVHD, CSP and MMF may be cont inued. GVHD at any 
time should be treated as per standard practice.  
 
K. Disease progression or persistence and mixed chimerism.  
Evidence of substantial persistent disease at day 80 or beyond may be an indication for 
therapeutic intervention while disease progression, at any time point will always be an 
indication for therapeutic intervention. Intervention for persistent disease at day 80 or 
beyond should be discussed with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_542119]. If the attending physician believes that the 
patient requires very aggressive therapy for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_54574], the case will be 
presented at the Patient Care Conference  (FHCRC patients only) . Otherwise, priority 
should be given to rapid r eduction of immunosuppression, option (a) below. Therapeutic 
options include:  
 
a. Discontinuation of immunosuppression. This should be considered the first 
therapeutic maneuver. If there is no GVHD, MMF should be stopped and CSP 
should be tapered over 2 weeks. Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_542120] 2 weeks after discontinuation of immunosuppressi on. If 
there is no response to withdrawal of immunosuppression, < 20% increase in 
donor chimerism and there is no GVHD, patients will be considered as treatment 
failures. DLI will not be offered for disease progression or relapse on this 
protocol. In this situation, patients may receive further therapy as per institutional 
protocols for disease relapse or progression after allogeneic HCT. If no GVHD 
occurs, patients with progressive disease may be offered enrollment in other 
institutional protocols for DLI treatment. If there is >20% absolute increase in 
donor chimerism, patients should be observed for additional 2 weeks and 
chimerism studies then repeated. If there is progressive disease that requires 
therapy before 4 weeks or progressive disease occurs des pi[INVESTIGATOR_542121], 
patients can be treated off protocol with DLI or be considered for options (b) or 
(c) below.  
b. Intercurrent treatment with chemotherapy or radiation . Conventional 
chemotherapy or radiation therapy should be considered in the setting of  life-
threatening progression of malignancy. Patients in this situation would be 
considered treatment failures. After cytoreductive therapy is completed, 
chimerism should be evaluated and the administration of DLI off protocol 
considered.  
c. High -dose allo geneic HCT This option should be discussed with the principal 
investigator. Patients who undergo high -dose allogeneic HCT will be removed 
from the protocol at that time.  
d. CML or Ph (+) ALL patients with Persistent or Increased Minimal 
Residual Disease: At day +[ADDRESS_707263] disease, dose -escalation of BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy or  DLI should be considered  
e. CML and PH (+) ALL patients with Relapse and Disease Progression:

 See above sections f or withdrawal of immunosuppression. If there is no response 
to withdrawal of immunosuppression and no GVHD has developed, dose 
escalation of BCR/ABL tyrosine -kinase inhibitor therapy and or DLI should be 
considered.  
 
L.  Assessment of Disease Responses  
The initial anti -tumor effect of allogeneic HCT will be evaluated with the intermittent 
analysis of appropriate tumor markers, if available: Responses will be classified as 
complete, partial response or no response. Response criteria for MM, NHL, CLL, CML, 
ALL, AML and MDS to be used in this study are described in Appendix E. Standard 
response criteria specific to other diseases will be used in assessing disease response 
for other patients on study.

recommended evaluation schedule.  
 
See Standard Practice Manual for Evaluation Guidelines After Departure from FHCRC System.  
 
For patients enrolled at external sites, post -transplant evaluations will be performed per local 
standard practice.  The testing listed in Table 8 are recommended evaluations.  All testing will  
be performed at the local institution.  
 
Guidelines for bone ma rrow evaluations beyond one year after transplant:  
1) Marrow evaluations represent the standard of care for all patients at the one -year LTFU 
visit after HCT.  
 
2) Subsequent marrow evaluations also represent the standard of care if…  
a. The CBC or platelet count sho ws any abnormalities  
b. If there is any clinical indication  for the procedure, OR  
c. If the most recent marrow evaluation or other testing showed any evidence of 
persistent malignancy, OR  
d. If the patient has a disease for which a low -dose maintenance treatment w ould 
be indicated if disease were discovered after a previous evaluation with no 
evidence of malignant cells.

11.1 Safety Evaluations  
 
Laboratory parameter  monitoring : Rhabdomyolysis  (defined as a creatine phosphokinase [CPK] 
value > 10fold the upper limit of normal) and hepatocellular injury  are infrequent yet potentially 
serious complications of statin treatment. Therefore, serum levels of CPK and transaminases 
will be assessed befor e initiation of atorvastatin treatment (baseline) and at its completion (first 
day of leukapheresis).  
 
Muscular symptom  monitoring : Because rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported with 
atorvastatin (approximately 1 in 1,000 patients), donors will b e instructed to report any new 
muscle symptoms (i.e. myalgias, tenderness, weakness) while taking atorvastatin. Taking into 
account that G -CSF (Neupogen™) frequently causes musculoskeletal symptoms, any 
symptoms temporally related to atorvastatin treatment  considered significant according to the 
medical team’s assessment will be evaluated at the attending physician’s discretion.  
 
Liver dysfunction  monitoring : Persistent elevations in serum transaminases occurred in 0.7% of 
patients who received atorvastatin  in clinical trials and, in most cases, were not associated with 
clinical symptoms. Transaminase elevations related to atorvastatin treatment are usually 
reversible after discontinuation of the drug and measurements of serum transaminase levels are 
general ly not recommended until completion of 12 weeks of atorvastatin treatment. As outlined 
under ”Laboratory parameter monitoring”, serum levels of transaminases will be assessed 
before initiation of atorvastatin treatment (baseline) and at its completion (fir st day of 
leukapheresis). If clinically indicated, additional measurements of serum transaminase levels 
may be performed at the attending physician’s discretion.  
 
Monitoring for other symptoms : Any new and unexplained significant signs or symptoms 
occurrin g in statin -treated donors should be evaluated according to the judgment of the 
attending physician. Approximately one week after init iation of statin therapy, at the time of 
PBSC collection and one week after donation and discharge from the center, the donor will be 
contact[CONTACT_66696] (at the local transplant center  or by [CONTACT_756]) to follow up on potential 
adverse effects that ma y require further evaluation. At the same time, the donor will also be 
asked about his/her compliance with the prescribed atorvastatin medication.  
 
If the donor develops clinical signs or symptoms deemed serious and at least possibly related to 
statin trea tment, the attending physician, in consultation with the Principal Investigator, will 
decide whether atorvastatin treatment should be discontinued. In this case, the donor will be 
provided with an appropriate follow -up plan, which will be formulated by [CONTACT_542165].

TOXICITIES AND COMPLICATIONS  
 
For the purposes of this protocol, toxicity will be graded using the modified NCI common toxicity 
scale  version 4.0.  
 
12.1 Atorvastatin  
• Skeletal Muscle  
Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been 
reported with atorvastatin (<1 in 1,000 patients) . A history of renal impairment may be a risk 
factor for the development of rhabdomyolysis. Patients with renal impa irment therefore merit 
closer monitoring for skeletal muscle effects.  Atorvastatin, like other statins, occasionally causes 
myopathy, defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with increases in CPK 
values >[ADDRESS_707281]. The concomitant use of higher doses of atorvastatin with certain drugs 
such as cyclosporine and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, itraconazole, and HIV 
protease inhibitors) increases the risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be 
considered in any patie nt with diffuse myalgias, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked 
elevation of CPK. Patients should be advised to report promptly unexplained muscle pain, 
tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by [CONTACT_21936]. Atorvastatin therapy 
should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or 
suspected.  
 
Atorvastatin therapy should be temporarily withheld or discontinued in any patient with an acute, 
serious condition suggestive of a myopathy or having a ri sk factor predisposing to the 
development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., severe acute infection, 
hypotension, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine and electrolyte disorders, and 
uncontrolled seizures).  
 
• Liver Dysfunction  
Atorvastatin has been associated with biochemical abnormalities of liver function. Persistent 
elevations (>[ADDRESS_707282] occurring on 2 or more occasions) in serum transaminases 
occurred in 0.7% of patients who received atorvastatin in clinical trials. The incidence of these 
abnormalities was 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.6%, and 2.3% for 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, respectively. One 
patient in clinical trials developed jaundice. Increases in LFTs in other patients were not 
associated with jaundice or oth er clinical signs or symptoms. Upon dose reduction, drug 
interruption, or discontinuation, transaminase levels returned to or near pretreatment levels 
without sequelae. Eighteen of 30 patients with persistent LFT elevations continued treatment 
with a reduc ed dose of atorvastatin.  
 
It is generally recommended that liver function tests be performed prior to and at 12 weeks 
following both the initiation of therapy and any elevation of dose, and periodically (e.g., 
semiannually) thereafter. Liver enzyme changes  generally occur in the first [ADDRESS_707283] of >[ADDRESS_707284], reduction of dose or wi thdrawal of atorvastatin is recommended. Atorvastatin should be 
used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a 
history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained persistent transaminase elevations 
are c ontraindications to the use of atorvastatin.  
 
• Endocrine Function  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
42 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis and theoretically might blunt adrenal and/or gonadal 
steroid production. Clinical studies have shown that atorvastatin  does not reduce basal plasm a 
cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve. The effects of statins on male fertility have not 
been studied in adequate numbers of patients. The effects, if any, on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -gonadal axis 
in premenopausal women are unknown. Caution should be exe rcised if a statin is administered 
concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid 
hormones, such as ketoconazole, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], and cimetidine.  
 
• CNS Toxicity  
Brain hemorrhage, optic nerve vacuolation and degeneration, and CNS vascular lesions were 
seen after long -term treatment of normal dogs with atorvastatin or similar drug s in this class at 
doses that produced plasma drug levels [ADDRESS_707285] recommended statin dose.  
 
 
 
• Additional Adverse Reactions  
Clinical Trial Adverse Experiences : In the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133]™ -placebo -controlled clinical trial data base of 
16,066 patients (8755 atorvastatin vs. 7311 placebo; age range 10 –93 years, 39% women, 91% 
Caucasians, 3% Blacks, 2% Asians, 4% other) with a median treatment duration of 53 weeks, 
9.7% of patients on atorvastatin and 9.5% of the patients on placeb o discontinued therapy due 
to adverse reactions regardless of causality. The five most common adverse reactions in 
patients treated with atorvastatin that led to treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate 
greater than placebo were: myalgia (0.7%), di arrhea (0.5%), nausea (0.4%), alanine 
aminotransferase increase (0.4%), and hepatic enzyme increase (0.4%). The most commonly 
reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 2% and greater than placebo) regardless of causality, 
in patients treated  with atorvastati n in placebo controlled trials (n=8755) were: nasopharyngitis 
(8.3%), arthralgia (6.9%), diarrhea (6.8%), pain in extremity (6.0%), and urinary tract infection 
(5.7%).  Table 13 summarizes the frequency of clinical adverse reactions  from 17 placebo -
controlled trials, regardless of causality, reported in ≥ 2% and at a rate greater than placebo in 
patients treated with atorvastatin (n=8755).

 Table 13. Clinical adverse reactions occurring in > 2% in patients treated with any dose of 
atorvast atin (Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_17133]™) and at an incidence greater than placebo regardless of causality (% of 
patients).  
 
 
 
Other adverse reactions reported in placebo -controlled studies include : 
Body as a whole : malaise, pyrexia; Digestive system: abdominal discomfort, flatulence, 
hepatitis, cholestasis;  Musculo -skeletal system : musculoskeletal pain, muscle fatigue, neck 
pain, joint swelling; Metabolic and nutritional system : transaminases increase, LFT abnormal ity, 
blood alkaline phosphatase increa se, serum CPK  increase, hyperglycemia; Nervous system : 
nightmare; Respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]: epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]; Skin and appendages : urticaria; Special senses : 
vision blurred, tinnitus; Urogenital system: white blood cells urine positive.  
 
12.2 GVHD  
Acute and chronic GVHD are well -recognized complications of allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation. GVHD will be assessed according to criteria summarized in Appendices B, C 
and D.  Recommended primary systemic treatment for acute GVHD will be cortic osteroids. Other 
systemic immunosuppressive medications may be used at the discret ion of the attending 
physician.  
 
12.3 Total Body Irradiation (TBI)  
TBI will be given in one 200  cGy or up to 400 cGy fraction (per institutional guidelines) from 
linear accelerator at a rate of 6 - 7 cGy/min. Dosimetry calculations are performed by [CONTACT_443951][INVESTIGATOR_541]. At the dose  used, side effects are not expected. Nevertheless, there may be 
fever, alopecia, parotitis, diar rhea, reversible skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], mucositis and late effects 
including cataract formation, growth retardation, pulmonary damage, carcinogenesis, and 
sterilization.

FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 12.4 Cyclosporine (CSP)  
See section 9.2. for information  about administration and dose adjustment . Side effects are 
generally reversible, and may include renal insufficiency, hypomagnesemia, paresthesias, 
tremor, seizures, visual disturbances, paresis, disorientation, depression, confusion, 
somnolence, coma, na usea, hypertension, hemolytic -uremic syndrome, hyperglycemia, 
gynecomastia, and hypertrichosis  
 
12.5 Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)  
See section 9.2. for information about administration and dosage adjustments.  
 
Precautions:   MMF has been studied extensively among patients after nonmyeloablative HCT. 
Previous clinical studies in patients after allografting suggest that the principal adverse reactions 
associated with the administration of MMF include nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea. In 
the setting of ma rrow transplantation, several etiologic factors may contribute to alterations in 
gastrointestinal and hematologic parameters. MMF has an increased incidence of digestive 
system adverse events, including GI tract ulceration, and hemorrhage (3% of patients r eceiving 
MMF). GI tract perforations have rarely been observed. Most patients in these studies were also 
on other drugs known to be associated with these complications. Up to 2% of patients receiving 
MMF for prevention of rejection developed severe neutrop enia (ANC <500). The development 
of neutropenia may be related to MMF itself, concomitant medications, viral infections or some 
combination of these causes. MMF dose adjustments will be made if clinically indicated if in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_542125], no other cause is thought to be responsible for the 
abnormality.  These adjustments should be discussed with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_496711] (CRF).  
 
12.6 Fludarabine  
The dose of fludarabine used in this protocol is nonmyeloablative, but does  cause significant 
immunosuppression. Fludarabine can lower the white blood cell count, in particular the CD4+ T -
cells. The immunosuppression observed with the use of fludarabine increases the risk of 
infection, which can be life threatening.  
 
12.7 Myelosuppres sion 
Grade IV myelosuppression will be defined as a decrease in ANC to <500/µL and/or platelet 
count to  20,000/µL. If myelosuppression occurs, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_542126]. Samples should be sent f or chimerism analysis. 
Myelosuppression may occur in this patient population for a number of reasons such as direct 
toxic effect of drugs (MMF, ganc iclovir etc.), rejection, relapse or after DLI.  
 
 
 
ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING  
 
13.1 Institutional Policy and Definitions  
 
• Policy  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
45 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 The following guidelines are the minimum Cancer Consortium IRB adverse e vent (AE) reporting 
guidelines.  
In accordance with institutional policy, all serious adverse events (SAEs) which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_542127] 10 calendar days of learning of the problem. Since only stem cell donors and 
not recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542128], monitoring of  non-
serious  AEs will focus o n the  donors . Non-serious AEs occurring in the patient will not 
be collected.  The Cancer Consortium Expedited Reporting Form for Unanticipated Problems or 
Noncompliance should be completed for all adverse events that meet the expedited reporting 
requiremen ts. The form should be sent to the Institutional Review Office (IRO) within 10 
calendar days of learning of the problem . 
SAE Policy and Reporting at External Sites :  For SAEs that occur in patients enrolled at 
external sites, reporting to the local IRB will be per the local institutional policy.  This will apply to 
expedited and annual reporting.  It will be the responsibility of the external site to submit to 
FHCRC an SAE report for all SAEs that occur in patients and donors.  These report s must be 
sent to FHCRC within 10  days of learning of the event.    
Please see Appendix F for definitions of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE) and 
serious and unexpected eve nts as well as mechanisms for reporting these events  
 
13.2 Adverse Events to be Monitored in This Study  
 
• Serious Adverse Events   
- SAEs:  All events occurring in donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542129] , regardless of whether they are related or unrelated to the 
protocol intervention or are expected or unexpected.  SAEs observed in donors or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542130] e 
IRB in an expedited fashion (within 10 calendar days of learning of the problem). All other SAEs 
will be reported to the IRB at the time of annual protocol renewal.  
 
• Adverse Events Related to Administration of Atorvastatin  
o Select t oxicities will be collected using the  National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0  (Appendix I) 
o Since the primary research intervention in this study is the administration of atorvastatin 
to PBSC donors before stem cell collection  (for prevention of severe acute GVHD  in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) , reporting of AE s that are not serious  will focus on atorvastatin -related events  
in donors . Although highly unlikely, the potential negative impact of donor statin 
treatment on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542131] -harm endpoints that trigger 
mandatory DSMB review  as further outlined in 17.3.  
o Donors  will be assess ed for the following events:  
▪ Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : grade 2 -5 
▪ Hepatobiliary disorders : grade 2 -5 
▪ Other  unexpected events thought related to the use of atorvastatin; grade 2 -5 
In cases where the NCI criteria do not apply, intensity will be defined as:  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
46 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 ▪ Mild: awareness of symptom or sign, but easily tolerated  
▪ Moderate: discomfort is enough to cause interferen ce with normal activities  
▪ Severe: inability to perform normal daily activities  
▪ Life threatening: immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
15.1 Principal Investigator  
  
• Responsibilities  
o Coordinating development of the protocol as well as its subsequent 
amendments.  
o Securing initial IRB and NHLBI approval of the protocol  
o Securing IRB approval of protocol amendments.  
o Reviewing and adjudicating whether SAEs are unexpected and related to 
administration of atorvastatin to donors before stem c ell collection.   
o Securing renewal of IRB approval at annual intervals.  
 
• Oversight Mechanisms  
To identify trends pertinent to patient or donor safety, t he Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_542133], SAEs  and AEs in the 
donors that might be related to administration of atorvastatin . Patient data (day 100 NRM and 
recurrent malignancy) will  also be reviewed .   
 
15.[ADDRESS_707292] (DSMB)  
 
• Role of the DSMB  
This stud y will be monitored by a DSMB. The primary role of the DSMB will be to monitor 
proto col specific AEs and SAEs  in the donors , even though occurrence of SAEs in donors 
probably or likely related to short -term atorvastatin treatment is considered highly unli kely.  The 
DSMB will monitor acute GVHD, relapse, non -relapse mortality and overall survival in the 
patients.    
 
• DSMB Membership  
Membership will consist of one statistician and two senior physicians who are familiar with HCT.  
To avoid any conflict of inter est, DSMB members are required to have no study involvement. 
Potential conflicts of interest will be reviewed by [CONTACT_542166].  
 
• Operations and Responsibilities of the DSMB  
The DSMB will meet after the first cohort of [ADDRESS_707293]  completed the stem cell donation 
process. Subsequent meetings will be held at 12-month intervals.  At each meeting the DSMB 
will review data related to donor  and patient safety. It is anticipated that the donor safety 
monitoring will include a review of all protocol -specific adverse events an d AEs  and SAEs. Even 
though there has been no indication based on large retrospective analyses that donor statin

100 mortality in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542134].  
Based on the information available at each of these meetings, the DSMB is charged with 
deciding whether a) no action is required, b) the protocol should be modified, c) further 
enrollment should be suspended pending additional review, or d) the protocol s hould be closed.   
The DSMB will keep minutes of its meetings and provide its findings to the Principal Inves tigator 
within 10 working days.  An exception to this time requirement will occur if the DSMB 
recommends study termination, suspension of enrollment  or a protocol modification that 
significantly affects donor or patient safety. In these cases, the DSMB will be expected to 
provide their recommendations to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours. Ad hoc meeting or 
discussion with the DSMB will be arr anged as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_350712].

15.3  Trial Monitoring  
Trial monitoring is provi ded in accordance with the FHCRC/University of Washington (UW) 
Cancer Consortium Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). Under the provisions of the 
DSMP, the Cancer Consortium Clinical Trial Support Office provides monitoring for quality 
process and compl iance by [CONTACT_542167]. 
Monitoring visits occur at specified intervals determined by [CONTACT_542168]. The scope of monitoring is specified in the DS MP 
http://www.cancerconsortium.org/rto/prr/   
Per FHCRC IRB Policy 1.9, all confirmed serious or continuing noncompliance with federal laws 
relating to research involving human subjects, the FHCRC hum an subject protection program 
(HRPP) or the requirements of the IRB will be reported promptly to either the IRO Director or 
other entities cited in the policy.  
 
 
DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIALITY  
Clinical Statistics maintains a subject database at FHCRC to allow storage and retrieval of  local 
subject data collected from a wide variety of sources. The investigator will ensure that data 
collected conform to all established guidelines for coding, collection, key entry and verificati on. 
Each subject is assigned a unique patient number to assure subject confidentiality. Subjects will 
not be referred to by [CONTACT_9127], by [CONTACT_2300], or by [CONTACT_542169]. The licensed medical record s department, affiliated with the 
Consortium  institution where the subject receives medical care, maintains all original inpatient 
and outpatient chart documents. Subject research files are scanned and stored securely in an 
optical web library (OWL). OWL r ecords are maintained by [CONTACT_542170].

assigning severity and grade will be reviewed by [CONTACT_542172]. Based on a hypothetical total of 100 patients evaluated, Table 14 illustrates 
the decreasing confidence that a true rate of grade 3 -4 acute GVHD of <9% exists 
corresponding to increasing numbers of patie nts in whom grade 3 -4 acute GVHD is observed. 
Having 90% confidence that a true grade 3 -4 GVHD rate of <9% exists appears sufficient to 
define success of this study; therefore, donor/patient pairs would be enrolled until the 6th patient

 17.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
• Acute and chronic GVHD  
Grades II -IV and II -IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD will be assessed with the use of 
cumulative incidence plots.  
 
• Non-relapse Mortality  
Non-relapse mortality will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots. This 
secondary endpoint will be characterized and presented as a cumulative incidence a t day 100 
and at 1 year after HC T. 
 
• Recurrent or p rogressive Malignancy  
Recu rrent or progressive malignancy will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence 
plots.  
  
• Overall survival  
Disease -free survival and overall survival will be evaluated as Kaplan -Meier estimates at [ADDRESS_707299].  
  
• Duration of Systemic Immunosuppres sive Treatment  
Primary and secondary treatment of acute GVHD and withdrawal of systemic 
immunosuppressive treatment will be assessed with the use of cumulative incidence plots.  
 
•  Discontinuation of Atorvastatin Therapy  
The number of donors who prematurely discontinue atorvastatin therapy and the reasons for 
discontinuation will be described.

patients with hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], SAEs were rare (<1%), did not increase across the 10 mg/day to

statin treatment may negatively affect recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ outcomes [2], rates of recurrent malignancy 
and day -100 mortality in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542136]. In the unlikely event that there was evidence suggesting donor  statin treatment causes 
harm in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the DSMB may recommend modification or closure of the study.

CHRONIC GRAFT -VERSUS -HOST DISEASE (GVHD)  
 
Chronic GVHD in allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_496724], Sjogren syndrome, primary biliary cirrhosis, lichen planus, wasting syndrome,  
bronchiolitis obliterans among others manif estations (see below). Approximately 50% of  
patients will develop this complication within [ADDRESS_707310] 2 years after allogene ic stem cell transplantation so that appropriate treatment can be  
instituted promptly in patients who develop chronic GVHD. Debilitation, joint contractures  
and profound immunosuppression resulting in recurrent bacterial infections are prominent  
characteristics of untreated chronic GVHD.  
 
A. Classification of Chronic GVHD  
The purpose of this classification is to identify patients with cGVHD who need long -term 
systemic immunosuppression according to clinical and laboratory findings and risk factors at  
the time of initial diagnosis.  
 
1.  Chronic GVHD not requiring systemic treatment: mild abnormalities involving a  
single site, with platelet count >100,000 and no steroid treatment at the onset of  
chronic GVHD  
a)  Oral abnormalities consistent with cGVHD, a positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other  
manifestations of cGVHD  
b)  Mild liver test abnormalities (alkaline phosphatase ≤[ADDRESS_707311] or  ALT 
≤3 x upper limit of normal and total bilirubin ≤1.6) with positive skin or lip bi opsy,  and no 
other manifestations of cGVHD  
c)  Less than 6 papulosquamous plaques, macular -papular or lichenoid rash involving <20% 
of body surface area (BSA), dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_450390] <20% BSA, or erythema  involving 
<50% BSA, positive skin biopsy, and no  other manifestations of cGVHD  
d)  Ocular sicca (Schirmer’s test ≤5mm with no more than minimal ocular symptoms),  
positive skin or lip biopsy, and no other manifestations of cGVHD  
e)  Vaginal or vulvar abnormalities with positive biopsy, and no other manif estations of  
cGVHD  
 
2.   Chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment: more severe abnormalities or  
involvement of multiple sites, or platelet count <100,000, or steroid treatment  
at the onset of chronic GVHD  
a)  Involvement of two or more organs with symptoms or signs of cGVHD, with biopsy  
documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
b)  ≥15% base line body weight loss not d ue to other causes, with biopsy documentation of  
cGVHD in any organ  
c)  Skin involvement more extensive than defined for cl inical limited c GVHD, confirmed by 
[CONTACT_9256]  
d)  Scleroderma or morphea  
e)  Onycholysis or onychodystrophy thought to represent cGVHD, with documentation of  
cGVHD in any organ  
f)  Decreased range of motion in wrist or ankle extension due to fasciitis caused by [CONTACT_57942]  
g)  Cont ractures thought to represent cGVHD  
h) Oral involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]  
i)  Vaginal involvement with functional impairment, refractory to topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]  
j)  Bronchiolitis obliterans not due to other causes  
k)  Positive liver biopsy; or abnormal liver function tests not due to other causes with  
alkaline phosphatase >[ADDRESS_707312] or ALT >3 x upper limit of  
normal, or total bilirubin >1.6, and documentation of cGVHD in any organ  
l)  Positive u pper or lower GI biopsy  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
58 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 m)  Fasciitis or serositis thought to represent cGVHD and not due to other causes  
 
B. Physical manifestations of Chronic GVHD  
Manifestations that are distinctive for chronic GVHD can begin before day [ADDRESS_707313] one manifestation that is distinctive for chronic GVHD ( identified by [CONTACT_496773] ) as opposed to acute GVHD. In all cases, infection and others causes must be  
ruled out in the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD.  
 
Karnofsky or Lansky  Clinical Performance scores <60%, ≥15% weight loss, and recurrent  
infections are usually signs of clinical extensive chronic GVHD. Abnormalities that could  
indicate chronic GVHD are categorized by [CONTACT_443965] ( italic print  
identifies man ifestation more distinct of chronic GVHD):  
 
Skin Erythema, dryness, pruritis, macular -papular or urticarial rash, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491] (i.e., hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
vitiligo), mottling, papulosquamous or lichenoid plaques, hyperkeratosis, exfoliation (icht hyosis), nodules, 
scleroderma, morphea (one or several circumscribed, indurated and shiny lesions) . The extent of skin 
involvement  and the s kin thickness score  for patients with scleroderma needs to be recorded at the time of 
diagnosis, when changes in treatment are made and when assessing treatment response. Medical photos 
are also useful for assessing the extent of skin involvement and response to treatment.  
Nails  B.     Ridging, onychodystrophy, onycholysis  
Hair Premature graying (scalp hair, eyelashes, eyebrows), thinning scalp hair, alopecia, decreased body hair  
Mouth  Dryness, burning, gingivitis, mucositis, striae, dryness, atrophy, erythema, lichenoid changes, ulcers, labial 
atrophy or pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], tightness around the mouth, sensitivity to acidic, strong flavors, heat or cold, 
tooth decay  
Eyes  Dryness, burnin g, blurring, gritty eyes, photophobia, pain  
Vagina/vul
va Dryness, dyspareunia, stricture or stenosis, erythema, atrophy or lichenoid changes not induced by [CONTACT_542175] (see laboratory tests)  
Lung  Bronchiolitis obliterans (see diagnostic indicators), cough, wheezing, dyspnea on exertion, history of 
recurrent bronchitis or sinusitis  
GI Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, dysphagia, odynophag ia 
Myofascial  Stiffness and tightness with restriction of movement, occasionally with swelling, pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], erythema 
and induration, most commonly affecting the forearms, wrists and hands, ankles, legs and feet, inability to 
extend the wrists without flexing the fingers or the elbows, contractures  
Muscle  Proximal muscle weakness, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_542137], pericardial, or peritoneal cavities not due to venocclusive disease 
of the liver, cardiac insufficiency, malignancy, infection, GM -CSF toxicity or other causes

59 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/[ADDRESS_707314] treatment of chronic GVHD usually begins with administration of glucocorticoids (1mg/kg/day) 
followed by [CONTACT_542176] -day regimen, with or w ithout daily cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus (FK506). Other medications used for treatment of corticosteroid -resistant chronic GVHD are 
summarized on the next page. Telephone consultation with the LTFU medical team is available to you, 
seven days a week, to dis cuss appropriate treatment and provide other follow up recommendations. In 
addition to immunosuppressive treatment, antibiotic prophylaxis for encapsulated bacterial infections and 
PCP must be given to all patients being treated for chronic GVHD  
 
The durat ion of systemic immunosuppressive treatment of chronic GVHD varies but requires at least one 
year of therapy. Approximately 80% of patients require systemic immunosuppressive for 2 years and 40% 
of them requires therapy for at least 4 years.

ACUTE GVHD ASSESSMENT  
 
Overall Grade  
 
The determination of an overall GVHD grade should be based on the organ stage, response to treatment 
and whether GVHD was a major cause of death.  
 
Overall 
Grade   Organ Stage  Qualifying Conditions  Additional Qualifying Conditions  
I Stage 1 -2 skin  No liver or gut  Indicates that the prophylactic 
immunosuppressive regimen was not 
sufficient to prevent all manifestations of 
aGVHD.  
II Stage 3 skin  
 or  
Stage 1 liver  
 or  
Stage 1 gut  N/A Indicates that the prophylactic 
immunosuppressive regimen was not 
sufficient to prevent all manifestations of 
aGVHD, but glucocorticoid treatment after 
the onset of GVHD was generally sufficient 
to control the disease.  
III Stage 4 skin  
 or  
Stage 2 -4 liver  
 or  
Stage 2 -4 gut   
without  GVHD as a major 
contributing cause of death  
 
 Indicates that the prophylactic 
immunosuppressive regimen was not 
sufficient to prevent all manifestations of 
aGVHD and that additional treatment after 
the onset of GVHD did not readily control 
the disease.  
IV Stage 4 skin  
 or  
Stage 2 -4 liver  
 or  
Stage 2 -4 gut   
with GVHD as a major 
contributing cause of death  
 
 GVHD was resistant to both the prophylactic 
immunosuppressive regimen and any 
additional treatment after the onset of the 
disease.

Evaluation of Disease Response  
 
Chronic myeloid Leukemia (CML)  
Complete response:  Normalization of the WBC  with complete disappearance of the Ph 
chromosome in 20/20 metaphases whenever possible. Molecular response is 
defined by [CONTACT_542179] -PCR for the BCR/ABL transcripts in bone marrow or 
blood.  
Partial response:  Normalization of the white count with >0% but ≤35% Ph -metaphases.  
No response:  Persistence of ≥80% Ph -positive metaphases.  
Progressive disease:  Acquisition of a new cytogenetic abnormality and/or development of 
accelerated phase or blast crisis. The criteria for accelerated phase will be 
defined as unexplained fever greater than 38.3° C, new clonal cytogenetic 
abnormalities in addition to a single Ph -positive chromosome, marrow blasts 
and promyelocytes >20%.  
 
Acute leukemia (AML, ALL)  
Complete response:  <5% marrow blasts by [CONTACT_542180].  
Partial response:  5-30% marrow blasts, or <5% marrow blasts with circulating blasts.  
Stable disease:  >30% marrow blasts without definite deterioration of performance status or 
worsening of anemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia.  
Progressive disease:   
 Evidence of relapse (>5% blasts) by [CONTACT_542181][INVESTIGATOR_542138].  
 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  
Complete remission:  Normal imaging studies (X -ray, CT, MRI) (nodes, liver, and spleen), peripheral

 APPENDIX F 
 
Study Coordinator’s Manual  
 
I. Introduction  
The mixed chimerism protocols have been opened to multiple sites to increase the referral base and 
accrual. Because of this expansion of collaborators, the data collection procedures are being revised. The 
procedure manual was created to assur e consistency of data reporting across the centers and to assure 
compliance with regulations. General expectations of collaborators are that they will comply with 
appropriate regulatory requirements, specified protocol requirements, and provide outcome dat a. 
 
The manual translates working procedures for study coordination. Its goal is to describe the procedures 
with sufficient clarity to ensure that all study centers will use the same procedures and follow -up 
schedules for participant data management and re porting. Changes to the manual and relevant forms will 
be made as soon as practical and will become effective on receipt of the revised procedures at the study 
centers, unless otherwise noticed.  
 
II. Institutional Review Board Review of Protocols and Modifications  
All research protocols proposed for use that involves human subjects must be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_4707] (IRB) prior to implementation. New protocols will undergo review at the 
FHCRC IRB and then will be distribute d to sites that wish to participate for their IRB’s review. For Centers 
that have a Federal Wide Assurance (FWA), formal collaboration includes submission of a form [ADDRESS_707318] be completed  before collaboration on a 
protocol can begin.  
 
In addition,  all amendments and/or revisions to on -going, approved activities must be submitted for review 
and approved prior to implementation  at an institution.  No revisions may be implemented at outside 
institutions without the prior approval of the FHCRC Principa l Investigator.   The FHCRC and the local 
site’s IRB must review all protocol activities at least once annually. This must be done within [ADDRESS_707319] be received for collaboration to continue for the  
next year.  
 
III. Registrations  
Collaborating Institutions : The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_542140]. Registration will include completion of the eligibility 
checkli st/demographic form. This form will be faxed (206 -667-5378) prior to treatment initiation. Patients 
should be registered prior to treatment initiation for valid registration  
 
IV. Reporting Adverse Events  
The following guidelines are the minimum serious adverse  event (SAE) reporting guidelines for Category 
1 and 2 studies conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.   
 
Expedited Reporting Requirements   
All adverse events (whether occurring on -site or off -site), which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_450398] (1) unexpected , and (2)  related or possibly related to the 
research and (3) serious or suggests that the research places research participant s or 
others at a greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or 
recognized must be submitted to the IRB within ten (10) calendar days of becoming 
aware of the event.  
 
 
 
2546.00  - Nonablative  
66 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/[ADDRESS_707320] a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavor able and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure 
whether or not considered related  to the medicinal product .  
 
Related or Possibly Related Adverse Event:  An adverse event is “related or possibly related to 
the research procedure” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14371], it was more likely than not caused by 
[CONTACT_28821]. Adverse events that are solely  caused by [CONTACT_113363], disorder or 
condition of the subject or by [CONTACT_542184], disorder or condition of the subject are not “related or possibly related.” If there is any q uestion 
whether or not an adverse event is related or possibly related, the adverse event should be reported.   
 
Serious Adverse Event: An adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
▪ death  
▪ a life -threatening adverse event (real risk of dying)  
▪ unplanned inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
▪ a persistent or significant disability/incapacity /or change in psychosocial status  
▪ a congenital anomaly  
▪ requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment of damage  
 
o Life-threatening AE  is defined as any adverse event that places the patient or subject, in view 
of the investigator, at immediate risk of  death from the reaction.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event: An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, 
or frequency are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with 
the research procedures  described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol, informed consent document and other relevant sources of information such as product 
labeling and package inserts; and are also not consistent with (b) the characteris tics of the subject 
population being studied including the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder 
or condition or any predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
To ensure no confusion or misunderstanding exist of th e differences between the terms “serious” and 
“severe,” which are not synonymous the following note of clarification is provided:  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) or a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate or severe myoc ardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action  criteria usually associated with events that pos e a threat to a patient’s life 
or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.  
 
For example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in general, will not be considered a serious adverse event as approximately 
half of evaluable M RD patients AND the majority of evaluable URD patients receiving non -myeloablative 
transplants were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123324] a serious adverse event if it fulfills the 
criteria for a serious and unexpected adverse event as describe d above.  
 
Serious events, including deaths, due to GVHD and/or infections will not be reported on an expedited 
basis.  These are well documented, expected, post transplant complications and will be reported 
biannually to the DSMB.

FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 FHCRC is acting as the Coordinating Center for this multi -institutional study, and it is the responsibility of 
the FHCRC Principal Investigator (or designee) to complete the FHCRC Serious Adverse Event Report 
for all serious adverse events that meet the expedited reporting r equirements that are received from the 
participating sites. It is the responsibility of the FHCRC Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_443890], NIH, 
FDA or other agencies of serious adverse events as required in the protocol.  
 
Procedure for Reporting Serio us and Unexpected Adverse Events (SAE) from 
Participating Sites : Regulations defining the responsibilities for reporting serious and unexpected 
adverse reactions are defined above.  
 
Donor : SAEs or any death regardless of cause (serious, unexpected, and related/possibly related) will 
be monitored and recorded from the time the donor starts atorvastatin therapy through [ADDRESS_707321] be reported  to the FHCRC Investigator within 10 days of 
learning of the event.  
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] : SAEs (life -threatening or fatal)   
• For [ADDRESS_707322] to treatment plan or primary protocol , SAEs or any death 
regardless of cause (serious, unexpected, and related/possibly related)  will be monitored and 
recorded from the time the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_542141] [ADDRESS_707323] be reported to the FHCRC Investigator 
within 10 days of lear ning of the event.  
• For [ADDRESS_707324] inator at 
(206) 667 -5378. This will be followed by [CONTACT_370433] (See Appendix G) within [ADDRESS_707325] be 
submitted as soon as the relevant information is available.   
 
 
Reporting of Adverse Events on Case Report Forms (CRF)  
All grade 3 or 4 adverse events (or highly unusual g rade 2 adverse eve nts), which occur between start of 
conditioning and day 100 during the study will be recorded on the CRF .  These adverse events which are 
observed by [CONTACT_183633], whether or not attributed to the study, wil l be 
reported on the Case Report Form using the selected (for this protocol) NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
(NCI-CTC) version 4 ( Appendix J). Attributes will include a description, date of onset, maximum severity, 
and assessment of relationship to the study agent or other suspect agent(s). These grade [ADDRESS_707326] to a treatment plan (FHCRC or Outsid e Center)  
Only SAEs (life -threatening or fatal) will be captured on SAE form (Appendix G). No other grade 3 or 4 
Adverse Events will be captured.  
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems that Involve Risk to Research Participants or 
Others:  Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets both of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature [specificity], severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved 
research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
2546.00  - Nonablative  
68 
FHCRC Current Version:  02/06/2018  
 
 • Indicates that the research places research participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, e conomic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
These must be reported to the FHCRC Investigator within 10 days of learning of the event as described 
above for reporting of SAE.  
 
V. Case Report Forms  
 
Donor  CRFs  – safety evaluations at three timepoints (CRFs to be provided to external sites)  
(Appendix M)  
• Prior to start of statins  
• First day of collection

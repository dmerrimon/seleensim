  05/[ADDRESS_196482] pressure (PAP) on depressive symptoms in 
women with prenatal sleep-disorder ed breathing (SDB) and depression.  
Hypothesis: The PAP group, in comparis on to the non-PAP group, will demonstrate 
improvements in depressive symptoms and more frequent remission of depression, as 
well as improved sleep quality, reduced sl eep fragmentation, and increased sleep 
duration.    
2. Characterize the effect of PAP on the H PA axis in women with prenatal SDB and 
depression.   
Hypothesis: Use of PAP will reduce levels of cortisol, a marker of HPA axis functioning, 
and reductions in cortisol will corr elate with improvements in mood.  
 
3. An additional, exploratory aim is to assess associations between PAP treatment and 
adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.  
We hypothesize that the PAP group in compar ison to the non-PAP group will show better 
delivery outcomes (lower rates of preterm birt h, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and their infants 
will demonstrate greater neurodevelopment rela tive to those born to the non-PAP group.  
 
Design and Outcomes   
The study is a randomized trial to test th e efficacy of PAP on sleep and depression 
symptoms in perinatal women. Mood and sl eep assessments will be completed at 
baseline, after [ADDRESS_196483] night of therapy in the Sleep 
Laboratory. Participants will use PAP at home for the remainder of their pregnancy and 
through 12 weeks postpartum. 
Participants in the treatment as  usual arm will continue their cl inical care as usual through 
obstetrics. Note that PAP is not part of  treatment as usual/ standard care through 
obstetrics. 
Sample Size and Population  
The study is a randomized controlled trial with  50 participants, 25 per group. Participants 
will be pregnant women with SDB and major depressive disorder. Women will be randomly assigned to either PAP (PAP group)  or treatment as usual (SDB group).

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) represents a spectrum of breathing disturbances during 
sleep, ranging from habitual snoring to obs tructive sleep apnea. Between 3-17% of the 
population experiences SDB of at least moderate severity (Peppard et al., 2013). Consequences 
of SDB include cardiovascular a nd behavioral morbidity and mo rtality (T. Young et al., 2009). 
An estimated 9% of women of childbearing age have SDB; however, this figure is likely an 
underestimate, as 90% are undiagnosed (Peppa rd et al., 2013; T. Young et al., 1993). 
Furthermore, risk increases during pregnancy (Izci et al., 2006; Pie n, Fife, Pack, Nkwuo, & 
Schwab, 2005). Published data, including our own, show that by [CONTACT_168450] >30% of 
women demonstrate habitual snoring, the ha llmark symptom of SDB (Bourjeily, Raker, 
Chalhoub, & Miller, 2010; Hutchison et al., 2012; O'Brien, Bullough, Owusu, et al., 2012). 
Perinatal depression affects nearly 20% of women (Gavi n, 2005). Highly recurrent (Di 
Florio et al., 2013), severe cases  can precipi[INVESTIGATOR_168429], suic ide, and infanticide (Yonkers, 
2011). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_88776],  50% of women with perina tal depression do not receive 
treatment (Ko, Farr, Dietz, & Robbins, 2012)and even with antidepressa nt treatment >40% 
remain depressed (Sit et al., 2011), conferring serious risk to themse lves and their offspring. It is 
well-established that offspring bor n to depressed mothers as comp ared to healthy mothers have 
poorer proximal (e.g., shorter gestation, lower bi rth weight (Field et  al., 2004)) and distal 
outcomes (e.g., childhood cognitive impairment (Hollins, 2007), self-regulation difficulties (Maughan, Cicchetti, Toth, & Rogosc h, 2007)). A critical need exists  for interventions that could 
improve these outcomes.

  05/2017  2.2 Study Rationale 
Depression is a frequent morbidity of SDB.  SDB of moderate se verity increases the 
prospective risk for depression 2- fold, equivalent to the increase in risk for hypertension (T. 
Young et al., 2009). Estimates of the comorbid ity between SDB and depression range from 18-
58% (Mosko et al., 1989; Ohayon, 2003). SDB is a ssociated with treatment -resistant depression 
(Roest et al., 2012). Notably, treat ment of SDB with positive airw ay pressure (PAP) significantly 
reduces depressive symptoms in patients with depression (El-Sh erbini, 2011), including 
treatment-resistant depre ssion (Habukawa et al., 2010).  
A new line of inquiry indicates that SDB is  a risk factor for a variety of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes (Bourjeily et al., 2010; F acco et al., 2012; Louis et al., 2012; O'Brien, 
Bullough, Owusu, et al., 2012; O'Brien, Bullough, et al., 2013; Poyares et al., 2007). However, 
the relationship between SDB and perinatal depr ession, one of the leadi ng causes of maternal 
morbidity (Colvin, Slack-Smith, Stanley, & Bower, 2013), is not well understood.   
Importantly, accumulating evidence now str ongly indicates that maternal sleep 
disturbance is a key modifiable ri sk factor for depressive illne ss. Studies demonstrate that poor 
sleep quality (Dørheim, Bonde vik, Eberhard-Gran, & Bjorvat n, 2009; Jomeen & Martin, 2007) 
and sleep fragmentation (Okun et al., 2011) are robustly associated  with perinatal depressive 
symptoms. Poor sleep quality in early pregnancy directly predic ts later depressive symptoms 
(Helen Skouteris, Germano, Wertheim, Paxt on, & Milgrom, 2008; H. Skouteris, Wertheim, 
Germano, Paxton, & Milgrom, 2009). Furthermore, poor  sleep quality in late pregnancy predicts 
postpartum depression (Okun et al., 2011; Wolfs on, Crowley, Anwer, & Bassett, 2003). One of 
the most common, yet undiagnosed, causes of poor sl eep quality is sleep disordered breathing 
(SDB). Notably, our own data show significant overlap between SDB and depressive symptoms 
in pregnancy; 43% of pregnant women who s nore report significant depressive symptoms, 
relative to 23% of non-snorers (O'Brien, Owus u, & Swanson, 2013). Our findings, the first in a 
pregnant population, are consiste nt with other studies that sh ow high comorbidity between SDB 
and depression. This raises the distinct possibili ty that treatment of SD B will improve perinatal 
depression. Importantly, PAP is a non-invasive, non-pharmacologica l intervention that can be 
readily implemented in pregnant women, as our ow n data demonstrate. However, the impact of 
SDB treatment on perinatal depression has not  been investigated to date.     
Sleep fragmentation, a consequence of SDB, is associated with HPA axis hyperactivity 
(Follenius, Brandenberger, Bandesa pt, Libert, & Ehrhart, 1992; Sp ath-Schwalbe, Gofferje, Kern, 
Born, & Fehm, 1991). Chronic activation of the HPA axis is a hypothesized pathway by [CONTACT_168451], and increase vulnerability to, depr ession. Hyperactivity of the axis is observed 
in both prenatal depression (Parcells, 2010; Rich -Edwards et al., 2008) and SDB (Vgontzas et 
al., 2007), and, importantly, predicts resistance to  antidepressants (E. A. Young et al., 2004). The 
axis is normalized with PAP (H enley et al., 2009; Schmoller et  al., 2009; Vgontzas et al., 2007). 
Maternal HPA axis functioning is implicated  in fetal programming (Weinstock, 2005).  
PAP is the standard treatment for sleep -disordered breathing in the non-perinatal 
population. However, it has not been  studied in pregnancy, and th e effects of PAP treatment on 
SDB, health, and mental health in pre gnant and postpartum women remains unknown. 
Participants will use PAP nightly  through [ADDRESS_196485] proposed a randomized design – in which participants ar e assigned to either 
PAP therapy or treatment as usual -- only after ca reful consideration of et hical and safety issues, 
SDBPD Protocol 6 of 20 Version

  Version 1.0 
  05/2017  and consultation with numerous leaders in the field. Conclusions from a panel discussion (held 
during the 2009 Annual Meeting of  the Associated Professional  Sleep Societies) regarding 
ethical issues in obstructive sleep apnea clinical tr ials were also utilized (Brown et al., 2011). [CONTACT_168462], a co-investigator on this study, was a me mber of this panel, and he has conducted 
randomized, controlled trials in  obstructive sleep apnea treatme nt. A randomized design was 
proposed for the study because in a non-randomi zed protocol many fact ors could influence 
acceptance or refusal of CPAP, and these confou nding variables might obscure our ability to 
draw conclusions about  effects of CPAP. 
We believe a randomized design is  ethical based on several main  points. First, there is a 
notable lack of published data a nd therefore significant clinical equipoise exists regarding the 
risks of SDB in pregnancy, the effects of PAP treatment in this population, and the ability of 
pregnant women to use PAP. The little evidence that does exist on risks of untreated SDB during 
pregnancy are conflicting. Importantly, there is no  published evidence that treatment of SDB in 
pregnancy has any impact on maternal, obstetric, or neonatal outcomes. No guidelines have been 
published for treatment of SDB during pregnancy. Second, screening for SDB is not standard of 
care in pregnancy, and most pregna nt women are never referred fo r sleep studies. Thus, the vast 
majority of pregnant women with SDB do not know  they have this condition, and are untreated. 
Third, several large studies of SDB have assessed participants ’ SDB status and followed them 
across many years without providing treatment, or  randomizing participants  to receive PAP or 
standard care (e.g., Sleep and Hear t Health Study; Sleep Apnea car dioVascular Endpoint study). 
We also wish to reference a recent study of sleep apnea in pregnancy conducted by [CONTACT_168452] (Facco et al., 2014), wherein pregnant  women were assessed for SDB and those 
diagnosed with SDB were not offered PAP treatme nt. Fourth, we have established a plan to 
protect participants from the most likely risk of untreated SDB, motor vehicle crash due to 
daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], further delineated in the Data  Safety Monitoring Plan. This approach and the 
focus for safety purposes on sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_168430] (Brown et al. 2011). Finally, all participants will be 
offered referrals for SDB treatment upon conclusi on of the study. In short, some individuals 
could benefit by [CONTACT_168453]; no participant will be prevented from seeking clinical 
care for SDB on their own accord; and participation in  this research is not  anticipated to impose 
incremental harm that would have be en avoided absent participation.  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This 5-year study is a randomi zed trial of PAP therapy in pregnant women with SDB and 
depression. The main objectives of the study are to (1) assess the impact of PAP on depression 
symptoms in women with prenatal SDB and depr ession and (2) characteri ze the effect of PAP on 
the HPA axis in women with prenatal SDB and depression. A secondary objective is to assess 
associations between PAP treatment and a dverse pregnancy and ne onatal outcomes.   
Fifty pregnant women who have comorbid SDB and depression will be enrolled in the study. 
Participants will be screened for depressi on using methodologies established by [CONTACT_27156] 
(Swanson, Flynn, Adams-Mundy, Armitage, & Arnedt, 2013). a Participants will be randomly assigned to PAP (n=25) or treatment as usual (n= 25). Participants will complete assessments of 
sleep and mood at enrollment through [ADDRESS_196486] aspects of the study in their home, including telephone-based 
SDBPD Protocol 7 of 20 Version

  Version 1.0 
  05/[ADDRESS_196487] 
night of PAP therapy in the sleep laboratory. Length of participation will vary depending on 
gestational age at enrollment a nd the length of each pa rticipant’s pregnancy. We anticipate that 
most women will participate for 4-6 months.  
Women who meet eligibility for th e study will be randomized to either PAP or treatment as usual 
using the minimization method (Schulz, Altma n, & Moher, 2010). In this CONSORT-approved 
method, the first participant is truly random, and th ereafter participants ar e allocated to condition 
to minimize between-group imbalan ce of selected characteristic s. Minimization is a viable 
alternative to true randomization, arguably superior as it allows for balanced groups even in 
smaller samples (Treasure & MacRae, 1998). We will balance assignment to group based on the 
following characteristics: race, gestation week, depression severity, SDB severity, 
socioeconomic status, partnered status, 1st trim ester BMI. Participants will not be blind to 
condition. The study clinician, who will complete c linician-rated assessments of participants’ 
mood, will be blind to group assignment.    
Participants randomized to PAP treatment will be asked to use PAP nightly through 12 weeks 
postpartum. Participants will use PAP at home for the remainder of their pregnancy, through 12 
weeks postpartum.  
Participants randomized to the treatment as usual group will not be offered PAP, and will 
continue to receive care as usua l within obstetrics (SDB group).  
 
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
Recruitment will occur through multiple sites at UM, leveraging the existing research 
infrastructure of the Women’s Mental Heal th and Infants Program (WMHIP). The WMHIP 
maintains an IRB-approved research recruitment re gistry at obstetrics clinics. Briefly, all women 
who present for care at the clinics complete a sc reen consisting of a dem ographic form, perinatal 
depression measure (EPDS), a question regarding ha bitual snoring, and consent to be contact[CONTACT_168454]. A research assistant inspects all fo rms for study eligibility and eligible women are 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Other sources of recruitment include the Women and Infants Mental Health Clinic at UMHS, 
UMClinicalstudies.org website, and fliers pos ted in the community and UMHS clinics.  
Subjects may be identified from the M-STRIDE S database - the clinic al database of the 
Department of Psychiatry, based on their Edinbu rgh Postnatal Depression Scale score. They may 
also be identified from the UM HS Obstetrics Clinic appointme nt list; those patients who have 
documentation of depression or an Edi nburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score ≥[ADDRESS_196488] in the study.

will be maintained to document reasons for inelig ibility and reasons for declined participation in 
eligible participants.   
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.[ADDRESS_196490] Pressure (PAP) 
Positive airway pressure therapy entails use of  a machine that blows pressurized room air 
through the airway (via a mask or nasal pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151], wo rn on the face) at a suffi cient pressure to keep 
the upper airway open. The pressu rized air acts as a splint. Pa rticipants randomized to PAP 
treatment will be offered PAP therapy using an au to-titrating device. The initial trial night of 
PAP will be conducted in a monitored, tec hnologist-attended sleep laboratory. Heated 
humidification will be used in this study, to minimize nasal symptoms and optimize adherence. The auto-titrating PAP delivers a minimum effec tive pressure with the result that the mean 
pressure over the course of the night is ofte n lower than the fixed pressure delivered by 
[CONTACT_168455], and therefore tolerance of PA P may be improved. This device is ideal for 
pregnant women, as it automatically adjusts pressu re settings to optimally treat SDB by [CONTACT_168456] t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_168433] l laboratory visits for re-titration. As in our other protocols of PAP 
in pregnancy, participants will receive the first night of therapy in the sleep laboratory. Treating obstetricians and psychiatrists will be informed of their patient’s enrolment in the study and will

  Version 1.0 
  05/[ADDRESS_196491] of care, but is successfully used in 
our pregnancy protocols and will optimize safety and yet remain generalizable to clinical settings 
where high-risk obstetric clinic  personnel probably could replicat e these frequent contacts, in 
person or by [CONTACT_648], when necessary.  Women will use the PAP device for the remainder of their 
pregnancy and through 12 weeks postpartum. In  comparison, people in the general population 
who use PAP for SDB often use it for many years. 
Risks of PAP therapy are minor, typi[INVESTIGATOR_168434], and other minor risks related to mask pr oblems or nasal symptoms. There is a rare risk 
of pneumothorax or pneumocephalus. All documented events of pneumothorax or 
pneumocephalus occurred in women who had previ ous trauma and/or nasal surgery. Therefore, 
participants with recent head trauma or surg ery (pi[INVESTIGATOR_168435]) that may have produced 
cranio-nasopharyngeal fistula (risk of entry of air or other material  into the crania l cavity) will be 
excluded from the study. The most frequent risks,  all minor, and interventions to minimize these 
risks are as follows: 
 Mask problem: Air leaks   Proper mask fitting and application Skin irritation Avoid over tightening of headgear; use of nasal pi[INVESTIGATOR_168436] e liminate mouth leak; heated humidity 
Mask claustrophobia  Nasal pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151]-type of interface 
 Nasal symptoms: Congestion                         Chin strap; heated  humidity; nasal saline 
Nose bleed                         Chin strap; heated humidifi cation; nasal saline rinses 
Rhinitis                         Nasal saline rinses  
Treatment as Usual  
In this condition, participants will continue their care through obstetrics. Positive airway 
pressure therapy is not provided as pa rt of usual care in obstetrics.   
5.[ADDRESS_196492] by [CONTACT_168457]. No interventions wi ll be prohibited. Use of medications, including 
those for depression (eg, SSRIs), and other de pression treatments (eg, psychotherapy), will be 
monitored and documented througho ut the study, but participants  will not be prevented or 
prohibited from accessing such care, or in making ch anges to their medications  or clinical care.  
5.3 Adherence Assessment  
Use of PAP will be monitored using web-based software, which will provide real-time, web-
based notification of nightly use.  Adherence is defined as four hours or more of PAP use on 70% 
or more of nights. Participants who use PAP for <4 hours will be contact[CONTACT_168458]. Early intervention is crucial to 
maximize adherence (Budhiraja et al., 2007).

  05/2017  6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening Evaluation 
Consenting Procedure 
A waiver of consent is sought to allow access to potential pa rticipants’ medical 
records prior to the eligibility intervie w to determine initial eligibility based on 
pregnancy status, current health, me dical history, and medications.    
Written informed consent will be obtained prio r to the eligibility interview. Informed 
consent will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_168437]. The informed consent 
document will be reviewed in detail with the potential participant, and any questions will be answered. A hard copy of the signed informed consent document will be maintained in the study’s records, which will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office accessible only by [CONTACT_464]. 
Screening 
An initial screen will occur prior to the full eligibility interview. This screen will 
involve examination of potenti al participants’ me dical records and a telephone screen 
to determine preliminary eligibility.  
The full eligibility interview includes 
 Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V (SCID) 
o Standardized, structured clinical interview to obtain information 
regarding current and past mental health history necessary to for 
diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria are based on the DSM-V.  Information to be obtained includes mental health  symptoms, freque ncy, and duration 
of symptoms of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use 
disorders, eating disorders, and psychosis.   
 Columbia-Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
o Structured clinician-administered interview to obtain information 
regarding risk for suicide.  
 Medical history  
o Participants will complete a questio nnaire indicating their history of 
medical conditions. They will also list their current medications.  
o Corroborating information will also be  abstracted from participants’ 
medical records.  
 Sleep  
o Participants will complete questionnair es to assess th eir sleep patterns 
and to determine risk for sleep diso rders. Questionnaires will include 
the Stop-Bang for SDB symptoms  and questions about RLS 
symptoms. They will also complete  a questionnaire (the Pregnancy 
SDBPD Protocol 12 of 20 Version 
6.0  
  Version 1.0 
  05/2017  and Sleep Questionnaire) to characte rize their sleep before and during 
pregnancy.  
 
  6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
Enrollment 
 Participants who meet st udy criteria based on the elig ibility interview will be 
enrolled in the study. They will be randomized  to condition at the time of enrollment.  
Baseline Assessments 
 In-home overnight sleep monitoring (Watch-PAT) 
o Baseline sleep and sleep-disordered breathing characteristics will be 
assessed in participants’ homes. Pa rticipants will wear a watch-like 
device worn on the wrist (Watch-PAT) will measure sleep/wake times 
and blood volume changes (monitored via sensor worn on the finger).    
 Participants randomized to the PAP group will complete a pre/post sleep 
questionnaire the night th ey sleep in the lab. 
 Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) 
o The HRSD is a clinician-rated asse ssment of depression symptoms.   
 Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 
o The EPDS is a self-report scale of  perinatal depression symptoms.  
 Relationship Quality Scale (RQS) 
o The RQS is a measure of relationship quality, and assesses several 
different relationship domains,  including love, conflict, and 
ambivalence.

7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Data Analyses  
Data analysis plan for objective 1: 
Linear mixed models using a repeated measures  group X time (weeks of study) will be used to 
assess main effects and interactions for interven tion and treatment week on HRSD, EPDS, PSQI,   
ESS scores. Logistic regression will assess for the odds of remission by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Covariates to be included in the models proposed  in the analysis include maternal age, marital 
relationship quality, bonding, pr egnancy and delivery complications, and SSRI dosage. Should 
other demographic characteristics differ between  groups despi[INVESTIGATOR_168442], these will be included as covariates.  Data analysis plan for objective 2:  Cortisol values for each time point will be averag ed across the 3-day period to obtain an average 
for pre and post-treatment assessments. Linear mixed models using a repeated measures group X 
time (weeks of study) will be used to assess main  effects and interactions for intervention and 
treatment week on cortisol. Correlations will assess the relationship between change in depression scores (HRSD, EPDS) and cortisol. Cova riates to be included in the models include 
gestational week at assessment, marital relati onship quality, BMI, and pregnancy and delivery 
complications.    Data analysis for secondary objective: The effects of treatment group on gestational ag e at delivery, type of  delivery, length of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and neurodevelopmental score will be conducted usi ng linear regression. 
Logistic regression, covaried for gestational ag e, will assess for the odds of failing domains on 
the ASQ-3 by [CONTACT_1570]. Covariates may in clude maternal education, baseline EPDS 
score, SSRI dose, bonding, and maternal health.

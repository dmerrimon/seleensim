Study Number and Title:
ASTX029-01: A Phase 1-2 Study of the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of ASTX029 in 
Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors
Investigational Drug: ASTX029
Clinical Phase: 1-2
Study Centers Planned/Country: 
Phase 1: up to 14 study centers in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe.
Phase 2: up to 30 study centers in North America and Europe.
Study Objectives: 
Primary Objectives
Phase 1 (Parts A and B): To assess safety and to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029.
Phase 2: To assess preliminary clinical activity, as determined by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR) in 
tumors characterized by [CONTACT_664179]-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal 
pathway that may confer sensitivity to ASTX029.
Secondary Objectives
To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ASTX029 including the food effect on PK 
parameters.
To evaluate other clinical activity parameters, such as duration of response (DOR), disease control 
rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). 
To evaluate relevant pharmacodynamic markers and target engagement (ie, phosphorylated 
ribosomal s6 kinase [pRSK] inhibition) in tumor biopsies. 
Exploratory Objective
To identify and evaluate biomarkers of ASTX029 activity.
Study Design and Investigational Plan: 
This study is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, multicenter, Phase 1-2 study to assess the safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of ASTX029 administered orally to subjects 
≥[ADDRESS_896957] of Parts A and B as follows:
Part A (Dose Escalation): Dose-escalation stage to identify the MTD for up to 2 dosing regimens of 
ASTX029 and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE), defined as either MTD or a dose below 
MTD that the Data and Safety Review Committee (DSRC) agrees shows adequate safety, PK, and/or 
preliminary biological or clinical activity. Subjects enrolled in Regimen 1 (continuous dosing) will 
receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 21 of each 21-day cycle. If Regimen 2 
(intermittent dosing) is opened to enrollment, subjects enrolled in Regimen 2 will receive ASTX029 
orally once a day on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. Initially, subjects will be allocated to 
Regimen 1 (continuous dosing). Subjects in the first cohort of Regimen 1 will receive a flat starting dose 
of 10 mg daily (QD). Planned initial escalation will be 100% (doubling the dose) until 160 mg. Smaller 
increments of dose escalation will be used above 160 mg. Dose doubling will also be discontinued if any 
1 of the following occurs within a cohort:
[ADDRESS_896958] experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 5Any study-drug-related clinically significant ≥Grade 2 AE not adequately managed or resolved to 
baseline or Grade 1 by [CONTACT_664180], per the DSRC, indicates further dose doubling 
would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
Any study-drug-related AE or confluence of AEs that, per the DSRC, indicates further dose 
doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
After this point, dose escalation will proceed in smaller increments (eg, by a 50% increase initially and 
an ~25% increase at the higher dose levels over the previous level) after review of all available safety, 
PK, and biomarker data from Cycle [ADDRESS_896959] an 
alternative intermittent regimen (Optional Regimen 3, eg, 7 days on/7 days off) and will recommend the 
dose and dosing regimen to be used. The total dose per cycle for the new regimen will not exceed the 
total safe dose per cycle already established in the first [ADDRESS_896960] 
3 evaluable subjects each with additional allowed expansion to 6 subjects (3+3 study design) until the 
MTD is determined for each regimen. Dose levels and dosing regimens, the number of cohorts, and the 
number of subjects per cohort may be modified, as needed, in response to emerging data and 
recommendations from the DSRC.
Dose-escalation/de-escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs during the first cycle 
of each dose level and the recommendations of the DSRC following review of all available safety, PK, 
and biomarker data from the completed first cycle of at least 3 subjects in each cohort. The DSRC RDE 
decision will be based on all available safety, PK, biomarkers, and preliminary activity data from all 
cycles (including potential for late or cumulative toxicity). The DSRC will also advise whether or not it 
is appropriate to proceed to Part B (Dose Expansion).
ASXT029 was originally introduced into the clinic in the powder-in-bottle (PiB) form and administered 
under fed conditions. Protocol Amendment 1.0 introduced the tablet dosage form  when it became 
available. Protocol Amendment 2.0 introduced the evaluation of administration under fasted conditions 
during Phase 1 Part A dose escalation. 
Part B (Dose Expansion): One or more dose levels (and regimens) may be studied in Phase 1 Part B to 
supplement available safety, PK, and/or clinical activity data and to evaluate target engagement in fresh 
tumor tissue biopsies. A total of 14 evaluable subjects will be treated at each dose/regimen selected. If 
more than 1 dose/regimen is selected, subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_896961] to 
meet the following molecular eligibility criteria: documented activating mutations in BRAF (BRAF 
V600 mutation or activating atypi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]-V600 aberrations), KRAS, NRAS, or HRAS. The RP2D 
decision by [CONTACT_664181], pharmacodynamic, safety, and preliminary 
activity data from all cycles (including the potential for late or cumulative toxicity). The RP2D could be 
the same or lower than the RDE. 
The DSRC will advise when it is appropriate to proceed to Phase 2.

in Phase 1 Parts A and B. Should ≥[ADDRESS_896965]-stage subjects respond, an additional 19 subjects will be 
enrolled into the second stage. Therefore, up to 29 subjects will be enrolled into each cohort. 
For Phase 2 Cohort F (which will enroll patients with various tumor types and gene aberrations, the 
sponsor, with approval of the DSRC, may expand enrollment for a particular molecularly defined 
subpopulation in which the most number of responses are observed to 10 or 29 subjects under the same 
Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design as for the other cohorts for better assessment of activity in that disease 
subpopulation (Optional Cohort F Expansion). It is expected that no more than 2 subpopulations will be 
expanded in this manner.

Study Treatment:
In the dose-escalation part of the study (Phase 1 Part A), subjects will receive 1 of up to potentially 2 
ASTX029 dosing regimens (Regimen 1 or Regimen 2). Subjects enrolled in Regimen 1 (continuous 
dosing) will receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 21 of each 21-day cycle. If Regimen 
2 (intermittent dosing) is opened to enrollment, subjects enrolled in Regimen 2 will receive ASTX029 
orally once a day on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle. Initially, subjects will be allocated to 
Regimen 1 (continuous dosing). Subjects in the first cohort of Regimen 1 will receive a flat starting dose 
of 10 mg QD. Dose levels for subsequent cohorts will be determined by [CONTACT_664186]. Planned initial 
escalation will be 100% (doubling the dose) until 160 mg. Smaller increments of dose escalation will be 
used above 160 mg. Dose doubling will also be discontinued if any 1 of the following occurs within a 
cohort:
[ADDRESS_896972] experiences a DLT.
Any study-drug-related clinically significant ≥Grade 2 AE not adequately managed or resolved to 
baseline or Grade 1 by [CONTACT_664180], per the DSRC, indicates further dose doubling 
would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
Any study-drug-related AE or confluence of AEs that, per the DSRC, indicates further dose 
doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
Dose escalation will then proceed in smaller increments (eg, by a 50% increase initially and an ~25% 
increase at the higher dose levels over the previous level) after review of safety and PK data from 
Cycle [ADDRESS_896973] 3 subjects and recommendations from the DSRC. Also, after this point, the sponsor, 
with approval of the DSRC, will determine if Regimen 2 is to be opened for enrollment. 
At any point after Cycle 1, the dose level may be reduced for individual subjects in the event of 
unacceptable treatment-related toxicity. One or more dose levels (and regimens) may be studied in 
Phase 1 Part B to supplement available safety, PK, and/or clinical activity data and to evaluate target 
engagement in fresh tumor tissue biopsies.
The dose level and dosing regimen used in Phase 2 will be determined by [CONTACT_664187] A and B of 
the Phase 1 portion of the study.
Study Endpoints:
Primary Endpoints
Phase 1: Incidences of DLTs and AEs to determine the MTD of up to 2 dosing regimens of

Study Assessments and Procedures:
Efficacy Assessments: 
The ORR, PFS, and DOR endpoints will be based on the investigator’s assessment of target and 
non-target lesions according to RECIST v1.1; computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans (or other appropriate disease evaluation method, including tumor marker 
measurement, as applicable) will be performed at baseline and every [ADDRESS_896974] 4 cycles, and 
then every 4 cycles (±1 cycle) thereafter until clinical and/or radiographic disease progression, death, or 
the subject withdraws consent. Subjects will be followed for OS.
Pharmacokinetics Assessments: 
Serial blood sampling (up to 24 hours postdose) on the following study days will allow assessment of 
systemic exposures of ASTX029:
Phase 1: Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1), Cycle 1 Day 2 (C1D2), Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), and Cycle 2 Day 2 
(C2D2) for Regimen 1 and C1D1, C1D2, Cycle 1 Day 14 (C1D14), and Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) 
for Regimen 2. 
Phase 2: C1D1, C1D2, C2D1, and Cycle 3 Day 1 (C3D1) for Regimen 1 and C1D1, C1D2, C1D14, 
C1D15, and C3D1 for Regimen 2. 
At specified study visits, blood samples, including predose and trough samples, will be collected. 
Additional ad hoc blood sample(s) may be collected per investigator discretion, for PK measurement at 
any time, including after the last dose, if there is a suspected safety issue. Plasma drug concentration 
data will be used to determine the PK parameters listed under Secondary Endpoints in all subjects 
during Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 if data are evaluable.
Pharmacodynamic and Biomarker Assessments:
The pharmacodynamic modulation and target engagement will be explored in fresh tumor tissue 
biopsies (when available). Identification and monitoring of potential biomarkers (DNA, RNA, and 
protein) of ASTX029 activity will be assessed in ctDNA, blood, and tumor tissue biopsies. 
Safety Assessments:
At each study visit, safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_88668], serious adverse events (SAEs), DLTs, 
and concomitant medications; additional safety assessments at selected visits include complete or 
symptom-directed physical examinations (PEs), weight and height, vital signs, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, 12-lead ECGs, ECHO/MUGA scans, and clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis). All AEs will be graded by 
[CONTACT_78182] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 10Sample Size and Statistical Analyses:
Sample Size Calculation:
The dose-escalation part of the study (Phase 1 Part A) follows a 3+3 study design, with a cohort size of 
either 3 or 6 evaluable subjects. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined for each 
dosing regimen evaluated.
For Phase 1 Part B, a sample size of 14 evaluable subjects will ensure a 90% probability of observing at 
least 1 adverse reaction to treatment for any adverse reaction with a ≥15% incidence. Evaluable subjects 
for Part B are all subjects who receive any amount of study drug.
For Phase 2, the sample size is based on a Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design. Each cohort will enroll 
[ADDRESS_896975] stage. Should ≥[ADDRESS_896976]-stage subjects respond, an additional 19 subjects will be 
enrolled into the second stage. Therefore, up to 29 subjects will be used for each treatment cohort. The 
sample size, (10+19) 29, under this Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design, will achieve a power of 80% to test 
the null hypothesis of ORRp 0 ≤0.1 at a 1-sided alpha of 0.05 assuming the response rate p 1 is 0.3. For 
Stage 2, the null hypothesis will be rejected if ≥6 responses are observed in a cohort of 29 subjects. For 
Phase 2 Cohort F (which will enroll patients with various tumor types and gene aberrations), the 
sponsor, with approval of the DSRC, may expand enrollment for a particular molecularly defined 
subpopulation in which the most number of responses are observed to 10 or 29 subjects under the same 
Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design as for the other cohorts for better assessment of activity in that disease 
subgroup (Optional Cohort F Expansion). It is expected that no more than 2 subgroups will be expanded 
in this manner.
Efficacy: 
Efficacy analysis (ORR) will be conducted on all subjects who had disease assessment at baseline and 
who received study treatment and had at least [ADDRESS_896977] scheduled disease assessment due to clinical progression or toxicity. 
Objective response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]) rate will be calculated, and its 
90% Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval (CI) will be provided. Disease control (CR + PR + 
stable disease [SD]) rate will be analyzed similarly. Subjects who receive any amount of study treatment 
will be included for PFS and OS analyses using the Kaplan-Meier procedure. Estimates and the 90% CIs 
for the median PFS and OS will also be provided. The DOR will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics, including arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, and range, for subjects who have 
overall responses.
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics:
The PK parameters for ASTX029 will be derived for each subject using a non-compartmental approach 
and will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range. Values at baseline and changes from baseline (if appropriate) of the pharmacodynamic 
parameters and biomarkers assessed will be summarized descriptively using mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical 
variables.
Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive any amount of study treatment (Safety 
Analysis Set). Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_1130]-reported and investigator-observed AEs, along with 
concomitant medications, PEs, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis), vital signs, ECOG performance status, ECGs, and ECHO/MUGA scans. All AEs will be 
graded according to the NCI CTCAE, v4.03. Treatment exposure, AEs (including relatedness and

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 221. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 
(ERKs) 1/[ADDRESS_896987] potent tumor growth inhibitory activity in nonclinical 
cancer models with oncogenic activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction cascade 
(also referred to as the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] signal pathway) 
(Section 1.3.2). The main objectives of this Phase 1-[ADDRESS_896988] that may confer sensitivity to 
ASTX029.
1.1. Background of the Disease
Approximately 1.69 million new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths are projected to occur 
in the US in 2017 (Siegel et al 2017). Although the combined cancer death rates have been 
continuously declining for [ADDRESS_896989] typi[INVESTIGATOR_664144], 
radiotherapy, and/or cytotoxic chemotherapy. Advances in genomics and molecular biology have 
led to successful development of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_664145] (eg, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] [EGFR], B isoform of RAF kinase [BRAF], ALK, BCR-ABL, 
KIT) (Friedman et al 2015; Xu et al 2014 ) . More recently, cancer immunotherapy has also been 
shown to significantly improve the outcomes of many cancers. However, a significant proportion 
of patients eventually relapse due to acquired resistance, and others present intrinsic resistance 
mechanisms (Farkona et al 2016). Thus, there is an unmet need for new approaches to stop the 
uncontrolled growth of cancer cells in patients whose tumors have progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_664146] (Section 2.1).
1.2.1. Mechanism of Action of ERK Inhibitors
ERK1/2 are ubiquitously expressed protein serine/threonine kinases that comprise a key 
component of the MAPK signaling pathway) (Figure 1). The MAPK signaling pathway regulates 
a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, cell survival, and proliferation. 
The pathway responds to the extracellular stimulation of cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs). Upon activation of RTKs, the rat sarcoma virus (RAS) guanosine-5'-triphosphate 
enzymes (GTPases) (Kirsten RAS [KRAS], neuroblastoma RAS [NRAS], and Harvey RAS 
[HRAS]) are converted from an inactive GDP-bound state to an active GTP-bound state. 
Activated RAS promotes the activation of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11907] (RAF) kinases (A 
isoform of RAF [ARAF], B isoform of RAF [BRAF], and C isoform of RAF [CRAF]), which, in 
turn, phosphorylate and activate the dual-specificity mitogen-activated extracellular signal-
regulated kinases (MEKs) MEK1/2. Subsequently, MEK phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2,

Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 23which, upon activation, phosphorylate multiple nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates including 
ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), which promotes cell proliferation and survival, and multiple 
transcription factors that promote cell proliferation and differentiation (Roskoski 2012; Anjum 
and Blenis 2008; Murphy et al 2002 ; Figure 1). 
ERK is commonly upregulated in cancer, as a result of activating mutations within upstream 
components of the MAPK pathway, such as RAS and RAF. Activating RAS mutations are 
contained in 30% of human cancers (Roberts and Der 2007). KRAS mutations are particularly 
prevalent in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) (Neuzillet et al 2014; Prior et al 2012). NRAS and HRAS mutations have high 
prevalence in melanoma and bladder cancer, respectively (Prior et al 2012). BRAFV600E is the 
most common activating BRAF mutation and is found in melanoma, CRC, and NSCLC 
(Neuzillet et al 2014; Wan et al 2004).
Two distinct classes of ERK inhibitor have been described to date (Blake et al 2016; Morris et al 
2013). Both classes directly inhibit the kinase activity of ERK. In addition, the second class also 
prevents the phosphorylation of ERK itself. Two examples of the first class of ERK inhibitor 
(which solely inhibit the phosphorylation of downstream ERK substrates) have been tested 
clinically and have shown some preliminary clinical activity in MAPK-activated cancers; namely 
ulixertinib (BVD-523) and GDC-0994 ( Sullivan et al 2018; Li et al presentation 2017; Varga et 
al 2020; Infante e
t al abstract 2015; Infante et al presentation 2015). SCH772984 is an example 
of the second class of ERK inhibitor, which, in addition to inhibiting ERK kinase activity, also 
prevents the phosphorylation of ERK (Morris et al 2013 ). ASTX029 belongs to this second class 
of ERK inhibitor and is able to modulate the phosphorylation of ERK as well as directly inhibit 
kinase activity (as presented in the current ASTX029 Investigator Brochure [IB] Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
An ERK inhibitor with this profile (dual mechanism of MAPK pathway inhibition) may prove to 
be more efficacious than the first class of ERK inhibitor in tumors driven by [CONTACT_64142], which 
provides the rationale for clinically testing ASTX029 in this study.

Source: Adapted from Lito et al [ADDRESS_896990] has been clinically validated by [CONTACT_664189] (eg, 
vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (eg, trametinib and cobimetinib) 
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/). These agents elicit profound antitumor 
responses in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma patients, although responses are often short-lived, due 
to the onset of acquired drug resistance (Flaherty et al 2012; Hauschild et al 2012; Little et al 
2012; Chapman et al 2011; Solit and Rosen 2011). A common feature of RAF or MEK inhibitor 
resistance mechanisms is the reactivation of ERK signaling, which drives proliferation and 
survival of the cells, even in the presence of BRAF and MEK inhibitors (Little et al 2012; Wagle 
et al 2011; Nazarian et al 2010; Emery et al 2009).

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 25As ERK is the primary downstream effector of the MAPK pathway, it is hypothesized that ERK 
inhibitors may prove to be less susceptible to oncogenic by[CONTACT_664190], therefore, have the potential to improve clinical outcomes in these patient populations 
(Nissan et al 2013).
Several ERK inhibitors have recently entered clinical development, although none have gained 
regulatory approval yet. ERK inhibitors in clinical development include GDC-0994 (Genentech; 
oral route), ulixertinib (BioMed Valley; oral route), LY3214996 (Eli Lilly; oral route) CC-[ZIP_CODE] 
(Celgene; oral route) LTT462 ([COMPANY_001]; oral route), KO-947 (Kura Oncology; intravenous [IV] 
route) and MK-8353 ([COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme Corp; oral route) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). 
Notably, in the Phase 1 study of GDC-0994 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), partial responses were 
observed in 2 subjects with BRAF mutant CRC (Varga et al 2020). Responses were also 
observed in subjects with BRAF and NRAS mutations enrolled in a Phase 1-2 study of 
ulixertinib ( Sullivan et al 2018; Li et al presentation 2017; Infante et al abstract 2015; Infante et 
al presentation 2015
). 
ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule that was developed using fragment-based drug discovery 
platform. Unlike most ERK inhibitors currently in the clinic, ASTX029 both prevents the 
phosphorylation of ERK and directly inhibits ERK kinase activity, which is expected to produce 
a more effective blocking of the MAPK pathway. Please refer to the current ASTX029 IB

[IP_ADDRESS]. Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion Studies and Nonclinical 
Pharmacokinetics
ASTX029 in vitro ADME properties were evaluated in mouse, rat, dog, non-human primate, and 
human studies, and in vivo PK properties were evaluated in mouse, rat, and dog studies. 
ASTX029 was moderately permeable in Caco-2 cell monolayer model and displayed efflux that 
was not inhibited with a p-glycoprotein inhibitor. ASTX029 showed very high plasma protein 
binding across species (≥99.4%) and was highly bound to human serum albumin (≥98.5%). 
However, ASTX029 did not appear to bind to human red blood cells. Intrinsic clearance of 
ASTX029 in hepatic microsomes was low (dog) to moderate (mouse, rat, and human) across 
species, but was high in the non-human primate. In hepatic microsomes, 4 metabolites of 
ASTX029 were detected across the 5 species. ASTX029 underwent oxidation of the 
tetrahydropyran (THP) ring and O-demethylation of the methoxyphenyl group to the O-
desmethyl metabolite (AT37200). The O-desmethyl metabolite was detectable in all species. The 
in vivo metabolite profile in the rat was similar to that defined in vitro.
ASTX029 was a CYP3A4 substrate in expressed human CYPs and human liver microsomes 
demonstrating concentration dependent clearance in both test systems. The inhibition of the 
metabolism of ASTX029 by [CONTACT_664191]3A4 mediated. In human liver microsomes, ASTX029 was a weak to moderate 
inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism, which was substrate dependent. The inhibition of CYP3A4 
increased after a pre-incubation step, indicating time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Weak 
inhibition of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 by [CONTACT_664192]029 was also observed in human liver 
microsomes.
In a preliminary assessment of transporter interactions, ASTX029 showed moderate inhibition of 
probe substrate uptake by [CONTACT_448662]1B1 and weak inhibitory action on uptake of a bile salt export 
pump (BSEP) substrate.
ASTX029 administered via the IV route in mouse, rat, and dog exhibited a low clearance of 
≤25% of liver blood flow across species, with the dog showing the lowest clearance. The volume 
of distribution at steady state (V ss) was low for all species, which is consistent with the very high 
plasma protein binding observed across species. ASTX029 had a short half-life in all species 
following IV administration. Following oral administration, ASTX029 was bioavailable in all 
species with the highest bioavailability being achieved in the dog. There was evidence of pre-
systemic metabolism and low bioavailability in rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Separate studies 
showed there was a supra-proportional relationship between dose and exposure in rats at oral 
doses of 1 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg. Evaluation of the elimination routes of ASTX029 in the rat 
showed that 10% of an IV dose was excreted in the bile, with minimal renal elimination. These 
results indicate that the primary mechanism of clearance is likely via metabolism. 
In general, dose proportional PK were observed in mice for oral doses between 50 and 
150 mg/kg. Furthermore, the PK showed no accumulation on repeat administration. 
ASTX029 distributed into tumor xenografts with a plasma to tumor ratio of 0.3 to 0.5. The 
higher plasma concentrations compared to tumor concentrations are likely due to very high 
plasma protein binding of ASTX029. Evaluation of ASTX029 in multiple studies where

of ASTX029 were variable.
Determination of the plasma concentrations in dogs following oral administration of ASTX029 
in formulations consisting of d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS), 
ethanol, and propylene glycol in different ratios showed that the presence of TPGS was 
important for achieving good exposure. The optimal formulation for maximum exposure was 
determined to be 80% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol, and 10% TPGS.
The ASTX029 spray-dried dispersion (SDD)-based tablet (“tablet”) formulation, the SDD 
formulation (suspension), and the powder-in-bottle (PiB) formulation were administered to 
cynomolgus monkeys at a single dose of 20 mg/kg to compare the overall systemic exposures. 
Systemic exposures, as measured by [CONTACT_664193]-time curve from time [ADDRESS_896991] data point (AUC last), were comparable between the tablet and the SDD suspension, 
whereas exposure was 2-fold higher following tablet administration compared to following PiB 
administration, although variability was also higher for SDD-based forms. Please refer to the 
current ASTX029 IB for more information.
Food-effect studies were recently conducted in monkeys and dogs following a single dose of 
ASTX029 tablets at 10 mg/kg or 2 mg/kg, respectively. In [ADDRESS_896992] studies demonstrate increased 
ASTX029 exposures in monkeys (~3.8- to ~4.3-fold) and dogs (~5.6-fold) fol lowing fasted-state 
dosing compared to fed-state dosing. Based on these findings, food may have a negative effect 
on the exposure of ASTX029 in humans.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies
In vitro studies with ASTX029 have shown that the compound inhibits ERK2 and ERK1 
catalytic kinase activity with nanomolar potency (2.7 nM and ~3 nM, respectively). The 
inhibition of ERK kinase activity has been demonstrated in cancer cells and in vivo models by 
[CONTACT_664194]029 on the phosphorylation levels of the ERK substrate RSK. 
Furthermore, experiments with isolated enzymes and cell-based assays confirmed that ASTX029 
prevents the phosphorylation of ERK by [CONTACT_664195].
Cellular studies have shown that ASTX029 inhibits proliferation in a wide variety of 
MAPK-activated tumor cell lines derived from multiple tumor types. In vivo, oral administration 
of ASTX029, over a range of doses, confers antitumor activity in a number of tumor cell line 
xenograft models with MAPK pathway activation (BRAF-mutant melanoma and CRC, 
KRAS-mutant lung cancer and CRC, and NRAS-mutant melanoma); tumor regression was 
achieved in several of these models. Please refer to the ASTX029 IB for a more detailed 
description.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Pharmacology
ASTX029 was tested for inhibition of the hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) ion channel 
using an automated patch clamp and a manual patch clamp assay and was shown to inhibit hERG 
channel with a half-maximal inhibition (IC 50) concentration of 11 µM. As ASTX029 is highly

approach these levels. No QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) prolongation was observed in 
the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) in vivo acute cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in 
dogs, in which ASTX029 was administered to telemetered dogs at doses up to 30 mg/kg. No 
relevant effects were noted on arterial blood pressure, heart rate, core body temperature, or lead 
II electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals at any dose level. A higher incidence of second degree 
atrioventricular (AV) block was noted in 1 animal after a 30 mg/kg dose. This may have been 
due to a higher background incidence of arrhythmia in this animal compared to the other animals 
in the study, but this could not be confirmed as this dog did not receive vehicle control or any 
lower doses. Therefore, an association with ASTX029 cannot be completely ruled out at this 
time.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology Studies
The initiation of the FIH study of ASTX029 (also known as AT35029) is supported by 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_664147]. ASTX029 refers to any form of AT35029, AT35029X refers to the free 
base form, and AT35029W is the monohydrate. These studies used oral twice a day (BID) and 
daily (QD) dosing with ASTX029 for 28 days (followed by a 2-week recovery) in rats and dogs 
and are intended to support the initial clinical regimen to be investigated in late-stage cancer 
patients. Earlier, non-GLP, studies in both species were conducted to enable the design for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_664148]. The toxicology program for ASTX029 followed ICH and FDA Guidance S9 
Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, dated March 2010 (FDA S9 2010), ICH 
and FDA Guidance M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials 
and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals, dated January 2010 (FDA M3(R2) 2010), and 
FDA Guidance Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and 
Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals Questions and Answers (R2), dated March 2013 
(FDA 2013).
As the intende
d initial clinical population consists of patients with advanced cancer, in 
accordance with the ICH Tripartite S9 guidance (FDA S9 2010), certain toxicology studies, such 
as stand-alone neurobehavioral, respi[INVESTIGATOR_664149], and genotoxicity studies with 
ASTX029 have not yet been conducted. A GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in 
dogs has been completed and is included in the Safety Pharmacology section above 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
In rats, repeat-dose toxicity of ASTX029 was evaluated first in 3 dose-range finding (DRF) 
studies of 14-days duration using BID and QD dosing, followed by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 28-day GLP study 
with continuous QD dosing for 28 days (followed by a 2-week recovery period). In the initial 
BID DRF study in male rats, doses above 60 mg/kg/day (30 mg/kg BID) were not tolerated, 
leading to severe body weight loss and early termination. Subsequent studies were conducted 
using QD dosing, based on efficacy data indicating that QD dosing is adequate. The DRF studies 
using either BID or QD dosing consistently showed that dose levels above 60 mg/kg/day were 
not tolerated in either male or female rats. Key findings across all DRF studies were reproducible 
and were consistent with the known class effects of inhibitors of the MAPK pathway (Diaz et al 
2012; Yanochko et al 2013). Changes in hematology (indicative of anemia and/or inflammation) 
and clinical chemistry parameters (indicating changes in liver and kidney function) were seen, 
including changes in serum phosphate levels.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 29Histopathological changes at 60 mg/kg/day included mineralization of the aorta and stomach 
(glandular portion) and other effects in the colon/cecum and lymph nodes. The mineralization 
seen is likely to be related to the pharmacology of ASTX029. Widespread mineralization 
affecting the stomach, kidney, colon, and arteries has been described to be related to MEK 
inhibition through FGF-23 signal blockade ( Diaz 2012; Yanochko et al 2013). The resulting 
increased levels of the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and, in turn, of Ca 
and P are considered the cause of metastatic calcification (Diaz 2012; Yanochko et al 2013). 
Although no changes in serum Ca and P were seen in the GLP study in rats, they were seen in 
the preceding DRF studies, and changes in these cations are considered relevant to the proposed 
pathogenesis of soft tissue calcification seen in this study. Based on the DRF studies, high doses 
of 60 mg/kg/day for males and 50 mg/kg/day for females were selected as the top doses for GLP 
studies to account for the gender difference in exposure and sensitivity. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_664150], ASTX029 administered orally to male and female Sprague Dawley 
rats QD for 28 consecutive days at 0, 6, 18, 50 (females), or 60 (males) mg/kg/day caused 
morbidity and severe clinical signs including scabs and body weight loss at the high dose of 
50 mg/kg/day in females with [ADDRESS_896993] of the group were either euthanized on Day 22 or assigned to the recovery group with no 
further doses administered. In males given 60 mg/kg/day, 2/15 males were also euthanized on 
Day 22 in poor condition, showing decreased body weight. At the high dose, which was clearly 
above tolerated level for the duration of this study, histopathology changes were present in 
multiple organs with the changes being grouped into soft tissue mineralization affecting the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, arterial system throughout, and the kidneys; degenerative ulcerative 
changes in the tongue and GI tract; bone and marrow changes due to infection and remodeling as 
a consequence of altered mineral homeostasis; and degenerative changes in the liver in the form 
of necrosis and inflammation. Hepatic periportal hypertrophy was also present. 
Changes in hematology (indicative of anemia and inflammation) and clinical chemistry 
parameters (liver and kidney function parameters) were consistent with those seen in the DRF 
studies in rats given the high dose. Microscopic findings in the high dose (above levels of 
tolerability) animals were extensive and severe, with a number of target organs being identified 
that included the aorta, stomach, and colon/cecum (as seen previously in the DRF studies), plus 
skin, bone, liver, and kidney. At the intermediate dose of 18 mg/kg/day, minimal changes in 
hematology and clinical chemistry parameters were seen, all of which were consistent with those 
seen in DRF studies and recovered by [CONTACT_664196]-free period. Microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the 
only target organ in rats given 18 mg/kg/day was the skin, with lesions, seen only in females at 
this dose, that did not fully recover by [CONTACT_2671] 2-week treatment-free period. Based on the 
severity of the skin lesions in females given 18 mg/kg/day and the lack of findings in males, the 
no-observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 18 mg/kg/day, with systemic 
exposures on Day 28 in males of maximum concentration (C max) 138 ng/mL and area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from the start of dosing (0) to the last quantifiable time point (t) 
(AUC 0-t) 1,860 ng•h/mL and in females of C max 3,340 ng/mL and AUC 0-t of 14,700 ng•h/mL. 
Given the difference in sensitivity between males and females at doses 18 mg/kg/day and above, 
the severely toxic dose in 10% of the animals (STD 10) (defined as the highest dose level that 
does not produce evidence of lethality, life-threatening toxicities, or irreversible findings) was 
considered to be above 18 but below 50/60 mg/kg/day. The exposure ratios for C max and AUC 0-t 
were 0.01 and 0.14 for male rats and 0.25 and 1.13 for female rats, respectively, relative to

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 30average exposures from the lowest dose tested (25 mg/kg) and shown to be efficacious in 
xenograft mouse studies (Colo205). 
In dogs, repeat-dose toxicity was first evaluated in a DRF study of 14 day’s duration using QD 
dosing, followed by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 28-day GLP study using continuous QD dosing (plus a 2-week 
recovery period). In the DRF study, morbidity/early terminations occurred at the highest dose 
tested (16 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively, in male and female dogs) manifested by [CONTACT_664197], suggesting males to be more sensitive to the toxic effects 
of ASTX029, albeit with limited number of animals (1 per dose) evaluated. This was reflected in 
the higher systemic exposures achieved in males versus females for a given dose. Key findings 
were changes in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters consistent with those seen in 
studies with rats. Macroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], findings were seen in the gastric mucosa of the stomach. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was considered to be ≥12 mg/kg/day in this study, but given the 
longer duration of the GLP study, the high dose of 10 mg/kg/day was selected for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 
4-week toxicology study. In the DRF study, the dose level of 12 mg/kg/day in the male dog was 
associated with C max and AUC 0-t values of 32,400 ng/mL and 120,000 ng•h/mL, respectively, on 
Day 14. For the female dog receiving 16 mg/kg/day, the C max and AUC 0-t values on Day 14 were 
24,200 ng/mL and 66,800 ng.hr/mL, respectively.
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_664151], dose levels were 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 10 mg/kg. One male at the mid-
dose of 3.5 mg/kg/day was euthanized early on Day [ADDRESS_896994] dose of 10 mg/kg/day. In animals surviving to scheduled termination, key findings 
included changes in hematology parameters consistent with anemia and inflammation, changes 
in coagulation parameters (increased fibrinogen), and minimal changes in clinical chemistry 
(decreased albumin at ≥1.5 mg/kg/day and total protein at 10 mg/kg/day). The ECG 
measurements revealed incidence of second degree AV block in 1 female and premature 
ventricular complex in another female dog given 10 mg/kg/day on scheduled measurement on 
Day 23. A second measurement taken on Day 29 showed the same findings (but in reverse with 
respect to the 2 animals affected). These animals were retained for further measurements at the 
end of the recovery period and showed no findings. In this study, the period of recording was 
short (1 to 2 minutes), and these arrhythmias are also reported to be common background 
findings in beagle dogs (Cools et al 2011; Tilley 1992). The incidences of arrhythmias observed 
in this study with ASTX029 were within ranges reported in normal dogs. Of note, dogs have 
high cardiac vagal tone compared to humans and sinus arrhythmia and sinus pauses can be quite 
pronounced in normal dogs (Cools et al 2011). Second degree AV block is also found in normal 
animals and is often associated with sinus arrhythmia and high vagal tone (Cools et al 2011). The 
potential for ASTX029-related cardiac arrhythmia was further investigated in a dedicated 
standalone GLP cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in dogs, in which some evidence for 
this was seen, with 1 dog showing high incidence of arrhythmias at the high dose (30 mg/kg. 
However, this animal did not receive other doses or vehicle treatment in the study and, as such, 
although a clear relationship to study treatment could not be conclusively established, based on 
available evidence from both studies, a relationship to ASTX029 could not be completely ruled 
out since they were only observed in animals in the high dose group.

Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 31In the dog pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], ASTX029-related microscopic findings were present in the esophagus 
and spleen. In 1 female dog, given 10 mg/kg/day, inflammation and ulceration were seen in the 
esophagus, which may have correlated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_664152] 17 and 18 in 
this animal and were considered adverse due to the severity. In addition, extramedullary 
hematopoiesis was observed in both sexes at 10 mg/kg/day and correlated with changes in 
hematology parameters indicative of anemia. This change was considered to be a physiological 
response to the anemia and, therefore, was considered nonadverse. Overall, based on the 
nontolerability seen at 3.5 mg/kg/day in [ADDRESS_896995] non-severely toxic dose 
(HNSTD) was considered to be 1.5 mg/kg/day, which also coincided with the NOAEL for this 
study. The exposure ratios for C max and AUC 0-t were 0.[ADDRESS_896996] dose tested 
(25 mg/kg) and shown to be efficacious in xenograft mouse studies (Colo205).
Although the toxicities seen and target organs identified at the NOAEL dose in rats (mid-dose 
level, skin) and HNSTD/NOAEL in dogs (low-dose level, GI tract), these dose levels in these 
species were toxicologically meaningful as they produced toxicities that have been seen with 
compounds in this class. More severe toxicities observed at higher dose levels that were above 
tolerability are likely also explained by [CONTACT_664198]. 
With the exception of the 1 dog at the intermediate dose (3.5 mg/kg) level that terminated early 
due to severe clinical signs explained by [CONTACT_664199], other findings in the dog study 
were minimal including those in animals from the high-dose level, and were fully recovered 
following the 2-week treatment-free period. However, in rats, the high dose (60 mg/kg in males 
or 50 mg/kg in females) was clearly not tolerated due to a multitude of target organs being 
affected due to exaggerated pharmacology as well as secondary infections due to severe skin 
lesions. 
Data from a bacterial reverse mutation test in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli 
(“Ames test”), an in vivo mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test in the mouse, an in vitro 
chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes reveal no evidence of 
genotoxicity. 
In conclusion, the main findings in toxicity evaluation studies in both species tested were 
consistent with the expected pharmacological action of ASTX029 (ie, findings in bone, soft 
tissue mineralization, skin lesions, and ulceration of the GI tract). Other findings, such as 
minimal effects on liver function with no associated histopathology correlates, may be due to the 
chemical toxicity of ASTX029. For an ERK inhibitor, tissue mineralization is a known class 
effect relating to perturbation of phosphate handling linked to vitamin D levels and FGF-23 
inhibition (Diaz et al 2012; Yanochko et al 2013). In addition, delayed skin lesions (rash) have 
also been seen clinically with ERK and MEK inhibitors (Sullivan et al 2018; Li et al presentation 
2017; Varga et al 2020; MacDonald et al 2015; Manousaridis et al 2013). Since the lower (in 
terms of human equivalent
 dose) NOAEL (and the HNSTD) was seen in the dog, this species is 
considered more sensitive than the rat to the toxicity of ASTX029 based on dose alone. 
However, considering the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_664153], the distinction of the dog as the more sensitive species is tentative. In 
addition, some key findings in the rats (tissue mineralization, skin lesions), which are consistent 
with known class effects of MAPK pathway inhibitors, can be considered relevant to the clinic.

clinical trial.
1.3.3. Clinical Data and Human Pharmacokinetics
This is an FIH study for ASTX029. For current data, please refer to the ASTX029 IB.
1.4. Summary of Data for Other Study Treatment 
This is a clinical study of ASTX029 as a single agent (monotherapy). No active control 
treatments are planned.
1.5. Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
The MAPK pathway is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and survival. Somatic alterations 
in MAPK pathway components that deregulate the pathway are highly prevalent in human 
cancer (Santarpia et al 2012; Kim and Choi 2010; Dhillon et al 2010; Roberts and Der 2007). 
Agents targeting the MAPK pathway (eg, BRAF and MEK inhibitors) have demonstrated 
clinical efficacy and have attained regulatory approval for BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma 
(Bollag et al 2012) and BRAF mutated NSCLC (FDA 2017 ). Re cently, several ERK inhibitors 
have entered clinical testing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/); however, none have yet attained 
regulatory approval.
In the FIH Phase 1-2 trial of the ERK inhibitor ulixertinib at oral doses up to 900 mg 
administered twice a day (BID), treatment-related dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) included Grade 
3 rash, Grade 3 pruritus, Grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation, Grade 3 and Grade 
2 diarrhea, Grade 3 vomiting, Grade 3 dehydration, Grade 3 elevated creatinine, and Grade 2 
hypotension. At the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 600 mg BID, ulixertinib was 
commonly associated with cutaneous adverse events (AEs) (rash, pruritus, dermatitis acneiform, 
and dry skin), GI AEs (diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), decreased appetite, fatigue, and 
peripheral edema (Sullivan et al 2018; Li et al presentation 2017; Infante et al abstract 2015; 
Infante et al presentation 2015), with 32% of subjects requiring dose reductions. One event each 
of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and cardiac failure and [ADDRESS_896997] 21 days of a 28-day cycle, was associated with rash, diarrhea, visual 
disturbances, and asymptomatic LVEF decrease. At the RP2D of 400 mg, GDC-0994 was 
commonly associated with cutaneous AEs (rash, dry skin, and dermatitis acneiform); GI AEs 
(diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting), decreased appetite, fatigue, visual disturbances (blurred vision) 
and peripheral and periorbital edema (Varga et al 2020). Responses were observed in [ADDRESS_896998] (IMP), subjects may experience reactions or complications that are unknown 
and, therefore, unpredictable. Risks to subjects participating in this first evaluation of ASTX029 
in a human clinical trial include the potential for adverse reactions. Due to its mechanism of

Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 33action, ASTX029 may have a toxicity profile similar to that of other ERK inhibitors in clinical 
development with the main findings in toxicity evaluation studies in both species tested being 
consistent with the expected pharmacological action of ASTX029, ie, findings in bone, soft 
tissue mineralization, skin lesions, and ulceration of the GI tract, and the main findings at the 
STD 10/NOAEL dose in rats and HNSTD dose in dogs being skin lesions (rats), GI lesions (dogs), 
and potential arrhythmias based on unconfirmed evidence from studies in dogs at higher doses 
(ASTX029 IB).
The potential for these AEs warrants frequent monitoring of subjects participating in this 
Phase 1-2 study of ASTX029 until the safety profile is further understood. In particular, clinical 
signs and/or symptoms of skin, ocular, GI, and liver toxicities and LVEF decrease (see 
Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix 6, Appendix 7, and Appendix 8, respectively) as well as 
hematology and clinical chemistry parameters will be closely monitored during clinical studies 
that employ ASTX029.
These and other risks of ASTX029 in humans are described further in Section 8, 
Risks/Precautions. For more detailed information, please refer to the ASTX029 IB.

2.1. Rationale for the Study
The MAPK pathway is a key regulator of cellular proliferation and survival. Somatic alterations 
in MAPK pathway components that deregulate the pathway are highly prevalent in human 
cancer (Dhillon et al 2007; Roberts and Der 2007). Activation of the ERK pathway in tumors can 
result from mutations in RAS genes (KRAS, NRAS, HRAS), mutations in BRAF and MEK, or 
activation of RAS by [CONTACT_614179] (Nissan et al 2013 ).
The primary objectives of the Phase 1 portion of this study are to assess safety and to identify the 
MTD, the RP2D, and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally. 
The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of this study is to assess preliminary clinical 
activity, as determined by [CONTACT_20363] (ORR) in tumors characterized by [CONTACT_664200]029. 
2.2. Rationale for ASTX029 Dose and Regimen and Justification of the 
Starting Dose
The starting dose for the FIH trial in cancer patients is proposed using available nonclinical data, 
following ICH and FDA Guidance S9 Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, 
dated March 2010 (FDA S9 2010), and using dose conversions in accordance with FDA 
Guidance Estimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics 
in Adult Healthy Volunteers, dated July 2005 (FDA 2005), using data from GLP studies in the rat 
and dog. As dose levels slightly above the NOAEL are possibly in the low end of the range of 
STD 10 for rats as a conservative estimate, the NOAEL of 18 mg/kg derived from 28-day 
continuous daily dosing in rats corresponds to the human equivalent dose (HED) of 108 mg/m2, 
which, converted to a fixed dose based on an average body surface area (BSA) of 1.7 m2 and 
applying a 1/10th safety factor adjustment, suggests a starting human dose of 18.36 mg. The 
1.5 mg/kg NOAEL/HNSTD dose from the dog GLP study corresponds to an HED of 30 mg/ m2 
and translates to approximately 8.5 mg fixed dose based on BSA conversion and applying a 1/6th 
adjustment (Table 1). 
Table 1: Proposed Human Starting Dose
HED, mg/m2Implied Starting Dose, 
mgaProposed Starting Dose, 
mg (Fixed)
Rat NOAEL, 18 mg/kg 108 18.36
Dog NOAEL/HNSTD, 1.5 mg/kg 30 8.510
BSA=body surface area; HED=human equivalent dose; HNSTD=highest non-severely toxic dose; NOAEL=no-observable 
adverse effect level.
aBased on average human BSA of 1.70 m2 and applying a safety factor of 1/10 for STD 10 and 1/6 for HNSTD (per ICH S9 
[FDA S9 2010]).
In view of the variability in the toxicokinetic data in the 28-day GLP studies and the overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_664155], a fixed dose of 10 mg is proposed 
for the starting dose in FIH clinical trials in cancer patients (ie, an intermediate dose between the 
implied starting doses calculated using dog and rat data but, conservatively, closer to the low end 
of the range).

Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 35ASTX029 has been shown to be efficacious in immunocompromised mouse xenograft models. 
At the lowest dose tested of 25 mg/kg (Colo205) systemic exposures as measured by C max and 
AUC last in the range of 9,618 to 16,880 ng/mL and 8,553 to 17,490 ng•h/mL, respectively, 
produced significant tumor growth inhibition as well as maximum inhibition of the RSK 
pharmacodynamic biomarker. The averages of these exposure values, 13,249 ng/mL for C max and 
13,022 ng•h/mL for the AUC last, were used for exposure comparisons with toxicokinetic data 
from toxicology studies. However, in xenograft studies following oral administration at 
25 mg/kg, ASTX029 caused near maximal inhibition of the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 
kinase (RSK) in Colo205 tumors and, on repeat administration, produced significant tumor 
growth inhibition. Therefore, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) is also 
anticipated at lower doses and lower exposures (AUC) of ASTX029.
The proposed clinical starting dose of 10 mg is less than 1/50th of projected human dose of 
[ADDRESS_896999] a narrow therapeutic window when 
given continuously; therefore, an intermittent regimen (2 weeks on/1 week off) may also be 
tested in this FIH study. The regimen may be further adjusted (eg, 1 week on/1 week off) based 
on emerging clinical data and DSRC recommendations.
The rationale for the RP2D and regimen is discussed in Section 7.3.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 394.1.1. Phase [ADDRESS_897004] of Parts A and B as follows:
Part A (Dose Escalation): The dose-escalation stage will identify the MTD of up to 2 dosing 
regimens of ASTX029 and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE), defined as either the 
MTD or a dose below the MTD that the DSRC agrees shows adequate safety, PK, and/or 
preliminary biological or clinical activity.
Subjects will receive 1 of up to potentially 2 ASTX029 dosing regimens. Subjects in Regimen 1 
will receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 21 of each 21-day cycle (Regimen 1; 
continuous dosing), and, if Regimen 2 is opened to enrollment, subjects in Regimen 2 will 
receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-day cycle (Regimen 2; 
intermittent dosing, 2 weeks on/1 week off).
Initially, subjects will be allocated to Regimen 1 (continuous dosing). Subjects in the first cohort 
of Regimen 1 will receive a flat starting dose of 10 mg QD. Dose levels for subsequent cohorts 
will be determined by [CONTACT_664186]. Planned initial escalation will be 100% (doubling the dose) 
until 160 mg. Smaller increments of dose escalation will be used above 160 mg. Dose doubling 
will also be discontinued if any 1 of the following occurs within a cohort:
[ADDRESS_897005] experiences a DLT (Section 7.4).
Any study-drug-related clinically significant ≥Grade 2 AE not adequately managed or 
resolved to baseline or Grade 1 by [CONTACT_664180], per the DSRC, indicates 
further dose doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
Any study-drug-related AE or confluence of AEs that, per the DSRC, indicates 
further dose doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
After this point, dose escalation will then proceed in smaller increments (eg, by a 50% increase 
initially and an ~25% increase at the higher dose levels over the previous level) (Section 7.1.4) 
after review of all available safety, PK, and biomarker data from Cycle [ADDRESS_897006] an alternative intermittent regimen (Optional Regimen 3, eg, 7 days on/7 days off) and 
will recommend the dose and dosing regimen to be used. The total dose per cycle for the new 
regimen will not exceed the total safe dose per cycle already established in the first 2 regimens. 
Dose levels and dosing regimens, the number of cohorts, and the number of subjects per cohort 
may be modified, as needed, in response to emerging data and recommendations from the 
DSRC.

least 3 evaluable subjects each with additional allowed expansion to 6 subjects (standard 3+3 
study design) (Section 7.3) until the MTD is determined for each regimen. 
Dose-escalation/de-escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs (defined in 
Section 7.4) during the first 21-day cycle of each dose level, and the recommendations of the 
DSRC following review of all available safety, PK, and biomarker data from the completed first 
cycle of at least 3 subjects in each cohort (as described in Section 7.3). The DSRC will also 
advise whether or not it is appropriate to proceed to Part B (Dose Expansion). 
Part B (Dose Expansion) will commence upon identification of the RDE for at least 1 regimen. 
The DSRC RDE decision will be based on all available safety, PK, biomarkers, and preliminary 
activity data from all cycles (including the potential for late or cumulative toxicity).
Part B (Dose Expansion): One or more dose levels (and regimens) may be studied in Phase 1 
Part B to supplement available safety, PK, and/or clinical activity data to establish the RP2D and 
to evaluate target engagement in fresh tumor tissue biopsies. Subjects will have to meet the 
following molecular eligibility criteria: documented activating gene mutations in BRAF (BRAF 
V600 mutation or activating atypi[INVESTIGATOR_15385]-V600 aberrations), KRAS, NRAS, or HRAS. The in 
vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical devices used in this study to determine genetic abnormalities are 
appropriately registered for use. A total of 14 evaluable subjects will be treated at each 
dose/regimen selected. If more than 1 dose/regimen is open for enrollment, subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The DSRC will advise when it is appropriate to proceed to Phase 2 
and will recommend the dose level and dosing regimen to be used. The RP2D decision by [CONTACT_664202], pharmacodynamic, safety, and preliminary activity data 
from all cycles (including the potential for late or cumulative toxicity). The RP2D could be the 
same or lower than the RDE. 
4.1.2. Phase [ADDRESS_897007] of the following up to 6 
cohorts:
Cohort A: NRAS-mutant melanoma.
Cohort B: KRAS-mutant or KRAS-amplified NSCLC.
Cohort C: BRAF V600-mutant cancers (non-CRCs).
Cohort D: BRAF-fusion cancers.
Cohort E: Gynecological cancers with alterations in the MAPK pathway.
Cohort F: Tumors characterized by [CONTACT_664203] 2.
Molecular eligibility will be based on the presence of documented gene aberrations in the MAPK 
pathway. The selection of these molecularly defined study populations is based on a 
comprehensive evaluation of ASTX029 nonclinical biology (as presented in the current

will be enrolled into each cohort based on a Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design (Simon 1989) at the 
RP2D and the dosing regimen identified in Phase 1 Parts A and B. If ≥2/10 responses are 
observed in a cohort, it will be expanded to a total of 29 subjects (Stage 2). For Cohort F (which 
will enroll patients with various tumor types and gene aberrations [Table 2]), the sponsor, with 
approval of the DSRC, may expand enrollment for a particular molecularly defined 
subpopulation in which the most number of responses are observed to 10 or 29 subjects under the 
same Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design as for the other cohorts for better assessment of activity in 
that disease subpopulation (Optional Cohort F Expansion). It is expected that no more than 
2 subpopulations will be expanded in this manner.

to evaluate relevant pharmacodynamic markers and target engagement (ie, phosphorylated pRSK 
inhibition) in tumor biopsies; and identify and evaluate potential biomarkers of ASTX029 
activity. This study is open-label, with no placebo or active control group.
The Phase 1 Part A dose-escalation process will be guided by [CONTACT_664206] (see Section 4.4, Section 7.3, and Section 7.4). The starting dose in each regimen 
evaluated will be escalated stepwise in successive cohorts of at least 3 subjects each with 
additional allowed expansion to 6 subjects (3+3 study design) until the MTD is determined for 
each regimen (see Section 4.1.1). 
Phase 1 Dose Expansion (Part B) will commence upon identification of the RDE for at least 
1 regimen. One or more dose levels (and regimens) may be studied in Phase 1 Part B to 
supplement available safety, PK, and/or clinical activity data to establish the RP2D and to 
evaluate target engagement in fresh tumor tissue biopsies. 
The Phase 2 portion of the study will explore the preliminary single-agent antitumor activity of 
ASTX029 at the RP2D of the selected dosing regimen identified in Phase 1 Parts A and B.
At any point, the dose level may be reduced for individual subjects in the event of unacceptable 
treatment-related toxicity (Section 7.5).
Planned dose levels and dosing regimens, the number of cohorts, and the number of subjects per 
cohort may be modified, as needed, in response to emerging data and recommendations from the 
DSRC.

5.4. Treatment Discontinuation and Withdrawal of Subjects
Subjects who discontinue study treatment will be followed up for important study data, as 
described below, unless they withdraw consent from further follow-up.
5.4.1. Discontinuation From Study Treatment
Subjects may permanently discontinue study treatment at any time (note: subjects who 
experience disease progression while receiving ASTX029 should not remain on study 
treatment). Subjects who discontinue study treatment will still continue study follow-up 
procedures until death, or until they withdraw consent or the study is closed. Investigators are 
encouraged to assess all subjects according to the study protocol even after discontinuation from 
study treatment. Possible reasons for discontinuation of study treatment include the following:
Investigators can discontinue subjects from study treatment in case of unacceptable 
toxicity, non-compliance, disease progression requiring alternative therapy, or if the 
investigator determines it is in the subject's best interest. 
The Sponsor may require that a subject is discontinued from treatment for safety 
reasons or for noncompliance. 
In all cases, the reason(s) for discontinuation from study treatment must be recorded in the 
source document and on the relevant page of the subject's electronic case report form (eCRF). 
It is important to obtain protocol-specified follow-up information on any subject discontinued 
from study treatment. For subjects who discontinue study treatment, the investigator should 
review the follow-up procedures with the subject, including the number of visits, the specific 
procedures to be done, and the total length of the follow-up period. If at all possible, subjects 
should undergo all safety and preliminary clinical activity evaluations at the Tx Term visit 
(Section 9.4.13) and the 30-day Safety Follow-up visit (Section 9.4.14). Section [ADDRESS_897017] dose of study treatment (see Section 10.3). 
Subjects who agree to remain enrolled in the study after discontinuing study treatment and 
completing the 30-day Safety Follow-up visit will be contact[CONTACT_664211] [ADDRESS_897018] (see Section 9.4.15).

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 495.4.2. Withdrawal From the Study
Subjects may withdraw consent for the study at any time or subjects may be lost to follow-up. It 
is important to obtain follow-up information, according to standard medical practice, on any 
subject withdrawn prematurely from the study. Every effort must be made to undertake at least 
standard assessments that are critical for clinical activity or safety evaluation, such as disease 
progression (if the subject did not withdraw because of disease progression), subsequent 
anticancer treatment, survival information, and safety data. 
If a subject withdraws consent from the study, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any 
information and data collected or generated up to the time of withdrawal of consent.
Additionally, if a subject withdraws consent, they may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested yet, and the investigator must document this in the site study records and inform 
the sponsor within 24 hours.
5.4.3. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects will be replaced in this study as needed to achieve the planned number of evaluable 
subjects in each part of the protocol. See Section 11.1 for the definition of evaluable subjects.
5.4.4. End of Study
The study will be considered complete (that is, scientific evaluation will be complete [study 
completion]) following evaluation of safety and efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Investigators will continue to follow the Schedule of Activities ( Table 13) for all patients until 
notified by [CONTACT_664212]. 
End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last patient.
5.4.5. Study Extension
Following Study Completion (see above Section 5.4.4), all patients who are on study treatment 
and derivi
ng clinical benefit with no undue risk may continue to receive study treatment in a 
study extension phase or a rollover study until any of the study treatment discontinuation criteria 
(Section 5.4.1) are met.
During study extension, assessments are to be conducted according to the Schedule of Activities 
in Table 13. Data collection will be limited and will include (at a minimum):
Study drug administration
Study drug accountability
AEs
SAEs
Any cases of pregnancy or overdose
Investigators will perform any other standard procedures and tests needed to treat and evaluate 
patients; however, the choice and timing of the tests will be at the investigator’s discretion. The 
Sponsor will not routinely collect the results of these assessments.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 516. ENROLLMENT AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES
Subjects will be screened at each study center for assessment of eligibility for the study. The 
investigator or designated staff will be responsible for allocating and recording subject 
identification numbers. Each subject who signs the informed consent form (ICF) will be assigned 
a unique identification (ID) number that reflects the study center number assigned to the 
investigator and the subject at that site. The same subject ID number will be used to identify the 
subject from screening throughout the study and will be entered on all study documents.
A given subject ID number will not be assigned to more than [ADDRESS_897019]. A centralized allocation procedure will be used. 
See Section 7.3 for the dose-escalation guidelines.
6.1. Randomization
This is an open label study. All enrolled subjects will receive ASTX029. In Phase 1 Part A (dose 
escalation), initially, only a single dosing regimen (Regimen 1) will be evaluated. Following the 
occurrence of event(s) meeting prespecified criteria (Section 7.1.4), a second dosing regimen 
(Regimen 2) may be activated. If the second dosing regimen becomes active, subjects will be 
assigned following a simple randomization procedure (eg, computerized random numbers) to 
Regimen 1 (continuous dosing) or Regimen 2 (intermittent dosing).
When only a single regimen is active (eg, the cohort for 1 regimen has completed enrollment, or 
is on hold), randomization will be suspended, and all subjects will be allocated to the active 
regimen.
In Phase 1 Part B, if more than 1 dose/regimen is selected, subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_897020] is identified (ie, meets all eligibility criteria), site staff will confirm the 
subject’s eligibility in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system. The IRT system will 
automatically enroll/randomize the subject to the appropriate treatment regimen/cohort and 
allocate study drug. Details of randomization/enrollment are described in the IRT User Guide.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 537.1.3. ASTX029 Reconstitution 
Tablets are provided in bottles containing [ADDRESS_897021] to permit oral self-administration at the required dose level for the 
required number of days.
Records of the receipt and dispensing of drug will be kept at the study centers and reconciled at 
the end of the study to provide a complete accounting of all used and unused IMP.
7.1.4. ASTX029 Regimens and Dose Levels
In this open-label study, all subjects will receive ASTX029 orally according to the assigned 
treatment regimen and dose. At any point in the study, the dose of ASTX029 may be reduced, 
withheld, or discontinued for individual subjects in the event of unacceptable treatment-related 
toxicity, as described in Section 7.5. No active comparator or placebo is planned for this study.
In Phase 1 Part A, subjects will receive 1 of up to potentially 2 ASTX029 dosing regimens. 
Subjects in Regimen 1 will receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 21 of each 
21-day cycle (Regimen 1; continuous dosing), and, if Regimen 2 is opened to enrollment, 
subjects in Regimen 2 will receive ASTX029 orally once a day on Days 1 through 14 of each 21-
day cycle (Regimen 2; intermittent dosing, 2 weeks on/1 week off).
Initially, subjects will be allocated to Regimen 1 (continuous dosing). Subjects in the first cohort 
of Regimen 1 will receive a flat starting dose of 10 mg QD (Section 2.2). Dose levels for 
subsequent cohorts will be determined by [CONTACT_664186]. Planned initial escalation will be 100% 
(doubling the dose) until 160 mg. Smaller increments of dose escalation will be used above 
160 mg. Dose doubling will also be discontinued if any 1 of the following occurs within a 
cohort:
[ADDRESS_897022] experiences a DLT (Section 7.4).
Any study-drug-related clinically significant ≥Grade 2 AE not adequately managed or 
resolved to baseline or Grade 1 by [CONTACT_664180], per the DSRC, indicates 
further dose doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
Any study-drug-related AE or confluence of AEs that, per the DSRC, indicates 
further dose doubling would be potentially unsafe for future subjects.
After this point, dose escalation will proceed in smaller increments (eg, by a 50% increase 
initially and an ~25% increase at the higher dose levels over the previous level), after review of 
all available safety, PK, and biomarker data from Cycle [ADDRESS_897023] has DLTs in any cohort of 3 or 6 subjects, no further escalation should occur of that 
regimen and exploration of lower dose regimens may be recommended by [CONTACT_664213].
An example of a possible dose-escalation plan is shown in Table 3, and a possible dose 
escalation flowchart is shown in Figure 3.

will recommend the dose and dosing regimen to be used. The total dose per cycle for the new 
regimen will not exceed the total safe dose per cycle already established in the first [ADDRESS_897025] 3 evaluable subjects each with additional allowed expansion to 6 subjects (3+3 study 
design) until the MTD is determined for each regimen.
Dose-escalation/de-escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs (defined in 
Section 7.4) during the first 21-day cycle of each dose level, and the recommendations of the 
DSRC following review of all available safety, PK, and biomarker data from the completed first 
cycle of at least 3 subjects in each cohort (as described in Section 7.3). The DSRC will also 
advise whether or not it is appropriate to proceed to Part B (Dose Expansion).
Part B (Dose Expansion) will commence upon identification of the RDE for at least 1 regimen. 
The DSRC RDE decision will be based on all available safety, PK, biomarkers, and preliminary 
activity data from all cycles (including the potential for late or cumulative toxicity).
At any point, the dose level may be reduced for individual subjects in the event of unacceptable 
treatment-related toxicity (Section 7.5). Planned dose levels, the number of cohorts, and the 
number of subjects per cohort, may be modified as needed, in response to emerging PK and 
safety data, and recommendations from the DSRC.
7.1.5. ASTX029 Administration
Subjects will receive instructions for the storage and self-administration of the IMP by [CONTACT_664214] (also see Section 9.4.11). However, on visit days, subjects will be asked 
to wait until they arrive at the study center and are under the supervision of the study staff before 
they ingest the study drug to ensure accurate recording and timing of blood draws relative to IMP 
ingestion. When subjects self-administer IMP at home, they are expected to record the date and 
time of ingestion in their dosing diary, along with any pertinent notes (eg, vomiting after 
ingestion of the dose). 
If a patient forgets to take or misses a dose, they may take the dose up to 4 hours late. After that 
time, the patient should skip the dose for that day and wait until the next day to resume the 
normal dosing schedule. The VFR of ASTX029 contains ethanol and propylene glycol (Section 
7.1.1). The maximum amount of the alcohol intake from the VFR is estimated to be 3.7 g. (Refer 
to the pharmacy manual for further information.)

Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 56ASTX029 should be ingested at approximately the same time of day on each dosing day, and the 
actual dosing time should be recorded as above. 
Study treatment compliance will be assessed periodically throughout the treatment period. 
Subjects will be required to return all study treatment syringes (used, unused, and partially used) 
and all unused tablets to the study center, and to share their dosing diaries with study staff. 
ASXT029 was originally introduced into the clinic in the PiB form (Section 7.1.1) and 
administered under fed conditions (Section 7.1.5). Protocol Amendment 1.0 introduced the tablet 
dosage form (Section 7.1.6) when it became available. Protocol Amendment 2.0 introduced the 
evaluation of administration under fasted conditions during Phase 1 Part A dose escalation 
(Section 7.1.7).
Drug Administration Under Fed Conditions
Based on available preliminary data and the properties of ASTX029, it was expected that doses 
would be better tolerated and absorbed when consumed with food. Hence, although food-effect 
studies had not yet been conducted with ASTX029, subjects enrolled in the early stages of dose 
escalation were requested to ingest the IMP with food, ie, within [ADDRESS_897026] meals are:
Egg(s), toast (or potatoes), and juice (orange, apple, cranberry, or tomato) or 
coffee/tea.
Bacon (2 strips), toast (or potatoes), and juice (as above) or coffee/tea.
Sausage, toast (or potatoes), and juice (as above) or coffee/tea.
Breakfast sandwich with eggs/sausage/bacon; juice (as above) or coffee/tea.
Other varieties/substitutions can be made as long as the meal provides a similar amount of 
calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat and has comparable meal volume and viscosity. 
Note: grapefruit juice is not allowed during treatment with ASTX029. 
Drug Administration Under Fasted Conditions
Amendment 2.[ADDRESS_897027] for 2 hours after ingestion of study drug. During the 4-hour fasting period, clear liquids (such 
as tea, coffee, and water) are allowed; milk, juice, and soup are not allowed. Note: grapefruit 
juice is not allowed during treatment with ASTX029. Please see Section 7.1.7 for further 
details of transition to fasted administration during Phase 1 Part A.
7.1.6. Transition From Powder-in-Bottle Dosage Form to Tablet Dosage Form
With Protocol Amendment 1.0, the tablet form was introduced and replaced the PiB formulation. 
Transition to the tablet dosage form occurred by [CONTACT_184432] a tablet-bridging cohort of 6 subjects at 
80 mg/day, a dose that did not exceed the highest PiB dose level in Regimen 1 at which no DLTs 
were observed as determined by [CONTACT_664215]-bridging cohort. Because the tablet dose was shown to be safe and no

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 57other issues were identified, dose escalation using the tablet dosage form proceeded in 
subsequent cohorts as described in Section 4.1.1, Table 3, with approval of the DSRC. If the 
tablet dosing form had not bee
n safely tolerated, dose de-escalation could have occurred as 
described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_897028] allowed transition of ongoing subjects still receiving PiB to tablets. At the time of 
Amendment 4.0, all subjects who received ASTX029 PiB had discontinued study drug.
7.1.7. Transition From Fed to Fasted Administration
At the time of Amendment 2.0, dose escalation (Phase 1 Part A) was ongoing. In Phase 1 Part A, 
ASXT029-01 dose was escalated in sequential cohorts from 10 mg/day to 200 mg/day QD using 
the PiB form in fed subjects. One DLT (Grade 3 nonserious maculo-papular rash) was reported 
in the 200-mg/day PiB cohort. Six subjects were enrolled in the tablet-bridging cohort at 
80 mg/day QD under fed conditions with no DLTs being reported, and enrollment was ongoing 
in the 120-mg/day QD tablet cohort. 
Preliminary PK data at the time of Amendment 2.0, showed relatively high variability for 
systemic exposures after ASTX029 was dosed with food. The geometric mean (CV%) plasma 
AUC 0-inf values on C1D1 were 2377(170) ng•h/mL for the 80-mg tablet-bridging cohort (n=4), 
compared with 4053(83) ng•h/mL for the 120 mg PiB (n=5) cohort and 8304(53) ng•h/mL for 
the 200 mg PiB cohort (n=9).
With Protocol Amendment 2.0, administration under fasted conditions was introduced. Fasted 
administration may result in higher exposure of ASTX029 at lower doses (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and 
potentially reduce intersubject variability compared with administration with food. 
Transition to fasted-state dosing occurred during Phase 1 Part A by [CONTACT_184432] a bridging cohort of 
3 subjects at a dose of 40 mg/day tablets QD. Starting with Amendment 3.0, dose escalation 
under fed conditions was discontinued, and dose escalation under fasted conditions is ongoing. 
Please refer to the current ASTX029 IB for preliminary PK and safety data.
7.2. Active Comparator or Placebo
No active comparator or placebo is planned for this study.
7.3. Dose-Escalation Guidelines and Recommended Phase 2 Dose 
Decision
Dose-escalation/de-escalation decisions will be based on the occurrence of DLTs (defined in 
Section 7.4) during the first cycle of each dose level, and the recommendations of the DSRC 
following review of all available safety, PK, and biomarker data from the completed first cycle 
of at least 3 subjects in each cohort (Section 4.4). The DLT-based dose-escalation guidelines are 
summarized below.
Intrasubject escalations will not be allowed; however, once an MTD or RDE dose level is 
determined, active subjects may be allowed to receive their subsequent cycles at that dose level 
at the investigator’s discretion with prior Sponsor approval.

If no subjects among the first 3 (<33%) experience a DLT, the dose may be escalated 
to the next higher level for the next cohort of 3 subjects.
If [ADDRESS_897029] 3 (33%) experiences a DLT, the cohort size will be 
increased to 6 subjects.
If [ADDRESS_897030] 3 (>33%) experience a DLT, the previous dose level (ie, 
1 step below) would be declared the MTD. 
Expanded Cohort of 6 Subjects
If no more than [ADDRESS_897031] in the cohort of 6 (ie, a total of 1 out of 6, <33%) experience 
a DLT, the dose may be cautiously escalated (~25% increase) to the next higher level 
for the next cohort of 3 subjects.
If 2 subjects in the cohort of 6 (33%) experience a DLT, that dose level or the 
previous dose level (ie, 1 step below) would be declared the MTD for the regimen. 
The DSRC may recommend exploration of intermediate doses before an MTD is 
declared.
If more than 2 subjects in the cohort of 6 (>33%) experience a DLT, the previous 
dose level (ie, 1 step below) would be declared the MTD for the regimen. The DSRC 
may recommend exploration of intermediate doses before an MTD is declared.
Recommended Dose for Expansion
The RDE is defined as either the MTD or a dose below the MTD that the DSRC agrees shows 
adequate safety, PK and/or preliminary biological activity, or clinical activity for a regimen. One 
or more dose levels (and regimens) may be studied in Phase 1 Part B to supplement available 
safety, PK, and/or clinical activity data and to evaluate target engagement in fresh tumor tissue 
biopsies. The RDE decision by [CONTACT_664216], PK, biomarkers, 
and preliminary activity data from all cycles (including potential for late or cumulative toxicity) 
from Phase 1 Part A.
Recommended Phase 2 Dose
The RP2D is defined as the dose that the DSRC agree shows adequate safety, PK, 
pharmacodynamic, and/or biological or clinical activity to warrant further investigation in the 
Phase 2 part of this study. The RP2D decision by [CONTACT_664181], 
biomarker, safety, and preliminary clinical activity data from all cycles, including potential for 
late or cumulative toxicity from Phase 1 Parts A and B. The RP2D could be the same or lower 
than the RDE.
Based on the data presented in Section 1.3.3, the DSRC determined the RP2D to be 200 mg 
administered orally daily, continuously, in 21-day cycles under fasting conditions.
7.4. Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicities

7.5. Guidelines for Adjusting, Withholding, or Discontinuing Study 
Treatment
ASTX029 dosing should be withheld in the case of a DLT in Cycle [ADDRESS_897033] qualified as a DLT if it had occurred in Cycle 1. Dosing may resume, at 
the investigator’s discretion, if and when study-treatment-related toxicity has:
Completely resolved or 
Returned to baseline or partially recovered to ≤Grade 2 (anemia, fatigue, malaise, and 
alopecia) or returned to baseline or partially recovered to ≤Grade 1 (all other 
toxicities).
If and when a decision is made to resume dosing, the individual’s dose should be adjusted to the 
previously assessed lower dose level that was considered safe by [CONTACT_664186]. A maximum of 
[ADDRESS_897034] is receiving compelling benefit, the

by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical monitor is required to restart study treatment after an interruption 
≥[ADDRESS_897035] be administered at a dose approved by [CONTACT_1034]’s medical 
monitor when toxicity has resolved as described above.
Suggested guidelines and criteria for adjusting, withholding, or discontinuing study treatment as 
a result of skin toxicities, ocular toxicities, diarrhea, liver toxicities, and LVEF decrease are 
provided in Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix 6, Appendix 7, and Appendix 8, respectively. 
The institutional standards for the management of these toxicities can differ from the suggested 
guidelines. In this case, best clinical judgment should be applied.
7.6. Concomitant Treatment
On the concomitant medication eCRF, document all medications a subject takes starting from 
[ADDRESS_897036] dose of study 
treatment. Include supportive or palliative treatment (see below) whether prescription or 
nonprescription, and medications taken for procedures (eg, biopsy). Include start and stop dates 
and indication. 
7.6.1. Supportive, Prophylactic, or Other Treatments
All subjects receiving treatment with ASTX029 should continue to receive appropriate 
supportive care for the treatment of their cancer, according to the institutional standard practice 
or other established standard of care guidelines. Antiemetics and loperamide may be given to 
alleviate ASTX029-related toxicity on an as-required basis, and GI toxicity should not be 
considered to be dose limiting in the absence of maximal supportive therapy. Subjects receiving 
treatment with a bisphosphonate are not excluded from participating in the trial; bisphosphonate 
therapy may be initiated while maintaining treatment with ASTX029 provided the subject does 
not have disease progression according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_897037] possible area of exposure. ASTX029 treatment should 
be interrupted during radiotherapy and resumed upon completion. 
Any supportive treatment should be documented in the provided eCRFs.
7.6.2. Prohibited Medications and Substances
Other anticancer treatments, including other investigational drugs or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], unless specified 
in the protocol, are prohibited. 
ASTX029 is a substrate and inhibitor of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A). 
Therefore, concomitant administration of drugs known to be strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or 
inducers has the potential to result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with ASTX029. Careful 
consideration should be given to balancing the medical needs of the subject and the potential 
effect on ASTX029 before coadministering a drug that is known to be a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor or inducer. It is strongly recommended that subjects avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
and inducers at ASTX029 dose levels that display clinical effects (toxicity or activity). Particular 
caution should be exercised when coadministering drugs with ASTX029 that are sensitive

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 61CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic windows until the potential liability of ASTX029 for 
DDIs is fully qualified. 
ASTX029 is an inhibitor of the liver uptake transporter OATP1B1. Therefore, concomitant 
administration of drugs known to be OATP1B1 substrates has the potential to result in DDIs 
with ASTX029. Particular caution should be exercised when coadministering drugs with 
ASTX029 that are sensitive OATP1B1 substrates with narrow therapeutic windows until the 
potential for DDIs via inhibition of OATP1B1 is fully understood.
Examples of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers and OATP1B1 substrates and inhibitors may be 
found on the following websites; note that the published lists are not comprehensive. Refer to the 
specific product information for an intended concomitant drug.

Medications known to increase the risk of torsades de pointes should be used with caution. A list 
of such medications is provided at the following website and discussed in Drew et al (2010) , 
https://www.crediblemeds.org/ (Woosley et al 2022). Any AV-nodal blocking medications (ie, 
beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, and digitalis) should be used with 
caution. A list of such medications is provided and discussed in Wooten 2002  and by [CONTACT_664218] 
(Vogler et al 2012).
The VFR of ASTX029 contains etha
nol and propylene glycol (Section 7.1.1). It is advisable to 
review concomitant medications that may interact with VFR ingredients.
Any medication considered necessary for the subject’s safety and well-being may be given at the 
discretion of the investigator(s). However, if a subject requires treatment with a drug known to 
prolong the QT interval while on study and there is no alternative medication, the subject should 
be carefully monitored for potential QT prolongation for at least [ADDRESS_897038] of medications that prolong the QT interval provided in the cited 
references is not exhaustive and there are other medications with a possible or conditional risk of 
causing QT prolongation and/or torsades de pointes. 
Investigators should consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor regarding the potential 
concomitant use of QTc-prolonging agents with a known risk of torsades de pointes while on 
study treatment in individual subjects on a case-by-case basis.
Concomitant St. John’s Wort, grapefruit, and grapefruit juice are also prohibited during 
treatment with ASTX029.
7.7. Overdose Instructions
Record the actual dose of study drug administered in the source document and on the Dosing 
eCRF. Record any adverse clinical signs and symptoms associated with a potential overdose on

Refer to the ASTX029 IB for the most current risks and precautions, as well as a list of potential 
AEs associated with ASTX029 therapy based on nonclinical toxicology studies and clinical 
findings with other investigational agents in this drug class. 
This study represents the first use of ASTX029 in humans, and as with any investigational 
medicinal product (IMP), subjects may experience reactions or complications that are unknown 
and therefore unpredictable. Risks to subjects participating in this first evaluation of ASTX029 in 
a human clinical trial include the potential for adverse reactions. 
Based on nonclinical toxicology studies with this molecule, and clinical findings with other 
investigational agents in this drug class (ERK inhibitors; ie, ulixertinib and GDC-0994) ( Sullivan 
et al 2018; Li et al presentation 2017; Varga et al 2020; Infante et al abstract 2015; Infante et al 
presentation 2015), the ASTX029 mechanism of action may result in cutaneous AEs (eg, rash, 
pruritus, dry skin), GI AEs (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and esophagitis), fatigue, peripheral 
and periorbital edema, LVEF decrease, potential arrhythmias, visual disturbances, and liver 
enzyme elevation.
The potential for these AEs warrants frequent monitoring of subjects participating in clinical 
trials of ASTX029 until the safety profile is further understood. In particular, clinical signs 
and/or symptoms of cutaneous, ocular, GI, and liver toxicities and LVEF decrease will be closely 
monitored, evaluated, and managed during the study (Appendix 4, Appendix 5, Appendix 6, 
Appendix 7, and Appendix 8 respectively).

9.1. Preliminary Clinical Activity Assessments
Measurable disease according to RECIST v1.1 (Appendix 3) will be assessed using CT or MRI 
scans at baseline (screening), every 2 cycles (±7 days) for the first 4 cycles, and then every 4 
cycles (±1 cycle) thereafter until clinical and/or radiographic disease progression, death, or the 
subject withdraws consent. Tumor markers (if applicable) should be measured at the same time 
points as the time points for radiological assessments.
For subjects whose disease is not measurable using RECIST v1.1, disease status must be reliably 
and consistently followed using another generally acceptable method. 
9.2. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic/Biomarker Assessments
9.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Serial blood samples for Phase 1 will be collected over a 24-hour period at specified time points 
postdose for PK analysis on C1D1, Cycle 1 Day 2 (C1D2), Cycle 2 Day 1 (C2D1), and Cycle 2 
Day 2 (C2D2) for Regimen 1 ( Table 4) and on C1D1, C1D2, Cycle 1 Day 14 (C1D14), and 
Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15) for Regimen 2 (Table 5). 
Serial blood samples for Phase 2 will be collected on C1D1, C1D2, C2D1, and Cycle 3 Day 1 
(C3D1) for Regimen 1 ( Table 6) and on C1D1, C1D2, C1D14, C1D15, and C3D1 for Regimen 2 
(Table 7). 
Additional
 ad hoc blood sample(s) may be collected, per investigator discretion, for PK 
measurement at any time, including after the last dose, if there is a suspected safety issue.
ASTX-029 plasma concentration data will be used to determine PK parameters, including AUC, 
Cmax, Cmin, Tmax, and t ½, in all subjects initially during Cycle 1 (both regimens) and Cycle 2 
(Regimen 1), if data are evaluable. Metabolites of ASTX029 may be investigated if applicable. It 
is essential that the actual time and date of sample collection relative to the administration of 
study treatment be recorded in the subject's eCRF. Nominal PK blood sampling times and 
collection windows should be adhered to as closely as possible. 
During the course of the study, as data emerge and improve the understanding of PK of 
ASTX029, sample collection times may be modified. Blood sample preparation and plasma 
sample storage details are provided in the laboratory manual.

Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 9210. EVALUATION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS
10.1. Definitions
10.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a clinically significant abnormal finding in laboratory tests or other diagnostic 
procedures), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Disease progression is not considered to be an AE or SAE. If there are specific AEs that are 
always part of disease progression, these do not need to be reported as AEs or SAEs. Pre-existing 
medical conditions (other than natural progression of the disease being studied) judged by [CONTACT_664225]-specified AE reporting period will be reported as AEs or SAEs as appropriate.
An AE or SAE can also be a complication that occurs as a result of protocol mandated 
procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as biopsies).
10.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An AE is considered serious, if in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes:
Death.
A life-threatening AE.
An AE is considered "life-threatening" if in the view of either the investigator, or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. 
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.
A congenital anomaly or birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on the appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAE. Examples of such medical events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 9310.2. Adverse Event Reporting and Descriptions
Record new AEs from the start of study treatment until [ADDRESS_897090]'s eCRF, in the source document, and if applicable, record on the SAE 
Report form. Whenever possible, the investigator should group signs and symptoms (including 
laboratory tests or other results of diagnostic procedures) into a single diagnosis under a single 
term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be reported as "upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]" or a pulmonary infiltrate, positive sputum culture and fever might be reported as 
"pneumonia."
To optimize consistency of AE reporting across centers, ask the subject a standard, general, 
non-leading question to elicit any AEs (such as "Have you had any new symptoms, injuries, 
illnesses since your last visit?"). 
Death is an outcome of an SAE and usually not itself an SAE, unless it is death with no 
identifiable cause or event. In all other cases, record the cause of death as the SAE. Investigators 
will assess the status of previously reported, and occurrence of new AEs and SAEs at all subject 
evaluation time points during the study.
10.2.1. Severity
Use the definitions found in the CTCAE v4.03 for grading the severity (intensity) of AEs. The 
CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_897091] experience any AE not listed in 
the CTCAE v4.03, use the following grading system to assess severity:
Grade 1 – Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.
Grade 2 – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), such as preparing 
meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.
Grade 3 – Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-
care ADL, such as bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.
Grade 4 – Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5 – Death related to AE.

Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 9410.2.2. Relationship to Study Treatment (Suspected Adverse Reactions)
Assess all AEs/SAEs for relationship to study treatment or if applicable, to study procedure.
If an AE/SAE occurs before the first dose of study treatment, report it only if it is considered 
related to a study-specific procedure (eg, bleeding or local infection after skin punch biopsy). 
Those events will be recorded in the study database but will not be part of the 
treatment-emergent AE analysis. 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
general guideline shown below. 
Related 
(Suspected Adverse 
Reaction)A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. Reasonable 
possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE such as a plausible temporal 
relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the 
drug; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the 
drug; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the 
drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon 
rechallenge. Further examples of type of evidence that would 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE:
A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and 
known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (eg, 
angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome),
One or more occurrences of an event that is not 
commonly associated with drug exposure, but is 
otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the 
drug (eg, acute myocardial infarction in a young 
woman),
An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a 
clinical study (such as known consequences of the 
underlying disease or condition under investigation or 
other events that commonly occur in the study 
population independent of drug therapy) that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment 
group than in a concurrent or historical control group.
Not Related 
(Not Suspected)Adverse events that do not meet the definition above.

1 year old by [CONTACT_36094]. 
Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Group Contact [CONTACT_664227]: email [EMAIL_12635]
A subject must immediately inform the investigator if the subject or subject's partner becomes 
pregnant during the time between the first study-specific procedure and [ADDRESS_897094], discussing 
any risks of continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus.
Report any abortion and the reason for it, whether therapeutic, elective or spontaneous, to the 
Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance group or designee within 24 hours of learning of the event, 
through the SAE reporting process (Section 10.2.4).
10.2.4. Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
All SAEs regardless of causality will be reported by [CONTACT_664228] 
30-day period after the last dose of study treatment. Deaths and SAEs occurring after the 30-day 
safety follow-up period AND considered related to study treatment or study procedures must 
also be reported until the end of the study or subject death.
Report all SAEs (initial and follow-up information) on the SAE Report form and email it to the 
Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance group or designee, within 24 hours of learning of the event or 
information (see below). The Sponsor may request follow-up and other additional information 
from the investigator (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104782], laboratory results).
Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Group Contact [CONTACT_664227]: email [EMAIL_12635]
Report all deaths with the primary cause of death as the SAE term, as death is the outcome of the 
event, not the event itself. If an autopsy was performed, report the primary cause of death on the 
autopsy report as the SAE term. Forward autopsy and postmortem reports to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance group or designee, as outlined above.
If study treatment is discontinued, temporarily suspended, or dose reduced because of an SAE, 
include this information in the SAE Report form.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are SAEs that qualify for 
mandatory expedited safety reporting to regulatory authorities where the SAE is suspected to be 
caused by [CONTACT_104819] (ie, not listed as expected in the

will report to the relevant regulatory authorities and forward a formal notification describing the 
S[LOCATION_003]R to investigators, according to regulatory requirements. Each investigator must then 
notify his or her IRB/IEC of the S[LOCATION_003]R as required by [CONTACT_664229]/IEC policy.
10.3. Follow-up for Adverse Events
Follow all AEs and SAEs that are encountered during the protocol-specified AE reporting period 
(1) to resolution, (2) until the investigator assesses the subject as stable and the event is 
following a clinically expected outcome, or (3) until the subject is lost to follow-up or withdraws 
consent.

Statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_4885].
Data summaries and listings will be generated using SAS version 9.4 or a more recent version 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).
The statistical analysis plan and/or the clinical study report will provide additional details of the 
analysis, which may include details of missing and, if applicable, unused data, as well as 
additional sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary variables. The clinical study report 
will describe deviations from the statistical analysis plan, if any.
11.1. Sample Size
The dose-escalation part of the study (Phase 1 Part A) follows a standard 3+[ADDRESS_897095] 85% of planned doses in the 
first cycle of treatment (or were not able to receive at least 85% of planned doses due to safety 
concerns).
For Part B (of Phase 1), a sample size of 14 evaluable subjects will ensure a 90% probability of 
observing at least 1 adverse reaction to treatment for any adverse reaction with a ≥15% 
incidence. Evaluable subjects for Part B are all subjects who receive any amount of study drug.
For Phase 2, the sample size is based on a Simon’s Optimal 2-stage design ( Simon 1989). Each 
cohort will enroll [ADDRESS_897096] stage. Should ≥[ADDRESS_897097]-stage subjects respond, an 
additional 19 subjects will be enrolled into the second stage. Therefore, up to 29 subjects will be 
used for each treatment cohort. The sample size, (10+19) 29, under this Simon’s Optimal 2-stage 
design, will achieve a power of 80% to test the null hypothesis of ORR p 0 ≤0.1 at a 1-sided alpha 
of 0.05 assuming the response rate p 1 is 0.3. For Stage 2, the null hypothesis will be rejected if 
≥6 responses are observed in a cohort of 29 subjects. For Cohort F (which will enroll patients

DSRC, may expand enrollment for a particular molecularly defined subpopulation in which the 
most number of responses are observed to 10 or 29 subjects under the same Simon’s Optimal 
2-stage design as for the other cohorts for better assessment of activity in that disease 
subpopulation (Optional Cohort F expansion). It is expected that no more than [ADDRESS_897098] Analysis Set will include information from all screened subjects, including those

TUMORS, VERSION 1.[ADDRESS_897107] v1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009). 
Measurability of Tumor at Baseline
Definitions
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable, as 
described below:
Measurable
Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_897108] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).
10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable).
[ADDRESS_897109] X-ray.
Measurable malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be [ADDRESS_897110] scan 
(CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline (ie, 
screening for this study) and in follow-up (ie, all measurements past screening for this 
study), only the short axis will be measured and followed. See also notes below on 
‘Baseline documentation of target and nontarget lesions’ for information on lymph 
node measurement.
Nonmeasurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes 
with 10 to 15 mm short axis) as well as truly nonmeasurable lesions. Lesions considered truly 
nonmeasurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_86122].
Special Considerations Regarding Lesion Measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment.
Bone Lesions
Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
EDMS-[PHONE_13734]-DocID-09009c4a81eef99d
Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 119or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are nonmeasurable.
Cystic Lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. 
However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for 
selection as target lesions.
Lesions With Prior Local Treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
Specifications by [CONTACT_664246], using calipers if clinically assessed. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
NEVER more than 21 days before the beginning of the treatment.
Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected 
for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_897111] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scans). 
Tumor Response Evaluation
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. In this study, only 
subjects with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study.
Baseline Documentation of 'Target' and 'Nontarget' Lesions
When more than 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
5 lesions total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will 
EDMS-[PHONE_13734]-DocID-09009c4a81eef99d
Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 120be recorded and measured at baseline. In instances where subjects have only 1 or 2 organ sites 
involved, a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions respectively will be recorded.
The criteria for selection of target lesions are as follows:
Largest in size (ie, lesions with the longest diameter). If the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement, the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.
a. Representative of all involved organs. 
b. Can be repeatedly measured using a reproducible method. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures that may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. As noted above, pathological nodes that are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short 
axis of [ADDRESS_897112] in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. 
For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20 × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) 
should be considered nontarget lesions. Nodes that have a short axis  10 mm are considered 
nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.
A sum of the diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
nontarget lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present,’ ‘absent,’ or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression.’ In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’). 
Response Criteria
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response 
for target lesions.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters.
EDMS-[PHONE_13734]-DocID-09009c4a81eef99d
Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 121Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), 
even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are 
included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if CR criteria are met, since 
a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of  10 mm. For PR, SD, and PD, the 
actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’: While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
nonnodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even when very small (eg, 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph 
nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the 
radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being 
‘too small to measure.’ When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the eCRF. If 
it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should 
be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (Note: it is less likely that this rule will be 
used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently 
surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be 
present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned 
in this circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5-mm thickness of CT scan 
slices (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these 
lesions is potentially nonreproducible; therefore providing this default value will prevent false 
responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that value should be recorded, even if it is below 
5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment: When nonnodal lesions ‘fragment,’ the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in 
obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the 
group of nontarget lesions. While some nontarget lesions may actually be measurable, they need 
EDMS-[PHONE_13734]-DocID-09009c4a81eef99d
Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 122not be measured, and instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol. 
CR: Disappearance of all nontarget lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be nonpathological in size (10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
PD: Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing nontarget lesions (Note: the 
appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Nontarget Disease
The concept of progression of nontarget disease requires additional explanation as follows, when 
the subject also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on 
the basis of the nontarget disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in 
nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor 
burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the 
size of 1 or more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal 
progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in 
nontarget disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ 
bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of preexisting lesions). This is particularly important 
when the subject’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may 
be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered that reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of 
PD even if they did not have brain imaging at baseline. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until 
the end of treatment. No confirmatory measurement for CR, PR, or SD is required in the study.
The subject’s best overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and 
nontarget disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.

Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at a particular time point, the subject is not evaluable at 
that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the 
case is also considered not evaluable at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be 
made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time 
point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a subject 
had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_897114] Overall Response: All Time Points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known.
Best response determination in studies where confirmation of CR or PR is not required: Best 
response in these studies is defined as the best response across all time points (eg, if a subject has 
SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment, he or she will have 
a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the 
protocol-specified minimum time from baseline (6 weeks). If the minimum time is not met when 
SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response depends on the 
subsequent assessments. For example, if a subject has SD at first assessment, but PD at the 
second assessment, and does not the meet minimum duration for SD, he or she will have a best 
response of PD. The same subject lost to follow-up after the first SD assessment would be 
considered inevaluable.
Special Notes on Response Assessment
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease to ‘normal’ 
size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should

Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 124be recorded even though the nodes are normal, in order not to overstate progression should it be 
based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may not 
have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the eCRF.
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
‘symptomatic deterioration.’ Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of 
such subjects is to be determined by [CONTACT_664247].
For equivocal findings of progression (eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic changes 
or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled assessment. If at 
the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of progression should be the 
earlier date when progression was suspected.
Frequency of Tumor Re-evaluation
In this study, tumor measurement will be conducted at the end of every 2 cycles (±7 days) for the 
first 4 cycles and then every 4 cycles (±1 cycle) thereafter until clinical and/or radiographic 
disease progression, or death, or the subject withdraws consent. Scan dates should not be 
adjusted or rescheduled due to dose interruption of any type. 
Baseline tumor assessments must be performed within 3 weeks (21 days) prior to the first dose of 
treatment. 
All efforts should be made to ensure consistency between the baseline measurements and all 
subsequent measurements in reference to utilization of scanning method, equipment, technique
(including slice thickness and field of view), and radiographic interpreter.
The radiographic evaluation must include CT or MRI scanning of the known sites of 
involvement, as well as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis if they are not the primary target. Any 
additional suspected sites of disease should also be imaged. All evaluations should meet the 
standard of care for imaging of lesions in the respective organ(s) and should conform to the 
image acquisition guidelines according to institutional standards.
All target and nontarget sites are evaluated at each time point of tumor assessment.

blurring and altered light perception, periorbital edema, increased lacrimation, uveitis, and visual 
disturbances. Retinal adverse events have also been described in subjects receiving MEK 
inhibitors (de la Cruz-Merino et al 2017 ; Stjepanovic et al 2016; Welsh and Corrie 2015). 
The causal relationship between a change in vision and the study treatment should be carefully 
explored, and an ophthalmologist should be consulted. Special attention should be given to 
retinal adverse events (eg, CSR, RVO). For events of visual changes regardless of severity, a 
blood sample for PK analysis must be drawn as close as possible to the time of the event. 
Suggested guidelines regarding management and criteria for adjusting, withholding, and

Discontinuation of study treatment should occur if a subject shows potential signals of liver 
injury, indicated by [CONTACT_664251]. (Note: liver 
toxicity or injury may be confirmed with a liver biopsy, if clinically indicated.)
ALT or AST ≥8×ULN. 
ALT or AST >5×ULN but <8×ULN for ≥7 days.
ALT or AST >3×ULN and either total bilirubin >2×ULN or INR >1.5, if INR 
measured.

Subjects with potential signals of liver injury must be closely monitored as described below: 
Report the event to the  Sponsor’s medical monitor.
Repeat liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and INR at least twice weekly until liver 
function test elevations resolve or stabilize or the values return to baseline. (The 
frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize 
and the subject is asymptomatic.) 
Obtain a detailed history of symptoms, including any prior and concurrent diseases. 
Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol and recreational drug use, and 
any special diets consumed. 
Rule out acute viral hepatitis (types A, B, C, D, and E), autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy, and biliary

1.0 GENERAL INFORMATION
This section describes modifications to the study protocol to allow flexibility in conducting this 
study during the COVID-19 public health emergency while maintaining safety of trial 
participants, maintaining compliance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and minimizing risks 
to trial integrity. These modifications are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the 
public health emergency related to COVID-[ADDRESS_897120] be discussed with the Sponsor’s medical monitor 
before implementation.
2.[ADDRESS_897121] safety and data integrity. The Sponsor decided to:
Continue to enroll/treat participants in this study with temporary modifications 
including:
Conversion of physical visits to telephone or video visits.
Modification to ensure that only strictly necessary visits are performed at study 
centers.
Allow laboratory test and/or diagnostic tests (excluding pharmacokinetic [PK] 
and biomarker analyses and disease assessments) to be conducted at a local 
laboratory, authorized certified to perform such tests, close to the subject’s 
residence, to reduce COVID-19 exposure, if needed.
Remote monitoring.
Remote source data verification (rSDV), where permitted by [CONTACT_19124].*
Changes to the informed consent process.*
Temporarily pause recruitment of new trial participants (at some study centers).
Extend the duration of the study, if needed, by 6 months.
* Where required, submitted as a substantial amendment.
3.0 COVID-19 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT
The safety of each trial participant is of primary importance, and the risks of participating in this 
clinical trial, given the challenges due to COVID-19, were carefully weighed against the 
anticipated benefit for trial participants. 
The Sponsor will reassess the risks of conducting this study as the situation develops and will 
document assessments as part of the sponsor’s trial master file. It is possible that local 
circumstances may lead to a local change in risk assessment (eg, an escalation of the pandemic 
within a certain region); therefore, the need to implement additional measures may arise.

Taiho Oncology, Inc. ASTX029-01
Protocol ASTX029-01, Amendment 5.0 23 May 2024
Confidential – Proprietary Information Page 133Investigators may be asked to complete a risk assessment questionnaire or other document 
provided by [CONTACT_1034](or designee. This assessment should be documented in the 
investigator’s site master file and communicated to the Sponsor. 
Benefits
The benefits of participating in this study during the COVID-19 pandemic include treatment of a 
life-threatening disease for which there are limited or no alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_664177] a study with an oral 
formulation of the study drug administered for conditions for which only intravenous (IV) or 
subcutaneous therapy is available. 
Risks
Additional risks to participating in this trial during the COVID-19 pandemic may include: 
Visiting the study center may increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19, depending 
on the status of the pandemic in the area near the study center.
As a result of the disease and treatment, there may be risk of greater morbidity and 
mortality if COVID-19 is contracted. Additional measures implemented to mitigate 
this will depend on the individual study center.
In the event that, as a result of the pandemic, local health officials require shelter in 
place, alternative arrangements (eg, dosing at home on study days when study drug is 
to be taken in the clinic) may need to be made to assure subjects continue to receive 
treatment. Arrangements will be made in collaboration with each study center 
physician to minimize any such associated risks.
COVID-19 Benefit/Risk Summary
With the life-threatening nature of the condition being treated in this study and because there are 
no approved alternative treatments for such conditions, the potential anticipated benefits of 
continuation of this study justify the risks. Study centers will only be allowed to participate in 
this study during the COVID-[ADDRESS_897122]’s chart. Alternative methods 
include, but are not limited to, contact[CONTACT_664252]-calls and obtaining oral 
consent, supplemented with e-mail confirmation, as per Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and Institutional policies or guidelines. 
4.2 Alternative Methods for Drug Supply
In extenuating circumstances (eg, during the COVID-19 pandemic) under which standard 
approaches to dispensing study drug to subjects are not possible, alternative methods for 
dispensing study drug to subjects may be used. The Sponsor will work with individual centers to 
find acceptable alternative arrangements (eg, shipment of study drug from study center

monitoring. Alternative methods for drug dispensing must be reviewed by [CONTACT_664253].
4.3 Study Visits and Procedures 
Protocol-mandated visits and laboratory/diagnostic testing may be modified as follows: 
Telemedicine visits (ie, visits conducted via telephone and/or video, or in-person 
Telehealth visits with a health professional) may be permitted in lieu of in-person 
visits to monitor adverse events and participant safety. 
Telemedicine visits must be approved by [CONTACT_664254].
Telemedicine visits must be appropriately documented in source documents.
Additional details regarding how to conduct telemedicine visits will be provided 
by [CONTACT_1034]. 
In-person visits are required to assess eligibility, perform baseline assessments, and for primary 
outcome measures. Telemedicine visits would generally not be permitted for the following 
visits/procedures unless approved by [CONTACT_1034]: 
Screening and/or predose Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) assessments to determine eligibility.
Visits with mandatory fresh tumor sample collection and sample collection for 
biomarker and PK analyses. 
Visits with disease assessments (eg, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI], tumor markers).
Visits with mandatory ophthalmic evaluations.
Day [ADDRESS_897123] is in early cycles of the protocol-defined treatment.
Visits with investigator assessments of new serious or ≥Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) 
or suspected dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events.

Title: Physical Activity in the Medical Workplace : A way to improve physical and mental well -being ? 
 
Abstract  
Many Americans do not meet the physical activity guidelines  and the majority of Americans are overweight or 
obese .  Decreased physical activity is not only associated with mult iple chronic medical conditions, including 
obesity, but also with depressed mood, and other neg ative emotions.  As many employed adults spend a great 
deal of time at work  where we are predominantly sedentary , strategies to increase physical activity at work are 
being pursued to help improve the physical and mental health of Americans. This 17 week randomized controlled 
trial will investigate changes of occupational physical activity in three  groups: those provided with a FitBit® but not 
able to monitor their activity level, and those provided with activity goals and individual physical activity 
challenges , and those who do not use a FitBit® . We hypothesize that providing awareness of occupational physical 
activity level as measured by [CONTACT_62867] (FitBit®) will increase occupational physical activity.  In addition, we 
hypothesize that as measured by [CONTACT_20763] -36® and perceived stress scale questionnaire measures  of emotional 
health will also improve.   
Specific Aims/Objectives  
 
1. We hypothesize that utilizing a FitBit ® to monitor activity level  (i.e. Step count) ; will lead to increased 
occupational physical activity (OPA).  
 
Background  
 Less than a third  of American adults reach the CDC physical activity guidelines [ 2].  Many of our occupations are 
sedentary and lead to decreased time in physical activity [ 3, 4].  Being sedentary is associated with multiple 
adverse health outcomes , including obesity  [5, 6].   In an effort to improve health, many workplaces and schools 
are attempting interventions to help increase occupational physical activity (OPA) [ 7].   
 
 In addition to general health benefits, participation in regular physical activity has been associated with decreased 
risk of depressive symptoms [ 8].  A review of school and  workplace interventions  to increase physical activity found 
that after the intervention there were  improvements in self- esteem, self -efficacy, satisfaction and commitment 
while there were decreases in anger, difficulty concen trating, fatigue, stress and feelings of sadness and depression 
[7].  A variety of interventions have been tried in numerous settings, many using self -report or questionnaires of 
physical activity [ 7, 9].  Interventions utilizing pedometers and providing activity goals have been successful at 
increasing OPA at a multi country university study [ 9]. Correlations with the improvement in OPA with marke rs of 
physical and mental well -being  were not performed [ 9].  
 
 Our goal with this study is to further investigate the efficacy of workplace interventions to improve physical activity as measured by [CONTACT_62867] (FitBit®) .  The Fit Bit® has been previously validated as a reliable step counter 
[
10].  Our workplace includes many different occupations  and we will investigate if participant knowledge of OPA 
level leads to improved OPA levels.  Further, if there is an increase in OPA, is this associated with weight loss and with decreased fee lings of sadness and depressive symptoms .

Inclusion criteria :  
1. Be between 18 –  [ADDRESS_385256] a stable weight -defined as self- reported weight that has not changed more than 10% in the 
past [ADDRESS_385257] understood and signed study informed consent  
 
Exclusion criteria :  
1. Have a known history of any condition or factor judged by [CONTACT_312827] –  such as a position where they 
predominantly provide transport as part of their job  
 
Study Groups  
We propose to recruit, consent and screen [ADDRESS_385258] will be asked to wear a FitBit®  on both wrists and walk on a treadmill, located in 
the DAHLC, while the study coordinator records their steps manually using a clicking device.  The subject will be asked to walk for 5 minutes at 0.9 MPH, followed by 5 minutes at 3.0 MPH and 5 minutes at 4.0 MPH.  They will 
then be asked to continue on with the blinded run -in phase.  
 All eligible subjects will be  invited to participate in 4 -week run -in phase using the FitBit® while at work and be 
blinded to the FitBit® daily activity recording.  This run -in phase will be used to collect baseline OPA data for 
each subject. During the run-in phase subjects  will be provided with a FitBit® but will not be made aware of their 
OPA level. Fit Bit® accounts will be created and maintained by [CONTACT_3476] . The FitBi t® itself will have the 
displays covered so that it will not be available for the subject to read during the blinded phase(s).    During this 
time s ubjects will be asked to wear their FitBit® while working and leave the FitBit® at their desk at the end of

 each day.  The FitBit® will be collected by [CONTACT_312828] ’ workweek.  During which time 
the coordinating staff will download the weekly data and recharge the devices.  They will then return the 
devices to the subjects at the beginn ing of their work week.  At the end of the 4 -week run -in-phase (baseline) 
they will be randomized into one of the three 12 week intervention arms using a computer -driven r andom 
number generator created with the help of statistician.  The groups to which the y will be randomized will be:  
1. Group 1  (control group )- participants will be blinded to their OPA during the entire study  (run -in and 
randomized intervention phases) .   
2. Group 2  (intervention group )- This group will be able to access their FitBit® activity data by [CONTACT_312829] , therefore they will be unblinded during the randomized intervention phase (and blinded during the 
run-in phase) . Participants will be given a specific OPA target based on the results from the run -in phase. The 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_83012] -investigators will meet with the participants randomized into th is 
intervention group .  The investigator will meet with subjects  within 1 week of the study visit (baseline and 
week 6) . Based  on the physical activity tracked during the baseline period, instructions will be provided to 
increase the OPA by 5 % a week as determined by [CONTACT_312830].  If at the post 6 
week study visit their OPA remains <5000 steps per  day, we will encourage the same 5% per week increase 
in OPA .  Various methods such as taking steps as much possible prior to taking elevators, lunch time walks, 
walking breaks, and walking meeting of non -patient related topi[INVESTIGATOR_312823]. The daily  FitBit OPA 
activity will be downloaded weekly by [CONTACT_207679] a print out of the weekly activity will be placed in 
the subjects study files for use by [CONTACT_312831].  
3. Group 3  (no FitBit ® Group ) – No  FitBit® during the 12 week  randomized  intervention phase .  
 As in the run -in phase, s ubjects will be asked to wear their FitBit®  while working and leave the FitBit®  at their 
desk at the end of each day.  The FitBit®  will be collected by [CONTACT_312832].  
During which time the coordinating staff will download the weekly data and recharge the devices.  They will then return the devices to the subjects at the beginning of their work week.  
 All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_5365] a final study visit via the telephone at [ADDRESS_385259] the randomized 
intervention.  
 
At baseline, and 6 weeks after they start the randomization intervention and at the end of the randomization phase (12 weeks)  all study participants will be asked to complete  the perceived stress scale, the SF 36 scale and 
be measured by [CONTACT_312833] 770 ®.  In addition, subjects in group [ADDRESS_385260] 80% power to detect a difference in the mean of 2.5% weight loss  
difference between a Group [ADDRESS_385261] [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] FitBit Study  S. Nanda and S. Bonnes, MD  
Page [ADDRESS_385262], there is a 6 – 7% drop out rate in the 
recruitment. To account for this drop -out rate, we propose to include 45 subjects in each arm of the study. We 
acknowledge that achieving a 2.5 % change in body weight might not be clinically feasible.  
We propose to run this study as pi[INVESTIGATOR_312824], change in body fat 
percentage and improvement in satisfaction level. We propose to run a larger randomized controlled study 
using this as preliminary data.      
 
Data Collection  
All data will be collected by [CONTACT_312834].  After 
consent and screening is completed, P erceived stress scale questionnaire and SF-36®, height, weight and InBody 
770® scan will be collected , followed by [CONTACT_312835]/her FitBit® for the run -in-phase . After 
the 4-week  run-in-phase is completed, subjects will come in for randomization to one of the groups described 
above.   
 
FitBit® devices will be collected on a weekly  basis to download activity levels and charge the devices.  A FitBit® 
account will be created for each study participant by [CONTACT_312836] l 
while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_312825] -in-phase and group 1 blinded during the randomized 
intervention phase . FitBit ® display will be hidden from the wearer for Group 1.  For Group 2, The online 
program  will allow us to limit the informa tion the FitBit® wearers see so that the FitBit ® can be specific to the 
goals set by [CONTACT_473].   We will repeat the perceived stress scale questionnaire, SF -36® and InBody 770® 
after [ADDRESS_385263] wear the FitBit®  at work for a minimum of 48 days out of the possible 60 days during the  
randomization phase.   
 
Data Handling  
To ensure the confidentially of the subjects participating in the present study; no names, social security numbers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312826]. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and any other information n eeded for recruitment, study involvement, and tracking will be obtained 
and maintained by [CONTACT_312837] a secured server with limited access. In addition, all study data (i.e. 
data collection forms as well as regulatory paperwork) will be maintained on a secure file server or in locked 
research data storage rooms to which only designated project staff will have access. All computer files and systems will be password protected and accessible by [CONTACT_182201]. Data entry and transfer will be 
performed by [CONTACT_312838].

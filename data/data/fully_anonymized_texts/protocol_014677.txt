Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828362] 1 dose of IL -2.  The Simon’s two -
stage optimal design with one -sided alpha level=0.025 and 80% power is adopted 
for comparing an ORR of 5% versus 20%.  In this study, [ADDRESS_828363] stage and if 1 or fewer patient s respond, the study will 
terminate.  Otherwise the study will expand to a total of 47 patient s in Stage 2.  
The study would de monstrate that lymphodepletion + LN- 145 + IL2  is clinically 
meaningful if 6 or more patient s respond in Stages 1 and 2.  
The assessment of safety data will be based on the summarization of treatment -
emergent adverse e vents  (AEs) including, serious AE , AEs leading to 
discontinuation from the study, and clinical laboratory tests.  
The primary efficacy endpoint (ORR) and the secondary endpoint of CR as a best 
overall response (%) will be reported including a 95% confidence interval.  The 
secondary efficacy endpoints (DOR, PFS, and OS) will be summarized by [CONTACT_5263] -
Meier analyses with estimated means, medi ans and ranges reported in months.  
DSMB Safety 
Assessments  The DSMB will evaluate safety data when 3 patients hav e completed the 
Treatment Phase . Enrollment shall not be halted and will continue while under 
review.  Additional evaluations will be specified in the charter.  
Discontinuation 
of Treatment  The Investigator will document on the appropriate eCRF page the reasons/circumstances for discontinuation.  A patient may be removed from 
further study drug administration for the following medical or administrative reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• Grade 3  or greater autoimmunity that involves vital organs (heart, 
kidneys, brain, eye, liver, colon, adrenal gland, lungs) with symptoms 
emerging prior to first IL -2 administration.  
• Grade 3 or greater allergic reaction including bronchospasm or 
generalized urticaria that does not resolve after medical management in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
• Grade 3 or greater toxicity due to IL -2 that does not decrease to Grade 2 
or less within 96 hours of management.   
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to Follow -up

 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Head and Neck Cancer  
Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck cancer (HNSCC) comprise malignancies of the 
nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, nasopharnyx, oral cavity, oropharynx, hyopopharynx, larynx, 
salivary glands, and head and neck paraganglial tissues (1).  The majority o f these tumors occur 
in older individuals who have a history or smoking or high alcohol use (more than 4 drinks per 
day), and are more frequent in men than in women (2, 3).  The HNSCC subset of oropharyngeal 
cancer (OPC) appears to be a distinct disease, with different risk associations than other HNSCC 
(4).  OPC prevalence among HNSCC has increased worldwide over the last two decades; in the US, the rate increased from 18% of all HNSCC in 1973 to 31% in 2004 (5).  HPV -positivity also 
has increased over the  same period, reaching an estimated 72% prevalence in OPC between 
2005 and 2009 (6- 8).  By [CONTACT_22242], fewer than 20% of other HNSCC are positive for HPV (8, 9).  
The increase in incidence of OPC is 4 -fold greater in males than females and among men, is 
asso ciated with age less than 60 years and white race (3, 10).  Of the many strains of HPV, type 
16 (HPV16) has been found in more than 90% of HPV -positive OPC (10).  Notably, genetic 
mutations in HPV -negative HNSCC appear to more frequent and distinct from th ose in HPV -
positive tumors (2).  For example, mutations of p53, a key tumor suppressor gene, were almost always associated with an HPV -negative tumor (11, 12), consistent with the known association 
between smoking and p53 mutations in subjects with HNSCC ( 13).  By [CONTACT_22242], activating 
mutations and amplifications of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) 
were more common in HPV -positive tumors (14).  As most HPV oral infections are sexually 
acquired, the increase in HPV -positive OPC  is thought to be associated with changes in sexual 
behavior over time (3).  While HPV vaccines approved for marketing over the last decade can 
prevent the development of precancerous cervical lesions (15), the effect of HPV vaccine on 
oral lesions or OPC is unknown and the HPV vaccines now is use were not available for the 
majority of current subjects with OPC.  
The current standard treatment for HNSCC typi[INVESTIGATOR_622268], radiation, and chemotherapy, typi[INVESTIGATOR_622269] (16).  Surgery can be minimally invasive in order to preserve organ function.  Radiation with hyperfractionation and accelerated 
fractionation has been found to improve survival (17), but has been associated with swallowing 
dysfunction (18) .  Five -year survival has significantly increased for all sites over the past 20 
years from 54.7% in 1992 to 1996, to 65.9% in 2002 to 2006 (19).  By [CONTACT_3725], estimated 5- year 
survival rates remain ≤ 63% for all sites other than the tongue or lip (20).  Notably, outcome for subject s with HPV -positive tumors is better than outcome for HPV -negative HNSCC [(6, 21, 22), 
with reported 2 - and 3 -year survival rates of approximately 95% and 80%, respectively (6, 21).  
The improved outcome of subjects harboring HPV -positive tumors may be a r esult of enhanced 
activity of TILs at the tumor site (17).   
The rates of occurrence of a second primary tumor or recurrence of tumors is high in HNSCC, 
particularly among smokers, likely due to the “field cancerization” effect of tobacco -induced 
malignanc y, whereby [CONTACT_622310]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828383] 2016  
 mucosa (3).  Argiris et al (23) estimated a recurrence rate of 50% for subjects in remission 
following treatment of a locally advanced HNSCC, and Chuang et al estimated that 36% of 
subjects would develop a second primary tumor within 20 years (24) Recurrence is higher in HPV -negative than in HPV -positive OPC (3 -year recurrence rates of 65.1% vs. 13.6%; P<.001).  
Additionally, the 3 -year rates of second primary malignancy were 1 4.6% vs. 5.9% (P =.02) in 
these groups (6).   
Outcome for recurrent HNSCC is poor across a variety of therapeutic modalities (25 -27), 
although Strnad et al (28) reported long-term high rates of local control of recurrent disease using interstitial pulsed-d ose-rate brachytherapy combined with chemotherapy in a selected 
subject population.  HPV -positive recurrent OPC disease has a higher OS rate than HPV -
negative recurrent OPC:  2 -year OS rates were 54.6% for subjects with HPV -positive tumors and 
27.6% for th ose with HPV -negative tumors (P<.001) (29).  
The findings of survival rates of 63% or less among most subjects with HPV -negative HNSCC or 
recurrent HPV -positive HNSCC, and even lower survival rates among subjects with recurrent 
HPV -negative tumors, indicate s a need for improved therapeutic options.    
1.2. Adoptive Cell Transfer of Tumor -Infiltrating Lymphocytes as Cancer Immunotherapy  
Adoptive cell transfer of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes represents a potentially effective treatment for patients with a variety  of solid tumors.  The method involves the recovery and ex 
vivo expansion of autologous antitumor lymphocytes that have infiltrated a patient’s tumor.  
The basic concept of using lymphoid cells for the immunotherapy of cancer arose from animal experiments that demonstrated, by [CONTACT_622311], the presence of T -lymphocytes within 
the microenvironment of most solid tumors and their metastases (12-14).  Recent findings  have 
clearly shown a predictive relationship between the frequency and phenotype of TIL in solid 
tumors (especia lly CD8+ T cells) and an increased overall survival (OS) and progression -free 
survival (PFS) in patients with melanoma (15 -18), lung cancer (19-22), ovarian cancer (23-25), 
squamous cell cancers (26, 27) , triple -negative breast cancer and basal-like breast cancer (28 -
35), and colorectal cancer (36 -39).  Notabl y, one study found that an increased Foxp3
+ 
Treg/CD8+ ratio and the presence of intra -tumoral high Foxp3+ Tregs predicted worse overall 
survival (40).  In addition, gene expression studies using DNA microarrays have indirectly 
correlated so -called “immune signature” genes and T -cell associated gene expression (e.g., 
CD3, CD8, CD4, inducible costimulator (ICOS), granzym e B (GRZB), DC- LAMP and chemokine 
and chemokine receptors) with improved OS and PFS in both primary and metastatic tumor settings (18, 36, 37, 41 -43).  Thes e findings support the development of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622270] a therapeutic agent against solid tumors.  
 ACT has several theoretical and practical advantages over active immunization and nonspecific 
immune stimulation.  First, the ex vivo environment allows expansion to proceed to very high 
cell numbers in the absence of suppressive factors, such as Treg, that are present in the tumor 
microenvironment (44-46); allowing re -infusion of much higher numbers of tumor -reactive T-
cells than is possible with other approaches.  Second, the TIL product potentially recognizes a 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828384] 2016  
 wider array of tumor antigens, such as mutated tumor neoantigens (47-50).  Preparation of the 
host patient with lymphodepletion immediately prior to the transfer of the antitumor cells also 
eliminates potentially suppressive influences (such as regulatory T cells and cytokine sinks) to provide an optimal milieu for the transferred TIL to proliferate and become activated in vivo .   
 The feasibility of TIL preparation was demonstrated by [CONTACT_622312], but any TIL contained within the excised tumor tissue can survive and proliferate when small cut tumor fragments are  placed in culture.  TIL can be cultured in the 
presence of IL -2 and can be grown to very large numbers using stand ardized protocols (≥  1 x 
10
8 cells) (12, 14, 53, 54) .  These TIL were then shown to have the capacity to kill tumor cells in 
vitro  and promote durable antitumor ef fects  in vivo when infused back into the original tumor 
donor (12, 14, 53 , 54) .  Further studies established that the efficacy of infusions of large 
numbers of TIL was enhanced by t reating the tumor -bearin g animal with cyclophosphamide to 
induce a non -toxic transient drop in endogenous lymphocytes in the host and IL -2.  With this 
combination, mice could be cured of advanced hepatic metastases (12) .  These findings set the 
stage for NCI clinical trials of TIL in patients with metastatic melanoma using a non -
myeloablative (NMA) consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide precond itioning regimen 
before TIL infusion, combined with high -dose IL -[ADDRESS_828385] 
consistently demonstrated high objective response rates (ORR), from 49% to 72%, with long -
term durable and potentially curative CR rates of up to 25 %.  
1.3. TILs for Head and Neck Cancer  
The rationale for investigating the use of TIL for treatment of HNSCC is based on the high rate 
of recurrence and overall low survival rates for subjects with recurrent disease following 
standard combinations of surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy.  Further, as was described above for other solid tumors, a positive correlation between the presence of TIL 
in HNSCC tumor specimens and subject outcome has been reported by a number of 
investigators.  For exam ple, Balermpas et al reported that among patients with HNSCC, those 
with high immunohistochemical CD3 and CD8 expression had significantly increased OS, PFS, 
and distant metastasis -free survival (DMFS), but not local failure -free survival (LFFS) in 
multivariate analysis (45).  Similarly, low CD8+ T -cell infiltration in the tumors of patients with 
laryngeal SCC was correlated with decreased survival (84).  TIL has shown prognostic value in both human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) -positive and HPV -negative HNSCC tumo r specimens. For 
example, Kong et al reported a survival benefit for higher CD3+ TIL in tumor specimens only for 
HNSCC with weak or no expression of HPV (85), whereas, Wansom et al (86) and Ward et al. 
(87) found that higher numbers of CD8+ cells in tumors  were positively correlated survival in 
patients with HPV -positive HNSCC  or HPV- positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC).  An additional 
report by [CONTACT_622313], CD8+ cells, as well as Treg cells (FoxP3) and total T -cell number all were positively correlated with OS and DFS, 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828386] 2016  
 independently of the tumor’s HPV status (88).  These data strongly suggest a beneficial role for 
TIL in the body’s response to HNSCC.   
The feasibility of generating TIL from HNSCC has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_223684].  
Junker et al (89) demonstrated the successful expansion of TIL bulk cultures were expanded in 
12/15 (80%) evaluable subjects; tumor specificity of the TIL were shown in 60%.  Up to 3500 -
fold expansion was achieved within 17  days.  TIL from 60% of the subjects were able to kill HLA -
A-matched tumor cell lines.  Additional characterization showed that the TIL expanded from an 
HNSCC were phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_622271], ie. CD3+/CD8+ and were similar 
before and after rapid expansion (90).  Moudgil et al (91) reported a success rate of 50% for generation of TIL (33 of 63 cultures initiated).  Of 22 tested TIL, 20 secreted IFN -gamma in 
response to co -culture with the autologous tumor cell target.  These findings are consistent 
with those of a retrospective study that showed that that TIL were successfully generated in 677 (86%) of the 787 specimens from 402 subjects with melanoma (92).  
To date, a single report has described use of TIL for treatment of a subject with H NSCC.  In this 
report, Leidner et al (93) infused autologous TIL in conjunction with DC -targeted microvessicle 
DPV -001 intradermal vaccine (Dribbles) to a heavily pretreated [ADDRESS_828387] received two multi -
drug regimens (cisplatin/cetuximab/5FU, carboplatin/ docetaxel), but progressed locally in the 
neck. The subject was then enrolled on a Phase Ib trial of combination anti -PD-1/anti -KIR (BMS 
CA223 -001, Nivolumab/Lirilumab) during months [ADDRESS_828388]-145

 2. STUDY DESIGN  
2.1. Overview  
This is a prospective single -arm interventional study evaluating patients with HNSCC receive 
adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with LN -145 (autologous TIL).  The TIL therapy to be used in this 
study is almost identical to that developed for melanoma- derived TIL by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steven Rosenberg 
and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Melan oma -derived TIL have 
demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of Stage IV melanoma, and Phase [ADDRESS_828390] shown an objective response rate of 49% or more (55 -58), 
exceeding rates reported by [CONTACT_622314][INVESTIGATOR_398881].   
Protocols for the tumor harvest and LN -145 administration for the current study are provided 
in separate operating manuals.  TIL therapy comprises multiple interdependent phases:  tumor 
resection for TIL harvest; ex vivo  expansion of TIL; NMA lymphodepletion, infusion of TIL, and 
infusion of high- dose IL -2.  A study flow chart is shown in  Figure 1.

2.2. Production and Expansion of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes  
Generating LN -[ADDRESS_828393]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828394] 2016  
 Appropriately expanded TIL cultures should reach several million cells (combined) in 2 to 3 
weeks.  In this trial, TIL cultures will be selected on the basis of bett er growth and a higher 
proportion of TIL.  TIL initially expanded from the tumor fragments then undergo a rapid 
expan
sion protocol (REP) using the resulting in 
billions of cells for re -infusion into the patie nt.   
Figure 2. LN-1
45 Manufacturing Process  
 
TIL production requires approximately 6 weeks following excision of tumor specimens.  The TIL 
produc
t is manufactured ex vivo using autologous tumor as starting material.  The key 
manufacturing steps include:  
• Surgical rem
oval of autologous metastatic tumor and shipment to the sponsor-
designated manufacturing facility  
• Initial TIL Culture (Pre -REP) of up to 3 weeks   
• REP culture for 14 days  
On Day 7 of the 2 -week REP protocol, the number of TILs successfully expa nded in the initial 
culture phase, will be determined.  If the number of TILs is sufficient for administration , 
approval by [CONTACT_622316]/fludarabine 
lymphodepletion regimen at Visit 4 (Day - 7). 
2.3. Non- myeloablative (NMA) Lypmphodepletion, TIL and IL -2 Therapy  
The lymphodepletion protocol used in the current study (2 days of cyclophosphamide plus 
mesna , followed by 5 days of fludarabine) is based on the method developed and tested by [CONTACT_138768] (55, 56, 58, 64, 65, 77) and is also the most often used.  Patients then will receive up to  
 LN-145. The upper limit of the range for infusion  viable cells) is based on the 

LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828395] 2016  
 known published upper limit safely infused where a clinical re sponse has been attained (64). 
TIL infusion will be followed by [CONTACT_43602] a regimen of high -dose IL -2 (600,000 
IU/kg) every [ADDRESS_828396] 
version 1.1 at Visits 17, 18 and 19 (Days 28, 56 and 84).  Patients who experience stable disease 
(SD), a par tial response (PR), or a complete response (CR), as defined by [CONTACT_44993] 1.1 at 
Visit 19 (Day 84) will continue to be evaluated for response and survival will continue to the Long Term Follow Up Phase. Survival status follow -up will continue to the Long Term Follow Up 
Phase for all treated patients.  Radiologic assessment of disease may also be performed at 
additional time points at the discretion of the investigator.

Colonoscopy is only required for patients who have had a documented Grade [ADDRESS_828415] will be conducted at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 3 (Day - 14) and Visits 17 through 25 (Days 28 through 
672, Months 1 through 24) . 
CT scans of additional anatomical locations  will be conducted at the above referenced visits if 
prior or suspected disease is clinically indicated . Assessments should be made and recorded by 
[CONTACT_622319].  
MRI or PET scans will be all owed for patients who have an intolerability to contrast media. The 
imaging modality used must be uniform for the duration of the study.  
5.22. Response Assessments  
Tumor response will be evaluated starting Visit 17 (Day 28) and at ever y visit thereafter. 
Response and progression will be evaluated using the RECIST version 1.1 criteria ( 95).  
CT scans will be forwarded to a central imaging facility for review. Data generated by [CONTACT_622320]’s  efficacy  results. An independent central response 
adjudication committee will perform an assessment of tumor responses. These data will be 
used in the final study analysis and the assessment will be included in the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR).  
5.23. Prior and Concomitant Medicatio ns 
All medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prescription, and non -prescription, including herbal 
supplements) taken by [CONTACT_622321] [ADDRESS_828416]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828417] for TILs  
At Visit 2 (Tumor Resection Visit), following confirmation of patient eligibility, the medical 
monitor, or designee, will provide approval patient for enrollment into the clinical trial.   
If enrolled, tumor resection is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_828418] -145 
infusion at Visit 11 (Day 0) and is dependent on the rate of cell growth at the central TIL manufacturing facility.   
A detailed Tumor Procurement Manual will be provided to each clinical site and training will be 
performed on the procedures for harvest, prosection, transport, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_622276] -designated central TIL Manufacturing Facility.  
5.26. Six paraffin embedded slides from resected tumor  
Six paraffin- embedded tumor section slides will be prepared for biomarker analysis  Visit 2 
(Tumor Resection).  Whole exome sequencing may be performed with consent.

Whole exome sequencing of normal  cells may be performed with consent to enable 
identification of mutations in the tumor specimen at Visit 2 (Tumor Resection).  
5.28. Non- myeloablative (NMA) lymphodepletion Regimen  
The NMA lymphodepletion regimen is scheduled to start on Visit 4 (Day - 7) which i s in 
conjunction with Day 7 of the 2 -week REP protocol. Approval from the sponsor is required to 
start the NMA lymphodepletion  regimen in order to ensure that the number of TILs cultured is 
adequate . The regimen comprises 2 days of cyclophosphamide followed by 5 days of 
fludarabine, as follows:  
5.28.1.  Preparation of Cyclophosphamide  
The dose is 60  mg/kg.  Reconstitute cyclophosphamide per institutional standard to 
deliver calculated dose in a final concentration of 20  mg/mL. Add dextrose 5% in water 
(D5W) t o the required volume of cyclophosphamide to reach a total infusion volume of 
250 mL.  If the volume of reconstituted cyclophosphamide is > [ADDRESS_828419] delivery than those of 
traditional drug production.  It is imperative that only the patient’s own (autologous) study treatment (LN -145) be administered to the same individual patient. For these 
reasons, the patient specimen must be procured and handled according to a strict protocol to ensure optimal quality of the specimen and minimum transport time to and from the processing facility, as well as to ensure the unique identification of the specimen at all times including injection back into the patient.  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828420] 2016  
 Note:  if the Patient is obese (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2), the  dose of cyclophosphamide will be 
calculated using practical weight as described in Appendix Section 16.3 . Infuse with 
Mesna as described below.  
5.28.2.  Preparation of Mesna  
The dose is 15  mg/kg.  Actual weight should be used to calculate the Mesna dose, even 
if the Patient’s BMI > 30 .0 kg/m2.  Dilute the volume of Mesna injection per institutional 
standard, or in any of the following fluids (per Mesna prescribing information, dated 
9/2015) to obtain a final concentration of 20  mg/mL:  
• 5% Dextrose Injection, USP  
• 5% Dextrose and 0.2% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP  
• 5% Dextrose and 0.33% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP  
• 5% Dextrose and 0.45% Sodium Chloride Injection, US  
• 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP  
• Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP  
5.28.3.  Infusion of Cyclophosphamide and Mesna  
Cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) in a total volume  of 250 mL (or greater if required), plus 
mesna (15 mg/kg) are to be infused together over 2 hours on Visits 4 and 5 (Days -7 and 
-6). Mesna infusion will continue at a rate of 3 mg/kg/hour over 22 hours after each 
cyclophosphamide dose during Visits 4 and 5 (Days - 7 and -6).   
5.28.4.  Fludarabine  
The fludarabine dose is 25  mg/ m2 administered by [CONTACT_622322] 30  minutes 
once daily for 5 days during Visits 6 through 10 (Days -5 through - 1)   
Note: If the Patient is obese (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2) fludarabine dosage will be calculated 
using practical weight as described in Appendix 163.[ADDRESS_828421] comprising a live cell suspension of autologous tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes derived from the patient's own tumor.  The overall process of

Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828441] 2016  
 10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Toxicities will be recorded as AEs and SAEs in the patient’s source documents and on the Adverse 
Event s eCRF and must be graded using the NCI’s CTCAE v4.03 dated June 14, 2010 (see Appendix 
Section 16.4 ).  
10.1. Definitions 
10.1.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurs during a clinical 
investigation regardless of causal relationship with the investigational product.  An AE 
can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laborato ry finding), symptom or disease assessed in eligible Patients after enrollment in 
the study.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Adverse event temporally associated with the use of any of the study drugs or 
TIL treatment whether or not considered related to the use of any of the study 
drugs or TIL treatment.  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (e.g. hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., EKGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), that worsen from baseline, and are felt to be clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the conditio n. 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with investigational product.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication.  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, u nless judged by [CONTACT_622326]’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
10.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828442] 2016  
 An AE is considered serious  if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Is Life Threatening  
• In-Patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not directly result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based o n Investigator decision, 
they may jeopardize the Patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes as listed in this definition.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622279] a telemetry unit or intensive care unit specifically 
for adminis tration of study treatment is not considered a serious adverse event.  
Any pregnancy that occurs while on the study  must be reported to the Sponsor or their 
representative.  The pregnancy must be followed up until discharge following delivery or premature termination to determine outcome and status of mother and child.  
Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  Any SAE occurring in association w ith a pregnancy, brought to the Investigator’s attention after 
the Patient has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_622327], must be promptly reported to the Sponsor or 
their representative.  In addition, the Investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male study Patients who become pregnant while 
the Patient is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy information must be reported to the 
Sponsor or their representa tive.  
10.2. Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events  
10.2.1.  All Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring after enrollment in the study and either observed by [CONTACT_183633] (whether or not attributed to the use of IL -[ADDRESS_828443] -145),  will 
be reported o n the eCRF.  Monitoring and reporting AEs will be conducted through the 
last on -study visit.    
Medically significant AEs considered related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_622328].  The Investigator shall categorize the cause of the AE as chemotherapy, LN-145, IL-[ADDRESS_828444] assign the following attributes:  description; dates of onset and resolution; 
severity; assessment of relatedness to investigational product, and action taken.  The 
Investigator may be asked to provide follow -up information.  
If any patient should die while on the study, the Investigator will inform the Sponsor as  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828445] 2016  
 soon as possible.  (Note: Death due to disease progression should not be reported as a 
SAE unless it is deemed to be related to the use of study treatment.)  The cause of death 
should be recorded in detail on the SAE Report Form.  
Each site will be responsible for reporting SAEs occurring at the site to the applicable IRB 
per the IRB’s reporting guidelines.   
It will be left to the Investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require the patient’s removal from the study  treatment.  A patient may also 
voluntarily discontinue treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE. This sh ould be captured in the eCRF.  If either of these occurs, the patient must undergo 
an early termination  visit and be given appropr iate care under medical supervision until 
symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable and returns for a safety Follow -up 
visit.  If the patient was permanently removed from the study or investigational product due to an SAE, this information must be inc luded in either the initial or follow -up SAE 
Report Form and in the eCRF.  
10.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to study treatment  should 
be considered:  
• Definite : There is a known causal relationship bet ween the study drug and the 
AE/SAE.  The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (de -challenge), and 
recurs with re -challenge when clinically feasible. (>95% certainty of 
relatedness).  
• Probable: There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and 
the AE/SAE.  The event responds to de -challenge. Re -challenge is not required. 
(65% -95% probability of relatedness).  
• Possible:  There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and 
the AE/ SAE.  De -challenge information is lacking or unclear. (35% -65% 
probability of relatedness).  
• Not likely:  There is temporal relationship to study drug administration, but 
there is no t a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
AE/SAE. (5 -35% probability of relatedness).  
• Not related: There is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration 
(too early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is known ca usal 
relationship between the AE/SAE and another drug, concurrent disease, or 
other circumstance. (<5% chance of relatedness).  
10.2.3.  Severity  
The severity of an event describes the degree of impact and/or the need for medical care necessary to treat an event.   
AE grading will be defined by [CONTACT_12397] v 4.03 (see Section 16.4).  In the event the 
CTCAE v 4.[ADDRESS_828446]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828447] 2016  
 • Mild:  Asymptomatic; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated  
• Modera te:   Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate activities of daily life  
• Severe:    Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_622280]; disabling; 
limiting activities of daily life  
• Life-threatening:  Urgent intervention is required  
10.3. Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
10.3.1.  Investigator Reporting to Sponsor  
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be collected while on the 
study .  In addition, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any SAE that may occur 
after this time period which (s)he believes to be certainly, probably, or possibly related 
study treatment.   SAE terminology and severity grading will be based on the NCI’s CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_828448] be reported by [CONTACT_611145] 24 hours of learning of the event.  The initial notification should be as complete as is possible with the information available 
and include the Investigator’s assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the event.  SAE reports will be reported to Chiltern International, Inc. via EDC system, MERGE eCOS. Pape r SAE forms can be used as back 
up and send via [EMAIL_11830] or fax (1 -[PHONE_829]).  Reporting to 
Regulatory Agencies and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) . 
In the event of a serious adverse event, the Sponsor, or their designee, will noti fy the 
appropriate regulatory authorities and all appropriate parties as per the regulations.  The Investigator is responsible for reporting serious adverse events to their IRBs  
In addition, the Sponsor must submit expedited reports of an increased rate of  
occurrence of serious adverse events over that listed in the protocol or Investigational Brochure. Sponsor will notify participating sites of any serious adverse events which occur during trial.

Clinical response will be determined using RECIST version 1.1.  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828449] 2016  
 11.1.1.  Evaluation of Target Lesions1 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have a reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm).  
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameter of target 
lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressi ve Disease  (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
• Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
11.1.2.  Evaluation of Non- Target  Lesions2  
• Complete Response  (CR): Disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) . 
• Non -Complete Response:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumo r marker level above normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression ) 
11.1.3.  Determination of Best Response for Each Patient  
The best  response for each patient is determined once all the data for the patient is known.  The 
best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until disease progression/recurrence, the initiation of new anti -cancer therapy, death  or [ADDRESS_828450].  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement 
                                                           
1 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all 
involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured during screening. A sum of 
the diameters (longest for non -noda l lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference by [CONTACT_622329]. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, only the short axis will contribute.
 
2 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline.    
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828451] overall response for each patient is determined as shown in  Table 2 .

11.2. Overall Response Rate (O RR) 
The ORR will be based on the best overall response for each patient.  The ORR rate is the 
percentage of patients who achieved a best response of CR o r PR among those successfully 
undergone NMA lymphodepletion and infused with LN -[ADDRESS_828453] one dose of IL -2.  
11.3. Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
11.3.1.  Confirmation 
To be assigned a status of PR or CR  changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_74909] [ADDRESS_828454]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828455] 2016  
 12. STATIS TICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
12.1. Introduction 
The primary statistical plan of analysis is based on use of descriptive methods unless 
mentioned otherwise. Continuous data will be summarized as the number of patients with 
non-missing data (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum value s. 
Categorical data will be summarized as counts and their related percentages, where applicable. 
Estimation of confidence limits will use two -sided, 95%. Missing data will not be imputed unless 
mentioned otherwise.  A more detailed description of the analyses and reporting plan of the data will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
12.2. Analysis Populations  
Three analysis populations will be defined to summarize the data. The resected  population will 
consist of all patients with resection of tumor for TIL harvest. The treated  population  consists 
of the  resected patients who have been successfully infused with  lymphodepletion,  LN-[ADDRESS_828456] overall response.   The 
responder popul ation will be used to summarize the duration of re sponse.    
12.3. Sample Size Justification  
The planned sample si ze for this single arm study is 47  patient s.  A Simon’s optimal two -stage 
design will be used to test the null hypothesis that ORR will be ≤5% (not c onsidered clinically 
meaningful ).  Fifteen  patient s will be included in the first stage, and if there are [ADDRESS_828457] met its statistical goal.  This 
two-stage design has 80 % power to de tect a difference of an ORR of 5% versus 20 % using a 
one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_828458]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828459] 2016  
 leading to discontinuation from the study, and clinical laboratory tests.  Adverse event 
summaries will be based on patient incidence counts and their related percentages; the 
number of events will be displayed as appropriate. In additional to an overall summary 
of adverse events, separate displays will be made by [CONTACT_2236] (grades by [CONTACT_3989]) and relationship . These toxicity grade summaries will also be provided separately for 
applicable laboratory parameters . 
A separate safety summary will be provided for patients in the  resected treated 
population until  the lymphodepletion therapy and resected untreated population .  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the overall response rate (CR+PR) as assessed by a 
central imaging reader.  The ORR is defined as the proportion of patient s who achieve 
either a PR or CR as best response as assessed by [CONTACT_622330] 1.1 Criteria.  Objec tive response will be evaluated per each disease assessment 
and the ORR will be calculated for the Safety  population .  The corresponding 95% two -
sided confidence  interval will be derived.    
12.5.2.  Secondary Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Additional Measures of Efficacy  
• The CR rate is based on responders ( patient s with ORR) who achieved CR as 
a best overall response, as assessed by [CONTACT_431].  
• PFS is defined as the time (in months) o 
PD, or 
 death due to any cause, whichever event is earlier. Patients not 
experiencing PD or having expi[INVESTIGATOR_622281].  
• OS is defined as the time (in months) from the  
 du
e to any cause. Patients not having expi[INVESTIGATOR_622282].  
• Duratio
n of overall response is measured from the first time response 
criteria are met until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease occurs. Patients not experiencing PD or death prior to the ti me of data cut 
or the final database lock will have their event times censored on the last 
date that an adequate assessment of tumor status is made.  
• PFS, OS, durations of any response will be subjected to right censoring. 
Kaplan -Meier methods will apply . 
12.5.3.  Exploratory Analyses  
Correlations of immune factors with response, survival, and toxicity will be explored.  
  

LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828460], evaluation, and 
docume ntation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor. , its authorized 
representative, and Investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will receive approval 
from an IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws o f the pertinent regulatory 
authorities.  
13.2. Protocol Modifications  
The Investigator will not modify this protocol without obtaining the concurrence of the 
sponsor .  All protocol amendments must be issued by [CONTACT_1034], signed and dated by [CONTACT_3786], and should not be implemented without prior IRB approval, except where 
necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor[s], change of telephone 
number[s]).  Responsibilities for reporting protocol amendments to any Regulatory Authority (if 
applicable) and/or IRB are further described in the Ethical Aspects section of the protocol.  
In situations requiring a departure from the protocol, the I nvestigator or other physician in 
attendance will contact [CONTACT_622331] .

required during the course of the study.  
13.4. Record Retention 
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines the Investigator/institution will be responsible for all information in the eCRF and will maintain the source documents that support the data 
collected from each patient, and all trial documents as specified in Essential Documents for the 
Conduct of a Clinical Trial and as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s). The 
Investigator/Institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.  Essential documents must be retained until at least [ADDRESS_828462]. These documents 
will be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_67836].  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the 
responsible Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody must be transferred to a person who will accep t the responsibility.  The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_19619].  
13.5. Data Quality Assurance  
Steps to be taken to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include; the selection of 
qualified Investigators and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the 
Investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_622333] a central laboratory into the 
databas e.  Electronic CRFs will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness by [CONTACT_622334] - site monitoring visits and after their return from the site, and any 
discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator or designees, as appropriate. The data will 
be verified for accuracy.  
Agreements made by [CONTACT_7216]/Institution and any other parties involved in the clinical trial will be in writing as a separate agreement. On -Site Audits  
Representatives of the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance department may visit the site to 
carry out an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy.  
Such audits will require access to all study records, including sourc e documents, for inspection 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828463] been contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency concerning 
an upcoming inspection.  
13.6. Data Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
13.6.1.  Electronic Data  
When using electronic data handling, the Sponsor or their designee will ensure that systems comply with 21CFR Part 11 requirements.  Documentation regarding the 
electronic data systems used in this protocol is located in the study -specific plans or 
SOPS for that particular task.  
13.6.2.  Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) Completion 
Electronic data capture (EDC) will be used for this study.  The site will be suitably trained 
on the use of the eCRF and appropriate site perso nnel will be provided electronic 
signatures.  Data must be entered into the eCRF screens in English. The eCRFs are to be 
completed at the time of the patient's visit, with the exception of results of tests 
performed outside the Investigator's office, so that they always reflect the latest observations on the patients participating in the trial.  
Data must be recorded first on a source document that can be verified before it is entered in the EDC system.  Completed eCRFs are to be signed off by [CONTACT_622335].  All eCRF corrections are to be made by [CONTACT_622336]. The Investigator must authorize changes to the recorded safety and efficacy 
data.  
Completed eCRFs will be submitted according to the Sponsor's instructions, and 
reviewed by [CONTACT_456061].  If necessary, Data Correction Requests will be generated for resolution by [CONTACT_3452].  
13.7. Study Completion/Termination 
13.7.1.  Study Co mpletion  
The Investigator will complete the study and submit all eCRFs in satisfactory compliance with the protocol after study completion.  
13.8. Monitoring  
On-site monitoring visits will be performed by [CONTACT_622337]. Visits are 
usually  made at intervals of at least four to twelve weeks.  The dates of the visits will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_413774] a trial center visit log to be kept at the site. The first post- initiation 
visit will usually be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun.  At these visits the 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828464] 2016  
 monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] 
(source documents). At a minimum, source documentation must be available to substantiate 
proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of adverse events, administration of concomitant medication, drug 
receipt/dispensing/return records, and study drug administration information.  Specific items required as source documents will be review ed with the Investigator prior to the study.  
Findings from this review of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the 
Investigator. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the Investigator (and as 
appropriate the Study Coordinator) w ill be available, the source documentation will be 
available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents.  
 
14. INVESTIGATOR REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS  
14.1. Institutional Review Boards  
This trial will be undertaken only after full approval of the protocol and addenda has been 
obtained from an IRB and a copy of this approval has been received by [CONTACT_1034].  The IRB must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments issued by [CONTACT_1034].  Reports on, 
and reviews of, the trial and its progress will be submitted to the IRB by [CONTACT_622338].  
The IRB must meet all regulatory requirements governing IRBs (CFR, Title 21, Part 56).  
14.2. Informed Consent  
Each patient (or a legally authorized repr esentative) must give written consent (and sign other 
locally required documents) according to local requirements after the nature of the study has been fully explained. The consent form must be signed prior to performance of any study -
related activity.  The consent form that is used must be approved both by [CONTACT_586735].  The informed consent should be in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and the Sponsor’s policies.  
The Investigator must explain to potential patients or their legal representatives the aims, 
methods, reasonably anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the trial, and any discomfort 
it may entail.  Patients will be informed that they are free not to  participate in the trial and that 
they may withdraw consent to participate at any time.  They will be told which alternative 
treatments are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice 
future treatment. Finally, they will  be told that their records may be examined by [CONTACT_229931]. Patients must be given the opportunity to ask 
questions. After this explanation and before entry into the trial, consent should be 
appropriately recorded by [CONTACT_106201]'s or his/her legal representative's dated 
signature.  If a patient and his/her legal representative are unable to read, an impartial witness must be present during the entire informed consent discussion. The signature [CONTACT_622351]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828465] 2016  
 witness will certify the patient's consent. The patient should receive a signed and dated copy of 
the informed consent. The informed consent process should be documented in the patient’s 
medical record.  
In accordance with HIPAA, the written Informed Consent Form must include a patient 
authorization to release medical information to the Sponsor or their representative and/or 
allow the Sponsor or their representative, a regulatory authority, or IRB access to patient’s medical information that includes all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44227], including a 
patient’s medical history.  
14.3. Patient Data Protection 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_622283], e mployees, and agents involved with this 
study will comply with relevant state and federal laws relating to the confidentiality, privacy, 
and security of patient’s personal health information (PHI). They will only create, maintain, use, or disclose any data that is generated by [CONTACT_622339] [INVESTIGATOR_622284], IRB, FDA, or other authorized recipi[INVESTIGATOR_445111], analysis, review, and reporting of this study. Such information shall not be used for any other purposes 
and will remain confidential. P atient records are only to be identified by [CONTACT_622340].  
14.4. Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator agrees to report all AEs to the Sponsor as described in the Adverse Events section.  Furthermore, the Investigator is responsible for ensuring that any co -Investigator or 
sub-Investigator promptly bring AEs to the attention of the Investigator.  If applicable, the 
Investigator also is responsible for informing the participating IRB/IEC of any SAEs.  
14.5. Investigator  
The Investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB review, and regulatory 
inspections by [CONTACT_622341]. The Investigator must 
notify the Sponsor when contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory authority regarding inspection of her/his study site.  
All required data will be recorded in the eCRFs in a timely manner.  All eCRF data must be 
submitted to the Sponsor throughout and at the end of the study.  
If an Investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting the study, the 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor to agree upon an acceptable storage solution. Regulatory 
authorities will be notified with the appropriate documentation detailing the person to whom 
the responsibility has been transferred.  
14.6. Confidentiality  
Unless otherwise specified in the clinical study agreement, the following process shall occur: The Investigator must assure that patients’ anony mity will be maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  In the eCRFs or other documents 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828466] 2016  
 submitted to the Sponsor, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_72560]. The Investigator should k eep a site enrollment log showing codes, names, 
and addresses.  Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (e.g., patients’ written consent 
forms) should be maintained by [CONTACT_30379], in accordance with all 
applicable local and national regulations.  All information provided to the Investigator prior to 
the study, as well as all data developed during the study, is confidential and remains the property of the Sponsor.  The Investigator agrees that no information based on the conduc t of 
this study (including the protocol, the data resulting from this study, or the fact that this study is/was conducted) will be released without prior written consent of the Sponsor unless this requirement is superseded by [CONTACT_29693].  
14.7. Publications  
The Sponsor will be responsible for determining when the study results should be published. The Sponsor will work jointly with the Investigators to publish information. The Investigator 
shall not submit a publication to journals or profession al societies without the prior written 
approval of the Sponsor.

16.3. Calculation of BMI, BSA and Practical Weight  
Unless otherwise specified in this protocol, actual body weight is used for dose calculations of 
treatment agents.  In Patients who are determined to be obese (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2), the practical 
weight  will be used.  
16.3.1.  BMI   
BMI = weight (kg)/[height (m)]2 
16.3.2.  BSA  
BSA = 0.007184  x height (m)0.725 x weight (kg)0.425 
16.3.3.  Practical Weight  
Practical body weight  (average of the actual weight and ideal body weight)  is to be used when 
dosing cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in patients who have a BMI > 3 0.0 kg/m2. 
Note: Practical weight will NOT be used in the calculation of dose for IL -2. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Ideal Body Weight  
Male = 50 kg + 2.3  x (number of inches over 60 inches)  
Example:   ideal body weight of 5’10’’ male  
50 + 2.3 x 10 = 73 kg  
Female  = 45.5 kg + 2.3 (number of inches over 6 0 inches)  
Example:   ideal body weight of 5’3’’ female  
         45.5 + 2.3 x (3) = [ADDRESS_828509]-145

16.5. Expected Toxicities  
16.5.1.  LN-[ADDRESS_828511] -145: 
• Short -term, transient/reversible effects of TIL infusion include fever, chills, shortness 
of breath, increased heart rate, hypotension (prolonged hypotension necessitating 
pressor treatment has been reported) (8) following TIL infusion.    
• Autoimmune melan ocyte destruction resulting in conditions such as vitiligo and 
uveitis have been reported.   
In addition, it should be noted that [ADDRESS_828512] been reported in conjunction with the 
lymphodepletion/TIL/IL -2 protocol.  One patient died of cardiac failure caused by 
[CONTACT_622344] (10), and the other patient developed an 
EBV lymphoproliferative disease 4 months after treatment and died of this lymphoma 8 
months later (3).  
16.5.2.  NMA Lymphodepletion  
The use of the NMA lymphodepletion regimen (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) prior to 
cell administration increases the toxicity of this treatment as profound myelosuppression occurs in all Patient s.  A summary of risks expected with use of each of these agents is 
provided below. Full prescribing information for cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are 
provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS].1  , respectively .

[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity  
Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactio ns to it, any of its metabolites, or to other components 
of the product. Anaphylactic reactions including death have been reported with cyclophosphamide. Possible cross -sensitivity with other alkylating agents 
can occur.  
Urinary Outflow Obstruction  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828513] 2016  
 Cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with urinary outflow 
obstruction.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Warning and Precautions  
Myelosuppression, Immunosuppression, Bone Marrow Failure and Infections  
Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia), bone marrow failure, and severe 
immunosuppression which may lead to serious and sometimes fatal infections, including sepsis and septic shock. Latent infections can be 
reactivated.   
Monitoring of complete blood counts is essential during cyclophosphamide treatment so that the dose can be adjusted, if needed. Cyclophosphamide should not be administered to patients with neutrophils ≤1,500/mm3 and 
platelets < 5 0,000/mm3. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, 
or should be interrupted, or the dose reduced, in patients who have or who 
develop a serious infection. G-CSF may be administered to reduce the risks of 
neutropenia complications associated with c yclophosphamide use. For 
additional information, see Section 5.[ADDRESS_828514] been reported 
with cyclophosphamide.  Urotoxicity can occur wi th short -term or long -term 
use of cyclophosphamide and can be fatal.  
Discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in case of severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Urotoxicity (bladder ulceration, necrosis, fibrosis, contracture and secondary cancer) may require interruptio n of cyclophosphamide treatment or 
cystectomy.   
Before starting treatment, exclude or correct any urinary tract obstructions [see Contraindications]. Urinary sediment should be checked regularly for the presence of erythrocytes and other signs of urotoxicity and/or nephrotoxicity. 
Cyclophosphamide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with 
active urinary tract infections. Aggressive hydration with forced diuresis and frequent bladder emptying can reduce the frequency and severity of bladder 
toxicity. Mesna has been used to prevent severe bladder toxicity.   
Cardiotoxicity  
Myocarditis, myopericarditis, pericardial effusion including cardiac 
tamponade, and congestive heart failure, which may be fatal, have been 
reported with cyclophosphamide the rapy.   
Supraventricular arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation and flutter) and 
ventricular arrhythmias (including severe QT prolongation associated with 
ventricular tachyarrhythmia) have been reported after treatment with 
regimens that included cyclo phosphamide.  
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828515] been reported 
during and following treatment with cyclophosphamide. Late onset 
pneumonitis (greater than 6 months after start of cyclophosphamide) appears to be associated with increased mortality. Pneumonitis may develop years 
after treatment with cyclophosphamide.   
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity.  
Secondary Malignancies  
Cyclophosphamide is genotoxic (see 13.1 [Nonclinical Toxicology] of Fu ll 
Prescribing Information).  Secondary malignancies (urinary tract cancer, 
myelodysplasia, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas) have been reported in patients treated with cyclophosphamide -containing 
regimens.   
Veno- occlusive Liver D isease  
Veno -occlusive liver disease (VOD) including fatal outcome has been reported 
in patients receiving cyclophosphamide -containing regimens. A cytoreductive 
regimen in preparation for bone marrow transplantation that consists of cyclophosphamide in combination with whole -body irradiation, busulfan, or 
other agents has been identified as a major risk factor.  For additional 
information, see Section 5.6  of Full Prescribing Information.  
Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  
Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when ad ministered to a pregnant 
woman (see Section 8.1 [Use in Specific Populations] of Full Prescribing 
Information).  Exposure to cyclophosphamide during pregnancy may cause birth defects, miscarriage, fetal growth retardation, and fetotoxic effects in 
the newb orn. Cyclophosphamide is teratogenic and embryo -fetal toxic in 
mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys.  
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant and to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for up to [ADDRESS_828516]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828517] ome resembling syndrome of inappropriate secretion of 
antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which may be fatal, has been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Common Adverse Events  
Hematopoietic system  
Neutropenia occurs in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. The degree of 
neutropenia is  particularly important because it correlates with a reduction in 
resistance to infections. Fever without documented infection has been 
reported in neutropenic patients.  
Gastrointestinal system  
Nausea and vomiting occur with cyclophosphamide therapy. Anore xia and, 
less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain and diarrhea may occur. There 
are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and 
jaundice occurring during therapy.  
Skin 
Alopecia occurs in patients treated with cyclophosphamide.  Skin rash occurs 
occasionally in patients receiving the drug. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_218586].

l.pdf  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Warning  
BOXED WARNING  
WARNING: FLUDARA FOR INJECTION should be administered under the 
supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of antineoplastic 
therapy. FLUDARA FOR INJECTION can severely suppress bone marrow 
function. When used at high doses in dose -ranging  studies in patients with 
acute leukemia, FLUDARA FOR INJECTION was associated with severe neurologic effects, including blindness, coma, and death. This severe central 
nervous system toxicity occurred in 36% of patients treated with doses 
approximately fo ur times greater (96 mg/m2/day for 5 -7 days) than the 
recommended dose. Similar severe central nervous system  toxicity has been 
rarely (≤0.2%) reported in patients treated at doses in the range of the dose recommended for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Ins tances of life -
threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia have been 
reported to occur after one or more cycles of treatment with FLUDARA FOR 
INJECTION. Patients undergoing treatment with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION should be evaluated and closely monitored for hemolysis.  In a clinical 
investigation using FLUDARA FOR INJECTION in combination with 
pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) for the treatment of refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), there was an unacceptably high incidence of 
fatal pulm onary toxicity.  Therefore, the use of FLUDARA FOR INJECTION in 
combination with pentostatin is not recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Precautions  
General: FLUDARA FOR INJECTION is a potent antineoplastic agent with 
potentially significant toxic side effects. Patients undergoin g therapy should 
be closely observed for signs of hematologic and non -hematologic toxicity. 
Periodic assessment of peripheral blood counts is recommended to detect the development of anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.  
Tumor lysis syndrome associated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION treatment has 
been reported in CLL patients with large tumor burdens. Since FLUDARA FOR 
INJECTION can induce a response as early as the first week of treatment, 
precautions should be taken in those patients at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_622300]. 
There are inadequate data on dosing of patients with renal insufficiency. 
FLUDARA FOR INJECTION must be administered cautiously in patients with renal insufficiency. The total body clearance of [ADDRESS_828521]-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828522] ly correlated with creatinine clearance. Patients with moderate 
impairment of renal function (creatinine clearance 30 -70 mL/min/1.73 m2) 
should have their Fludara dose reduced by 20% and be monitored closely. 
Fludara is not recommended for patients with se verely impaired renal 
function (creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).  For additional 
precautions in special populations, refer to the Full Prescribing Information in 
Section 16.9.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Adverse Events  
The most common adverse events include myelosup pression (neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia), fever and chills, infection, and nausea and vomiting. Other commonly reported events include malaise, fatigue, anorexia, and weakness. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients 
treat ed with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION.  Non -hematoglic AEs observed in two 
clinical trials of fludarabine in patients  with chronic lymphocytic  leuke mia are 
shown in  Table 4.

The most frequently reported adverse events and those reactions which are 
more clearly related to the drug are arranged below according to body 
system. 
Hematopoietic Systems  
Hematologic events (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or anemia) were reported in the majority of CLL patients treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION. During FLUDARA FOR INJECTION treatment of 133 patients with 
CLL, the absolute neutrophil count decreased to less than 500/mm
3 in 59% of 
patients, hemoglobin decreased from pretreatment values by [CONTACT_2669] 2 grams 
percent in 60%,  and platelet count decreased from pretreatment values by [CONTACT_12697] 50% in 55%. Myelosuppression may be severe, cumulative, and may 
affect  multiple cell lines. Bone marrow fibrosis occurred in one CLL patient 
treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION.  
Several instances of trilineage bone marrow hypoplasia or aplasia resulting in ancytopenia , sometimes resulting in death, have been reported in 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828528] 
been reported to occur in patients receiving FLUDARA FOR INJECTION (see WARNINGS section). The majority of patients rechallenged with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION developed a recurrence in the hemolytic process . 
Metabolic  
Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in CLL patients treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION. This complication may include hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, 
hematuria, urate crystalluria, and renal failure. The onset of this syndrome 
may be heralded by [CONTACT_622346].   
Nervous System  
(See WARNINGS section) Objective weakness, agitation, confusion, visual disturbances, and coma have occurred in CLL patients treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION  at the recommended dose. Peripheral neuropathy has been 
observed in patients treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION and one case of wrist -drop was reported.  
Pulmonary System  
Pneumonia, a frequent manifestation of infection in CLL patients, occurred in 16%, an d 22% of those treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION in the MDAH 
and SWOG studies, respectively. Pulmonary hypersensitivity reactions to 
FLUDARA FOR INJECTION characterized by [CONTACT_27926], cough and interstitial 
pulmonary infiltrate have been observed.  In post -marketing experience, cases 
of severe pulmonary toxicity have been observed with Fludara use which 
resulted inARDS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary 
fibrosis, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. After an infectious origin has been excluded, some p atients experienced symptom improvement with corticosteroids.  
Gastrointestinal System  
Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, stomatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding have been reported in patients treated with FLUDA RA FOR INJECTION.  
Cardiovascular  
Edema has been frequently reported. One patient developed a pericardial effusion possibly related to treatment with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION. No 
other severe cardiovascular events were considered to be drug related.  
Genitourinary System  
Rare cases of hemorrhagic cystitis have been reported in patients treated with 
LN-145  
Protocol: C -145-[ADDRESS_828529] 2016  
 FLUDARA FOR INJECTION.  
Skin 
Skin toxicity, consisting primarily of skin rashes, has been reported in patients 
treated with FLUDARA FOR INJECTION.  
16.5.3.  IL-2 
IL-2 administration has been associated with capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737] (CLS) which is 
characterized by a loss of vascular tone and extravasation of plasma proteins and fluid into the extravascular space. CLS results in hypotension and reduced organ perfusion 
which may be s evere and can result in death. CLS may be associated with cardiac 
arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular), angina, myocardial infarction, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_12965], gastrointestinal bleeding or infarction, renal insufficiency, e dema, and mental status changes.  
IL-2 treatment is also associated with impaired neutrophil function (reduced 
chemotaxis) and with an increased risk of disseminated infection, including sepsis and bacterial endocarditis. Consequently, preexisting bacterial infections should be 
adequately treated prior to initiation of IL -2 therapy. Patients with indwelling central 
lines are particularly at risk for infection with gram positive microorganisms. Antibiotic 
prophylaxis with oxacillin, nafcillin, ciprofloxacin,  or vancomycin has been associated 
with a reduced incidence of staphylococcal infections. IL -2 administration should be 
withheld in Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_539835]; continued administration may result in coma.  
The standard app roach to the administration of high -dose IL -[ADDRESS_828530] commonly seen grade 4 events are pulmonary and renal impairment, and mental status changes.  These 
toxicities may sometimes require intubation for protection of the Patient’s airway.  It 
is important to note that although these Patients require significant supportive 
measures during this period, all toxicities are reversible and the overwhelming 
majority of Patients have suffered no long term sequelae following this treatment 
regimen.  However, fatal complications are possible and it is therefore only appropriate to carry out this experimental treatment in the context of life threatening 
metastatic cancer.

   v ABSTRACT Context: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children. There is a window of opportunity to reduce the degree of lifelong disability by [CONTACT_416842].  Objectives: 1) To determine the optimal treatment duration of a novel early mobility training program (dynamic supported mobility, DSM) between 6 to 24 weeks of treatment; and 2) To evaluate the clinical futility of this intervention compared to current rehabilitation practice. Study Design: Exploratory clinical trial Setting/Participants:  Sixty participants with, or with suspected, CP between the ages of 1-3 years will be enrolled. All testing procedures and interventions will occur in the Center for Rehabilitation at CHOP on an outpatient basis. Study Interventions and Measures: Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either dynamic supported mobility (DSM, experimental) treatment or intensity-matched conventional treatment. Repeated assessments of gross motor function will be performed during the treatment phase and at three follow-up points over one year after treatment to track the developmental trajectory of participants’ motor function. Gross motor outcomes of DSM treatment will be compared to published percentile scores of motor function development in CP to determine if the trajectory of predicted motor development is altered, and to outcomes of intensity-matched conventional treatment.

CP is the most common cause of motor disability in children3 with a prevalence that has remained stable over recent decades at more than [ADDRESS_525427], the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)[ADDRESS_525428] to 
   
   2 optimize the potential of the developi[INVESTIGATOR_416822]. As such, the proposed work will also inform the early treatment practices for other developmental disorders, such as early brain injury, Down Syndrome, and various neurogenetic disorders.  1.2 Name [CONTACT_416857] (DSM) - The experimental therapy group will receive dynamic weight support (using the ZeroG Gait and Balance training system, Aretech LLC, Ashburn, VA) during all therapy time, and the environment will be arranged to encourage active motor exploration by [CONTACT_2252], in order to promote the motor variability, challenge, and error experiences that characterize the typi[INVESTIGATOR_416823]. Activities will be graded in difficulty to the child’s ability and will include: moving between the floor and standing, walking, squatting to reach the floor, climbing/walking up and down steps and inclines, and other typi[INVESTIGATOR_416824], somewhat similar to a play gym for toddlers. The floor area within 3 feet below either side of the overhead track for a distance of approximately 20 feet (approximately 120 ft2 total) will be defined with colorful thin rubber interlocking mats and arranged with pediatric toys and activities, tailored to the child’s interests and to encourage motor skills just beyond his/her current ability level. The dynamic support system continuously provides a constant amount of weight assistance (as determined by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541]) by [CONTACT_416843] (i.e. cable lengthens if child moves to the floor and shortens if child climbs up steps, with no lag time). The user’s movements are not restricted at all within this space. This arrangement works well to keep children within the limits of the overhead track and provide ample opportunity and space for motor play and exploration. Initial amount of weight assistance will be determined during the first therapy session by [CONTACT_416844][INVESTIGATOR_541]. Weight assistance will be gradually reduced during the treatment phase as postural control and coordination improve.

No adverse events occurred. Attendance rate was 81% for Participant 3 and 100% for all others. All therapy sessions were videotaped for later activity coding to validate the motor outcomes.

She did not start walking on her own at home, until approximately three weeks later, suggesting that the treatment allowed her to practice more advanced skills than she was able to do on her own. Participant 5 demonstrated improvement during treatment, but the rate of development was less than her baseline rate (0.3). This child made large gains during baseline when she started walking on 
   
   4 her own (at 16 months of age), and as a result there is no indication from these data that the intervention improved her motor ability beyond what could be predicted. She was the least affected participant (above the 50th percentile of GMFCS level I) and likely not an ideal candidate, which informed the refinement of participant selection criteria.

   5 Treatments that improve a child’s motor function by [CONTACT_416845] a large and impactful change that exceeds the level of improvement realized by [CONTACT_416846].14,15,[ADDRESS_525436] six weeks of DSM treatment. Six weeks of treatment was sufficient for one child (Participant 3) to be reclassified from a level II to I. For the other three participants who would meet the proposed selection criteria (Participants 1, 2, and 4), if improvement had continued at the observed rate, approximately [ADDRESS_525437] 12 weeks of DSM treatment will effectively alter the trajectory of motor development to a degree that is sustained at longer term follow-up.  For the four children who would meet the proposed selection criteria, all training videos were coded to investigate if changes were indeed related to the treatment provided. Amounts of training time spent doing activities related to each relevant GMFM subscale (C. Crawling & Kneeling, D. Standing, and E. Walking, Running & Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) were correlated to net changes in the respective subscale. A high degree of variance in subscale outcomes was explained by [CONTACT_416847] (r2 = 0.80, 0.74, 0.98, 1.00, respectively). Video coding also revealed a high level of motor engagement and falls, as intended. The relationship between number of falls and total GMFM-66 change was quite strong (r=0.80), suggesting that falling and learning may have happened simultaneously. Table 2 presents video coding results (note: raw scores for activity subscales are not shown). These video coding data provide the foundation for Hypothesis 1.2 that the amounts of motor error, variability and engagement incorporated into the DSM treatment will be related to outcome.   Table 2. Video coding results, including variance explained (r2) between training time in each GMFM activity subscale (C, D, and E) and motor change, motor engagement, and average number of falls per session.

This suggests that the DSM treatment significantly accelerated their individual rates of motor skill attainment with conventional rehabilitation services. However, motor development is not always linear,47 so this approach is not sufficient to determine the treatment’s futility compared to other treatments. Second, the same four participants all demonstrated net changes (ranging from 2.4-9.7, Figure 2) after only six weeks of treatment that exceeded the corresponding minimal clinically important difference values for treatments that have a large effect size (1.5 for GMFCS level II and 1.3 for level III).45 However, caution should be taken as these minimal clinically important difference values were determined from a sample of children aged 4-18 years, and while unknown, it is possible that the minimal clinically important difference values would be larger earlier in development. Although promising, prospective comparison to intensity-matched current rehabilitation intervention is needed to confirm the potential advantages of DSM treatment prior to progression to a larger efficacy trial. These data support the foundation of Hypothesis 2.2 that children who receive DSM treatment will demonstrate greater gains in gross motor function than participants who receive equal amounts of CONV treatment.   Other Relevant Literature  Determining the optimal dose of pediatric rehabilitation services for children with CP and other developmental disabilities has been identified as a national priority.48  Yet, the majority of research in the field has not explored dose-response outcomes for various interventions. The convenient, rather than scientifically-grounded, dosing of neuromotor rehabilitation historically offered during clinical trials often limits the validity and comprehensiveness of the research findings. Investigation of treatment response over a duration long enough to reach an anticipated behavioral plateau in the early stages of scientific inquiry more adequately prepares an experimental rehabilitation treatment for Phase III efficacy evaluation.49  Both the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (www.ninds.nih.gov) and leaders in neurology50 and neurorehabilitation51 suggest that early clinical trials are the appropriate stage at which to evaluate the futility of a new treatment compared to another treatment or standard of care. These data are critical in determining if and how the science should progress in a definitive Phase III trial. Dobkin further emphasizes that while “a nonactive placebo may be the only therapy in a drug trial if no standard drug therapy exists, comparing a specific rehabilitation treatment to nothing is no longer acceptable.” (2009) The intensity of treatment (minutes per week) in the proposed study will approximate the average amount of physical therapy received by [CONTACT_416848]. The average amount of physical therapy is 82 (SD 60) minutes per week in the [LOCATION_002], and 90 (SD 60) minutes per week in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.[ADDRESS_525439] 
   
   7 amount of services means that not all children would receive this intensity outside of the research study. This variability in current practice is a common issue in identifying “standard of care” in rehabilitation trials. However, it has been determined in gold-standard trials that matching the treatment intensity of the experimental group is the most important component of the “control” group,24,[ADDRESS_525440].  1.4 Compliance Statement  This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416828], all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations, and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by [CONTACT_5787] (ICH). All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478]. The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.   2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives (or Aims) Aim 1. To determine the optimal treatment duration of dynamic supported mobility (DSM) treatment in infants and toddlers with cerebral palsy, between 6 to 24 weeks of treatment. Hypothesis 1.1. Gross motor ability (measured by [CONTACT_416849]-66) will exceed individual predicted values in infants and toddlers with cerebral palsy after 12, 18, and 24 weeks of DSM treatment, and gains will be maintained at 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up points.  Hypothesis 1.2. Gross motor function gains will be positively related to the amount of motor error, variability and engagement experienced during DSM treatment.  Aim 2. To determine the futility of dynamic supported mobility compared to conventional rehabilitation in infants and toddlers with cerebral palsy. Hypothesis 2.1. The frequency of adverse events among participants who receive DSM treatment and those who receive conventional (CONV) treatment will not differ by [CONTACT_7809] 10 percent.  Hypothesis 2.2. Participants who receive DSM treatment will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in gross motor ability (measured by [CONTACT_416849]-66) than participants who receive equal amounts of CONV treatment, and these differences will be maintained at each follow-up point.  
   
   8 2.2 Secondary Objective (or Aim) The secondary objective is to: • Compare physical activity at home, postural control, engagement in daily life, caregiver satisfaction and cognition in the dynamic supported mobility (DSM) therapy group to the conventional (CONV) therapy group.  3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 3.1 General Schema of Study Design The proposed study is a single-blind, randomized exploratory clinical trial with repeated assessments during a 24-week treatment phase and at three follow-up points over 12 months after treatment to track the developmental trajectory of participants’ motor function. Gross motor ability will be compared to published percentile scores of motor function development in CP to determine if the trajectory of predicted motor development is altered, and to outcomes of intensity-matched conventional treatment to determine if continued Phase III investigation is warranted. 3.1.[ADDRESS_525441] provide written informed consent prior to the start of any study activities. Written assents of minors will not be obtained due to the age of the participants.  3.1.2 Study Treatment Phase (start of the study intervention) Children will be able to continue their outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], if their families’ choose to do so. Whether they reduce or continue their pre-enrollment therapy schedule, families will be asked to maintain the schedule of outside physical therapy constant throughout the treatment phase. It is anticipated that most children will be receiving early intervention therapy services in the home. Other medical care will be documented but not restricted. If parents sign CHOP’s standard HIPAA authorization, we will request copi[INVESTIGATOR_416829]-occurring treatments. Treatment will start within one week of Assessment [ADDRESS_525442], both of whom will be trained using the study manual to provide each type of treatment. We will follow intent to treat procedures such that no child will be withdrawn from the study for failing to adhere to the therapy schedule. A training log will be maintained for each session. One session per week will be videotaped (if separate consent is provided) for quality control to ensure that activities between the treatments remain different and are consistent with the distinguishing characteristics.  After enrollment and the initial assessment, participants will be randomized to receive either DSM or conventional (CONV) treatment, using a randomization scheme to ensure that motor ability does not differ at baseline. Participants will also be randomly assigned to either the primary or secondary research therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416830]

Children will receive dynamic weight support (ZeroG®, Aretech LLC, Ashburn, VA) during all DSM treatment time. The environment will be arranged to encourage active motor exploration, somewhat similar to a play gym for toddlers, to promote the motor variability, engagement, and error experiences that characterize the typi[INVESTIGATOR_416823]. The floor area within 3 feet below either side of the overhead track for a distance of 20 feet (approximately 120 ft2 total) will be defined with colorful thin rubber interlocking mats and arranged with pediatric toys and activities, tailored to the child’s interests and to encourage motor skills just beyond his/her current ability. This arrangement worked well in pi[INVESTIGATOR_416831]. Initial amount of weight assistance will be determined by [CONTACT_416844][INVESTIGATOR_541], up to a maximum of 40% of the child’s weight. Greater than 40% weight support produces significant alterations in normal walking biomechanics in healthy adults (unpublished data, communication with system inventor, J. Hidler, PhD). Amount of weight assistance will be re-assessed at the start of each session, and will be gradually reduced as postural control and coordination improve to the minimum amount that allows walking and squatting to reach the floor with the least amount of assistance from the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416825]/she initiates.  CONV treatment. The conventional treatment group will receive traditional, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]-directed pediatric physical therapy. Therapy will focus on early gait training strategies and encouragement of “normal” movement patterns for walking and other age-appropriate movements, with manual guidance or correction of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_416832]. This group may use assistive devices, orthoses, and may receive static body weight support for gait training. Therapy activities will be performed in blocks of practice, with the specific activities and level of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416833]. Examples include: using a posterior rolling walker with ankle foot orthoses (braces), physically guided practice of standing from the floor through half kneeling, manual correction of side steps while cruising at a bench, and repeated sit to stand practice from a small chair.

If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the CRF. 4.4.[ADDRESS_525447] all procedures enumerated for Assessment 5 completed as the early termination visit.  4.4.2 Make-up treatment sessions If subjects miss greater than 20% of therapy sessions, they will be given the option to make up treatment sessions at the end of the study, after Assessment 5 (at 24 weeks). If six or more make-up sessions are completed, a final post-treatment visit will be completed, which will include a repeat of all procedures enumerated for Assessment 5.  5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS 5.1 Screening and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements In addition to the measures listed below, the study database and data collection instruments will also include relevant data elements from the NINDS Common Data Elements (CDE), including elements on Demographics, Health History, Physical Exam, Treatment/Intervention Data, Protocol Experience, and Safety Data (http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/General.aspx#tab=Data_Standards). 5.1.[ADDRESS_525448] will be accessed and reviewed for potential candidates who are patients, as part of the recruitment and screening process. Non – CHOP patients will be asked to provide their relevant medical records with written HIPPA authorization from their medical facility. Screening for eligibility based on medical record review will include: date of birth and review of any significant history of orthopedic, neurologic or cardio-pulmonary conditions.  5.1.2 Physical Examination • Physical therapy examination 
   
   13 • Ability to initiate pulling to stand, score of at least 1 on GMFM Item 52 (inclusion criterion).  • BSID-III, gross motor scale (inclusion criterion)  5.2 Efficacy Evaluations 5.2.1 Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) The primary outcome is the GMFM-66, a Rasch-analyzed measure of gross motor function designed for children with CP.54 Computation of the GMFM-66 score involves statistical weighting of the raw item scores for difficulty. This score will also be used with the patient’s age to determine GMFCS percentile rank.[ADDRESS_525449] designed to measure postural control in young children with physical disabilities.  Physical activity. A wireless activity monitor will be provided to the caregiver, who will be instructed on use of the monitor at home, with a goal of recording 5 total hours of the child’s free play in the following week. An envelope will be provided to return the activity monitor. Amount and magnitude of physical activity will be calculated using corresponding software. Caregiver satisfaction. One caregiver of each participant will rate their child’s performance on the caregiver’s self-identified goals, and the their own (caregiver’s) satisfaction with the child’s performance using the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure.  Child Engagement in Daily Life. One caregiver of each participant will complete the Child Engagement in Daily Life Measure to obtain a measure of the child’s participation in play in daily life. 5.2.3 Weight The child’s weight will be measured at each assessment to ensure that the percent weight support during treatment sessions is accurate.  5.2.[ADDRESS_525450] from repeated testing, this will be completed only every 6 months.  5.2.5 Family Empowerment Scale  One caregiver of each participant will complete the Family Empowerment Scale to obtain a measure of the caregiver’s self-efficacy, also known to influence response to 
   
   14 rehabilitation.58 To avoid caregivers remembering their prior responses, this will be completed only every 6 months.  5.2.6 Possible video or photograph  One treatment session will be videotaped each week to quantify participant error experience (number of falls), motor variability (time spent in one motor activity before moving to the next), and salience or motor engagement (time engaged in a dynamic motor activity) during DSM treatment, allowing evaluation of the relationship of these factors to treatment response. The videotaped sessions will also be coded for the amount of time participants spend doing activities in each of the GMFM subscales, to allow evaluation of the relationship between time spent in each activity category and outcome in each subscale. Randomly selected videos will also be used for quality checks to ensure that the two treatments remain different and consistent with the distinguishing characteristics of each group.  Occasional photographs may be taken, if separate consent is provided, for educational or scientific purposes, or as souvenirs for the children.  5.[ADDRESS_525451] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_20721]. Anticipated and unanticipated adverse events will be recorded to confirm that DSM treatment does not pose greater risks than current interventions.   6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the change in GMFM (Gross Motor Function Measure) from baseline to each post-treatment assessment session.  6.[ADDRESS_525452] descriptive summaries (including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum and range for continuous variables and frequency counts and percentages categorical variables). We will also report the 95% confidence interval for pertinence means and proportions. Baseline characteristics in each group will be compared using two-sample tests, including t-tests, the Mann-Whitney test, and chi-square tests, as appropriate for the respective type of data.  6.2.2 Efficacy Analysis For the analysis of Aim 1, Hypothesis 1.1 (Gross motor ability will exceed predicted values after DSM treatment and gains will be maintained at follow-up), GMFCS percentile ranks will be obtained after 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks of treatment based on actual GMFM-66 
   
   15 scores and age, and will be compared to predicted percentile ranks based on age and initial GMFM-66 score. Mean values and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for actual and predicted scores. Optimal treatment duration will be identified as the maximum change observed at the related time point which is maintained during the following period. If maximum change occurs after 24 weeks, this time will be considered the optimal duration. Spearman correlation will be utilized to analyze Hypothesis 1.2 (Outcomes will be related to the amount of error, variability and engagement during treatment), to estimate the relationship between motor improvement and the amount of motor error, variability and engagement experienced during treatment.  To address Aim 2, Hypothesis 2.2 (Participants who receive DSM treatment will demonstrate greater improvements than participants who receive CONV treatment, and the differences will be maintained at follow-up) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_416851]-[ADDRESS_525453], and chi-square tests, as appropriate for the respective type of data. We will then use a univariate approach for comparing the two treatments using analyses of variance and covariance (ANCOVA). Measurements at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks, as well as at both follow-up points after treatment will be individually compared between the two treatment conditions using baseline score, cognition and caregiver self-efficacy as covariates. We will also use a multivariate approach using linear mixed effects model59 or the Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE).[ADDRESS_525454]-treatment time points. Also, such analyses will allow us to examine the between subjects effects which represent a factor with two levels (treatment conditions) and within subjects effects which represent time effects (pre and post measurements) and a time by [CONTACT_224283]. The random effect model will be implemented utilizing SAS Proc Mixed and the GEE will be implemented by [CONTACT_416852]. (SAS/STAT User's Guide, 2004, Version 9. Cary, NC: SAS Institute, Inc). Cognition and caregiver self-efficacy will be included as covariates in these analyses. Two-sided p values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Similar procedures will be used for the analysis of secondary outcomes, with appropriate tests for parametric (postural control, physical activity) and non-parametric measures (caregiver satisfaction, Child Engagement in Daily Life). 6.2.3 Safety Analysis To address Hypothesis 2.1 (Adverse events will not differ by [CONTACT_7809] 10% between treatments), type and frequencies of adverse events will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_3148]. A magnitude of difference of less than 10% will be considered as similar between treatments. 6.[ADDRESS_525455] size or statistical power, but rather to derive estimates and confidence intervals. A minimum of 15 subjects receiving a novel treatment has been recommended for early studies of dose-response and futility in neurorehabilitation.51 We also calculated predicted change and 95% 
   
   16 confidence intervals for both treatments. Predicted change after DSM treatment was determined from the data of the four pi[INVESTIGATOR_416834]. A mean GMFM-66 increase of 5.3 was observed after six weeks of treatment. Assuming such change will be doubled after 12 or more weeks of treatment, a 10.6 increase from baseline is predicted as a minimum change after DSM treatment. Predicted change after CONV treatment was determined from maximum change in published GMFM-66 scores over six months in a 24 month old child classified as GMFCS level II.55 A 1.8 increase from baseline is predicted after CONV treatment. We estimated that with a sample size of 17 participants receiving each treatment, a 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in GMFM-66 will extend +/- [ADDRESS_525456] deviation (SD) is 9 (nQuery Advisor 6.0), which was larger than observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a conservative estimate. An additional 8 children (4 in each group) will be enrolled to account for an anticipated attrition rate of 20%. Based on random assignment, 21 participants will receive DSM treatment, and another 21 will receive CONV treatment.  7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 7.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  7.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.

All risks and alternative treatment options will be explicitly stated in consent documents. 8.4.[ADDRESS_525461]. Bernbaum. Eligible patients seen in CHOP’s CP clinic and those with CP who are receiving services at the Center for Rehabilitation will also be invited to participate. Potential candidates who are not CHOP patients will be reached through the internet (www.clinicaltrials.gov and the CHOP Research Institute website http://www.research.chop.edu/research/clinical_research/) and mailings to local clinicians, including therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], developmental pediatricians, and pediatric neurologists. All recruitment materials will receive prior ethics approval. We will also be working with the Recruitment Enhancement Core, including posting messages in the "This Week at CHOP" email to employees. Additionally, we will also work with the National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC) to send out notifications regarding our study. For both the "This Week at CHOP" and NARIC postings, we will use the approved blurb below in Section 7.01 (5.0) that is currently used on CHOP's public website. We will also work with PeRC to distribute mailings to potential participants.  PeRC will provide the study team with a list of names and contact [CONTACT_416853]. Potential participants will be asked to call or email a member of the study team for additional information.  Interested participants will be contact[CONTACT_416854] a information about the study. We will also work with Research Communications to create a short video about our study. This video will be distributed to rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_416836]. This video can be shared with colleagues and/or caregivers of potential participants.  8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization A parent or legal representative of each potential participant will receive a verbal and written explanation of the purposes, procedures and risks of the study.

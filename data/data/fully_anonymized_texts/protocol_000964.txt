Primary:  
To observe the anti-tumor effects of INCB018424 in patients with   
relapsed/refractory AML, ALL, and MD S (including CMML), and blast phase  
or tyrosine kinase refractory CML.   
Secondary: 
1. To determine the safety and tolerability  in patients with re lapsed/refractory  
AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinase refractory CML.   2. To determine the pharmacokineti cs and preliminary pharmacodynamic 
activity including the modulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pr otein phosphorylation.  
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.[ADDRESS_510213] adult patients with leukemia still 
die from disease progression, and impr ovements in therapy are still required 
for pediatric patients with resistant or  relapsed leukemia. For patients with 
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who fa il to achieve a complete remission 
(CR) with first attempts at induction or who have relapsed disease, current 
therapy is inadequate with a true long term cure rate of less than 10% and 
therefore, ne w agents are needed.
1 Adult patients with acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (ALL) who fail to achieve a CR with first attempts at induction or who have relapsed disease have a true long term cure rate of less than 10%.
2 Patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who enter blastic 
phase having received prior imatinib ther apy or who fail imatinib therapy for 
blastic phase have a median survival of [ADDRESS_510214]  
INCB018424 phosphate is an inhibitor of the Janus kinase family of protein 
tyrosine kinases (JAKs) that is current ly being developed for treatment of 
myeloproliferative disorders under IND No. 77,456.  Unless otherwise

 noted, INCB018424 phosphate is refe rred to throughout this IND as 
INCB018424.  INCB018424 Phosphate Tablets 5 and 25 mg (free base 
equivalent), as disclosed in IND No. 77,456, will be used in the proposed 
studies described in this IND. Additional  details of the CMC characterization 
of INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical  Investigators Brochure (CIB). 
IND No. 77,455 was submitted to t he FDA Division of Anesthesia, 
Analgesic, and Rheumatology Products to develop INCB018424 Phosphate 
Capsules for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthri tis.  Phase 1 of 
this study (Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-132) has safely completed the short term (10 
day) dosing of normal volunteers with the 25 mg BID doses of INCB018424 
that are proposed to be used in this study.   
2.2.2 In Vitro  Pharmacology of INCB018424 
INCB018424 is a potent inhibitor of all JAK family members (IC 50 values < 5 
nM), with modest selectivity for JAK2. It does not significantly inhibit a broad 
panel of [ADDRESS_510215] the various JAKs.  Moreover, in cell-
based assays relevant to the pathogenesis of MPDs and cancer, such as cytokine-induced JAK-STAT signa ling, cytokine-driven tumor cell 
proliferation as well as growth of  a cell line expressing the JAK2V617F 
mutation, INCB018424 demonstr ates excellent potency (IC
50 values of ~ 80-
150 nM).  This effect is not due to general cytotoxicity, because 
INCB018424 (up to 20 µM) had no signi ficant effect on the growth of 
cytokine-independent cell lines.  In addition, INCB018424 inhibits cytokine-induced JAK/STAT phosphorylation in human whole blood with an IC
50 
value of ~ 300 nM, providing a useful biomarker of INCB018424 pharmacological activity. Additional details as to the in vitro  pharmacology of 
INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical  Investigators Brochure (CIB). 
2.2.3 In Vivo  Pharmacology of INCB018424  
Treatment of mice with or ally administered INCB01 8424 resulted in a dose-
dependent suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation and tumor growth in the cytokine-dependent multiple myeloma INA-6 xenograft model at doses ≥ 10 
mg/kg BID.  Moreover, oral adminis tration of INCB018424 inhibited JAK 
pathway signaling, tumor cell growth and splenomegaly in mice resulting 
from intravenous inoculation of a BaF3 cell line engineered to express JAK2V617F (BaF3-JAK2V617F).  A dditional details as to the in vivo  
pharmacology of INCB018424 may be found in the Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure (CIB).  
 
Pharmacological data obtained in both in vitro  and in vivo  model systems 
support the potential utilit y of orally administered INCB018424 in the 
treatment of JAK-dependent hem atological malignancies.

been administered with monitoring of adver se events, clinical laboratories, 
PK and pharmacodynamic parameters.  All single doses were well tolerated 
with no observed drug-associated adver se events.  The pharmacodynamic 
preliminary, unaudited draft data available indicate that single doses of INCB018424 are able to inhibit interleukin-6 induced STAT3 
phosphorylation in a dose dependent m anner.  The 200 mg dose of [ZIP_CODE] 
produced ~80-95% inhibition of ST AT3 phosphorylation between 1-[ADDRESS_510217] been 
treated at the 25 mg BID dose for at leas t 1 month to establish this dose as 
the MTD in this population. 
 
2.3 Rationale  
The Jak family of kinases comprises four proteins (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2) that can associate with cytokine
 receptor subunits, phosphorylate 
them, and in doing so create docking sites on the receptors for binding of 
Protocol Number 2007-[ADDRESS_510218] of several domains (JH1-
JH7), including a tyrosine kinase domain,  and the functional significance of 
these domains has been characterized by [CONTACT_13984].  Jaks are 
able to associate with the cytokine receptors as well as with each other. 
Dimerization/oligomer ization of cytokine receptor subunits as a result of 
ligand binding leads to juxtaposit ion of Jaks. This results in 
transphosphorylation and activation of their kinase activity and the 
phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins such as Stats, Src-
kinases, and adaptors such as Shc, Grb2, and Cbl.[ADDRESS_510219] been associated with a number of 
disorders. For example, chromosomal translocations resulting in TEL-JAK2 
constructs lead to the constitutive activation of STAT5, IL-3-independent 
cellular proliferation, and l eukemogenesis. The translocation 
t(9;12)(p24;p13) results in the fusion of the kinase catalytic region of JAK2 
with the transcription factor TEL generating the constitutively active TEL-
JAK2. Similarly, infection with oncogenic viruses such as human T-cell 
lymphotrophic virus, type I, and Abelson murine leukemia viruses results in 
enhanced kinase activity of Jaks , possibly accounting for their leukemogenic 
potential.  
The STAT transcription factors are coded by [CONTACT_404647] [ADDRESS_510220] with other 
transcription factors such as the p300/cyclic AMP-responsive element 
binding protein family of coactivators to activate genes. The transcriptional 
activity of STATs may also be regulated by [CONTACT_404648], although the implications of such regulation 
are not known.  
Protocol Number 2007-[ADDRESS_510221], and in GM-CSF- and IL-3-induced proliferation. 
STATs also modulate cellular differentiation and apoptosis. Reconstitution of 
STAT1 in STAT1-null U3A cells (which do not respond to TNF-
 ) restores 
basal caspase expression and renders them sensitive to TNF-induced 
apoptosis. Conversely, STAT3 and STAT5 mediate the antiapoptotic effects 
of IL-[ADDRESS_510222] relapsed/refractory  leukemias for which no standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404633]. Patients with poor-risk myelodysplasi a (MDS) [i.e. refractory anemia with 
excess blasts (RAEB-1 or RAEB-2) by [CONTACT_163387]] and chronic 
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) who fail ed prior therapy are also candidates for 
this protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML) by [CONTACT_404649] O classification (i.e. ≥ 20% blasts), acute lymphocytic 
leukemia (ALL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Patients with CML who are resistant to at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors and have no standard stem cell transplant  option are also eligible . 
 
C. ECOG performance status of 0-2.  
 
D. A female of childbearin g potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy 
test at screening.   Women of child-bearing potent ial (i.e., women who are pre-
menopausal or not surgically sterile) must  use acceptable contraceptive methods 
(abstinence, intrauterine device [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative serum or uri ne pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_510223] the following clinical laboratory values unless considered due 
to leukemic organ involvement: 
1. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl.  
2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered 
due to Gilbert’s syndrome or hemolysis.  
3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT ), and aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) ≤ 2.5x the upper limit of no rmal unless considered due to 
organ leukemic involvement (then ≤ 5x the upper limit  of normal).  
 
H.  Patients with active CNS disease are included and will be treated concurrently 
with intrathecal therapy.  INCB018424 will  not be administered by [CONTACT_404650]. 
 
 
3.2  Exclusion Criteria 
 
Patients with any one of the following criteria will not be eligible for study 
participation:  A. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness in cluding, but not limited to uncontrolled 
infection, symptomatic congestive heart failu re, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric 
illness/social situations that would lim it compliance with st udy requirements.  
 B. Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months, 
symptomatic coronary artery disease, a rrhythmias not controlled by [CONTACT_12617], 
or uncontrolled congestive heart failure. 
 C. Current treatment or tr eatment within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives (whichever is 
longer) prior to the first dose of study medication with another  investigational 
medication or current enrollm ent in another investigationa l drug protocol (unless 
there is evidence of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_404634] a shorter interval from last therapy may be acceptable). 
 D. Females who are pregnant or  are currently breastfeeding. 
 
E. Patients receiving therapy with intermedi ate or high dose steroids greater than 
the equivalent of 10 mg predniso ne per day are not allowed.

 F. Evidence of active hepatitis or hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection 
determined by [CONTACT_404651] 3 months. 
 
G. Any unresolved toxicity equal to or  greater than Grade 2 from previous 
anticancer therapy, except for stable chroni c toxicities not expe cted to resolve, 
such as peripheral neurotoxicity. 
 
H. Incomplete recovery from any prior surgical procedures or had surgery within 4 
weeks prior to study entry, excluding the placement of vascular access.  
 
I. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any concurrent condition that, in the 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would jeopardize t he safety of the patient or compliance 
with the protocol. 
 
J. In patients who are receiv ing medications known to be inhibitors or inducers of 
CYP3A4 every effort will be made to change these medications to acceptable 
alternatives. If this is not safely possible, patients will be excluded from 
participation in the study. If  a patient is already on t he study, must be started on a 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, and is demonstrating benefit from the study , they will be seen 
twice weekly in the first cycle and weekly  in the subsequent cycles for toxicity 
evaluation and their dose will be modified according to the table in section 4.[ADDRESS_510224] of CYP3A4 
inducers and inhibitors is  provided in Appendix I. 
 
 
4. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
4.1  Dose of INCB018424 and Treatment Cycle 
 
This is a phase II study of oral INCB018424 in  patients with relapsed/refractory 
AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinase 
refractory CML. The starting dose of  INCB018424 will be 25 mg po twice daily, 
which has been determined to be the maxi mum tolerated dose in patients with 
myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia and a dose that is tolerated for ten days in 
normal human volunteers.    INCB018424 will be administered orally at  a dose of 25 mg BID for 7 days each 
week for 4 weeks (cycle number 1).  Pati ents will be evaluated after 1 full cycle of 
therapy (28 days) for response.  Res ponding patients or patients with stable 
disease will be allowed to continue on study at a dose of 25 mg INCB018424 BID 
until progression. The respons e assessment for the purpose  of study statistical 
evaluation will be after two cycles (8 weeks) of therapy.  Patients with 
progressive disease, based on clinical and laboratory evaluatio n, will, at the 
discretion of the Investigator , either be removed from the study or, as long as the 
25 mg BID dose has been well tolerated, dose escalated to 50 mg INCB018424 BID. In instances of dose escalation to 50mg BID, patients will be evaluated after 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 10 of 36 
 1 full cycle of therapy (28 days) for respons e and toxicity.  At that point, patients 
with continued progressive disease, based on clinical and labor atory evaluation, 
will be removed from the study.  In inst ances of dose escalation, the response 
assessment for the purpose of study statisti cal evaluation will be after two cycles 
(8 weeks) of therapy at the [ADDRESS_510225] the dose escalation as this population has less of a life-th reatening disease situation. 
   Patients who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_110503], are demonstrating cytopenias not 
thought to be related to disease progr ession and who may be receiving benefit 
from treatment may, at t he discretion of the Investi gator, be dose adjusted to a 
lower dose of INCB018424 BID or an equivalent dose given daily (see section on 
dose modifications below).  Studies in subjects with myelofibrosis with myeloid 
metaplasia using different doses and sc hedules of INCB18424 may be used as a 
guide to dose adjustments in this study.  Patients will initiate the first cycle of t herapy at MDACC. They will have weekly 
visits at their local physician’s office  with physical exam and review of symptoms 
during cycle one. In the absence of intolerabl e side effects, patients may return to 
the local oncologist for laboratory tests, but only MDACC investigators can make treatment decisions.  Patients will re turn to MDACC every [ADDRESS_510226] the drug provided.  For toxicity evaluation, patients enroll ed in the study will be considered in 2 
cohorts (I) those with relapsed/refractor y AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), 
and blast phase CML, and (II) those with ch ronic phase CML. At any time after 6 
patients are enrolled in cohort I (inclu ding AML, ALL, MDS, blast phase CML 
patients), if 30% or more patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be 
directly related to INCB 018424 and lasting longer than 2 weeks, then we will stop 
that cohort of the trial. At any time after 6 patients are enrolled in cohort II 
(including chronic phase CML patients), if 15% or more patients experience 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be dire ctly related to INCB018424 and lasting 
longer than 2 weeks, then we will  stop that cohort of the trial.

 4.2 Administration of INCB018424 
 
This is an open label, non-randomized, study of INCB0 [ZIP_CODE], administered 
orally to patients with relapsed/refra ctory AML, ALL, and MDS (including 
CMML), and blast phase or tyrosine kinas e refractory CML.  The study of 
INCB018424 in each disease listed will be conducted in two parts.  The first 
part is intended to enroll a maximum of 10 patients within each of the four 
disease categories included in this study  and to identify whether significant 
benefit is observed.  If a minimum of one patient shows benefit that is considered significant, there will be an expanded cohort of 20 additional patients treated in that  arm of the study.  
  
Patients will receive 50 mg/day administered orally in two divided doses (i.e., 
BID: every 12 hours ± 2 hours).  Within each arm of the study, three patients 
will be initially treated and observed for toxicity for one treatment cycle (28 
days) before the additional seven patients are entered. Dose reduction will be 
considered if the number of patients ex periencing grade 3 or higher toxicities 
exceed 2/3, 3/4, 4/7, 5/10, 6/14, 7/18, 8/22, 9/26.  Treatment will be 
administered primarily on an outpatient basis, but can be administered as an 
inpatient if the patient is hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_404635].   
 The [ADDRESS_510227] able when stored up to one month 
at 25ºC/60%RH and 40ºC/75%RH; the [ADDRESS_510228] been shown to be stable when stored for three months at 25º/60%RH and 40º/75%RH.  (25ºC = 
77ºF, 40ºC = 104ºF). 
  
 4.3 Supportive Care Guidelines 
  
Supportive measures incl uding erythropoietin, analgesics, blood transfusions, 
antimicrobials, and hematopoiet ic colony stimulating fa ctors for treatment of 
cytopenias are permitted. 
 Prophylactic use of  hematopoietic colony stimulati ng factors  is not permitted.  
 Other chemotherapy, investigational cytotoxic agents, radiation, or biologic 
therapy is prohibited while the patient is on study with the following exceptions during cycle 1: During the first 7 days of study only, patients may receive 
leukaphereses (not more than three procedures per week and not more than five procedures in total to control elev ated blast and/or platel et counts and/or 
hydroxyurea (up to a maximum of 5 gm /day) for a maximum of 14 days.  
Intrathecal chemotherapy to treat isol ated CNS involvement of leukemia is 
allowable.

  4.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may 
continue until one of the following criteria applies: 
 
˜ Lack of objective response after 2 cycles  of therapy (3 cycl es if there is 
dose escalation to 50 mg BID afte r cycle 1) unless INCB018424 is 
considered to be of clinic al benefit to the patient 
 ˜ Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 ˜ Unacceptable adverse event(s)  ˜ Patient decides to withdr aw from the study, or 
 ˜ General or specific ch anges in the patient’s condi tion render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in  the judgment of the investigator. 
 
 4.5 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications 
 
Dose Adjustments 
 
The dose of INCB018424 will be adjusted according to the guidelines shown 
in the following tables for INCB018424 - related clinically  significant toxicity.  If 
a toxicity is not covered in the tabl e, doses may be reduced or held at the 
discretion of the investigator for the pat ient’s safety.  Dose adjustments for 
hematological toxicity are based on the blood counts obtai ned in preparation 
for the day of treatment i.e. CBC within 3 days of Day 1 of that cycle.   
 Patients will be withdrawn from  the study if they fail to recover to CTC AE 
grade 0 to 2 (or within 1 gr ade of starting values for pre-existing laboratory 
abnormalities) from a treat ment-related toxicity within 2 weeks (leading to 
treatment delay of > 2 weeks) unless t he investigator feels that the patient 
should remain in the study because of  evidence that the patient is/may 
continue deriving benefit from continuing study treatment. 
 Patients with toxicities that are manageable with s upportive therapy may not 
require dose reductions.  Patients r equiring greater than [ADDRESS_510229] awn from the study, unless INCB018424 is 
considered to be of clinical benefit to the patient.  Dose modification for neutropenia and thrombocytopenia grade 4 persisting 
beyond 2 weeks of therapy is allowed if the treating physi cian believes them 
to be related to the treatment and not the underlying disease. The dose can 
be held until the AE is to grade 2 or lo wer; then INCB018424 will be restarted 
at [ADDRESS_510230] of t he drug and uncontrolled disease. 
 
 
Dosing for INCB018424- Related Toxicities 
 
NCI CTC AE Grade INCB018424 
Grade 0-2 non-hematological to xicity No dose reduction. 
Grade 2 toxicities that are persistent and intolerable (e.g. stomatitis) can result in dose delays or dose reduction to [ADDRESS_510231] with other drugs.

 7.2 Pharmacodynamic Method  
7.2.1 Blood Collection  
 
On Day 1 of Cycle 1 (at pre-dose and 2 hours after dose), and on Day 1 of 
Cycles 2 and 3 (pre-dose sample only) venous whole blood samples will be 
obtained for both whole blood and plasma PD markers according to the Study 
Protocol Number 2007-[ADDRESS_510250] dose of 
study medication preceding the blood draw.   
 See Appendix F for specif ic information regarding the procedures for PD blood 
sample collection, processing and shipment. 
 
7.2.2 Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
 
The whole blood PD samples will be evaluated both unstimulated and following 
stimulation with a cytokine (e.g., IL-6) to  activate the JAK/STAT pathways and 
then analyzed for both basal and activated le vels of JAKs and STATs, including 
phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5.  Phos phorylated STAT3 and STAT5 will be 
measured using phospho-specific STAT3 a nd STAT5 ELISAs.  For each patient, 
the percent inhibition of phosphorylated STAT3 and/or STAT5 will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_404655].  
Additional PD markers (e.g ., monitoring other cell sign aling pathways, measuring 
specific cell populations or measuring ce ll surface markers that can be measured 
by [CONTACT_4133], Western blot or ELISA) may be evaluated utilizing excess 
whole blood PD samples.  In addition, using the plasma PD sample , changes in plasma cytokine levels and 
markers of disease activity will be monito red over time using specific ELISAs.  
For each patient, the percent change in le vel will be calculated by [CONTACT_404656].  Additional 
PD markers (e.g., other cytokine levels , chemokine levels or other non-genomic 
protein markers that can be measured by [CONTACT_404657]) may be 
evaluated utilizing excess PD or PK sample s.  These analyses will be carried out 
by [CONTACT_109912] (Wilmingt on, DE) or Incyte’s designee.

will provide specific instructions to the Investigators. 
 8.  REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
Adverse event reporting will be as per the current NCI criteria and the MDACC Adverse Event Reporting Policy for Leukemia Phase I and early Phase II studies. 
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) vers ion 3.0 will be utilized for adverse event 
reporting. (http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html).   
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event is – any adverse dr ug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of t he following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places 
the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the 
adverse experience as it occurred. It  does not include an adverse experience 
that, had it occurred in a more se vere form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242] 
• A persistent or significant disability/in capacity – a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
 Important medical event s that may not result in death,  be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious  adverse drug experience when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may j eopardize the patient or subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such  medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the development  of drug dependency or 
drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).   
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 28 of 36 
 • Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important  medical event can and should be 
reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_97591]. 
 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of 
a SAE must by [CONTACT_404658]  “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center

 8.1  Expedited Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Leukemia associated symptoms are not to be reported as  adverse events on this 
protocol. Myelosuppression and associated complication are expected events during 
leukemia therapy and are part of the treatment success (marrow emptying of 
leukemia cells).  Therefore, myelosuppre ssion and associated complications such as 
fever, infections, bleeding, and related hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_404641].  Only prolonged myelosuppression, as  defined by [CONTACT_404659], i.e. marrow cellularity <5% on day 42 or later (6 weeks) from start of 
therapy without evidence of leukemia, will be reported as an SAE and considered in 
defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404642] a new cycle of treatment does not 
require expedited reporting. SAEs occurring in  patients registered to the trial but not 
receiving any protocol agents (ie occurring before protocol treat ment) do not require 
expedited reporting.   For this protocol, the following adverse events are specifically excluded from expedited AE reporting:

the safety analyses.  
 
9.1.1 Selection of Sample Size 
 
This phase II study will use a Gehen’s design. Assuming a null response rate of 0%, targeting a 15% response rate and power=80%, the tr ial will initially 
enroll 10 patients in each disease category:   1) AML; 2) A LL; 3) MDS; and 4) 
CML. If at least one response is achieved in the 10 patients in a disease   
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 30 of 36 
 Category, then a total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this disease category. 
Thirty patients will provide a confidence interval for response rate with half-
width=0.13, assuming the true response rate  is 15%. The total sample size is 
120. 
 
 For toxicity evaluation, patients enroll ed in the study will be considered in 2 
cohorts (I) those with relapsed/refractor y AML, ALL, and MDS (including CMML), 
and blast phase CML, and (II) those with ch ronic phase CML. At any time after 6 
patients are enrolled in cohort I (inclu ding AML, ALL, MDS, blast phase CML 
patients), if 30% or more patients experience grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be 
directly related to INCB 018424 and lasting longer than 2 weeks, then we will stop 
that cohort of the trial. At any time after 6 patients are enrolled in cohort II 
(including chronic phase CML patients), if 15% or more patients experience 
grade 3 or 4 toxicity thought to be dire ctly related to INCB018424 and lasting 
longer than 2 weeks, then we will  stop that cohort of the trial. 
 
 
9.2  Efficacy and PK/PD Variables 
 
The efficacy variables include  
 Clinical response 
 Cytogenetic response 
 The PK and PD variables will include: 
o Determination of the PK of INCB018424 by [CONTACT_404660].  
o Determination of PD markers includ ing % inhibition of STAT3/5 protein 
phosphorylation 
 
9.2.1  Efficacy and PK/PD Analysis 
 
Efficacy analyses will be exploratory in nature.  All efficacy measures will be 
estimated with 95% confidence interval s at the dose used in the expanded 
cohort.  The clinical response and the hematological response will be estimated with 95% confidence interval s at each time point.  The response 
rates over time may be analyzed graphi cally or using a statistical model. 
 The PK parameters of INB018424 will be summarized using descriptive statistics, and the log-transfo rmed INCB018424 PK parameters will be 
compared using a 1-factor analysis of variance.  The mean values of the PK parameters may be compared to historical data in healthy volunteers to 
determine if the INCB018424 PK profile is different between patients with 
hematological malignancies  and healthy patients. 
 For each patient who has taken study m edication, the PD parameters will be 
calculated to explore preliminary evidence of PD activity by [CONTACT_404661] 2007-[ADDRESS_510255]-dose.  If the p-STAT3/[ADDRESS_510256], an explorat ory PK/PD analysis will be performed. 
 
9.3  Safety Analysis 
 
The clinical safety data (vital signs, EC Gs, routine laborator y tests and adverse 
events) will be analyzed using summary statis tics (e.g., mean, frequency) and no 
formal statistical comparisons among the treatment gro ups are planned. 
 
9.3.1  Adverse Events 
 Severity of adverse events will be  based on the NCI–CTCAE v3.0 (NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Publ. Aug 9, 2006). The subset of adverse events that are cons idered by [CONTACT_95334] a 
possible or probable relationship to st udy medication will be considered to be 
treatment-related adverse ev ents.  If the Investigat or does not specify the 
relationship of the adverse event to study medication, the adverse event will 
be considered to be treatment-related.  The incidence of adverse events and 
treatment-related adverse events will be tabulated.  
 9.3.[ADDRESS_510257] values outside the no rmal range will be assessed for drug 
association based on screening and baseline va lues and for severity based on 
the normal ranges for the clinical refe rence laboratory.  The incidence of 
abnormal laboratory values and shift t ables relative to baseline will be 
tabulated.    
9.3.3  Vital Signs 
 Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_404644]) 
at each assessment time.  Vital sign re sults will be reviewed for clinically 
notable abnormalities and pati ents exhibiting clinically notable vital sign 
abnormalities that were not present at screening or baseline will be listed. 
 
9.4  Study Definitions 
 
Survival, time to progressi on, time to treatment failu re, and duration of response 
will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves for each patient group 
  9.4.1    Survival  
"Survival" is defined as the period of time from date of first study drug  
administration to the date of deat h or date patient withdrawn from 
study. 
Protocol Number 2007-0925 
October 13, 2008 
Page 32 of 36 
  
  9.4.2    Time to Progression 
 
"Time to Progression" is defined as t he period of time from the date of  
first study drug administration to the date that the patient is withdrawn  
because of clinical or radiographic progressive disease or death from  
any cause.   
 
9.4.3    Time to Treatment Failure 
 
"Time to Treatment Failure " is defi ned as the period of time from the  
date of first study drug administrati on to the date of wit hdrawal from the 
study for any reason other  than study closure. 
 
  9.4.4     Duration of Response 
 
"Duration of Response " is defined as the period of time from the date 
of first objective response to the date of progression. "Duration of 
Response" is defined for patients with an objective response only. 
 
 9.4.5 Time to Response 
 
"Time of Response " is defined as t he period of time from the date of 
first study drug administration until the first objective documentation of 
response.    
 
  9.4.[ADDRESS_510258] one dose (full or partial  dose) of study drug.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_510259] be assessed for response to 
treatment, unless there ar e major protocol treatment deviations or they 
are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response,  2) partial response, 3) stable 
disease, 4) progressive diseas e, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxici ty, 7) early death because of other

 cause, or 8) unknown (not assessable,  insufficient data).  [Note:  By 
[CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” 
status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 
10.0 ETHICS 
 
10.1 Institutional Review Boar d or Ethics Review Committee 
 It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assure that all aspects of the ethics review are conducted in accordance with the current Declaration of Helsinki as described in the International Conferenc e on Harmonisation (ICH) E6: Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and/or  local laws, whichever provides the 
greatest level of protection for the study participants.  The protocol and any information supplied to the patient to obtain informed consent, including written informed consent form(s), patient recrui tment procedures (e.g., advertisements), 
and written information to be provided to pat ients (information leaflets), must be 
reviewed and approved by a qualified IRB/ ERC prior to enrollment of participants 
in the study.  Amendments to the protocol and revisions to the informed consent must also be 
submitted to and, if required,  approved by [CONTACT_1201]/ERC. 
 At intervals required by [CONTACT_1201]/ERC, but not less than annually, the Investigator 
must submit to the IRB/ERC a progress report with a request for re-evaluation 
and re-approval of the study.    
After completion or termination of the study, the Investigator must submit a final 
report to the IRB/ERC.  This  report should include:  dev iations from the protocol, 
the number and types of participants eval uated, the number of participants who 
discontinued (with reasons),  results of the study, if  known, and significant 
adverse events, including deaths that o ccurred during the conduct of the study. 
 The Investigator, as part of the records retention requirements for the study, must 
maintain documentation of all submissions, correspondence, and approvals to and from the IRB/ERC.  Each clinical Investigator is responsible to conduct the study in accordance with the protocol, all applicable laws, regulations, and GCP according to ICH guidelines.  
10.[ADDRESS_510260] the IRB/ERC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_404645].  The document must be in a language understandable to the patient and must 
specify who informed the pat ient.  Where required by [CONTACT_1769], the person who 
informs the patient must be a physician.  After reading the informed consent documen t, the patient must give consent in 
writing.  The patient’s consent must be c onfirmed at the time of consent by [CONTACT_404662]. 
 If the patient is unable to read, oral pr esentation and explanation of the written 
informed consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence of an impartial witness.  Consent must be confirmed at the time 
of consent orally and by t he personally dated signature [CONTACT_404664] a local 
legally recognized alternative (e.g., the patient’s thumbprint or mark).  The 
witness and the person conducting the in formed consent discussions must also 
sign and personally date the consent document.  
A copy of the signed consent document must be given to the patient.  The 
original signed consent document will be retained by [CONTACT_737]. 
 The Investigator will not undertake any m easures specifically required only for 
the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  The Investigator must inform the patient ’s primary physician about the patient’s 
participation in the trial if  the patient has a primary physician and if the patient 
agrees to the primary ph ysician being informed. 
 
10.2.1 Update of Informed Consent  The informed consent and any other in formation provided to patients or 
the patient’s legally acceptable representative, should be revised 
whenever important new information becomes  available that is relevant to 
the patient’s consent, and should re ceive IRB/ERC approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_143197].  The Investi gator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_404663]’s legally acceptable representative of  all pertinent aspects of the study and of any 
new information relevant to the patient’s willingness to continue 
Protocol Number 2007-0925

 participation in the study.  This co mmunication should be documented.  
During a patient’s participation in the tr ial, any updates to the consent form 
and any updates to the written informa tion will be provided to the patient.

[ADDRESS_890335]  
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy with almost 2,[ADDRESS_890336] 
topped over 90% in the past decade, overweight and obese pediatric ALL patients have a 50% greater risk of relapse than normal weight children.  With about [ADDRESS_890337] observed that: 1) nearly half ALL patients are overweight or obese at diagnosis, 2) all patients, regardl ess of starting weight, gain significant fat mass over the first month of 
therapy (on average 20 -30%), and 3) obesity at the time of diagnosis is associated with a higher 
likelihood of poor response to chemotherapy as evidenced by [CONTACT_660270] (mini mal residual 
disease) after induction therapy . Together, these data show that body fat is a significant risk factor for 
ALL treatment failure, and that its negative effects are evident within the first month of treatment .  
Recent laboratory and clinical data illustrates the ability of diet restriction and physical activity to 
improve chemotherapy efficacy, reduce treatment -related toxicities and better overall quality of life .  
 However, to our knowledge, no clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of such a comprehensive, 
integrative medicine appr oach to improve chemotherapy efficacy and quality of life in ALL patients 
during intensive therapy, let alone any pediatric cancer population .  Given the importance of successful 
induction therapy in predicting long term survival and the negative role of o besity on treatment success, 
we are proposing a complete personalized dietary and exercise intervention for pediatric ALL patients 
that aims to reduce fat gained during induction therapy, thereby [CONTACT_660271] . 
 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN SCHEMA  
 
1.0  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Hypothesis:  

 
15 
 In pre-adolescents, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) diagnosed with NCI/Rome High -Risk B -
precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR -ALL), reducing gains in adiposity (i .e. fat mass) will 
improve leukemia sensitivity to induction chemotherapy, reduce post -induction minimal residual 
disease (MRD), reduce fatigue and obesity -associated toxicities, and improve quality of life . 
 
1.2 Primary aim :   
 
In AYA patients newly diagnosed with HR -ALL, to quantify the impact of a personalized dietary 
and activity intervention to mitigate chemotherapy -induced body fat gain throughout the critical 
first month of treatment ("induction") .  
 
1.3 Secondary aims :   
 In AYA subjects newly diagnosed with HR -ALL:  
 
1. To compare the rate of leukemia “positive” minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone 
marrow at end of induction (≥ 0.01% mononuclear cells) in those who received the 
intervention as compared to a historical controls . 
 
2. To assess adhe rence to, and feasibility of, implementing a personalized and comprehensive 
dietary and exercise intervention during the first month of intensive chemotherapy  
 
1.4. Exploratory aims : 
 
In AYA subjects newly diagnosed with HR -ALL:  
 
1. To evaluate persistence or extinguishing of this effect over months of continued dose-
intensive pre -Maintenance phases of chemotherapy  
2. To characterize the direct impact as compared to baseline of the intervention on self - and 
family - reported quality of l ife (QOL) outcomes including fatigue, mood, social interaction, 
and cognitive impairment reported via the PedsQL questionnaire and Child and Adolescent 
Scale of Participation (CASP) following the induction phase and serially during dose -intensive 
phases of  chemotherapy . 
3. To quantify the effect of adiposity on the activity of leukemogenic JAK2/STAT3, PIK3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK , and other signaling pathways in leukemia cells as determined 
by [CONTACT_660272] . 
4. To quantify the effect of adiposity and of the  intervention on the metabolic activity of 
leukemia blasts and of adipocytes as assessed by [CONTACT_14799] -1, other obesity -associated cytokine 
signaling pathways, adiponectin, leptin, free fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, and levels 
oxidative stress.  
 
[ADDRESS_890338] shown 
that obesity increases the risk of cancers such as leukemia, and can impair leukemia treatment and patient survival (1 -3).
  In adults treated for breast and colorectal cancer, altering nutritional intake and increasing 
physical ac tivity during treatment improves efficacy (4,5) while limiting treatment symptoms like fat gain 
and fatigue (6) .  In this proposed study, we will explore how a dieting and exercise intervention throughout 
the first month of treatment may counteract the adv erse impact of body fat on leukemia therapy efficacy, 
toxicity, and quality of life . 
 2.[ADDRESS_890339] a higher risk of mortality from their disease (3) . In 2007, a la ndmark study in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) led by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Butturini from the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7723] (CHLA) demonstrated in two large cohorts (4,314 
and 1,160 patients) that obesity at the time of diagnosis increases risk of relapse in childre n with National 
Cancer Institute/Rome High-Risk B -precursor ALL (HR -ALL) by 50% (1), a finding independently confirmed 
in a different population of children (7)  in obese adults (8) , and by [CONTACT_63700] -analysis (2) .  In a recent study, 
36% of children with ALL were overweight or obese at diagnosis (9) , while in another cohort 23% of 
children with HR -ALL continued to be obese throughout therapy (10) .  In our earlier cohort of adolescent 
and young adults with HR -ALL treated at CHLA, we  found an even higher prevalence of high body fat 
whereas 48% were overweight or obese at diagnosis . Our data also showed that all individuals –  both 
those lean and those obese - gain a significant amount of adipose tissue during the first month of 
treatmen t alone (“induction”) .  On average, patients gained ~20 -30% of fat above their starting body fat 
percentage .  The use of glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone and prednisone during induction therapy 
likely contribute to this fat gain, as they stimulate adi pogenesis and appetite.   Predisposition to inactivity 
due to intensive leukemia treatment combined with steroid -induced dietary derangements are therefore 
likely moderating factors of this marked gain in body fat .  As response to leukemia treatment in the first 
month of therapy is a key determinant of overall prognosis and risk for relapse, and as obesity and body 
fat are risks factors for relapse, an intervention aimed at reducing the gain in body fat has potential to 
improve leukemia therapy efficacy star ting from the initial time of diagnosis .  
   
2.[ADDRESS_890340] century (11) . Recent experiments have focused on the theory of “differential stress resistance,” a diet 
restrictive metabolic state that increases normal tissue, but not cancer cell, tolerance to chemotherapy 
(12). During carcinogenesis, cancer cells acquire mutations to various metabolic oncogenes, such as Akt  
and Ras, which allow uncontrolled proliferation .  During dietary restriction and the subsequent lack of 
nutrients and growth factors, normal cells down -regulate their metabolic activity while cancer cells 
 
[ADDRESS_890341] cancer cells . This was demonstrated in a transgenic mice with human neuroblastoma fasted for 
48 hours prior to etoposide treatment . The fasted mice not only survived longer than non -fasted mice but 
also suffered less drug -induced toxicity (13) .  
 
While such a severe starvation diet is not feasible in the clinical setting, altering dietary composition 
and/or reducing caloric intake is sufficient to see similar results . In a murine prostate cancer model , mice 
fed with either a low -fat or no -carbohydrate diet had significantly reduced tumor growth compared to 
m i c e  o n  a  “ W e s t e r n ”  d i e t  ( 1 4 ) . Similarly, a low carbohydrate, high protein, isocaloric diet limited 
squamous cell carcinoma and breast cancer growth  in mice (14) .Even restricting total caloric intake during 
treatment by 30% regardless of dietary makeup reduced breast tumor aggressiveness and tumoral fat 
content (15) . Our own preliminary research (described below) has demonstrated a similar effect of c aloric 
and fat restriction on reducing weight and improving survival of obese mice with ALL . 
 Physical activity during therapy has also been shown efficacious to augment cancer sensitivity . Mice that 
were allowed to run on a wheel had slower breast tumor g rowth and improved immune function 
compared to non -exercised mice (16) . Furthermore, the amount of running inversely correlated with the 
size of the tumor . Similarly, serum from men who exercise for one hour prevented prostate cancer growth 
in vitro  compar ed to cells in serum from non- exercising men (17) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_660253], the translation of these laboratory findings into the clinical setting has remained a ba rrier . 
 Diet and exercise have concrete benefits in addition to potentially augmenting chemotherapy efficacy.  
Multiple clinical trials conducted in the last ten years have demonstrated the ability of diet and/or exercise 
to prevent chemotherapy -associated fat gain, reduce fatigue and improve emotional well -being in adults 
with solid tissue and hematological cancers (5, 18, 19) . Furthermore, the American Cancer Society has 
recommended that proper nutrition and physical activity play a role in all phases of c ancer treatment (20) .  
 
 
2.4 DIET AND ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR OBESITY  
With 1 6.9% of 2-19 year olds  being obese (21) and at risk for serious co -morbidities (22), there is a 
necessity for effective obesity -targeted pediatric interventions .  While many interventions have long 
existed for obese adults, their efficacy in obese children has only begun to be explored recently.  Obese 
children without cancer randomized to an intervention prescribing 90 minutes of moderate exercise three 
times per week, a hypocaloric diet, and weekly meetings with a dietician had a lower BMI, body fat 
percentage and LDL cholester ol level than children receiving only individual diet or exercise (23) . Similarly, 
a 16 week low -carbohydrate plus aerobic and strength training intervention proved more effective in 
reducing BMI, body fat and fasting glucose compared to diet or exercise a lone (24).   
 
2.[ADDRESS_890342] been developed to assess QOL in the pediatric cancer population.  One such tool, the Pediatric Quality 
of Life Inventory (PedsQL), in conjunction with the PedsQL 3.0 Fatigue Module, has been shown to be 
particularly effective in assessing physical, emotiona l and social functioning, fatigue, pain, nausea, anxiety 
and cognitive problems among others (25) .  
 
Using this assessment tool, it has been shown that children actively undergoing chemotherapy have a 
lower QOL than healthy children (26) or even those 1 year removed from chemotherapy (27) . Additionally, 
researchers have measured the changes in patient QOL over the course of ALL therapy . In patients with 
SR-ALL or HR -ALL, nausea, procedural and treatment anxiety and worry were worse during induction 
compar ed to maintenance therapy (28) . Another similar study demonstrated a lower health -related QOL 
in patients in induction therapy compared to all other phases of treatment (29) .  
 Little research has been performed to analyze the effect of physical activity o n QOL in ALL patients 
undergoing chemotherapy .  One randomized trial demonstrated improved QOL in pediatric cancer 
patients, including those with ALL, who participated in physical activity sessions during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (30). In adolescent survivors of AL L, leisure -time physical activity was also associated with improved QOL 
(31). Greater research is needed to better understand the ability of physical activity, and dietary 
intervention, to improve patient QOL during and after chemotherapy .

3.0 PRELIMINARY DATA  
 
 
19 
 Obesity is a common problem in our patients with ALL .  
In our cohort of adolescents with HR -ALL at CHLA, 48% 
were overweight or obese at diagnosis . Further, from the 
time of diagnosis to the end of the induction phase, 
subjects had an ~25% increase in body fat over these first 
28 days of chemotherapy alone (from 23 .3±9.1% at t ime 
of diagnosis to 3 3.7±9.8% at end of induction, p<0 .001, 
Fig. 1). Even more striking, this gain in body fat pecentage 
was present in the entire cohort regardless of starting 
body composition (Fig 1 .). Body fat then increased even 
further, to a mean of 3 7.1±7.9% by [CONTACT_660273], following approximately seven months of 
intensive chemotherapy (p<0 .001, not shown) .   Overall, 
this increase in body fat represents a gain of 5 .2±4.9 kg of 
adipose tissue over the entire study period .  Given  our 
findings that adipose tissue can directly impair chemotherapy efficacy on ALL (32,33), this gain in body fat 
during such the  critical chemotherapy dose-intensive treatmentr period is very concerning . 
 
Obesity impacts ALL survival within the first month of treatment . Treatment for childhood ALL generally 
lasts for [ADDRESS_890344] month of treatment (induction) is intense including prolonged high doses of 
steroids, and weekly c hemotherapy, and frequent 
physician visits.  Response to induction therapy 
through clearance of leukemia from the bone marrow 
as measured by [CONTACT_660274] 
“minimal residual disease” (MRD) is generally 
accepted as one of the best predictors of long -term 
survival (34) .  Given the association observed 
between obesity at diagnosis and EFS (1), we examined whether weight status at diagnosis would 
increase the risk of residual leukemia at the end of 
induction as measured by [CONTACT_417010] .  To do this, we 
retrospectively evaluated the records of [ADDRESS_890345] positivity (as defined per COG by [CONTACT_660275] ≥ 0.01%) was increased in 
children who were overweight or obese (Fig 2 above) . 
The strongest association was in obese patients, who had a statistically and clinically significant higher risk 
of persistent MRD (Odds ratio 2 .5, 95% CI 1 .2 – 5.1, p = 0 .014, adjusted for NCI risk group and validated 
leukemia risk factors) but with increased risk present in the overweight too (OR 1.37, p=0 .046 for the 
three weight -group analysis) .  Evaluation of BMI percentile as a continuous variable further confirmed 
increased prevalence beginning in the overweight range (Fig . 2).  Thus, the effect of overweight and 
obesity to worsen EFS is present during Induction . 
Fig 2. BMI percentile and MRD positivity 
(≥0·01%) .   

 
20 
  
The effects of obesity are reversible . As 
weight is not static during ALL therapy (10), 
we recently evaluated the effect of duration of exposure to extreme weight on survival 
(Fig. 3, 35) .  In a restrospective COG study 
led by [CONTACT_660276] . al., in 2,008 children with 
HR-ALL, we determined that while children 
who were obese for greater than 50% of the 
early intensive chemotherapy phase had a 
poorer event free survival (HR of event = 
1.43 [1.04-1.96] compared to those of 
“normal” weight), obese children whose 
weight normalized out of the obese range 
for more than 50% of the time of early intensive therapy had an improved outcome similar to those never 
obese (HR = 0.99 [0.62-1.58]). These d ata suggest the effect of obesity might be reversible .  
 
To address this important question, we designed 
experiments to determine whether or not 
dietary intervention that was initiated when 
leukemia is diagnosed could improve outcome.  
Diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and matched 
controls were transplanted with ALL cells and chemotherapy with vincristine (VCR) was 
initiated 7 days after transplant, as previously 
described (3 2). At this point, half of the obese 
mice were switched to a low (10%) fat diet . Thus, 
this experiment simulated the clinical condition in which a dietary intervention could be initiated 
at the time of diagnosis, namely at the same time 
that chemotherapy w ould be started . 
Remarkably, obese mice switched to a low fat 
diet had a substantially improved survival compared to the non -switched animals (p<0 .001), and even 
survived longer than controls that had been raised on the low fat diet (p< 0.01, Fig 4) . Thus, switching mice 
from high fat to low fat diet when treatment is started substantially improves leukemia survival .  
 Obesity increases toxicity .  As part of the same COG desribed above (Orgel et . al)., we also evaluated 
obesity as an ongoing risk for toxicity . In doing so, we found a striking effect of obesity on toxicity within 
each phase of pediatric ALL chemotherapy for children with HR -ALL: in 2,008 children (representing 
13,946 cycles of chemotherapy), obesity was associated with increases in hepa tic (OR = 1 .32 [1.15-1.51], 
p<0.001) and pancreatic (OR = 1.53 [1.22-1.92], p<0 .001) toxicity within each cycle of chemotherapy as 
compared to lean or underweight children . Toxicity affecting the liver and pancreas are specifically 
Fig 3. EFS per BMI during HR -ALL Therapy  
Fig 4. Diet affects ALL survival . Dieted mice 
were switched to 10% fat diet on day 7, when 
vincristine (VCR) treatment was initiated .

 notable in ALL regimens as they limit our ability to deliver optimal dosing of chemotherapy . Of note, and 
germane to the secondary objectives of this proposal, obese children also suffered from reduced strength 
during therapy (OR = 1 .33 [1.08-1.64], p<0 .001) as compared to those lean/underweight . Healthy 
reduction in body fat therefore has significant potential to not only improve survival, but to reduce key 
toxicities during ALL therapy . 
 
Physical activity can be targeted in ALL.  In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_660254], we assessed 37 patients ages 10 -18 (68% male; 65% 
Latino) using the Activity Preferences and Participation Scale (APPS), a newly developed measure designed 
to identify activity preferences, activity frequency, and social engagement in activity . The tool was 
administered on an iPad, and included perceptions of activity levels, self -reported changes in activity 
levels since diagnosis, and perce ived barriers to engaging in physical activity and the importance of 
physical activity . Of the participants, 14 were in the induction/consolidation phase of treatment, 12 in 
Maintenance, and 11 off - treatment .  Forty percent of individuals in the sample we re overweight or obese . 
At all phases of treatment, participants strongly preferred and participated in sedentary activities . There 
was a high correlation between activity preference and activity participation in moderate -vigorous 
activities . Of particular  relevance to the present study is that more than half of the participants in the 
induction/consolidation phase stated that fatigue, poor balance or weakness, and energy levels were barriers to participation in physical activity, while approximately 1/[ADDRESS_890346] declines reported in the induction/onsolidation (100%) . All participants 
reported that they  would like to be more physically active .  As would be anticipated, induction 
chemotherapy fosters a non -active lifestyle; an integrative medicine intervention educating subjects and 
families how to safely exercise is both urgently needed and desired by [CONTACT_660277] .

Patients may be receiving concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660255] .   
 
5.4 CO-ENROLLMENT ON RESEARCH STUDIES  
As per the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) standard practice, this study is a behavioral intervention and 
does not include an investigational agent and is therefore not excluded from co -enrollment on COG trials .  
Moreover, th e study behavioral intervention occurs during a treatment period (induction) where no COG 
or other research intervention is planned through the duration of this protocol .  Of note, the relevant COG 
trial AALL1131 specifically outlines multiple concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660256] .  For patient specimens, collection of samples for research will 
be coordinated closely with the clinical leukemia team; should a conflict arise for patient samples,  priority 
will be first accorded to clinical care .  Second priority will then be afforded to COG studies required for co -
enrollment on COG therapeutic trials . Following both these uses, remaining sample will be obtained for 
this research study . 
 
  
 
[ADDRESS_890354] dietary and activity preferences 
assessed by a registered dietician (RD) and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) at the start of induction .   
 
Subjects will receive an individualized comprehensive dietary and physical activity plan.   The RD and PT 
will devise a personalized dietary and activity intervention aimed at creating a minimum 10% caloric deficit 
each day (10% nutritional + exercise) throughout the four weeks of induction therapy .  Adherence to the 
intervention will be assessed by [CONTACT_660284]-calls between clinic visits .  Home and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660257] a wearable electronic movement monitoring device (Fitbit ®) for all participants .  A list of 
representative “menu” of possible activity interventions from which subjects may choose is provided as a separate Appendix .   The prima ry efficacy of the intervention will be assessed in comparison to a recent 
historical control via determining the change in body fat percentage (and lean muscle) during induction as quantified by [CONTACT_751] -energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) .  A key secondary aim  will be the effectiveness 
of the intervention to reduce chemoresistance as evidenced by [CONTACT_660285] (MRD) at the end of induction . MRD using multicolor flow cytometry is routinely assessed 
as a predictor of ou tcome in all patients with HR-ALL .  Exploratory analyses will also examine biomarkers 
of the proposed mechanism including adiposity and intervention -related changes in leukemogenic 
signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and cellular metabolism .  Parent - and subject -reported QOL 
assessments will consist of the PedsQL and Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP) surveys (see 
separate Appendix) and will be conducted pre-  and post -induction and at two delayed time- points (mid -
point of intensive chemoth erapy [3 months from diagnosis] and at end of intensive chemotherapy phase 
[10 months from diagnosis] to assess the psychosocial benefits of the intervention . 
 6.[ADDRESS_890355] and is designed to achieve an at minimum ≥10% daily 
caloric deficit to prevent fat gain along with a moderate  fat (20 -25%), high protein (20-25%), and low 
glycemic index/high fiber carbohydrate (45 -55%) nutritional plan to prevent loss of lean muscle mass loss 
and to maintain micronutrient intake.   The subject’s basal metabolic rate (BMR) will be calculated using 
the Schofield equation as per the World Health Organization recommendations (World Health 
Organization, Energy and Protein Req uirements, Technical Report Series 724, 1985) with an activity factor 
of 1.3 (“for a well -nourished child at bedrest with mild to moderate stress”) applied to better estimate 
the subject’s resting energy expenditure (REE) from which to calculate the initia l 10% caloric deficit goal.    
At the initial counseling session, the dietician and family will determine which dietary technique is most 
likely to lead to dietary adherence .  Dietary management tools will incorporate the My Plate (USDA) and 
the Traffic Lig ht Diet tools to help educate families regarding portion size and eating habits .  The RD will 
use a menu of common foods that meet the intake goals above as well as help families choose “exchanges” on the menu to personalize the menu options to maximize ad herence.   During the initial 
 
[ADDRESS_890356] how to monitor 
food intake using a simplified log .  If available, and if the family so desires, the option will be available for 
families to use their personal cell phone or digital camera to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_660258] (before consumption 
and after consumption) to email to the RD to h elp guide the dietary intervention.   
 
During subsequent weekly outpatient chemotherapy clinic visits (or if the subject remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), 
the RD will follow -up with families on their perceived adherence and obtain intermittent dietary intake 
via [ADDRESS_890357] the family to provide 
reinforcement/motivation, answer questions, and obtain interval dietary history if necessary .  Specific 
dietary recommendations for foods/drinks, meals, and snacks wi ll be adjusted weekly in discussion with 
families to meet the daily caloric deficit and goal diet as described.   The caloric goals may also be adjusted 
±5% depending on insufficient/excessive weight or body composition changes .  At the end of the acute 
intervention, the RD will discuss with the subject and family their dietary status and sustainable healthy 
eating behaviors .  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_890358]’s usual activity level, 
choices/preferences, and a vailable activities at home once discharged.   A key component of this baseline 
assessment, and of beginning the exercise program during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be education 
provided to subjects and their families to allay concerns over potential muscle weakness and/or fatigue 
and demonstrate with positive reinforcement how to exercise safely during leukemia therapy .  During the 
assessment, the subject’s “rate of perceived exertion” (RPE) will be assessed to gain insight into the 
subjects threshold s for exercise intensity.  
 A target of 200 minutes/week will be set for a combination of “moderate” cardiovascular exercise and 
resistance training (36) with progressive goals based on adherence and capacity . As per latest guidelines 
from the American Hear t Association, this weekly target may be accomplished with a minimum of 
30minutes/day or divided into 15 -minute sessions over the course of the day with the goal of daily 
exercise . To quantify the prescribed “moderate” exercise, metabolic equivalents (METs ) were assigned to 
a variety of exercise modes from which the subject may choose, which best suit their preference and 
home capabilities (Appendix I) .   While the goal exercise prescription in METs is uniform for the 
intervention, the PT will work with the  family and subject to outline an individual path to meet that goal 
based on the subject’s physical capabilities, preference, and home availability .  METs will be converted to 
“points” and the subject will be able to choose from suggested exercise modes wi th the appropriate 
number of minutes to meet daily and weekly “point” goals .  Subjects will be asked if there are any 
additional activities/exercises they would like to include . If so, these will be added and the “points” (METs) 
calculated for them .  Participants and their parents will be asked to record the selected mode and number 
of minutes performed on a study log (or calendar) and weekly total scores will be tabulated (METs -
 
27 
 minutes) . For patients who do not complete (or do not bring) the study log, adherence will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_660286] -report of days meeting activity goals .  The following scale will 
be used: 0% (<1day/week), 25% (1-2days/w eek), 50% (3-4days/week), 75% (5-6days/week), 100% 
(7days/week) .  Reported activity must meet 100% of that recommended for each qualifying day .   
The exercise program will be progressive by [CONTACT_660287] o n adherence, ability, and clinical condition .   
 All subjects will be provided a wearable electronic activity monitor (Fitbit®) to assist in recording home 
activity levels in minutes of activity; the Fitbit® has the important secondary benefit of providing  visual 
reinforcement for the subject of their progress toward their Daily Goal as set by [CONTACT_3476] .   
 
6.2.3 MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING (PROMOTION OF ADHERENCE TO INTERVENTION)  
To facilitate adherence to the dietary and behavioral changes above, motiv ational interviewing (MI) 
techniques will be employed by [CONTACT_3476] . MI is a patient -centered method for enhancing intrinsic 
motivation to change health behavior by [CONTACT_660288], nonjudgmental, and s upportive communication techniques (37) . Numerous studies have 
illustrated the efficacy of MI as a promising strategy to encourage positive health behavior change (38), including promoting health behavior change and weight loss in nutrition and exercise in terventions in 
children and adults (37, 39) . Specifically, MI has been used to promote diet and exercise in breast cancer 
patients with some success (41) . 
 6.2.[ADDRESS_890359] their baseline DXA scan (within 96 hours from start of 
systemic chemotherapy), the initial PT and RD assessments, and start with the supervised activity 
intervention and diet intervention.   Bedside nursing will be available to provide reinforcement during that 
time .  Following anticipated discharge, the subjects will be assessed at each weekly clinic visit to have 
their diet and activity interventions monitored and adjusted as needed and also to receive 
 
28 
 education/motivation from the psychosocial team .  At the final clinic visit at the end of induction, subjects 
will receive the post -intervention assessments along with additional motivation/education.   Subjects will 
then continue on chemotherapy per routine care with ~8 -9 additiona l months of intensive chemotherapy; 
subjects will receive PT, RD, and QOL assessments midway at the start of “interim maintenance” and again 
at the final time -point at the start of the low -intensity maintenance phase.  These follow -up visits will help 
gauge whether the effect of the intervention and education extinguished or persisted during the 
intervening post -intervention months . 
 6.[ADDRESS_890360] REMUNERATION  
While no payment is provided to subjects for participation, a Fitbit© will be provided to participants, as 
part of the study assessments as indicated in the schema and described further below . At the conclusion 
of the study’s follow -up portion, the subjects (or parent/guardian if the subject is <13 years of age) will be 
permitted to keep the Fi tbit should they wish to do so . 
 
7.0 MODIFICATIONS OF INTERVENTION FOR  TOXICITY  
 
7.1 MODIFICATION OF ACTIVITY INTERVENTION  
Instances may arise throughout the course of induction therapy in which subjects may not be able to 
adhere to the prescribed activity intervention due to complications from leukemia treatment . Initially, 
attempts will be made by [CONTACT_660289].  If 
treatment- toxicity is persistent or severe (i. e. subject in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890]), the activity intervention will be 
suspended until the subject is deemed to be able to resume the intervention by [CONTACT_660290]’s treatment team . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_890361] may not be able to adhere to the nutrition intervention for reasons such as, 
nausea/emesis or the treatment team determining the subject cannot receive liquids or food by [CONTACT_1966] 
(NPO) . In such instances, the study team will continue to track all data at specified time-points and the 
registered dietician will re -assess nutritional caloric goals.  Moreover, for subjects at lower BMI 
percentiles, despi[INVESTIGATOR_660259], should the BMI percentile decrease to <[ADDRESS_890362] of care and institutional guidelines .  No specific 
precautions are required for patients on study .

 9.1 REQUIRED OBSERVATIONS  
“At Diagnosis” blood samples should be collected before or in closest proximity as possible t o starting 
systemic chemotherapy (steroid pre-treatment, steroid prophase, or intrathecal therapy may have 
already been given), but all samples must be collected before the start of the activity/nutrition 
intervention and prior to the end of chemotherapy d ay [ADDRESS_890363] be done  within 96 
hours from the beginning of systemic chemotherapy and  ideally before the start of the activity/nutrition 
intervention.   The timing of the DXA scan in relation to chemotherapy and the intervention will be 
recorded.

9.3  BONE MARROW ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649701] & BIOPSY  
As per the preceding CHLA ALL Obesity Environment & Microenvironment Study #2, subjects on study may require extra bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_660261] . The bone marrow as pi[INVESTIGATOR_660262] .  If there is insufficient specimen available, there will be 
no additional aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (needle punctures) performed for study purposes only and no bone marrow 
leukemia cells will be expected from that time -point for study .  If a routine bone marrow biopsy at 
diagnosis was performed with sufficient extra specimen, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_660263] .  
Subjects undergoing bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_660264] a single additional research- only bone marrow biopsy to be performed at the same time.   For sites that do 
not (or cannot) collect bone marrow biopsies in saline, marrow biopsies will not be collected for this study .  
 
31 
 Similarly, bone marrow biopsies not collected in saline (for any reason) will not be obtained for this study 
as it precludes analysis of the marrow fat .   
 9.4 EXTRA SAMPLE  
Any extra blood or bone marrow specimens collected at time of diagnosis or later while on this study, 
which is not needed for clinical purposes by [CONTACT_660291] . Blood may be us ed for measurements of other related tests including but not 
limited to amino acids, cytokines, adipose tissue hormones, and/or collection of viable leukemia cells . 
Extra bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy material may be used for examination, culture and studies  to 
investigate cells type and functions . All testing will be done in the context of further investigating the 
relationships between bone marrow microenvironment, nutrition, osteoblasts, adipocytes and leukemia .

clinical laboratory.  Blood draws will be coordinated with routine collection where -ever possible .  It is 
recommended that study bags be provided to nursing prior to study visits that will contain all necessary 
specimen tubes and instruction regarding volumes to be drawn . Labels and/or instructions will be included 
regarding specimen distribution and specimen pro cessing . At CHLA, for reference (and if study bags 
unavailable), please see Appendix  I which contains all relevant details .

of body fat content by [CONTACT_11324] . This type of scan is necessary as it provides c omplementary information and 
is the “gold standard” method to quantify body fat .   
 
[ADDRESS_890371] x-ray (DXA = 
~1/[ADDRESS_890372] x -ray) .   DXA confers a radiation total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) of ~ 0.5 mREM 
of radiation per scan . This is a total study exposure of ~1 mREM for subjects (2 DXA scans) . The critical 
organ exposed is the gonad s; DXA contributes a total study exposure of 0 .24 mREM to gonads in subjects . 
The total radiation exposure from the DXA scans is minimal and well beneath the 100 mREM  upper limit 
considered to be “minimal risk” by [CONTACT_660292] . 
 
In common  terminology, everyone receives a small amount of unavoidable radiation each year named 
“background radiation .” Some of this radiation comes from space and some from naturally -occurring 
radioactive forms of water and minerals.  Participation on this researc h study gives the subject the 
equivalent of about [ADDRESS_890373] extra blood collected for the study when there catheters 
are being accessed and blood drawn for clinical purposes .  As per above, patients with religious (Jehovah 
Witness) or medical contraindications will n ot have blood collected.   The collection of extra blood for 
study will prolong the procedure for less than 2 minutes and will not cause any significant discomfort .  
Subjects without central venous catheters will require venipuncture at each visit (using a needle to draw 
blood from a vein) .  This may cause mild pain or a bruise at the site where the blood is to be collected.   
Occasionally, a person may feel faint during the time of blood collection.   The risk for infection is very rare 
since only sterile one -time equipment will be used.   If possible, sample collection will be coordinated with 
venipuncture for clinical purposes .  
 
11.2 BONE MARROW ASPI[INVESTIGATOR_649701] & BIOPSY  
All research procedures will be coordinated with clinical bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99193] .  If there is 
insufficient specimen available from the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], there will be no additional aspi[INVESTIGATOR_660265] .  As such, there is minimal additional risk to this procedure.   The 
research-only biopsy at the end of inducti on will be coordinated with the routine bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]; 
the biopsy will be obtained per standard practice using the same skin puncture with minimal prolongation of anesthesia (typi[INVESTIGATOR_15120] 3 minutes) with minimal additional post -operative disc omfort due to the 
addition of the biopsy to the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337].   Post -operative care routinely includes assessments of discomfort 
and the clinical care teams will assist in managing this as needed.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_890374] and PT throughout the 
intervention.  Subjects that are unable to adhere to the dietary and/o r activity intervention may be at risk 
for psychological distress (i. e. depression, anxiety, etc .). The treatment team will work to proactively 
address these risks in each patient through positive discussion and adjustment of the intervention if 
necessary .  Additionally, each patient may be at risk for psychological distress following the introspective 
nature of the QOL assessment . Psychological distress from any facet of the intervention will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_660293].

course of the study, including but not limited to interventions performed by [CONTACT_660296], survival, 
or relapse . For this purpose, study records and coding information will be maintained in a confidential 
database as below until study closure .   
 
 
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND EVALUATION CRITERIA  
 
13.1 SAMPLE SIZE AND STUDY DURATION  
Based on available data over a recent 3 -year period (2012-2014), we predict at least 43-45 subjects ≥10 
years of age with HR -ALL patients will be eligible for enrollment during the three year study.   We anticipate 
>85% of subjects to be enrolled & evaluable for the primary and secondary aim surrounding the Day [ADDRESS_890378] 36 subjects .  As of AMD03, additional site(s) were added 
to gain experience with the study intervention at outside institutions; there is no cha nge to the target 
study accrual goal of 36 evaluable subjects . 
 
As subjects historically gain body fat during induction irrespective of starting body composition (i .e. both 
those lean and those overweight/obese gain body fat), we will enroll a goal of 18 o verweight/obese and 
[ADDRESS_890379] in those “lean” by [CONTACT_660297] .  We will continuously monitor accrual by [CONTACT_660298] a 
minimum final targe t accrual of 14 overweight/obese and 22 lean subjects (40/60) which, as below, 
preserves our ability to detect an effect on body fat and on the key secondary aim of MRD .  For assessment 
of the delayed endpoints, we expect that 80% of the initial cohort wil l additionally be evaluable for 
secondary the aims at the final pre-start of maintenance time -point (due to treatment -related 
morbidity/mortality/lost -to-follow -up).  
 
13.2 PRIMARY ENDPOINT EVALUATION  
The primary endpoint for efficacy is a reduction in gai n of body fat percent (per DXA) from diagnosis to 
the end of induction . From data on [ADDRESS_890380] induction, there was a significant average fat gain during induction therapy of 5 .5±3.3 percent (mean 
± s.d.), p<0 .001.  Based on a two -sample (36 historical, 36 present study) two -sided t -test with 5% Type I 
error, there will be at least 90% power to detect a 2 .5 percentage point reduction in change in body fat as 
a result of intervention (e .g. from  gain of 5.5 to a gain of 3 .0%).  Hence, this study has sufficient power to 
detect subtle, achievable effects on body fat during induction, and will with certainty detect stabilization of or a decrease in body fat during induction .   
 13.3 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Evaluation 
 
35 
 To compare the ra te of leukemia “positive” minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow at end of 
induction (≥0 .01% mononuclear cells) in those who received the intervention as compared to historical 
controls . 
 
The key secondary endpoint for efficacy is whether or not  the bone marrow is “positive” for MRD at the 
end of induction (using the COG definition of ≥0 .01% mononuclear cells) .  From the retrospective study at 
CHLA of B -precursor ALL/obesity and end-induction MRD, 69 patients in the cohort had HR -ALL over the 
age of 10 at diagnosis .  Of these, 53% of those overweight or obese (n=30) were MRD positive at the end 
of induction as compared to only 26% of those lean at diagnosis (n=39) .  Using this cohort as the historical 
comparison group, for the overweight/obese sub set only, this study will have approximately 80% power 
to detect a reduction in the MRD positive rate to approximately that of the historical lean group (i .e from 
53% to 24%) based on a two -sample, one-sided test of proportions with a Type I error of 0 .10 (as a 
commonly used “go/no go” threshold to continue to Phase III trials) .  For the overall cohort, again in 
comparison to the historical cohort (MRD+ 38%, n=26/69) using a similar two -sample, one -sided test of 
proportions, the study will have the ability at ~80% power to detect a decrease in MRD by 20% .  The study 
will therefore provide data on the potential reduction in the MRD positive rate that can be expected in 
preparation for the subsequent randomized Phase III trial for efficacy .  These analyses wil l be adjusted for 
risk group, age, and other factors as appropriate and also compared to external published rates for MRD 
positivity .    
 
To assess adherence to, and feasibility of, implementing a personalized and comprehensive dietary and 
exercise interve ntion during the first month of intensive chemotherapy  
 
This endpoint will be reported as the proportion of study subjects who adhere to proposed dietary and 
activity interventions .  A threshold of 80% of RD and PT visits (combined, RD only, PT only) comp leted will 
determine feasibility of incorporating the intervention itself into induction therapy .  Adherence to each 
component of the intervention will be further assessed using a threshold of 75% MET-minutes prescribed/completed and 75% of dietary adheren ce prescribed/actual intake (overall, and to each 
macronutrient group) .  Further exploratory analysis will examine which sets of activities and dietary 
recommendations afforded the greatest level of adherence and any trends toward adherence by [CONTACT_654], sex, 
race, and/or ethnicity .   
 
13.[ADDRESS_890381] prescribed or recommended from the intervention versus actual minutes/dietary intake at 
the delayed time -points of start of Interim Maintenance (~+3 months) and start of Maintenance (~+10 
months) .  Activity and dietary i ntake patterns will also be compared to baseline at -diagnosis levels . Similar 
exploratory analysis will examine the effect of age, sex, race, and/or ethnicity . 
 
[ADDRESS_890382] as compared to baseline of the intervention on self - and family - reported 
quality of life (QOL) outcomes including fatigue, mood, social interaction, and cognitive impairment 
reported via the PedsQL questionnaire and Child and Adolescent Scale of Participation (CASP) following 
the induction phase and serially during dose-intensive phases of chemotherapy  
 
The PEDSQL questionnaire returns a QOL score between [ADDRESS_890383] during induction (the intervention) and using repeated 
measures analysis for all four time -points .   
 
To quantify the effect of adiposity at diagnosis on the activity of leukemogenic JAK2/STAT3, 
PIK3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and other signaling pathways in leukemia cells as determined by [CONTACT_660299] 
(adiposity) using a two -sided, two -sample t -test for the different pathways as well visually for overall 
trends in related pathways . 
 
To quantify the effect of adiposity and of the intervention on the metabolic activity of leu kemia blasts and 
of adipocytes as assessed by [CONTACT_14799] -1, other obesity-associated cytokine signaling pathways, adiponectin, 
leptin, free fatty acid synthesis and metabolism, and levels oxidative stress . 
 Exploratory analyses using similar t -tests will be perfo rmed to explore the effects of adiposity at diagnosis 
on adipokines, obesity -associated cytokines, oxidative stress, and measures of cellular metabolism . The 
effect of the intervention on oxidative stress and free fatty acid synthesis will be analyzed usin g paired t -
tests for pre/post intervention and compared to samples from the historical cohort . 
 
14.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting are required as part of every clinical trial to ensure the 
safety of  patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar 
agents . Adverse events are reported in a prescribed manner at scheduled times during the trial . 
 Induction chemotherapy has many associated toxicities due to  the intensity of regimen, and these will be 
monitored per routine care by [CONTACT_660300]/or by [CONTACT_660301] a concurrent therapeutic research study .  
 
We will not record non- targeted toxicities (those  described in clinical history Section 9 .1) due to the 
underlying leukemia or treatment regimen.  
 
 
37 
 As this trial consists of behavioral interventions (diet and exercise) that are within the scope of standard 
of care for patients, we will ONLY collect AE’s that occur during  or immediately following the exercise 
activities .    If this should occur, the AE  will be reported to the local IRB and the coordinating IRB (CHLA) . 
 For an AE that occurs as above, we will record and report using the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) available for download at http://ctep .cancer .gov. 
 All reporting of adverse events must include:  
• severity (grade) of the event  
• duration of the event  
• attribution to the study (i .e. how the event is related to the study) .  
• whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660266] (or prolonged) for subjects  
 
Categories of attribution in order of increasing likelihood are:  
• Unrelated  
• Unlikely  
• Possible  
• Probable 
• Definite  
 
All adverse events will be labeled “unexpected” for this behavioral study intervention.   
 14.[ADDRESS_890384], expedited reporting 
will only be required in the case:  
 
Toxicities that occur during this protocol -specified activity (as described above) and cause or prolong 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660267] 5 business days . 
 
Toxicities that are ≥ Grade 4 and occur during the protocol -specified activity (as described above) will be 
reported in an expedited manner to the IRB within 5 business days.  
 
15.0 RECORDS AND REPORTING  
 
Research records will be maintained through paper study -specific case reporting forms (CRF) .  Research 
records for this study will be maintained in locked cabinets in the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) or institutional 
research offices accessible only to the investigators and study team .  The master list linking subjects to 
their unique identifier will be kept in the regulatory binder locked in the CTO office and in a password -
protected database .  Regulatory binder and CR Fs will be maintained primarily by [CONTACT_660302]/investigators as needed . 
 
 
38 
 Study results will be entered by [CONTACT_660303]/SC -
CTSI.    At conclusion of the treatme nt portion of the study, screening logs with coded identifiers only will 
be provided from each site to enable assessment of selection bias (e .g. CONSORT diagream) . The database 
will then be downloaded by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_660268] s and follow -up as 
indicated in Section 1 3.2 (“Study Closure”) .  The database will remain under unique password -protection 
and will be remain strictly confidential.   At the conclusion of the prescribed 5 -year follow-up period (final 
study closure), all identifying information will be destroyed and the database will be preserved in a 
password -protected completely de -identified format for a minimum of six years as per CCI requirements 
at which time it will be destroyed.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_890385] -of-care behavioral intervention only, data and 
safety monitoring for all patients enrolled on the study will be conducted by [CONTACT_660304] .

v1: May 30th, 2019  
v2: June 7th, [ADDRESS_215895] (OHCA) victims with initial shockable rhythms (pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) treated with therapeutic hypothermia targeting 
a temperature of 32 ℃-33℃ as compared to placebo.1,2 A more recent, larger randomized trial 
comparing temperature controlled to 33 ℃ vs 36℃ did not demonstrate a significant difference in 
outcomes.3 In the earlier  therapeutic hypothermia studies, neuromuscular blockade (NMB) was 
administered throughout the cooling period in the intervention group but not the control group. In 
contrast, paralytic use was minimized in both groups in the more recent study comparing 33 ℃ to 
36℃. Thus, the use of NMB is a potential unrecognized confounder from the earlier hypothermia 
studies.  
 
Multicenter observational data has previously demonstrated that continuous NMB following 
cardiac arrest may be associated with improved lactate cl earance and reduced mortality.[ADDRESS_215896] will improve blood lactate levels and potentially 
clinical outcomes as compared to usual care.  
Study Overview  
Study Design and Setting  
This was a phase II, mult i-center, randomized trial of continuous neuromuscular blockade using 
rocuronium vs. usual care in patients who had sustained return of spontaneous circulation 
(ROSC) but remained unresponsive after cardiac arrest. Enrolling sites were five urban tertiary 
care centers in the [LOCATION_002]. The trial coordinating center gathered and analyzed the data, 
and vouches for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from the leg ally authorized representatives of 
all patients.  
 
Trial Participants  
Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who experienced a cardiac arrest and subsequently had 
sustained ROSC (≥20 minutes) but remained comatose (i.e. not following commands) and were 
undergoing  TTM targeting between 32 ℃ and 36℃ were enrolled in the study. An additional 
inclusion criterion of a minimum serum lactate level of ≥2mmol/L was added after the 42nd 
patient was enrolled . Patients were excluded if they had a traumatic etiology of cardiac arrest, 
were already receiving continuous neuromuscular blockade for clinical purposes, were not 
expected  by [CONTACT_182790] 24 -hours, had been undergoing TTM for ≥[ADDRESS_215897] modified Rankin scale score of 4 or higher, or were members of a protected 
population (including prisoners, pregnant patients, and the developmentally disabled). Patients 
who had received a single -dose of a neuromuscular blocking agent , most commonly during 
4 
 tracheal intubation, could be enrolled in the stud y so long as the drug had worn off and there 
were no immediate plans for additional neuromuscular blockade administration.  
 
Patient flow through the trial will be displayed in a CONSORT diagram (see Appendix Figure 1 
for shell figure).  
 
Randomization and Intervention  
Patients were randomized to continuous NMB or usual care in blocks of four and in a 1:[ADDRESS_215898] of the study. The site -specific 
allocation sequences were maintained by [CONTACT_182791].  
 
Patients in the continuous NMB arm received a rocuronium bolus of 1.0mg/kg followed by a 
continuous infusion of rocuronium for a total of 24 -hours. The infusion of rocuronium was titrated 
to 1-2 out of 4 twitches on a train -of-four peripheral nerve stimulator. To mini mize any difference 
in the time between randomization and receipt of the study drug between the two groups, 
patients in the usual care arm were administered a small volume of normal saline to mark the 0 -
hour time point. All patients undergoing TTM, includi ng those who received continuous NMB, 
were deeply sedated per local site protocol. Use of the Columbia anti -shivering protocol was 
recommended to clinical teams, but adherence was not mandated.7 
 
Study Registration and Monitoring  
The trial was registered a t clinicaltrials.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and was approved by [CONTACT_182792].  
 
A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) evaluated and monitored the trial for safety. There 
were no pre -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_182783] f utility or efficacy. No statistical interim analyses were 
performed.   
Outcomes and Definitions  
Primary Outcome and Sample Size Estimation  
The primary outcome of the study is change in serum lactate level measured between [ADDRESS_215899] a predicted mean difference in 24 -hour lactate of 2.0mmol/L (±3.2mmol/L) 
with 80% power assuming a two -sided test and an alpha of 0.05.

Statistical Analysis  
General Principles  
All initial analyses will be performed in a modified intention -to-treat (modified ITT) population, 
defined as all randomly assigned subjects who received any study drug (rocuronium or the 
saline time marker). The primary analysis for the outcome o f lactate at 24 -hours will be repeated 
in the per -protocol population including only those patients who were alive at 24 -hours and 
received either 24 -hours of continuous rocuronium (if so assigned) compared to  those who 
received usual care without  any neuromuscular blockade medication after the time 0 -hour point.    
 
Baseline Characteristics  
A description of the baseline characteristics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] (see Appendix 
Table 1). Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_182794]. 
Percentages will be calculated according to the number of patients for whom data are available. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using mean s (standard deviations , SD) or median s 
(interquartile range , IQR ). Statistical tests will not be used to compare baseline characteristics 
between groups. A table describing sedative and off -protocol paralytic use in each arm will be 
included (Appendix Table 2)  
 
Analysis of Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome is lactate change between 0 -hours and 24 -hours after enrollment. The 
group difference in change from the time of study drug administration (0 -hours) to 24 -hours will 
be assessed using a linear mixed effects model.  Lactate values will be log -transformed for th is 
analysis if they are not approximately normally distributed.  Fixed effects will include the 
allocated treatment, shock stratification, time point (0 -hour, 12 -hour, and 24 -hour), and the 
interaction between treatment and time point. Study site will be in cluded as a random intercept. 
The usual care  group will be the reference variable for group, and baseline (0 -hour) will be the 
6 
 reference variable for time. Means and 95% confidence intervals of lactate  over time will be 
presented, by [CONTACT_3148], using longi tudinal plots (see appendix Figure 2)  
 
Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  
The following outcomes will be summarized using mean ± SD or median (IQR) and linear 
regression using the above described linear mixed model will be performed to assess the 
differences b etween treatment groups.  
● ICU length of stay  
● Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]  
● Time to shock reversal  
● Time to liberation from mechanical ventilation  
● Biomarker measures (regression controlled for baseline level of each biomarker)  
● Muscle weakness score  
 
The following outcomes will be summarized using frequencies and percentages and logistic 
regression will be performed to assess the differences between treatment groups.  
● Neurologic outcome at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
● Survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182786].  
 
• Shock and non -shock stratification groups  
• Shockable and non -shockable initial rhythms  
• Cardiac arres t location  
 
Additional Planned Analyses  
Additional planned analyses of total body oxygen consumption and cellular oxygen consumption 
for those patients in whom these variables are available will be performed.  
 
Statistical Software  
Stata (version 14, StataCorp, College Station, Tx) will  be used for all analyses.

4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
4.[ADDRESS_696733] cancer subtypes, TNBC has higher expression levels of PD -L1 and its 
receptor PD -1, which may hinder antitumor T cell responses. Immunotherapy has 
demonstrated promising efficacy in pretreated metastatic TNBC and appears to be one  of future 
treatment choices for resistant cancers.

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the [LOCATION_002]. Lung cancer is  expected 
to account for an estimated 22 4,390 new cases (11 7,920 in men and 106,470 in women) and 
158,080 deaths (85,920 in men and 72,160 in women) in 2016.
1 Only 16.8% of lung cancer 
patients are alive for 5 years or more after their diagnosis. NSCLC  accounts for over 85% of 
all lung cancer cases. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB/IV)  
disease,[ADDRESS_696734] -line platinum -based doublet chemotherapy yields 1- year OS rates of 
only 30–40% and can cause significant toxicities that may complica te treatment.3 However, 
much progress has recently been made in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer including 
screening methods, minimally invasive techniques for diagnosis and treatment, and advances 
in radiation therapy (RT) including SBRT, target ed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].4-[ADDRESS_696735] shown unprecedented rates of durable 
clinical responses in patients with various cancer types.
9-13 Upregulation of PD -L1 and its 
ligation to PD -1 on antigen- specific CD8+ T -cells (termed adaptive immune resistance)  
represents a major mechanism by [CONTACT_535501] .14, 15 
Under healthy conditions, PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T -cells, functions  
to downmodulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to 
CD28 and cytotoxic T -lymphocyte -associated antigen -4 (CTLA -4) that has been shown to 
negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
PD-L2). The structure of m urine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and its family members are 
type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail res ponsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains two  tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
6 immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch 
motif (ITSM). Following T -cell stimulatio n, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases Src 
homology phosphatase ( SHP)-[ADDRESS_696736] from that of CTLA -4, as both 
molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_272446] t of signaling proteins . PD-1 was shown to be expressed 
on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, regulatory T 
cells ( Tregs ), and natural killer ( NK) cells. PD-1 expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4- CD8 - (double nega tive) T -cells as well as subsets of macr ophages and 
dendritic cells  (DCs). The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed 
or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues and  various 
tumors . Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and Ig constant -
like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known 
signaling motifs. Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_696737] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably 
expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue and  chroni c inflammatory 
environments. PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, 
whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell fun ction in peripheral tissues . Although 
healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of canc ers have been  demonstrated to 
express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor. PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -
specific T -cell expansion in s ubjects with melanoma . This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 
pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune e vasion and should be considered an attractive 
target for therapeutic intervention. 
 Clinical trials have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of PD -1 blockade therapy. Brahmer 
et al. demonstrated that, among patients with previously treated advanced squa mous NSCLC, 
OS, response, and PFS rates were significantly better with the PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab than 
with docetaxel regardless of PD -L1 expression level. The confirmed ORR was significantly 
higher with nivolumab than with docetaxel (20% [95% confidence  interval (CI): 14–28] vs. 
9% [95% CI: 5 –15]; P = 0.008).
[ADDRESS_696738] et al. found that treatment with MPDL3280A, a PD -
L1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), induces therapeutic responses in patients with 
advanced NSCLC, renal cell cancer, and melanoma.17 Powles et al. showed that the same 
antibody can be used to treat urothelial bladder cancer. Among patients with a minimum of 6 weeks of follow -up, ORRs were 43% (13/30; 95% CI: 26–63) for those with tumor PD -L1 
immunohistochemical (IHC) expression scores of 2 or 3 (2/3) and 11% (4/35; 95% CI: 4–26) 
for those with tumor PD -L1 IHC expression scores of 0 or 1 (0/1). In the tumor PD -L1 IHC 
expression 2/3 score group, the ORR included a 7% complete response (CR) rate (2/30). 
Among patients with a tumor PD -L1 IHC expression score of 2/3 and a minimum of 12 weeks 
of follow -up, an ORR of 52% (13/25; 95% CI: 32–70) was achieved. Sixteen of the [ADDRESS_696739] response assessment later 
presented with new lesions, including a bladder mass thought to be consistent with pseudo-progression.
18 Anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy has also shown promising results in TNBC.2 The 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
[ADDRESS_696740] data analysis of a Phase I clinical trial of MPDL3280A in TNBC revealed a 24 -week 
PFS rate of 27% and ORR rate of 19%, with three of four responses ongoing. This data is 
encouraging, because longer responses do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_535479], the standard of care for this population.[ADDRESS_696741]. PD -L1/PD -1 expression in cancer cells is an obvious candidate 
biomarker for immunotherapy response, as PD -L1/PD -1 can directly turn off the immune 
response by [CONTACT_535502] -infiltrating cytotoxic T -lymphocytes (CTLs). 
However, PD -L1 and PD -[ADDRESS_696742] LA-4/PD -1 
inhibition is by[CONTACT_92842].  
 Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized mAb  of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, 
PD-L1 and PD -L2. Antibody- mediated PD -1 blockade wi th pembrolizumab and other similar 
agents reinvigorates the immune system, allowing for cancer cell targeting and destruction. Pembrolizumab is one of a number of closely related therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535480].
19 On September 4, 2014, KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) was approved by [CONTACT_941] U nited 
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  for the treatment of patients with unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma and dise ase progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_77972], if BRAF V600 
mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. On October 2, 2015, KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) 
received accelerated FDA approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic PD -L1-
positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy 
or targeted therapy against anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13392]  (EGFR) , if appropriate. KeytrudaTM is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, 
the PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx test, the first test designed to detect PD -L1 expression in 
NSCLC tumor s. FDA  approval for both disease indications was based on the results from the 
open label, first -in-human Phase I b KEYNOTE -001 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) of pembrolizumab 
in patients  with progressive locally advanced or metastatic carcinomas. The melanoma cohort 
included patients with advanced disease previously treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_535481] a BRAF inhibitor (for BRAF mutation carriers).
20 After mandatory biopsy, 
patients were treated with one of three doses of pembrolizumab for 12 weeks; responders continued on treatment until disease progression. Among 173 patients treated with the recommended 2 -mg/kg pembrolizumab dose, the overall response rate was 24%, with a DoR 
of 1.4 to 8.5 months. The NSCLC cohort included 550 patients with metastatic disease.
21 The 
ORR in the efficacy population, which comprised 61 patients with PD -L1 strongly positive 
tumors, was 41% (95% CI : 28.6–54.3); all were partial responses  (PRs). At the time  of the 
analysis, responses were ongoing in 21 of 25 (85%) patients, with 11 (44%) patients having a

8 DoR  of ≥ [ADDRESS_696743] commonly occurring ( ≥ 20%) adverse  events (AEs)  included 
fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea, and  cough. The most frequent ( ≥ 2%) serious AEs (SAEs)  
were pleural effusion, pneumonia, dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonitis. Immune -
mediated AEs occurred in 13% of patients and included pneumonitis, colitis, hypophysitis, and 
thyroid disorders . Multiple ongoing clinical trials in all phases ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  are evaluating pembrolizumab monotherapy and  
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535482], including 
TNBC. The KEYNOTE -086 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a P hase II trial of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy in metastatic TNBC pa tients. The  KEYNOTE -119 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a n 
open label , randomized  Phase III study of single -agent pembrolizumab versus single -agent 
chemotherapy per physician's choice for metastatic TNBC. The KEYNOTE -173 study 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is a  Phase Ib study to e valuate the safety and clinical activity of 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment for TNBC. Together, these studies will pave the way for expanding the indications for pembrolizumab.  
 RT is proven to provide local tumor control. RT has traditionally been thought to mediate 
tumor regression through direct cytotoxic effects. However, it is now known that RT also alters the local tumor microenvironment to affect both local and systemic antitumor immune responses. There is grow ing evidence that the rational integration of RT with the expanding 
armamentarium of clinically approved immunotherapeutics can yield potent antitumor responses exceeding those of either therapy alone.
[ADDRESS_696744] was tumor -type independent and involved the infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ 
lymphocytes and NK1.1+ NK cells into the tumor sites of mice.[ADDRESS_696745] remains 
an active area of investigation in the immunotherapy field. CTLA -4, a negative regulator of 
cytotoxic CD8+ T -cells, has been targeted as a means to activate anti tumor immune CTLs. 
CTLA -[ADDRESS_696746] recently

9 to engage in stable interactions with tumor targets.28 The NK group 2, member D (NKG2D) 
ligand retinoic acid early inducible -1 is upregulated in irradiated neoplastic cells; interaction 
with its receptor, NKG2D, on CTLs costimulates and enhances tumor cell killing. T -cell 
receptor, NKG2D, and CTLA -4-transduced si gnals contribute to the stability of the 
immunological synapse. Their association appears to be mediated in part by [CONTACT_535504].[ADDRESS_696747] primed by [CONTACT_535505], seem to play a significant role in RT -
induced antigen- specific immunity.
30 Further evidence that antigen -specific T cells are elicited 
after RT is borne out by [CONTACT_535506] a significant CD8+ T -cell-mediated reduction 
in systemic  tumor burden after local ablative RT.31 T-cell priming following RT -mediated 
tumor cell death has been postulated to occur through DC cross presentation of released tumor antigens in draining lymph nodes, leading to primary or metastatic tumor rejection.  
 Antigen presentation by [CONTACT_535507] -induced CD8+ T cell -dependent 
antitumor immunity. Antigens can be endogenously or exogenously loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I  molecules. RT seems to differentially affect th ese 
two antigen presentation pathways. Presentation of endogenous antigens is blocked in irradiated DCs, whereas presentation of exogenously pulsed peptide antigens is enhanced in irradiated DCs, l eading to favorable antitumor T -cell responses.
32 RT dose -dependently 
facilitates cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules by [CONTACT_535508]: (1) induction of protein unfolding and degradation to increase the intracellular peptide pool; 
(2) enhancement of protein synthesis to increase  the intracellular peptide pool; and (3) 
generation of radiation- specific peptide antigens to increase the diversity of the intracellular 
peptide pool. By [CONTACT_535509]/or diversity of the peptide pool, RT leads to an overall increase in the number and density of surface peptide/MHC class I complexes 
expressed on murine DCs.

It is gener ally believed that Tregs are more radioresistant than conventional effector T -cells35 
and may be over -represented in RT -treated patients compared with RT -naïve patients.36 
Radiatio n has been shown to upregulate transforming growth factor -β and adenosine A2A in 
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.37 This can provide both a growth and survival 
advantage to Tregs38, thereby [CONTACT_535510]. 
Strategies to eliminate or suppress the number and activity of Tregs such as adjusting RT dose and schedule would enhance RT -induced antitumor responses.

addition of SBRT to HD IL -2 has been shown to be highly effective in patients with metastatic 
melanoma and renal cell cancer and represents a clinically  tenable strategy given that HD IL -
2 is approved for use in these malignancies. The presence of an elevated effector memory 
CD4+  T-cell population in the peripheral blood was associated with a clinical response in these 
patients.[ADDRESS_696751] shown that ADV/HSV -tk followed by [CONTACT_535513] (GCV) therapy 
(ADV/HSV- tk + GCV) has a favorable toxicity profile and antitumor activity in prostate 
cancer. Furtherm ore, this system has been shown to direct systemic antitumor activity in 
several experimental cancer models, including prostate cancer, and thus may serve as the basis for in situ immunomodulatory gene therapy. In a mouse model of prostate cancer, NK cells  
were shown to mediate the antimetastatic activity of A DV/HSV- tk + GCV. To enhance its 
antitumor activity, A DV/HSV- tk + GCV has been combined with A DV/IL-12. IL -12 increases 
NK cell proliferation and cytotoxicity.  ADV/HSV- tk + GCV + ADV/IL -12 combination 
therapy demonstrated superior local and systemic growth suppression compared with either 
therapy alone. Importantly, when the metastatic tumor burden was increased to an extent that negated the growth- suppressive activity directed by [CONTACT_535514]/HSV -tk + GCV or ADV/IL -12 
alone, the combination therapy continued to demonstrate significant growth suppression. Examination of TILs showed enhanced NK lytic activity with the combination therapy.
51 
Suicide gene therapy using HSV -tk + GCV therapy is being explored for the t reatment of a 
wide variety of cancers. HSV -tk phosphorylates GCV, converting it to a non- diffusible 
nucleoside analog that terminates DNA synthesis, causing cell death.[ADDRESS_696752] to the

[ADDRESS_696753] demonstrated  the immun ologic activity of HSV -tk therapy. 
HSV- tk + GCV -treated tumors contain areas of necrosis highlighted by [CONTACT_535515]4+ and CD8+ T -cells.
54-57 Furthermore, within treated tumors are 
detectable levels of the cytokines IL -1, IL -2, IL -6, IL -12, IFN -c, TNF -α, and GM-CSF in a 
fashion consistent with a Th1 ( cellular based) response profile.57,  Functional antitumor roles 
for these immune effectors have been suggested to impact within a treated tumor in the form of a local by[CONTACT_535516]- transduced tumors or challenge 
tumor  cell injections in the form of a dista nt by[CONTACT_145152].
54, 58-61 Further supportive 
evidence has noted a significant loss of growth suppression in immunocompromised hosts.55, 
58, 5 9 HSV- tk + GCV may induce immune -related activities through necrosis -mediated 
exposure of putative tumor antige ns to the cytokine -stimulated lymphocytic infiltrate. 
However, for the most part, direct demonstration of effector cell induction and its relevance to in vivo responses is lacking. In an orthotopic model of mouse prostate cancer, injection of ADV/HSV- tk + GCV therapy was found not only to inhibit local tumor growth but also to 
suppress spontaneous metastatic activity.
[ADDRESS_696754] a tumor  cell challenge injection of 
parental cells via the tail vein was induced by A DV/HSV- tk + GCV treatment of the primary 
tumor. Direct evidence of HSV -tk + GCV -mediated induction of antitumor lymphocytes was 
provided by a serial assay demonstrating the lytic activity of TILs isolated from H SV-tk + 
GCV- treated orthotopic tumors against parental tumor cells in vitro .61 These studies 
demonstrated the induction of NK cells by A DV/HSV- tk + GCV treatment. Gene therapy 
performed in the absence of NK cells, but not T -cells, resulted in a modest but significant loss 
of HSV -tk + GCV -directed growth suppression within the primary tumor and complete 
abrogation of systemic activities.61 Therefore, HSV -tk + GCV therapy appears to induce NK 
cells to impact local and remote tumor growth. Enhancement of NK ce ll activity may improve 
therapeutic response to A DV/HSV- tk + GCV.  
Viral vectors have been increasingly studied as potential antitumor therapeutic agents. With their ability to invade and replicate within target cells, viruses have been utilized as oncolytic 
agents to directly lyse tumor cells. Viruses can also deliver their genetic payload into infected 
cells, allowing for the repair of defective tumor suppressor genes, disruption of oncogenic pathways, and production of cytokines that activate the immune system. Furthermore, viruses encoding tumor -associated antigens can infect DCs to trigger tumor -specific immune 
responses. The ability to engineer viruses with high levels of tumor specificity and efficient rates of infection has enhanced the safety  profile of these agents, making viral vector -mediated 
gene therapy, either alone or in conjunction with more conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a viable option for cancer therapy.

After single -dose intravenous (IV) administration at 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg in Cynomolgus 
monkeys, decline of serum concentration followed multiphasic kinetics. Anti –drug antibodies

(t1/2) a ppeared to be dose -dependent in the dose range tested, with t1/2 varying from 4 to 10 
days.  
In the 1 -month repeat -dose (once weekly) GLP toxicity study at 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg in  
Cynomolgus monkeys, ADAs were detected in most of the low -dose (6 mg/kg) treated animals.  
The systemic exposure (area under the curve [ AUC ]) over the 7- day dosing interval  was sex  
independent and increased with increasing dose. The mean t 1/2 values in individual ADA -
negative animals ranged from 15.7 to 22.3 days across doses. 
 
In the 6- month r epeat -dose (every other week) GLP toxicity study at 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg in  
Cynomolgus monkeys, ADAs were detected in most of the low -dose (6 mg/kg) treated animals. 
The systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and was  approximately dose  
proportional across all doses. The mean t 1/2 values in individual ADA -negative animals 
ranged from 21 to 22 days across doses.

The potential for systemic toxicity of pembrolizumab was assessed in a 1- month repeat -dose 
toxicity study with a 4 -month recovery and a 6 -month repeat -dose toxicity study with a 4-
month recovery period in Cynomolgus monkeys. In the 1 -month toxicity study, Cynomolgus 
monkeys were administered an IV dose of 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg once weekly for a total of 5

13 doses. Four monkeys/sex/group were euthanized during Week 5. The remaining 2 
monkeys/sex/group were euthanized during Week 23, after a 4- month post-dose per iod. In this 
study, pembrolizumab was well  tolerated in monkeys , with the systemic exposure (AUC) up 
to approximately 170,000 µ g·day/mL over the course of the study. There was no test article –
related mortality, and test article –related changes were limited  to an increased incidence of 
inguinal swelling and increased splenic weights in males receiving 200 mg/kg. Both of these 
findings were not considered adverse and there  was no histopathologic correlation. Splenic 
weights were normal at the post -dose necropsy. Anti-pembrolizumab antibodies were detected 
in 7 out of 8 animals in the 6 mg/kg dose group and 1 out of 8 animals in the 40 mg/kg dose 
group and were associated with an apparent increase in pembrolizumab CL. The presence of 
ADA in monkeys in the low -dose group and in [ADDRESS_696756] 
the pharmacodynamic response, as  sufficient target engagement was demonstrated for the 
duration of the study (with the exception of 1 low -dose monkey). Additionally, anti -
pembrolizumab antibodi es were not detected in any monkeys in the high- dose group, 
suggesting that potential toxicity has been evaluated at the highest exposure levels in the study. Based on the lack of adverse test article- related findings in this study, the no observed adverse  
effect level (NOAEL) was  ≥ 200 mg/kg.  
 In the 6 -month toxicity study, the potential for systemic toxicity was assessed in Cynomolgus 
monkeys administered an IV dose of 6, 40, or 200 mg/kg once every other week for approximately 6 months (a total of 12 dos es) followed by a 4 -month treatment- free period.  
Three animals/sex/group were designated for interim necropsy at the end of the 6- month dosing 
phase ([ADDRESS_696757] dose in Week 23); the remaining monkeys were designated for final necropsy following the 4- month treatment- free period. Pembrolizumab 
was well tolerated at all dose levels. There were no test article -related  antemortem findings, 
electrocardiographic or ophthalmic findings, changes at injection sites, gross observations , or 
organ weight changes at the interim or final necropsy. As there were no test article- related 
histomorphologic findings at interim necropsy, histomorphologic evaluation of tissues collected at final necropsy was not conducted. The presence of ADA was observed in 5 out of 10 animals in the 6 mg/kg/dose group during the dosing phase, which correlated with an 
apparent increased rate of pembrolizumab elimination in these animals.  No anti –
pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in the 40 or 200 mg/kg/dose groups during the dosing 
phase, and no pembrolizumab serum concentration profiles in these [ADDRESS_696758] of ADA on pembrolizumab elimination rate. During the treatment -free period, anti –
pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in 2 animals in the 6 m g/kg/dose  group, which 
already had  ADA present during the dosing phase, and in 2 additional animals (1 in the 6 
mg/kg/dose group and 1 in the 200 mg/kg/dose  group), which were ADA -negative during the 
dosing phase. The detection of anti -pembrolizumab antibodies had a minimal effect on the 
mean group systemic exposure to pembrolizumab during the study and did not impact the evaluation of potential toxicity of  pembrolizumab for the duration of the 6- month study, 
because there were no test article- related effects on any of the parameters examined and no 
monkey in the mid-  and high- dose groups developed ADA during the dosing phase. In 
conclusion, pembrolizumab administered once every other week over a 6- month duration to 
Cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated and the NOAEL was ≥  200 mg/kg/dose (the highest 
dose tested).

[IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab Clinical Trial Data63 
 [IP_ADDRESS].1 Ongoing S tudies  
KEYNOTE -001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) is an open label, first- in-human Phase I study of 
pembrolizumab in subjects  with progressive locally advanced or metastatic carcinomas, 
especially melanoma or  NSCLC.  This study is active, but not recruiting patients. Part A of the 
study involved dose escalation that used a traditional 3+3 design. Cohorts of  3 to 6 subjects 
were enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg  administered every 2 weeks 
(Q2W ). Once the dose escalation was completed, additional subjects were  enrolled into Parts 
A1 and A2 to further characterize the PK and pharmacodynamics of  pembrolizumab. In Parts 
B and D, subjects with metastatic melanoma were enrolled to assess the safety and  antitumor 
activity of pembrolizumab. Additionally, Part B explored 3 different dose  regimens in subjects 
with metastatic melanoma: 10 mg/kg Q2W, 10 mg/kg every 3 week s (Q3W ), and 2 mg/kg 
Q3W.  In Part C, subjects with NSCLC (with prior systemic therapy) were enrolled at 10 mg/kg  
Q3W to assess the tolerability, safety, and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab. Part D 
explored the low and high doses of pembrolizumab identi fied in Parts A and B in subjects with 
advanced or metastatic melanoma . In Part F, non- previously treated (Cohort F -1) and 
previously treated (Cohort F -2) subjects with NSCLC whose tumors expressed PD -L1 were 
enrolled at  10 mg/kg Q2W and 10 mg/kg Q3W to characterize the tolerability, safety, and 
antitumor  activity of pembrolizumab. A small cohort of previously treated ( at least 2 lines of 
systemic therapy ) subjects with NSCLC whose tumors did not express PD -L1 were enrolled 
and treated at a dose of 10 mg/kg Q2W (Cohort F -2). In Cohort F -3, previously treated subjects  
with NSCLC whose tumors express ed PD-L1 were enrolled at 2 mg/kg Q3W to better  
characterize the efficacy, safety, and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab.  Each of the 2 
disease- specific cohorts (melanoma and NSCLC) were enrolled to confirm  tolerability and 
evaluate tumor response to pembrolizumab. The overall response rate and disease control rate 
for 655 melanoma subjects who received pembrolizumab w ere 31% and 51%, respectively. 
The ORR  was 19.4%, and the median DoR w as 12.5 months  for 495 NSCLC patients who 
received pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, or 10 mg/kg Q2W.
64 
Median PFS and OS were 3.7 months and 12 months, respectively.  
 
KEYNOTE -002 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is a part ially blinded, randomized Phase II study designed 
to evaluate 2 doses of  pembrolizumab versus a chemotherapy control arm in subjects with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -refractory metastatic melanoma .65 Subjects (n = 540)  were randomized to receive 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg  Q3W  (n = 180) , pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W  (n = 181) , or 
chemotherapy (according to current clinical  practice; n = 179)  for the treatment of melanoma. 
Subjects assigned to the control chemotherapy arm  could cross over to the experimental 
pembrolizumab arm once progression was confirmed (approximately ≥ Week 12).  Based on 
410 PFS events, PFS was improved in the  pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg ( hazard ratio [ HR]: 0.57; 
95% CI : 0.45–0.73; P <  0.0001) and pembrolizumab  10 mg/kg groups (HR: 0.50; CI:  0.39–
0.64; P <  0.0001) compared with the  chemotherapy group. The 6-month PFS rate  was 34% 
(95% CI : 27–41) in the pembrolizumab  2 mg/kg group, 38% ( 95% CI: 31–45) in the 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 16% ( 95% CI: 10–22) in the chemotherapy group. G rade 
3–4 treatment -related AEs occurred in 20 (11%) patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group,

KEYNOTE -011 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is an open label, non- randomized, multicenter Phase I study 
of pembrolizumab monotherapy in Japanese subjects with advanced solid tumors and in 
combination with  cisplatin/pemetrexed and carboplatin/paclitaxel in subjects with advanced 
NSCLC in Japan. This study is active, but not recruiting patients. In Part A (monotherapy, 3+3 
design), subjects with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of pembrolizumab 
(dose level 1 , 2 mg/kg Q2W;  dose level 2 , 10 mg/kg Q2W ). Three patients received 
pembrolizumab at 2.0 mg/kg and 7 patients received pembrolizumab at 10 mg/kg. No dose -
limiting toxicities  were observed during cycle 1. Eighty percent of patients experienced drug-
related AEs (DRAEs; mostly Grade 1 or 2); the most common DRAEs were nausea, malaise, pyrexia, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) increased (n = 2 each) . No Grade 4 or 5 DRAEs occurred. Immune -related AEs comprised G rade 3 ALT 
increased (n = 1), Grade [ADDRESS_696759] increased (n = 1), Grade 1 pneumonitis (n = 1), and Grade 1 thyroid- stimulating hormone increased (n = 1). A partial tumor response was observed in on e 
patient with NSCLC and in one patient with melanoma.
66 In Part B (combination, 3+6 design),

 KEYNOTE -021 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is an open  label , multicenter  Phase I/II study of 
pembrolizumab at 2 dosing schedules  in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy 
in subjects with locally advanced or  metastatic NSCLC. This study is recruiting patients. The 
study is composed of 2 parts. The objective of Part 1 i s to determine the recommended Phase 
II dose (RP2D) for pembrolizumab in combination with different chemotherapy and/or 
immunotherapy regimens:  
• Cohort A – 1:1 randomization to carboplatin and paclitaxel plus either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg • Cohort B – 1:1 randomization to carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab plus either  
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg • Cohort C – 1:1 randomization to carboplatin and pemetrexed plus either pembrolizumab  
2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg • Cohort D – ipi[INVESTIGATOR_535483]  
• Cohort E – erlotinib plus pembrolizumab  
• Cohort F – gefitinib plus pembrolizumab  
The objective of Part 2 is to evaluate the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab in combination  
with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Part 2 includes a randomized comparison of  
chemotherapy ± pembrolizumab based on the doses defined in Part 1, as well as a cohort

[CONTACT_535517] -023 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is an open  label, multicenter Phase I trial of pembrolizumab 
in combination with lenalidomide (Len) and dexamethasone (Dex) or pembrolizumab and Len 
in subjects with  relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have failed at least 2 lines of prior 
therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomi b or carfilzomib) and an 
immunomodulary derivative (thalidomide, pomalidomide, lenalidomide). This study is 
recruiting patients. The trial uses a modified 3+3 design for dose determination, followed by 
[CONTACT_535518], a further evaluation of  safety, and a preliminary assessment 
of efficacy. During dose  determination, cohorts of  approximately 3 to 6 subjects are enrolled 
and receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg IV Q2W in each 28- day cycle in combination 
with Dex 40 mg QW and/or Len 25 mg or 10 mg on Days 1 to 21. After a preliminary maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD )/maximum administered dose (MAD) is  identified, additional subjects 
are enrolled at a fixed dose of pembrolizumab 200 mg or 100 mg in combination with Len/Dex 
to confirm the MTD/MAD .

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_696762] been obtained in the ongoing  studies KEYNOTE -001, KEYNOTE -002, 
KEYNOTE -012, KEYNOTE -013, and KEYNOTE -023 from subjects with solid tumors  
(KEYNOTE -001 Part A); subjects  with advanced melanoma ( KEYNOTE -001 Parts B and D, 
KEYNOTE -002); subjects with NSCLC ( KEYNOTE -001 Parts C  and F); subjects with 
advanced solid tumors which include breast cancer (TNBC) and head  and neck cancer, 
urothelial tract cancer, and gastric cancer ( KEYNOTE -012); and subjects with hematological 
cancers ( KEYNOTE -013 and KEYNOTE -023). Pre-dose and post -dose samples have been 
obtained in various c ycles: cycles 1, 2, 5,  and 6 for  KEYNOTE -001 melanoma; c ycles 1 and 6 
for KEYNOTE -001 NSCLC; and c ycles 1 and 2 for KEYNOTE -002, KEYNOTE -012, 
KEYNOTE -013, and KEYNOTE -023. Pre -dose samples only were drawn every 3 to 8 cycles 
thereafter. In KEYNOTE -001 Part A, extensive blood sampling was applied during c ycles 1  
and 2 for detailed PK analysis. Pre-dose minimum serum concentration (C trough) and post -dose 
serum concentration (C max) levels were consistent and in good agreement across the different 
studies. There is no  meaningful difference between the pre -dose or post -dose concentration 
values per time point  for the different indications.  
 The PK profile of pembrolizumab was investigated in Part A of the ongoing study KEYNOTE -
001. Results have been obtained following a single dose at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg pembrolizum ab 
to 17 subjects with solid tumors in cycle 1 (Part A and A -1). The observed PK profile of 
pembrolizumab was typi[INVESTIGATOR_535486], with a t 1/2 of 
approximately 2 to 3 weeks. There was no indication of dose dependency of t 1/2
 in the  3 dose 
groups. A dose -related increase in exposure was observed from 1 to 10 mg/kg. The long t 1/[ADDRESS_696763] -dose concentrations of the 10 mg/kg 
Q3W regimens are appr oximately 5 times higher than those of the 2 mg/kg Q3W regimen,  
confirming dose  proportionality of pembrolizumab exposure in this dose range. The overall 
geometric mean 24 -week pre- dose serum concentration values from subjects treated with 10 
mg/kg Q2W  (N = 128 [ N = 89 melanoma subjects and N = 39 subjects other cancer types ]) 
across all studies and indications is 231 μg/mL (range, 191–296 μg/mL), which is on average 30% higher than the week 24 pre -dose concentration (155 μg/mL) from subjects treated with 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
18 10 mg/kg Q3W (range, 154–156 μg/mL ; N = 168 [ N = 161 melanoma subjects and N = 7 
NSCLC subjects ]). 
 
In summary, t he PK profile of pembrolizumab, with low CL and limited volume of  distribution, 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_422473]. Exposure to pembrolizumab is approximately linear in the 
dose range of clinical relevance (1 to 10 mg/kg).  
 [IP_ADDRESS].3 Summary of Immunogenicity Data
63 
Data for immunogenicity assessment are available from subjects with advanced melanoma (KEYNOTE -001, Parts B and D, and KEYNOTE -002) and from subjects with NSCLC 
(KEYNOTE -001, Parts C and F). For the subjects with advanced melanoma, the observed 
incidence o f treatment -emergent ADAs in evaluable subjects was 0.4% (1 out of 268 subjects), 
based on [ADDRESS_696764] with a confirmed treatment -emergent positive status compared with all 
evaluable subjects including 3 with a non- treatment -emergent positive status and 264 with a 
negative immunogenicity status. A subset analysis of subjects treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W was performed. In this analysis, none of the 220 evaluable subjects treated with 2 mg/kg Q3W tested positive for treatment -emergent anti -pembrolizum ab antibodies. None of 
the subjects with NSCLC were classified as treatment- emergent or non- treatment -emergent 
positive. To this point, only 6 of the 290 assessable subjects were treated with 2 mg/kg. Due to the majority of subjects receiving the high dose , only [ADDRESS_696765] sample below the drug tolerance level (DTL) and could be classified as conclusively negative. The other [ADDRESS_696766] or less than 1% of the subjects evaluable for immunogenicity assessment, indicating a low potential of pembrolizumab to elicit the formation of ADA. No im pact of ADA on pembrolizumab exposure, efficacy, or safety has 
been observed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Summary of Efficacy Data
63 
The overall response rate obtained in KEYNOTE -001 demonstrated the  antitumor activity of 
pembrolizumab in subjects with melanoma (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naïve and  previously treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The KEYNOTE -002 study demonstrated superior PFS for both pembrolizumab 
treatment arms compared with the chemotherapy  control arm. In KEYNOTE -002, t reatment 
with pembrolizumab lead to an overall response rate that was > [ADDRESS_696767] progressed after multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Summary of Adverse Event Data63 
In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials ( KEYNOTE -001, KEYNOTE -002, KEYNOTE -
012, KEYNOTE -013, KEYNOTE -28, and KEYNOTE -011 [monotherapy arm ]), the overall 
incidence of AEs  ranged  from 83.0% (73 of 88 subjects in KEYNOTE -012) to 100% (10 of 
10 subjects in KEYNOTE -011). The most commonly reported AEs included fatigue, diarrhea, 
decre ased appetite, nausea, and anemia. The incidence of DRAEs ranged from 39.8% (35 of 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
19 88 subjects in KEYNOTE -013) to 80.0% (8 of 10 subj ects in  KEYNOTE -011). The most 
commonly reported DRAEs across all studies were nausea, fatigue, and diarrhea. The 
incidence  of Grade 3 –5 DRAEs across studies ranged from 6.8% (6 of 88 in KEYNOTE -013) 
to 12.0% (187 of 1562 subjects in KEYNOTE -001/002) . The most commonly reported Grade 
3–[ADDRESS_696768] subjects who experienced 
an AE continued in the study, with the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation ranging 
from 1.9% (8 of 430 subjects in KEYNOTE -28) to 12.3% (192 of 1562 subjects in KEYNOTE -
001/002). The majority of AEs leading to  discontinuation were not considered drug rela ted. 
Discontinuations due to a DRAE were  infrequent and ranged from 0% (no subjects in 
KEYNOTE -011) to 4.5% (4 of 88 subjects in KEYNOTE -013). The  most commonly reported 
DRAEs leading to discontinuation were pneumonitis, ALT increased, and AST  increased.  The 
overall pattern of AEs observed in melanoma subjects enrolled in KEYNOTE -002 
demonstrates  the favorable safety profile of pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy. 
Consistent  with prior observations from randomized comparisons of the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
dose levels when given Q3W , there are no important differences in the safety profile of  
pembrolizumab at these [ADDRESS_696769] a favorable safety profile 
compared with chemotherapy.  
 
In the combination therapy trials  KEYNOTE -021 and KEYNOTE -023, the overall incidence 
of AEs was  95.4% (62 of 65 subjects) and 80% (8 of 10 subjects) , respectively . In KEYNOTE -
021, the most  commonly reported AEs across the dose regimens were fatigue (49.2%), 
constipation and nausea (26.2% each) , decreased appetite (23.1%), diarrhea (18.5%), and  
anemia and alopecia (15.4% each). In KEYNOTE -023, the most commonly reported AEs 
across the dose regimens were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (50.0%  each), followed by 
[CONTACT_108659], respi[INVESTIGATOR_40938] n, and back pain (30.0% each).  The incidence of DRAEs was 
86.2% (56 of 65 subjects) in KEYNOTE -021 and 60.0% (6 of 10 subjects) in KEYNOTE -023. 
In KEYNOTE -021, the most commonly reported DRAEs across the dose regimens were 
fatigue (35.4%); nausea, decreased appetite, and alopecia (13.8% each); diarrhea (12.3%); and 
constipation and AST  increased (10.8% each). In KEYNOTE -023, the most commonly 
reported  DRAEs across the dose regimens were neutropenia and  thrombocytopenia (50.0% 
each) ; anemia (30.0%) ; and dysphonia, hiccups, and pruritis  (20.0% each).  
 
Grade 3 –5 DRAEs were reported in 23.1% (15 of 65 subjects) in KEYNOTE -021 and 50.0% 
(5 of 10 subjects) in KEYNOTE -023. In KEYNOTE -021, the most common Grade 3–[ADDRESS_696770]  increased  (6.2%) and anemia and ALT  increased

In general, the incidence of drug- related SAEs  (DRSAEs) was low. Many  of the events 
occurred in [ADDRESS_696773] each and/or <  1.0% each.  In the pembrolizumab monotherapy trials, the 
most commonly reported DRSAEs (those that  occurred in [ADDRESS_696774] 
1 study) were pneumonitis (range , 0.7% –1.3% of subjects); colitis (range , 0.3% –0.9% of 
subjects), pyrexia (range , 0.3% –0.5%  of subjects); diarrhea (range , 0.2% –0.4%  of subjects ); 
hepatitis (0.7% of subjects); nausea, adrenal  insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperthyroidism, 
hypophysitis, vomiting, and dyspnea  (0.3% of subjects each); and dehydration, generali zed 
edema, hypothyroidism, renal failure  acute, and pericardial effusion (0.2% of subjects each). 
The remaining DRSAEs occurred in  [ADDRESS_696775] each. In  KEYNOTE -021, 8 subjects experienced 
DRSAEs; the DRSAEs were as follows: anemia, febrile neutropenia,  atrial fibrillation, colitis,  
pyrexia, hypersensitivity, ALT  increased,  AST  increased, drug eruption, rash, and urticaria. In 
KEYNOTE -023, 2 subjects  experienced DRSAEs; [ADDRESS_696776] 
(AEOSI) was 16.1%. Overall, the most  commonly reported AEOSI included hypothyroidism 
(7.2%), pneumonitis  (2.9%), infusion reaction (2.5%), and hyperthyr oidism (2.2%). The 
incidences of the remaining AEOSI were low (range , 0.1% –1.3%). The overall incidence of 
drug- related AEOSI was 14.3%. Overall, 2.6% of  subjects discontinued treatment due to an 
AEOSI , and the most commonly reported drug- related  AEOSI lea ding to discontinuation was 
pneumonitis (1.3%). Only one  subject died of AEOSI (pneumonitis, 0.1% of subjects). 
Corticosteroids were not used to manage myositis, pericarditis, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes

 [IP_ADDRESS] HSV -tk Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Many laboratories have shown the in vitro  susceptibility of mouse and human prostate cancer 
cells to HSV -tk/prodrug treatment. Our group has evaluated the effects of ADV -tk + GCV on 
in vivo  tumor growth an d survival in mouse prostate cancer models.
[ADDRESS_696777] intratumoral injection.67-69 Tumor growth was significantly delayed in 
the ADV- tk + GCV group compared with the control groups (ADV -tk  + saline and ADV -β-
galactosidase [control vector] + saline or GCV).67 Tumor volume in the ADV -tk + GCV -
treated group was 16% of that in the combined control groups. However, with longer follow -
up, ADV -tk + GCV -treated tumors began to grow at a rate similar to control tumors. Mean 
survival was 14.2 ± 0.6 days for the combined control groups and 21.2 ± 1.3 days for the 
treatment group (P < 0.001 by [CONTACT_535519] -Cox log- rank analysis). Animal studies have also shown 
that ADV- tk treatment can protect against metastases. In an orthotopic model, t he spontaneous 
metastasis rate was significantly lower for the ADV -tk + GCV treatment group compared with 
the pooled control groups (12.5% [2/16] vs. 71.4% [10/14]; P = 0.0032 by [CONTACT_3493]'s Exact test).70 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
21 Similar results were obtained in experimental metasta sis models (i.e., tail vein injection of 
tumor cells).  HSV- tk/GCV gene therapy in combination with radiation significantly prolonged 
survival compared with either therapy alone and sham treatment  (22.9 ± 1.34 days vs. 16.9 ± 
0.84 days and 11.3 ± 0.77 days, respectively; P < 0.001 by [CONTACT_26500]- rank and Wilcoxon tests).70  
Based on extensive efficacy and toxicity studies in mice, cotton rats , and non- human 
primates ,68, 71 our gr oup designed a dose escalation P hase I clinical study to evaluate the 
potential toxicity of ADV/HSV- tk in humans (Regulatory Affairs Certification [RAC] protocol 
# 9601- 144). The study was evaluated and approved by [CONTACT_290524] 
[IRB] an d institutional biosafety committee and national (RAC and FDA) regulatory bodies. 
Subjects included men with locally recurrent prostate cancer after RT. Vector particles (2 x 
109 to 2 x 1012) were administered in a single intratumoral injection guided by [CONTACT_533574]. Three patients achieved PRs , and only occasional transient toxicities were observed 
(Phase I Study of Adenoviral Vector Delivery of the HSV -tk Gene and the Intravenous 
Administration of Ganciclovir in Men with Local Recurrence of Prostate Cancer after Radiation Therapy, National Institutes of Health- Office  of Recombinant DNA Activities #

Based on our favorable preclini cal and clinical trial data, a P hase I /II study was designed to 
analyze the efficacy and toxicity of HSV -tk gene therapy in combination with RT in prostate 
cancer patients.72 In this study, intravenous GCV was replaced with valacyclovir (Valtrex, 
Glaxo Wellcome), an orally administered medication that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_535487] a cyclovir. The trial consisted of 3 treatment arms: Arm A, low -risk 
patients treated with HSV -tk/valacyclovir + RT; Arm B, high- risk patients treated with the 
same regimen as Arm A with the addition of hormonal therapy; and Arm C, patients with stage D1 (positive pelvic lymph nodes) who received the same regimen as Arm B with the addition of 45 Gy to the pelvic lymphatics. Fifty- nine patients (29 in Arm A, 26 in Arm B, and 4 in 
Arm C) completed the trial. The median age was 68 years (range, 39–85 years). The  median 
follow -up for the entire group was 13.5 months (range , 1.4–27.8 months). Only Arm A patients 
were observed to have an increase in prostate specific antigen (PSA) on day 14, which then declined appropriately. All patients in Arm A (median follow -up, 13.4 months) and Arm B 
(median follow -up, 13.9 months) had biochemica l control at last follow -up. Three patients in 
Arm C (with pretreatment PSA of 335, 19.6, and 2.5 ng/mL and a combined Gleason score of 8, 9, and 9 involving all biopsy cores) had bioche mical failure at 3, 3, and 7.7 months. Two 
patients had distant failure in bone and 1 patient in the para -aortic lymph nodes outside the 
radiation portal. Six to twelve prostate biopsies performed in these 3 patients revealed no evidence of residual carcin oma. In Arm A, biopsy showed no evidence of carcinoma in 66.7% 
(18/27), 92.3% (24/26), 91.7% (11/12), 100% (8/8), and 100% (6/6) of patients at 6 weeks, 4 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months after treatment, respectively. In Arm B, biopsy showed no evidence of carcinoma in 96% (24/25), 90.5% (19/21), 100% (14/14), 100% (7/7), and 100% (2/2) of patients at [ADDRESS_696778] reported trial of its kind in the field o f prostate cancer 
that aimed to expand the
 therapeutic index of RT by [CONTACT_535520].73  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
[ADDRESS_696779] represents a major tumoral immune resistance mechanism. Viral vector -
based gene therapy such as ADV/HSV -tk + GCV has also been shown to induce antitumor 
immune activity by [CONTACT_535521], boosting cytokine stimulatory activity, and increasing lymphocytic infiltrate. The therapeutic potential of HSV -tk gene therapy is greatly enhanced by a “by[CONTACT_145152]” in 
which cytotoxicity is conferred to non- transduced neighboring cells. RT ha s been shown to 
augment endogenous antitumor innate and adaptive immune responses. The beneficial effects of RT in cancer patients extend beyond direct tumor cell cytotoxicity. Delivery of localized radiation to tumors often leads to systemic responses at distant sites, a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect, which has been attributed to the induction and enhancement of endogenous antitumor innate and adaptive immune responses. The mechanisms surrounding the abscopal effect are diverse and include traffi cking of lymphocytes into the tumor microenvironment, 
enhanced tumor recognition and killing via upregulation of tumor antigens and antigen-presenting machinery, and induction of positive immunomodulatory pathways. Thus, RT in combination with immunomodula tors can produce significant local control and induce 
antitumor responses at distant sites by [CONTACT_535522]. Here, we propose a rational combination of  ADV/HSV- tk in situ gene therapy plus 
SBRT followed by i mmunomodulatory therapy with pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
metastatic TNBC and metastatic NSCLC .  
 
 TNBC is a n aggressive, difficult -to-treat disease with poor prognosis and no current targeted 
therapy options. Compared with other intrinsic breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has higher expression levels of PD -L1 and its receptor PD -1, which may hinder antitumor T cell 
responses. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer -related deaths worldwide. NSCLC 
accounts for over 85% of all lung cancer cases. Mos t patients are diagnosed with advanced or 
metastatic (stage IIIB/IV) disease, and current first -line treatment options for these patients are 
limited. In patients with advanced NSCLC, first- line platinum -based doublet chemotherapy 
yields 1- year OS rates of only 30–40% and can cause significant toxicities that may complicate 
treatment.
3 Pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising efficacy in TNBC and NSCLC.64, 74 
In a P hase Ib study, 18.5% of 27 evaluable patients with heavily pretreated recurrent or 
metastatic TNBC responded to pembrolizumab (10 mg/kg Q2W) .74 One patient had a CR, 4 
patients had a PR , 7 patients had stable disease  (SD) , and 12 patients had progressive disease  
(PD). Results of an ongoing Phase Ib study have demonstrated the antitumor act ivity and 
acceptable side effect profile of p embrolizumab in patients with advanced NSCLC. These 
study results have led to FDA accelerated approval of KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) for the  
treatment of patients with metastatic PD -L1-positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on 
or after platinum -containing chemotherapy or targeted therapy against ALK or EGFR, if 
appropriate. Use of ADV/HSV- tk in situ gene therapy plus SBRT before pembrolizumab may 
represent a window of opportunity to enhance pembrolizumab efficacy in patients with 
metastatic TNBC and metastatic NSCLC.

23 4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection   
An open label Phase I trial ( KEYNOTE -001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single -agent pembrolizumab . The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered Q2W in subjects 
with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting 
toxicities were observed. This first -in-human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of 
target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No MTD  has been identified to da te. Ten mg/kg Q2W, the 
highest dose tested in KEYNOTE -001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, 
C, and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity. Recent data from other clinical studies 
within the pembrolizumab program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab  and a less 
frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life.
63 Pharmacodynamic data 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>  21 days). This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing 
schedule.   
 
A population P K analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_696780] a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication. The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed- dose regimen relative to 
a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight -based regimen are anticipated to remain well with in the 
established exposure margins of 0.5–5.0 for pembrolizumab  in the melanoma indication. The 
exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 
mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e., 5-fold higher dose and 
exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed a lack of  significant impact of tumor burden 
on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure  between different indication settings. 
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab in 
solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at either 
2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in mel anoma patients ; 2) the flat exposure -response relationships 
of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg 
Q3W ; 3) the lack of effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of 
pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) ; and 4) the assumption that the 
dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary meaningfully with tumor type. 
The choice of 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed us ing the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the 
fixed dose of 200 mg Q3W  will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those 
obtained with 2 mg/kg dose Q3W ; 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
24 range es tablished in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response;  and 3) will 
maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are 
well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and reduce potential dosing errors. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
ADV/HSV- tk will be administered intratumorally (single -site injectio n) at 5 x 10
11 virus 
particles ( vp) on Day 0. This dose is based on the toxicity results from the Phase I /II study of 
ADV- tk oncolytic virus  therapy in combination with chemoradiation in patients with 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.75  
The dose of valacyclovir to be used in this study is 2 g orally three times daily ( t.i.d.)  for 14 
days ( Day 1 to D ay 15). This dose has been calculated to give a similar AUC  as 10 mg/kg of 
IV acyclovir administered every 8 hours. This is the same dose regimen used in a previous 
Phase I clinical trial of ADV/HSV -tk + acyclovir and topotecan in patients with recurrent 
ovarian cancer.76

**Pembrolizumab will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24  months (35 cycles) in subjects 
without disease progression.  All subjects  who stop pembrolizumab  treatment with complete response  may be eligible for up 
to an additional 1 2 months (17 cycles ) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_535489]. The subject  must meet the conditions out lined in Section 5.2.3.  
 
ADV/HSV- tk 
The tumor will be identified by [CONTACT_28124] ( PET) /CT by [CONTACT_335144]. ADV/HSV- tk will be administered intratumorally as a single injection  using a 21-
gauge needle. For nodal, lung, and liver lesions, ADV/HSV -tk will be administered after 
fiducial placement for SBRT. For primary lung tumors , ADV/HSV- tk will be administered  
under endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guidance. In cases where the tumor cannot be 
accessed by E BUS, a CT -guided injection will be performed. For primary breast tumors , 
ADV/HSV- tk will be administered under ultrasound guidance.  For liver and lung metastatic 
lesions, ultrasound or CT -guided injection of ADV/HSV -tk will be performed.  EBUS will be 
perfo rmed with the patient under sedation. Patients will be monitored until the sedation has 
worn off. For CT -guided injections, local anesthesia will be used and patients will be 
monitored for several hours after the procedure.  
SBRT  
Primary lung tumors and met astatic lesions (breast and lung) will be treated with SBRT  (6 Gy 
X 5 fractions over 2 weeks) . Primary breast tumors will be treated with three -dimensional (3D) 
RT (short course of 5−8 fractions over 2 weeks) . Tumor target will be decided by [CONTACT_10052]/CT 
scan. For the planned dosing regimen, SBRT simulation will be done before treatment. For 
subjects with multiple tumors, the largest tumor will be selected. Sedation is not necessary for 
SBRT.  
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Selection  
The rationale for sel ection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 4.0 –  
Background and Rationale.   
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
30 [IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modification  
Pembrolizumab:  AEs (both non- serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab  
exposure may represent an immunologic etiology.  These AEs  may occur shortly after the first 
dose or several months after the last treatment  dose. Pembrolizumab must  be withheld for drug-
related  toxicities  and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table 3 below. See Section 5.4  for 
supportive care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids.

b If symptoms resolve within one hour of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_13056], the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original infusion rate  (e.g., 
from 100 mL/hr to 50 mL/hr).  Otherwise , dosing will be held until symptoms resolve and the subject should be premedi cated for the 
next scheduled dose.  Refer to Table 4 –  Infusion Treatment Guidelines for further management details.  
c Patients with intolerable or persistent Grade [ADDRESS_696806] dose.  
 
ADV /HSV -tk oncolytic virus  therapy:  Significant toxicity has not been observed with the 
administration of AD V/HSV- tk oncolytic virus  therapy alone or in combination with RT  or 
chemotherapy in previous clinical trials.71, 73, 75, 76 Fever may occur due to the local 
inflammatory and immune response to ADV -tk, which will be treated with acetaminophen as 
necessary. If local inflammation is ex tensive or infection develops, valacyclovir will be 
stopped and antibiotics and/or anti -inflammatory therapy will be given as appropriate.  
In both the TNBC and NSCLC cohort s, ADV/HSV- tk dose will be de -escalated to 5 x 109 vp 
if unacceptable toxicity occurs  with the planned dose of ADV/HSV -tk. If toxicity occurs with 
this dose modification, the dose will be further de -escalated to 5 x 106 vp. 
Dosing interruptions for pembrolizumab and SBRT /3D RT  are permitted in the case of 
medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, 
unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back 
on study therapy w ithin 3 weeks of the s cheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with 
the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in the patient's study record.  
Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an AE including abnormal laboratory value must be followed at least once a week for [ADDRESS_696807]. Dose 
interruptions should be reported on the appropriate Dosage Administration case repor t form 
(CRF ). The maximum time allowed for toxicity -related treatment interruption is 21 days (3 
weeks) from the intended dosing day. If interruption is > [ADDRESS_696808] be discontinued from the study treatment. However, the patient will continue to be followed for toxicity.  
Valacyclovir:  For patients with serum creatinine level of  1.6−2.0 × ULN, valacyclovir dose 
will be reduced 50% (i.e., 1 g t.i.d.). 
5.2.2 Timing of Dose Administration  
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpatient basis. 
ADV/HSV- tk (5 x 10
11 vp) in a 2- mL total volume will be injected intratumorally on D ay 0 of 
the study. For nodal, lung, and liver lesions, ADV/HSV -tk will be administered after fiducial 
placement for SBRT.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
32 Valacyclovir  will be orally administered at a dose of 2 g t.i.d. for 14 days  from Day 1 to D ay 
15 of the study.  
 Primary lung tumors and metastatic lesions (breast and lung) will be treated with SBRT  (30 
Gy; 6 Gy X 5 fractions) . Primary breast tumors will be treated with a short course (5−8 
fractions) of 3D RT . SBRT and 3D RT will be administered over 2 weeks  from  Day 2 to  Day 
16 of the study. 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion Q3W  (± 1 day) .  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. 
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of - 5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: - 5 min/+10 min).  
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for the preparation of the pembrolizumab infusion fluid and administration of infusion solution. 
5.2.3 Second Course  
All subjects who stop pembrolizumab  treatment with CR may be eligible for  up to an additional 
12 months (17 cycles ) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_535490]. This retreatment is termed the Second Course 
Phase of this trial and is only available if the trial remains open and the subject meets the 
following conditions:  
Either 
• Stopped initial treatment with pembrolizumab after at taining an investigator -
determined confirmed CR based on the RECIST 1.1, and 
o Was treated with at least [ADDRESS_696809] 2 cycles of  pembrolizumab beyond the date when the initial CR 
was declared  
OR 
• Had CR and stopped pembrolizumab  treatment after completion of 24 months ( 35 
cycles ) of pembrolizumab  for reasons other than disease progression or intolerability 
AND  
• Experienced  an investigator -determined radiographic disease progression by [CONTACT_535524] T 1.[ADDRESS_696810] dose of 
pembrolizumab, and  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
[ADDRESS_696811] will not be counted as an event for the primary analysis of either endpoint in this trial. 
 
5.2.4 Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator , and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
5.3 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the [COMPANY_006] C linical team. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with 
the investigator and/or the subje ct's primary physician.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_696812]’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_12983]. All concomitant medication will be recorded on the CRF  including all 
prescription, over -the-counter, herbal supplements, and IV  medications and fluids.  If changes 
occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_696813] ( ECIs ) as defined in Section 7.2. 
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications /Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_535491] r modified irRC  and RECIST 1.1:  
• Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy , hormone therapy, or targeted/ biological 
therapy .  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol . 
• RT not specified in this protocol .

34 NOTE: Patients are allowed to have palliative radiotherapy to a painful site if they are 
otherwise benefitting from the trial treatment per the treating physician’s judgment and and 
it is not the target index lesion for tumor response assessment. 
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab and ADV/HSV- tk. 
Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_696814] dose of trial treatment and while participating 
in the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: 
measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster , yellow fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette -Guérin , 
and typhoid vaccine.  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an ECI of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation wi th the Sponsor. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the trial.  Subjects may receive other medications that the investigator deems to be  medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications that  are prohibited in this trial.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.4 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.4.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707]. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs  with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate , these guidelines 
include the use of oral or IV treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessar y as symptoms may worsen when the 
steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional 
supportive care. The  treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator  
determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator  does not 
need to follow the treatment guidance  (as outlined below) . Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for dose 
modification.  It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
• Pneumonitis :  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
35 o For Grade 2 events , treat with s ystemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks.  
o For Grade 3 –4 events , immediately treat with IV  steroids. Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures as needed . 
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid administration. 
 
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subject s should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subject s who experience diarrhea /colitis  should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible,  fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion. For Grade 2 or higher 
diarrhea, consider gastrointestinal consultation and endoscopy to confirm or 
rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , administer oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with IV  steroids followed by [CONTACT_535525] .   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• T1DM if new onset  (including diabetic ketoacidosis ) or ≥ Grade 3 h yperglycemia  
if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 –4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for T 1DM  and for Grade 
3–4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids . When symptom s improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 –4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid s followed 
by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
36 • Hyperthyroidism or Hy pothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes 
in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2– 4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta- blockers (e.g., propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy. 
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy w ith 
levothyroxine or liothyroinine is indicated per standard of care.  
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned 
to baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat w ith IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 –4 events, treat with IV corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Gra de 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 –4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and symptoms usually develop during or 
shortly after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within [ADDRESS_696815] s who experience an infusion reaction 
associated wit h administration of pembrolizumab ( MK-3475) .

azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).   
Female subjects will be considered of non- reproductive potential if they are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no mense s without an alternative 
medical cause; in women < 45 years of age, a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) 
level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in 
women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.);  
OR  
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], or 
bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion at least 6 weeks prior to screening;  
OR  (3) ha ve a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or 
impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study treatment  and for [ADDRESS_696818] dose of study treatment by [CONTACT_139649]:  
  
(1) practice abstinence
† from heterosexual activity;  
 OR   (2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.    Acceptable metho ds of contraception are
‡: 
 Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• intrauterine device  
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_535478]/IND17200/ 5.2019 (v15.0)  
 
 
39 • male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• hormonal contraceptive: contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or 
subcutaneous contraceptive injection 
  †Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s pre ferred and usual lifestyle and if considered 
acceptable by [CONTACT_535526] ( ERCs )/IRBs.  Periodic 
abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable m ethods of contraception.  
Subjects should be informed that the trial therapy  may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study,  
subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of trial therapy  initiation throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_696819]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours  to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious 
adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -
threatening complication to the mother or newborn).   
The study investigator will make every effort t o obtain permission to follow the outcome of 
the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner , the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately 
and the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_696820] milk are about four times higher than in the mother's blood. The safety of valacyclovir in breastfeeding infants has not been established. Since many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for seri ous adverse reactions in the nursing infant, subjects 
who are breastfeeding are not eligible for enrollment.

[ADDRESS_696821] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_535527], the trial 
plan is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding discontinuation or withdrawal a re provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent. 
• Confirmed radiographic disease progression 
• Dose interruption that exceeds 21 days  
• Unacceptable adverse experiences  
• Any G rade 4 or greater AE  
• Severe (Grade 3) or life- threatening (Grade 4) immune -mediated complication  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test  
• Noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Death  
• Administrative reasons  
• Discontinuation of pembrolizumab treatment may be considered for subjects who have 
attained a confirmed CR and have be en treated for at least 8 cycles (at least 24 weeks) 
of pembrolizumab and have received at least 2 cycles  of pembrolizumab beyond the 
date when the initial CR was declared. These subjects may be eligible for second course treatment as described in Section 5.2.3. 
• Completion of 24 months ( 35 cycles ) of pembrolizumab  
 
NOTE: Subjects who stop pembrolizumab after completion of 24 months ( 35 cycles)  may be 
eligible for retreatment if they progress after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_535493] d etailed in Section 5.2.3. Subjects may be retreated in the Second Course Phase 
(Retreatment) for up to an additional 12 months ( 17 cycles  [calculated starting with the first 
dose]). 
 
The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 7.1.5 (Visit 
Requirements). At the end of treatment  (EOT) , each subject will be followed for 30 days for 
AE monitoring ( SAEs  will be collected for 90 days after EOT as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PD will have post -treatment follow -up for 
disease status until disease progression, initiating a non- study cancer treatment, withdrawing 
consent , or becoming lost to follow -up. After documented disease progression each subject 
will be followed by [CONTACT_535528], withdrawal of consent, or the end of the 
study, whichever occurs first.

41 5.7 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements  
3. Incidence or severity of adverse drug reaction in this or other studies indicates a potential 
health hazard to subjects  
4. Plans to modify or discontinue the development of the study drug  
In the event of [COMPANY_006] decision to no longer supply study drug, ample notification will be 
provided so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.

 7.0 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
7.1 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart -  Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit. Individual trial procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].  
Further more, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_112102]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, hepatitis C, etc.) and thus , local reg ulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject. In these cases, such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential subject prior to 
participating in a clinical trial. 
Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_423]’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along wi th the dated signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before participation 
in the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informe d consent form , and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s  
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349]. The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial. The communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captur es the subject’s dated signature [CONTACT_90096] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level.

clinically indicated . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging  
Brain magnetic resonance imaging will be performed on NSCLC patients only at screening.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  and Abscopal Effect Evaluation  
Tumor assessments will be performed at  screening , every 8 week s thereafter until completion 
of the protocol -specified study treatment and/or at the discretion of the treating physician, 
when  clinically indicated, and [ADDRESS_696837] 1.1  in addition to modified irRC  (see Section 12 ). For patients wi th equivocal CT 
scan results, PET scan will be performed.  For abscopal effect evaluation, CT -based response 
assessment (RECIST 1.1) of a non -target lesion will be performed at screening , every [ADDRESS_696838] 1.1, the modified irRC (a) require confirmation of both progression and response by [CONTACT_62576] 8 weeks after initial imaging and (b) do not necessarily score the appearance of new lesions as PD if the sum of lesion diameters of target lesions (minimum of 10 mm per lesion, maximum 
of 5 target lesions, maximum of 2 per organ) and measurable new lesions does not increase by ≥ 20%. All measurements should be recorded in metric notation. The modified irRC based on RECIST 1.1 are defined as follows:  
• New measurable lesions: incorporated into tumor burden.  
• New non -measurable lesions: do not define progression but precludes immune -related CR  
(irCR).  
• Overall irCR: complete disappearance of all lesions (whether measurable or not) and no 
new lesions. All measurable lymph nodes must also have a reduction in short axis to 10 
mm or less.  
• Overall immune -related PR (irPR): ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of 
target and new measurable lesions.  
• Overall immune -related SD (irSD): Sum of the longest diameters of target and new 
measurable lesions neither irCR, irPR, (compared to baseline), or immune -related PD 
(irPD) (compared to nadir).

 • Overall irPD: ≥ 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of target and new 
measurable lesions (compared to nadir), confirmed by [CONTACT_7850], consecutive observations at 
least 4 weeks (normally it should be done at 6 we eks) from the date first documented.  
Documentation of irPD (based on the modified irRC) does not mandate discontinuation of the 
study treatment even after irPD is confirmed with CT scan [ADDRESS_696839] 1.1 are defined as follows:  
Target Lesions (Main Tumor)  
• CR: Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm. 
• PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target les ions, using the baseline 
sum diameters as the reference.  
• PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, using the smallest 
sum on study (includes the baseline sum) as the reference.  In addition to the relative 20% 
increase, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:   the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)  
• SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
using the smal lest sum diameters while on study as the reference.  
 
Non-Target Lesions  
• CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker levels.  All 
lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<  10 mm short axis). 
Note:   If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for 
a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker levels above the normal limits.  
• PD: Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.      
• Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_79465] s hould prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or investigator). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Second Course (Retreatment) Tumor Imaging  
Tumor imaging must be performed within [ADDRESS_696840] on- study imaging assessment should be performed at 8 weeks ( ± 7 
days) after the restart of treatment. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 8 
weeks ( ± 7 days) or more frequently, if clinically indicat ed.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Tissue and Blood Collection and Correlative Studies  
In patients with accessible tumor, biopsies will be conducted at Day 0 and  3 (± 2) days after 
the first dose of pembrolizumab. Subjects whose disease progresses while on treatment  will 
undergo an additional biopsy before start ing their new treatment. Banked tumor tissue obtained 
as part of the subject’s standard of care and collected biopsy tissues will be evaluated for Th1 
response by [CONTACT_535530] (IL-1, IL -2, IL -6, IL -12, IFN -c, TNF -α, and GM-CSF); TILs ;

 7.1.3 Laboratory Procedures/Assessments  
Details regarding specific laboratory procedures/assessments to be performed in this trial are provided below  
Laboratory Safety Evaluations (Hematology, Chemistry , and Urinalysis)
  
A blood sample for clinical chemistry panel (sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, chloride, calcium, glucose, albumi n, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, total protein, 
alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT)  and evaluation of phosphorus, magnesium, and lactate 
dehydrogenase will be obtained at screening , on Days 0 and 17, and every 3 weeks thereafter 
until completion of the protocol -specified treatment , at EOT, and when clin ically indicated.
 
PT/INR and aPTT will be tested at screening  and on Day 17. Thyroid- stimulating hormone,

7.1.4 Other Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to trial completion, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the final trial visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation. Any AEs  
which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be  followed in accordance 
with the safety requirements outlined in Section 7.2 -  Assessing and Recording Adverse 
Events.   
7.1.5 Visit Requirements  
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0 -  Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure -related 
details are provided above in Section 7.1 -  Trial Procedures.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Post -Treatment Visits  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_696846]. All AEs that occur prior to the Safety Follow -Up Visit should be recorded.  
Subjects with an AE of Grade > 1 will be followed until the resolution of the AE to Grade 0–[ADDRESS_696847]:    Pembrolizumab  52 
Protocol/Amendment No.:    
 
  
 
 within 90 days of EOT  or before initiation of a new antic ancer  treatment should also be 
followed and recorded.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Follow -up Visits  
 Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than disease progression will move into the Follow -Up Phase and should be assessed every 6 weeks ( 42 ± 7 days) by [CONTACT_165919]. After 1 year, the imaging time point will occur every 9 weeks (± 7 days).  Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status 
until the start of new antineoplastic therapy, disease progression, death, or end of the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_696848] a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE  can, therefore, be any unfavorable  and 
unintended sign ( e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not 
considered related to  the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure. Any worsening 
(i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associ ated with the study treatment  is also an AE. Progression of 
the cancer under study is not considered an AE.  
All AEs that occur after informed  consent form signing must be reported by [CONTACT_535531] a protocol -specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, 
placebo treatment , or a procedure.
  
 From the time of informed consent signing through [ADDRESS_696849] be reported by [CONTACT_093]. AE reporting will be performed according to 21 
CFR 312.32.
 AEs will be recorded at each examination on the Adverse Event 
CRFs /worksheets. AEs (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described 
using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separ ate AE.
 Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be 
recorded in the Medical History page of the subject ’s CRF.  The reporting timeframe for AEs  
meeting any serious criteria is described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. The investigator  will make every 
attempt to follow all subjects with non -SAEs  for outcome. 
Product:    Pembrolizumab  53 
Protocol/Amendment No.:    
 
  
 
 AEs will not be collected for subjects during the prescreening period as long as that subject 
has not undergone any protocol -specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a 
blood draw, fresh tumor biopsy etc., the subject is first required to provide consent to the main 
study and AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the patient at each 
study visit. AEs may also be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_535532], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determ ine: 
 1. Severity grade (CTCAE G rade 1 –4) 
2. Duration (Start and end dates or if continuing at the Safety Follow -up Visit)  
3. Relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], unknown, not applicable)  
5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non- drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non- drug therapy)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown)  
7. Whether it is serious, where a SAE is defined as in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study treatment including possible interruption or  discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_535496], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its 
resolution, and assessm ent should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of 
any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.   
7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporti ng of Overdose to the 
Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 
mg or greater (≥  5 times the indicated dose). No specific information is available on the 
treatment of pembrolizumab  overdose. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided 
if clinically indicated.  In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs 
of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an AE (s) is associated with (“results from”) pembrolizumab  overdose, the AE (s) is reported 
as a SAE , even if no other seriousness criteria are met. 
If a dose of pembrolizumab  meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious ECI, using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”

 For valacyclovir overdose, activated charcoal may be administered to aid in the removal of 
unabsorbed drug. General supportive measures are recommended. Acute renal failure and neurological symptoms, including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, decrease d 
consciousness and coma, and nausea and vomiting may occur. Caution is required to prevent inadvertent overdose. Many of the reported cases involved renally impaired and geriatric patients receiving repeated overdoses due to lack of appropriate dosage reduction. 
All reports of overdose with and without an AE must be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor ([EMAIL_10237]

7.2.3 Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to th e Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916] , unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062] : 
o routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication and not associated 
with any deterioration in condition 
Product:    Pembrolizumab  55 
Protocol/Amendment No.:    
 
  
 
 o elective or preplanned treatment for a preexisting condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under  study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
o treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
o social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999] ’s general condition;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is another important medical event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may b e considered 
serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or 
involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.   
• Note:  In addition to the above criteria, AE s meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) definition, 
are reportable to the [COMPANY_006] in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by [CONTACT_131892].  
o Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);  
o Is associated with an overdose.  
Refer to Table 6 for additional details regarding each of the above criteria.  
From the time of informed  consent form signing, any SAE  or follow up to a SAE , including 
death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section [IP_ADDRESS] for ad ditional details) , that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor ( [EMAIL_10237]
; FAX 713 -790-5106) and within [ADDRESS_696852] initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any SAE  or follow up to a S AE, including death due to any cause 
other than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional

 Table 6 Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all AEs  as to:  
V4.0 3 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mi ld symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  
 
Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL ). 
 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_535497]; disabling; 
limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade [ADDRESS_696857] medical occurrence that at any dose : 
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or  places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This doe s not include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay, even if the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19358] a pre- existing condition that has not 
worsened is not a SAE .  A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of the study treatment  and is documented in the subject ’s 
medical history.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis) ; or 
 Is a new cancer  (that is not a condition of the study)  (although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] within 2 
working days to meet certain local requirements); or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any AE associated with an overdose is considered a SAE for collection purposes. An overdose that is not associated 
with an AE is considered a non -serious ECI and must be reported within [ADDRESS_696858] and may require medical or surgical intervention to preven t one of the outcomes listed previously 
(designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the AE. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units  
Action taken  Did the AE cause the study treatment  to be discontinued?  
Relationship to 
the study 
treatment   Did the study treatment  cause the AE? The determinati on of the likelihood that the study treatment  caused the AE will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified 
physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically 
qualified assessment of causality was  done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as ref erence 
guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the study treatment  and the AE based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the study treatment  and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and 
their respective elements (in number and/or intensity ), the more likely the study treatment  caused the AE:  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was a ctually exposed to the study treatment  such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment, expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurem ent of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from  administration of the study treatment ?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect? 
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental  factors  
 
[ADDRESS_696859]  and the AE: (continued)  
to [COMPANY_006]  
Product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improve d despi[INVESTIGATOR_77992]’s product; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the sub ject re -exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product  in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is  a single- dose drug trial); or (3) 
Sponsor’s product(s) is/are used on ly one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY [CONTACT_535534] , OR IF REEXPOSURE TO THE MERCK PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE 
SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_535535].  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with previous k nowledge regarding the [COMPANY_006]  product or drug class pharmacology or 
toxicology? 
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the CRFs /worksheets by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including considerat ion 
of the above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present  to be indicative of [COMPANY_006]  product relationship).  
Yes, there is a rea sonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006] product  
relationship.  There is evide nce of exposure to the [COMPANY_006] product .  The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the  administration of the [COMPANY_006] product  is 
reasonable. The AE is more likely exp lained by [CONTACT_535536].  
No, there is not a rea sonable 
possibility of  [COMPANY_006] product  
relationship  Subje ct did not receive the [COMPANY_006] product  OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the [COMPANY_006] product  is not reasonable 
OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_535537] .  (Also entered for a subject with overdose without an associated AE.)

 7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs , and investigators in accordance 
with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
Sample Size: For the TNBC cohort, the null and alter nate hypothes es are 19%  ORR78 and 39% 
ORR , respectively . For the NSCLC cohort, the null and alternate hypothes es are 20% ORR79 
and 40% ORR , respectively . For the TNBC cohort, the target response rate is 39%.  With a 
sample size of 28 patients, if the observed number of responders is 11 (39.3%); the 95% CI 
estimate will have a margin of error of 18.1 percentage points (i.e., 21.2% to 57.4%) based on the normal approximation.  For the NSCLC cohort, the target response rate is 40%.  With a 
sample size of 29 patients, if the observed number of responders is 12 (41.4%); the 95% CI estimate will have a margin of error of 17.9 percentage points (i.e., 23.5% to 59.3%) based on the normal approximation. For both the TNBC and NSCLC cohorts, we will implement a sa fety 
run-in period for the initial subjects enrolled onto the study. An initial cohort of [ADDRESS_696860] 3 patients after each individual i s enrolled onto this trial via a 
Reportable Event application . If only 1 of 3 patients experience toxicity, then 3 more patients 
will be enrolled. If no more than 1 of 6 patients experience toxicity, then the trial will be fully opened. The staggering inte rval will be 5 weeks for the run- in cohort. 
Statistical Analysis:  DoR, OS  rate, PFS rate, and CBR  will be analyzed. Safety profiles will 
also be assessed through summaries of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 
and treatment -related death.  The safety analysis will report the frequency of all AEs and 
laboratory abnormalities as well as the frequency of dose interruptions and toxicity- related 
treatment discontinuation. Toxicity rates will be presented using the worst NCI CTCAE grade per patient.

 1.0 OBJECTIVES:  
 Primary objective 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  5 1) To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level of SOM 230 in combination with 
docetaxel and prednisone. 
 
Secondary objectives:  
1) To evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of the combination in metastatic CRPC. 
2) To evaluate preliminary efficacy of the combination of SOM 230 and docetaxel and 
prednisone as defined by [CONTACT_313346] (m easurable and PSA), time to progression 
(TTP) and overall survival (OS).  
3) To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (P K) of the combination. 
4) To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the combination as seen by [CONTACT_902974]-1, serum chromogra nin A (SCA), and neuron specific enolase 
(NSE), and to associate them with TTP and OS. 
5) To assess the pretherapy circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts and change in CTC after 
therapy, and to associate them with TTP and OS.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND: 
 
Docetaxel based chemotherapy is FDA app roved in metastatic CRPC due to the results of 2 
randomized trials [ 1,2] demonstrating improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) as compared to mitoxa ntrone and prednisone therapy. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_902955], the improvement in OS remains modest and 
usually does not achieve cure. The median pro gression free survival (PFS) with docetaxel 
and prednisone therapy is [ADDRESS_1266513] 
demonstrated increased risk of toxicity, and an increased rate of death as observed with the 
docetaxel and calcitriol  and docetax el and GVAX combinations [3,4]  
Given the limited median progression free survival of 6 months noted in metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy, it appe ars that resistance to docetaxel develops fairly 
quickly in majority of the prostate cancers. One of the mechanisms of resistance reported has 
been the multidrug resistance gene overexp ression hence diminishing the exposure of the 
cancer cells to docetaxel. Currently a microtubule inhibitor agent called cabazitaxel [[COMPANY_011]- 
Aventis Inc] has demonstrated OS improvement in metastatic CRPC progressing after 
docetaxel therapy. This agent has efficacy possibly by [CONTACT_902975]. One of the other mechanisms of resistanc e reported has been the neu roendocrine differentiation of 
prostate cancer cells leading to decreased efficacy of docetaxel. Overcoming these 
mechanisms of resistance with novel agents give n in combination with docetaxel, is rational. 
In addition,there is a preponderance of elderly patients, with associated comorbidities in the metastatic CRPC population. Hence, the added nove l agent has to be well tolerated and 
cannot significantly compromise docetaxel efficacy and dosing . Based on above, there 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  6 remains a  need for effective and better tolerated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_902956].  
 
Pasireotide (SOM-230) is a multitargeted somatostatin receptor (sst) analogue that binds 
to 4 of the 5 receptors (sst1,2, 3 and 5) [5]. The binding occurs with extremely high affinity; 
30X higher for sst 1, comparable for sst 2, 5X higher for sst 3, and 40X higher for sst [ADDRESS_1266514] 1, 2 and 5 are expressed on prostate cancer cells and SOM-230 demonstrated 44% inhibition in xenograft models of human PC3 tumors  [6] The somatostatin analogs; octreotide and lanr eotide increase the cytotoxic effect, 
and can overcome the resistance to docetaxel in PC3 cells, inhibit androgen-independent growth, and induce apoptosis ( 7, 8). Also the neuroendocrine  component within metastatic 
prostate cancer is likely to be refractory to chemotherapy, but sensitive to somatostatin receptor analogues. Treatment of the human horm one and chemotherapy-refractory prostate 
cancer cell lines; PC3 and DU145, resulted in synergistic cytotoxic activity and apoptosis, 
and reduced secretion of stem cell factor and platelet-derived growth factor in PC-[ADDRESS_1266515] growth factor in DU-145 
cells [ 7,8]. One phase II study at UCSF investigated the effect of octreotide LAR on CRPC 
[ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ]. Patients were treated with octreotide-LAR (30 
mg every 4 weeks) together with LHRH-analogs. No steroids were permitted as concomitant medication. The primary endpoint of PSA response was not met, but IGF-1 levels were reduced and IGFBP-1 levels were increase d after 3 months of therapy, hence indicating the 
mechanism of IGF inhibition [9]. A phase II randomized trial of somatostatin analogue and dexamethasone ,versus combination of estramustine and etoposide revealed comparable 
response rates, palliative effects and comparable su rvival in metastatic CRPC. The toxicity 
profile however was much more favorable in the somatostatin analogue and steroid therapy 
arm [ 10].  Since pasireotide has increased affinity to the somatostatin receptors as compared 
to the other analogues, it is rational to hy pothesize a higher level of activity in metastatic 
CRPC and a possibility of overcoming doce taxel resistance with the combination. The 
preclinical activity and clinical safety of pasireotide, and the efficacy of somatostatin 
analogues in metastatic CRPC, creates a strong rationale for exploring the safety and activity of the combination of SOM 230 and docetaxel in metastatic CRPC.

 Mechanism of Action 
Like natural somatostatin and other  somatostatin analogues (SRIF a), pasireotide exerts its 
pharmacological activity via binding to somatost atin receptors (sst). There are five known 
somatostatin receptors: sst 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Somatostatin receptors are expressed in different 
tissues under normal physiological conditions. Somatostat in analogues activate these receptors 
with different potencies (Schmid and Schoeffter 2004) and this activation results in a reduced 
cellular activity and inhibition of hormone secr etion. Somatostatin receptors are strongly 
expressed in many solid tumors, especially in neuroendocrine tumors where hormones are 
excessively secreted e.g. acromegaly (Freda  2002), GEP/NET tumors (O berg, Kvols et al. 2004) 
and Cushing’s disease.  
The SRIFa currently approved for use in the cl inic (octreotide and lanreotide) have a high 
affinity to the sst subtype 2 (sst2), with moderate or no affinity to the remaining subtypes. Pasireotide is a novel cyclohex apeptide somatostatin analogue that exhibits a unique binding 
profile, binding with high affinity to fou r of the five known human somatostatin receptors. 
(Table 1) Compared to Sandostatin
® (octreotide acetate), pasireotide exhibits a binding affinity, 
which is 30-40 times higher for human sst1 and sst5, 5 times higher for human sst3, and 2.5 times lower for human sst2. A detailed summary of available preclinical data is provided in the [Investigators' Brochure].

Clinical experience with pasireotide 
Pasireotide is available as a short -acting subcutaneous (s.c) formulation and a long acting release 
(LAR) intramuscular (IM) formulation.    
Pasireotide s.c. 
Pasireotide when given subcutaneously (s.c.) was we ll-tolerated at doses up to 600 µg b.i.d., 900 
μg b.i.d. and 1200 μg b.i.d by [CONTACT_628496], Cushing’s disease and carcinoid tumor patients, 
respectively. In addition, healthy volunteers have received pasireoti de s.c. as a continuous 
infusion for seven days with total daily doses of up to [ADDRESS_1266518] frequently re ported adverse events were gastrointestinal, p redominantly 
diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain . Generally these events were mild, transient and only 
occasionally caused patients to discontinue treatment. 
Hyperglycemia  was also observed for patients in al l three indications. In general HbA1c was 
observed to increase by [CONTACT_3450] 1%, corr esponding to a blood glucose increase of 
approximately 30 mg/dL. Blood glucose increa ses tended to occur with increasing dose, and 
appeared to be more notable in pa tients who had a history of hyperglycemia or diabetes mellitus 
prior to receiving pasireotide. However hype rglycemia in these patients was responsive to 
appropriate diabetic management such as adjustments in oral antidiabetic treatment, or in some 
cases the addition of insulin. 
Occassionally laboratory abnormaliti es in liver function tests and pa ncreatic enzymes have been 
observed at higher doses of pasireotide. Th ese events however have been transient. 
Further details on pasireotide s.c. can be  found in the Investigator Brochure. 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  10  
Phase II studies of pasireotide s.c. in neuroendocrine tumors 
Preliminary safety data are available from a Phase II study [CSOM230B2202] in [ADDRESS_1266519] after approximately 6 
months. There was no apparent relationship between the weight loss and pasireotide dose. 
Preliminary efficacy data from this study also support that pasireotide is active in patients 
refractory/resistant to Sandostatin LAR, as pa rtial or complete symptom control was observed in 
12 of 44 patients (27%). Complete response was achieved in two patients at the pasireotide 600 
µg s.c. b.i.d. dose and one at the 900 µg s.c. b.i.d. dose. Nine patients achieved partial response 
to treatment, three at each of the f ollowing doses: 600, 750, 900 µg s.c. b.i.d. 
 
Clinical Safety 
Pasireotide LAR has been evaluated as 5 diff erent formulations (1, 2, 2b, 2c, and 3) at 
different dose levels varying between 10 and 60 mg in healthy volunteers [CSOM230C2101]. 
Formulation 2b at the tested doses of [ADDRESS_1266520] favorable PK profiles and was selected for further cl inical development in acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, 
and Cushing’s disease. Therefore, only the data on formulation 2b are described here.  
Clinical PK Following a single i.m. injection of 40 mg or  60 mg in healthy volunteers [CSOM230C2101], 
the pasireotide LAR formulation demonstrated a c ontrolled-release type of concentration-  
versus-time profile, with an initial spi[INVESTIGATOR_902957] 1 followed by a slow-release process 
for up to 42 days. The Cmax of the extended release phase was observed approximately on day 20 for both dose levels. Pharmacokinetic exposure was dose-proportional for the doses tested. The relative bioavailability of pasireotide L AR to pasireotide s.c. wa s approximately 100%. 
Based on the single-dose data for 40 and 60 mg, PK simulation demonstrated that the LAR formulation would be suitable for monthly (every 28 days, q 28 d) dosing regimen and a steady state could be achieved after 3 injecti ons in healthy volunteers. The accumulation 
(based on the ratio of Ctrough,ss/Ctrough,d28) was predicted to be approximately 20%. Following monthly (q 28 d) injections of 20 mg, 40 mg or 60 mg pasireotide LAR in patients 
with acromegaly or carcinoid tumors [CSOM230 C2110], preliminary results showed an 
approximately linear dose-exposure proporti onality and a steady state achieved following 
[ADDRESS_1266521] injection of 40 and 60 mg LAR 
in acromegalic patients and patients with carc inoid tumors were similar to those from a single 
dose of 40 and 60 mg LAR in healthy volunteers. The PK exposure to pasireotide at steady 
state in acromegalic patients was comparable to the simulated PK exposure at steady state in healthy volunteers, whereas, the PK exposure in patients with carcinoid was roughly 2-fold that in acromegalic patients. The accumulation (based on the ratio of Ctrough,d84/Ctrough,d28) 
was observed as approximately 20-40% for acromeg alic patients and 20-80% for patients with 
carcinoid, respectively. 
Clinical PK/PD of pasireotide LAR 
Following 3 monthly (q 28 d) i.m. injections of pasireotide LAR in acromegalic patients 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  11 [CSOM230C2110], preliminary results from PD analysis has demonstrated dose-response 
relationship for both GH and IGF-1 following 3 monthly injections of 20, 40 or 60 mg 
pasireotide LAR. Emax, EC50, E0, and γ across dose groups for GH were estimated as 19.6 ± 
32.0 ng/mL, 5.9 ± 4.1 ng/mL, 4.4 ± 7.8 ng/mL, and 1, respectively. Emax, EC50, E0, and γ  
across dose groups for IGF-1 were  estimated as 536 ± 174 ng/mL, 6.4 ± 4.4 ng/mL, 223 ± 143 
ng/mL, and 1, respectively. Pasireotide LAR demonstrated similar potency on both GH and 
IGF-1 suppression as the median values of EC50 were similar (4.6 and 4.8 ng/mL, respectively). The median value of  EC50 for GH suppression was similar between pasireotide 
LAR (4.6 ng/mL) and s.c. (3.8 ng/mL for responders and 3.2 ng/mL for non-responders), suggesting a similar pharmacological activity between the s.c. and LAR formulations.  
Clinical safety 
Single doses of pasireotide s.c. up to 1500 μg q.d. and 750 μg b.i.d. multiple s.c. doses  
(7-14 days) up to 1500 μg q.d., 750 μg b.i.d, and 2100 μg b.i.d. (up to 5 days), and continuous  
(7-day) s.c. infusion by [CONTACT_497636], have been well-tolerated, with mostly mild, transient 
side effects reported. The most common adve rse events (AEs) were  gastrointestinal, 
predominantly mild diarrhea and nausea requiring no treatment or study discontinuation. 
These effects were seen at all doses, but occurred more frequently at higher doses in all studies. The frequency of the gastrointestinal events appeared to decrease with time in multiple-dose studies. A number of subjects also reported mild to moderate headaches; similarly these were also tra nsient and required no treatment. 
Single and multiple doses of pasireotide s.c. have ge nerally been well tolerated by [CONTACT_902976], metastatic carcinoid tumor, or Cushing’s disease. Pasireotide has been  
tested in the Phase II studies at maximum doses of up to 600 μg b.i.d for acromegalic patients,  
900 μg b.i.d for patients with Cushing’s disease, and [ADDRESS_1266522] on blood glucose was more pronounced in patients with Cushing’s disease, a setting in which glucose metabo lism is 
inherently dysregulated. Blood glucose increases tended to occur with increasing dose, and 
appeared to be more notable in patients who ha d a history of hyperglycemia or diabetes 
mellitus prior to receiving pasireotide. However, hyperglycemia in these patients was responsive to appropriate diabetic management such as adjustments in oral antidiabetic treatment, or in some cases the addition of insulin. In  acromegalic patients, median changes in 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values over time in patients generally did not exceed 0.60%, regardless of pasireotide dose level or duration of treatment. Although no pre-clinical or clinical studies have revealed any specific pasireotide-related 
cardiac toxicity issues, a thorough clinical QT/QTc evaluation was performed in healthy volunteers in [CSOM230B2113]. In Part I of the study, pasireotide doses from 900 μg to  
2100 μg were explored, after which the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for pasireotide was  
defined as 1950 μg s.c. b.i.d. The MTD was then used as the pasireotide dose for Part II of the 
study (i.e. a three- way crossover design using moxiflo xacin, placebo and pasireotide 1950 μg  
s.c. b.i.d). An effect of pasireotide (at MTD) on QTcF interval was demonstrated. This was based on the upper bound of the  95% one-sided CI for the difference from placebo in QTcF 
change from baseline being > [ADDRESS_1266523] at 2 hours postdose (of 17.5 ms and 8.5 ms QTcF change from baseline versus placebo, respectively). Pasireotide subjects also showed a reduction in 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  12 HR at 0 to 4 hours postdose (maximum cha nge versus baseline of 10.7 bpm). 
 
Pasireotide LAR in healthy volunteers 
Most of the experience with pasire otide comes from healthy volunteer and patient studies 
evaluating the subcutaneous formulation of pasireoti de.  Pasireotide LAR is being evaluated in 
two studies, one healthy volunteer study and one  study involving patients with acromegaly and 
carcinoid disease. 
Preliminary data from the healthy volunteer stud y found single IM doses of pasireotide LAR, at 
doses of up to [ADDRESS_1266524] of the subjects and was 
sometimes associated with abdominal pain, flatulence, and/or nause a.  The gastrointestinal 
events were mild or moderate in severity.  About 38% of subjects reported mild injection site 
pain and about 15% reported headaches. 
Transient elevations in liver function tests and/or pancreatic enzymes were observed in two 
subjects, both of which resolved and were not a ccompanied by [CONTACT_628497].  Mild 
increases in fasting blood glucose were obser ved in some subjects during the pasireotide LAR 
treatment period.  All elevations were asymptomatic, considered not clinically significant and 
generally returned to normal within 3 to 4 weeks after the pasireotide LAR IM injection. 
 Pasireotide LAR in acromegalic patients 
Preliminary safety data are available from 18 acromegalic patients trea ted with pasireotide LAR 
in an ongoing study [CSOM230C2110]. These patients had received pasireotide LAR  at doses 
of 20 (n=5), 40 (n=6) or 60 mg (n=7) for about six weeks at the time of the summary.  
Pasireotide LAR was well-tolerated by [CONTACT_902977]. The most common 
drug-related adverse events were gastrointestinal, predominantly diarrhea. Mild erythema 
reported as drug-related was experienced by [CONTACT_902978]. Two patients on the 60 mg dose were 
reported to experience drug-related increas es in blood glucose: mild diabetes mellitus was 
reported for one patient and mi ld hyperglycemia was reported fo r the other patie nt who also had 
a history of diabetes mellitus at baseline. A further patient who received the 20 mg dose 
experienced hyperglycemia, however this event wa s considered to be unrelated to study drug by 
[CONTACT_093]. All three patients were given oral hy poglycemic agents and all continued in the 
trial.  
Following 2-3 injections of pasireotide LAR in acromegaly  patients [CSOM230C2110], steady-
state concentrations of pasireoti de were achieved.  The trough plasma concentrations of 
pasireotide at steady state (Cmin.ss) on day 84 were 3.8 ± 2.1, 5.6 ± 2.4, and 13.8 ± 10.2 ng/mL 
for 20 mg (N=9), 40 mg (N=9), and 60 mg (N=11) LAR, respectively, indicating an   
approximate dose proportionality. 
   
Pasireotide LAR in carcinoid patients 
An interim analysis of the results of [CS OM230B2202] showed that, at the time of response, 
pasireotide at total daily doses of >900 to ≤1200 μg, >1200 to ≤1500 μg, and >1500 to  
≤1800 μg s.c. successfully controlled (completely or  partially) the symptoms of diarrhea and  
flushing, for at least 15 days for 12 (27%) of the patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors that 
were refractory or resistant to octreotide LAR. 
There was no evidence of tumor shrinkage. Pa tients who achieved complete or partial 
symptom control (treatment success) had stable di sease. In responders, the median effective 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  13 concentration of pasireotide was estim ated as approximately 10 ng/mL. 
Clinical responses were observed at 600 μg s.c. b.i.d. and above doses. In view of the large  
inter- patient variability, doses above 600 μg s.c. b.i.d. will be considered for future clinical  
studies to maximize the clinical benefit of  pasireotide in patients with metastatic carcinoid 
tumors. Preliminary safety data are avai lable from nine carcinoid patients treated with 
pasireotide LAR in an ongoing study [CSOM230C 2110]. These patients ha d received pasireotide 
LAR at doses of 20 (n=1), 40 (n=4) or 60 mg (n= 4) for about six weeks at the time of the 
summary. Pasireotide LAR was well-tolerated by [CONTACT_628500]. Si x out of nine treated 
patients reported at least one AE and the most commonly reported AEs were gastrointestinal.  
However, most of these events were considered unrelated to study drug.  Two patients reported 
hyperglycemia judged as related to study drug, on e was mild and one moderate.  The patient who 
experienced moderate hyperglycemia had a past history of diabetes mellitus at entry to the study 
and died due to carcinoid tumor progression. 
Although pasireotide exposures appe ar to be higher in patie nts in comparison with healthy 
volunteers, the data from studies assessing the subcutaneous formulatin of pasireotide support 
that pasireotide LAR at dose of 60 mg and below are expected to be well-tolerated by [CONTACT_1962].  
A healthy volunteer study was conducted of pa sireotide s.c. by [CONTACT_902979] 2,025 mcg per day [SOM230B2108].  The dose of 2,025 mcg by s.c. infusion per day 
was well-tolerated and is equivalent to a dose of 56.7 mg from a single 28 day IM depot injection 
of pasireotide LAR.  Data resulting from studies [SOM230B2108] and [SOM230B2202] are 
described fully in the Pas ireotide s.c Investigato r’s Brochure.  
Possible indications and medical needs 
In all animal models investigated (rodent, do g, monkey) pasireotide is a more effective 
inhibitor of the GH/IGF-1 axis than octreotide. Thus, pasireotide should exhibit superior efficacy in acromegaly, and may be of use in patients either not responding or becoming resistant to octreotide therapy Lambe rts, van der Lely, and Hofland 2002).  Since pasireotide 
has a higher binding affinity and functional activity for receptors other than sst2 (Schmid and 
Schoeffter 2004) , it may also have utility in ca rcinoid patients whose disease has either not 
responded or become resistant to therapy with othe r somatostatin analogues. In addition to the 
treatment of diseases for which other  somatostatin analogues are currently approved, other 
possible indications are being explored, such as Cushing’s disease. In vitro experiments have  
shown that pasireotide inhibits ACTH secretion in cultured adenoma cells from patients with 
Cushing’s disease (Hofland, et al 2003) . The hypothesis that pasireotide may be able to reduce 
cortisol levels by [CONTACT_902980]. In 29 efficacy- evaluable patients with Cushing’s dise ase, there were reductions in the  
mean plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels re gardless of the extent of reduction in urinary 
free cortisol (UFC). The final development strategy for pasireotide will be based on early proof of concept (POC) 
studies in healthy volunteers and in disease settings where pasireotide may be effective, such 
as acromegaly, Cushing’s disease, or GEP -NET tumors. The pharmacodynamic and efficacy 
profile of pasireotide in huma ns elucidated in these studies will be used to refine the overall 
scope of possible clinical indications for pasireotide.   
3.2 DOCETAXEL (TAXOTERE
/g163/g163)  
 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  14 3.21  Description:  Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family. 
It is prepared by [CONTACT_391415] a precursor extracted from the renewable 
needle biomass of yew plants. The chemical name [CONTACT_391430] (2R,3S)-N-carboxy-3-phenylisoserine,N- tert-butyl ester, 13-ester with [ADDRESS_1266525]-white powder with an empi[INVESTIGATOR_299754] C
43H53NO 14• 3H 2O, and a molecular 
weight of 861.9. It is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water. TAXOTERE (docetaxel) for Injection Concentrate is a clear yellow to brownish-yellow viscous 
solution.  Docetaxel is sterile, non-pyrogenic, and is available in single-dose vials 
containing 20 mg (0.5 mL) or 80 mg (2.0 mL ) docetaxel (anhydrous). Each mL contains 
40 mg docetaxel (anhydrous) and 1040 mg polysorbate 80. 
 
Clinical Pharmacology:  Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by [CONTACT_902981]. Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into 
stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibit ing their disassembly. This leads to the 
production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules, which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells. Docetaxel's binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules, a feature which differs from most s pi[INVESTIGATOR_391387]. 
 
A. Preparation of the Initial Diluted Solution 
 
1. Gather the appropriate number of vials of docetaxel for injection concentrate and 
diluent (13% Ethanol in Water for Injection).  If the vials were refrigerated, allow 
them to stand at room temperature for  approximately 5 minutes. 
 
2. Aseptically withdraw the contents of the a ppropriate diluent vial into a syringe and 
transfer it to the appropriate vial of doc etaxel for injection concentrate. If the 
procedure is followed as described,  an initial diluted solution of 10mg 
docetaxel/ml will result.   
 
3.  Gently rotate the initial diluted solution for approximately 15 seconds to assure full 
mixture of the concentrate and diluent.  
 4.  The initial diluted docetaxel solution (10 mg docetaxel/ml) should be clear; 
however, there may be some foam on top of the solution due to the polysorbate 80. 
Allow the solution to stand for a few minutes to allow any foam to dissipate. It is 
not required that all foam dissipate prior to continuing the preparation process.  
  The initial diluted solution may be used immediately or stored either in the  
 refrigerator or at room temperature for a maximum of eight hours.  
 
B. Preparation of the Final Dilution for Infusion 
 

Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  15     1.  Aseptically withdraw the required a mount of initial diluted docetaxel solution  (10 
mg docetaxel/ml) with a calibrated syringe and inject into a NON- PVC infusion 
bag or bottle of either 0.9% sodium chloride solution or 5% dextrose solution to 
produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 0.74 mg/ml .  
 
2.  Thoroughly mix the infusion by [CONTACT_30545].  
 3. As with all parenteral products, docetaxel should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter or discoloration prior to a dministration whenever the solution and 
container permit. If the docetaxel initial dilution (in vial) or final dilution for infusion is not clear or appears to have  precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], it should be discarded.  
 
Contact [CONTACT_902982] d. In order to minimize patient exposure 
to the plasticizer DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC 
infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or NON-PVC  plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin) and 
administered through NON-PVC  polyethylene-lined administration sets. 
 
Stability:  The initial diluted solution in the manufac turers vial may be used immediately 
or stored either in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a maximum of 8 hours. 
 
Fully prepared docetaxel infusion solution (in either NON -PVC 0.9% sodium chloride 
solution or NON-PVC 5% dextrose solution) stored  between 2º and 25º C (36º and 77º F) 
is stable for 4 hours (which must in clude the IV administration time).

3.25 Human Toxicology 
 
Acute toxicities are uncommon, as is periphera l neuropathy.  Prolonged treatment with 
weekly docetaxel results in chronic toxicitie s, which include asthenia (fatigue), anemia, 
edema, excessive lacrimation (epi[INVESTIGATOR_119230]), and onycholysis.  Chronic toxicities are most prominent when docetaxel is administered on a continuous weekly basis, without a break, and are delayed in onset by [CONTACT_902983] (for example, treating 6 of 8 
weeks or 3 of 4 weeks); these chronic toxicities occur at a lower cumulative dose when a continuous weekly schedule of docetaxel is utilized.  
 
The following covers current toxicity information for docetaxel at 100 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1266526] dose, single-agent regimen: 
 
The dose limiting toxicity for docetaxel is neutropenia with 76% of patients with 
normal liver function (transaminases /g100 1.[ADDRESS_1266527] or alkaline phosphatase /g100 2.[ADDRESS_1266528]) having grade IV neutropenia when docetaxel is used as a single agent at a dose of 100 mg/m
2.  Other toxicities include hypersensitiv ity reactions (with recommended 
premedication) in 15.7% of patients (se vere, 0.9%), skin toxicity in 58.5% (severe, 
5.6%), and fluid retention (with recommended premedication) in 48.5% (severe, 5.2%).  The latter symptoms can be ameliorated by [CONTACT_094]-medication dexamethasone 8 mg PO bid 
starting the day prior to docetaxel, and then continuing the dexamethasone for 2-4 
additional days.  Fluid retention has been described in patients receiving docetaxel, and is manifested by [CONTACT_902984], pericardial 
effusion, ascites, or weight gain.  When fluid retention occurs, peripheral edema usually begins in the lower extremities and may become generalized.  In clinical studies, the 
median weight gain in patients with fluid retention was 2 kg (Taxotere /g163Prescribing 
Information, Jan. 2000).  Severe fluid retention has been characterized by [CONTACT_902985], generalized edema, effusion requiring urgent drainage, dyspnea at rest, 
tamponade, or pronounced abdominal di stention (due to ascites) (Taxotere
/g163 Prescribing 
Information).  It is important to note that fluid retention has not been accompanied by 
[CONTACT_347639][INVESTIGATOR_347578], oli guria, or hypotension (Taxotere/g163 Prescribing 
Information, Jan. 2000).  There are no common clinical features with acute capi[INVESTIGATOR_902958]-2 (Data on file, Aventis Pharmaceuticals).  A corticoste roid regimen (eg, oral dexamethasone 8 mg BID for 3-5 
days) was instituted during Phase II studies.  This regimen should be administered for 3-5 
days beginning 1 day prior to each docetax el cycle to reduce the incidence and severity of 
fluid retention (Taxotere
/g163 Prescribing Information). 
 
Fluid retention, when seen has been cumulativ e in incidence and severity, and usually did 
not occur until several courses of docetaxel trea tment had been administered.  In Phase II 
clinical trials, this event was completely re versible following discontinuation of docetaxel 
(median: 29 weeks, range: 0 to 42+ week s).  Among 229 patients who received the 
recommended corticoster oid regimen, moderate fluid retention was observed in 17.4%, 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  17 severe fluid retention occurred in 6% and only 1.7% of patients required treatment 
discontinuation due to fluid retention (Taxotere/g163 Prescribing Information, Jan. 2000). 
 
The median cumulative dose to onset of mode rate or severe fluid retention was 705 
mg/m2 in patients receiving the recommended corticosteroid regimen, compared with 490 
mg/m2 in patients who did not receive corticosteroids (Taxotere/g163 Prescribing 
Information, Jan. 2000).  In a recently repo rted study by [CONTACT_902986], the 
incidence of fluid retention was assessed prior to and following the addition of the 
recommended corticosteroid re gimen in [ADDRESS_1266529] cancer.  The analy sis confirmed that treatment with corticosteroids 
significantly (P<0.001) decreased the incidence, time to onset, severity and treatment 
discontinuation due to fluid retention. 
 
It is important to note that dexamethasone does not alter docetaxel clearance (Taxotere/g163 
Prescribing Information, Jan. 2000).  Patients with preexisting effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for possible exace rbation of the effusions.  Patients

Kimberlee Dobson [PHONE_18212].   
 At the time of registration, a pre-study form and all information required to verify eligibility 
shall be necessary on each patient prior to tre atment. Data will be collected and maintained on 
study specific case report forms.   5.2 Agent Administration 
Docetaxel and SOM-230 cycles should be design ated by [CONTACT_902988]. For protocol purposes the day of admi nistration should be specified, until the DLT 
period is completed. Then only cycle number of docetaxel and of SOM-230 can be designated. 
Starting doses of the agents are as follows:

Cohorts of 3 patients each will be treated fo r 56 days with escalating doses of SOM-230 
according to the dose levels defined until dose limiting toxicity DLT is observed. Dose 
escalation and expansion of cohorts to 3-6 pa tients will proceed according to the criteria 
listed in Section 6.0. DLT will be defined from th e safety profile of cycles 1 and 2 for each 
dose level (Section 6.0). The MTD is the dose leve l at which 0/6 or 1/[ADDRESS_1266537] cohort will be started with dose level 1.  If 3 
patients in each dose level do not demonstrate (DLT) then therapy will proceed to the next dose 
level. If [ADDRESS_1266538] DLT at a dose level then this will be 
considered MAD and patients will then be treated at one dose level lower which will be considered the MTD (maximum tolerated dose). The patients ar e monitored for DLT in the first 
[ADDRESS_1266539] 56 days of therapy, then 
escalation to dose level 2 will be performed in the next cohort. Toxicities requiring dose 
modification of prednisone will not be  included in the dose limiting toxicity (DLT).

of higher doses of SOM-230 (>80 mg every 28 days) is available, and the dose level 3 of the 
combination is well tolerated, then consideration will be done for adding higher dose levels of 
SOM-230 in this protocol. 
 
 
 
5.2.1 Docetaxel administration  
On day 1 of each cycle docetaxel will be administered if ANC > 1500 and platelets > 
100K. If not, repeat CBC in 7 days and administer if above criteria met. If still no recovery, repeat CBC weekly, until recovery  and then reduce docetaxel by [CONTACT_37387] (60 mg/m
2).  If dose reduction is required fo r toxicity related to docetaxel after 
the first 56 days of therapy then protocol ther apy can be continued with dose reduced 
to 60 mg/ m2 . If toxicity requiring dose modification of docetaxel recurs then patients 
should be taken off protocol therapy. Pa tients can continue on SOM-230 if ANC> 
500/mm3 and platelets > 50,000/ mm3 and no other grade [ADDRESS_1266540] and initiate medical management,  then if recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_902961]230 dose reduction and call it a DLT. 
 
5.2.3 SOM-230 administration  
Patients will receive SOM-230 at specified dose IM on day 1, after docetaxel therapy, 
and subsequently every 28 days. On the days of SOM-230 administration only, it can 
be administered if ANC>500/ mm3 and platelets > 50,000/ mm3 and no other grade [ADDRESS_1266541] cycle

If patient cannot be treated on scheduled day 1 of docetaxel due to toxicity, then evaluate weekly until therapy can be resumed. If day 1 therapy has to be delayed >[ADDRESS_1266542] 36 weeks 
and then every 16 weeks. PSA to be  assessed on the days of therapy. 
  
5.7 Retreatment with SOM-230 therapy 
On the days of SOM-230 administration, it can be administered if ANC>500 and platelets >50K 
and no other grade 3 or 4 non hematologic toxiciti es related to SOM-230 are noted. If SOM-230 
therapy has to be delayed > 4 weeks from the sc heduled treatment date due to toxicity, then 
discontinue SOM-230 therapy. If any of the discontinuation criteria below are met, SOM-230 
should be discontinued immediately.   
/g120 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1266543] and Total Bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_1266544] and ALP < [ADDRESS_1266545]  
/g120 ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_1266546] and ≤ [ADDRESS_1266547] persistent for more than 2 weeks   
/g120 ALT or AST  > [ADDRESS_1266548] 
In addition, proper safety follow-up mana gement should be performed as outlined in 
section 6.7 .   Re-challenge of study medication is prohibited once discontinuation 
criteria are met.  
5.8 Reasons for Discontinuing Protocol therapy  
 Patients will continue on treatment until the y fulfill one of the following criteria for 
removal from treatment: 
 
i. Completion of two cycles of therapy, after documentation of  a complete response. 
ii. Disease progression as defined in section  iii. Unacceptable, severe grade 3 or 4 toxicity iv. >4 weeks delay in treatment due to toxicity. v. The patients may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason 
vi. Early study closure based on an une xpected high rate of toxicity or disease 
progression, major shift in disease management or loss of funding support 
 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  23 5.9  All patients will be followed every 3 months for progression and survival after study 
therapy is discontinued, unless consent is withdrawn by [CONTACT_102]. All reasons for 
termination of treatment should be clearly documented.  
   
6.0 TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED AND DOSAGE MODIFICATION: 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1266549] 8 weeks an d subsequently on days of administration of 
docetaxel or SOM-230 therapy. Radiologic eva luation every 12 weeks with scans, and PSA 
levels every 21 days.  
 
Three patients will be enrolled at each dose level (3 planned dose levels cu rrently). The patients 
in a cohort will be monitored for toxicity for 56 days (time when Cmax of SOM-230 is achieved), before accrual begins for the next dose level cohort .  
Toxicities requiring dose modification of prednisone will not be included in the dose limiting toxicity (DLT).   
 The DLT  will be defined as any one of the following  occurrences if they are at least possibly 
related per treating physician, to either docetaxel or SOM-[ADDRESS_1266550] 56 days  of therapy: 
1) Absolute neutrophil count nadir <500/mm
3 for >7 days duration or occurrence of febrile 
neutropenia. 
2) Platelet count <50K for >7 days duration or Platelet count <50K of any duration with 
clinically significant bleeding. 
3) Persistent fasting hyperglycemia > grade 3, despi[INVESTIGATOR_11920]. 
4) Other grade 3 or higher non hematologic tox icities attributable to therapy, except alopecia, 
fatigue, nausea and emesis, except for grade 3 or higher fatigue (unrelieved by [CONTACT_9075], and 
limiting self-care ADLs) lasting greater than 7 da ys or grade 3 or higher emesis that lasts 
>5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_51495]. 
 
If 1 or more patients experience a DLT, then three additional patients will be enrolled at that 
dose level. The MAD will be determined if more than 2 of the 6 patients treated experience a DLT. Once MAD is determined, the recommended dose for phase II testing/MTD will be one dose level below the MAD dose level and a total of 12 patie nts will be treated at this dose level.   
Number of Patients with 
DLT at a Given Dose 
Level Escalation Decision Rule 
0 out of 3 Proceed to the next dose level  
1 out of 3 Enter three additional patients to a total of 6 at this dose level: 
If 0 of these patients experienc e DLT, proceed to the next dose 
level.   
If 1 additional patient or 2 of the 6 patients suffer DLT, then dose escalation is stopped, and this dose is declare
d the maximally 
administered dose . 
2 or more of 6 treated This dose level will be declared the maximum administered dose 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  24  
   
6.2 Docetaxel dose modifications: 
 
On day 1 of each cycle docetaxel will be administered if ANC > 1500 and platelets > 100K. If 
not, repeat CBC in 7 days and administer if above criteria met. If still no recovery, repeat CBC weekly, until recovery and then reduce docet axel to one dose level lower (60 mg/m
2). If dose 
reduction is required for toxicity related to docetaxel within the first [ADDRESS_1266551] 56 days of therapy then 
protocol therapy can be continued with docetaxel dose reduced to 60 mg/ m
2 . 
 If patient experiences a DLT and still wishes to resume therapy then one dose level decrease of 
the agent causing toxicity (docetaxel, or SOM-230, or both, depending on attribution of toxicity, as determined by [CONTACT_1963]) is required, after resolution of the treatment related 
toxicities to grade 1 or less (except alopecia).  If toxicity occurs on starting dose level of SOM-230 then discontinue the therapy. If toxicities recur at gra de 2 or higher, or > 3 weeks delay from 
the scheduled date of therapy for docetaxel and >4 weeks from the scheduled date of therapy for 
SOM-230 is required, then discontinue protocol therapy. Docetaxel or SOM-230 only can be continued, at the discretion of the investigator, and if patient is continuing to benefit from therapy.  
 
 
6.3 Prednisone Dose Modifications: 
Toxicities requiring dose modification of predniso ne will not be included in the dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). If any toxicity grade 3 or higher attributable to prednisone, then decrease dose to 
5 mg once daily. If grade 3 or 4 toxicity recurs then consider tapering further, or discontinuing therapy, at the treating physician’s discretion.

• Provided information and receive teaching on diabetes disease management 
• Monitoring of blood glucose by [CONTACT_569226] (fasting morning blood glucose and 2-
hour post-meal) if not already done. Patie nts, who monitor blood glucose should keep a diary 
of their glucose values and present the collected data to their physician/ diabetes specialist for 
evaluation and appropriate management.

8.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITION: 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1266571] 1.1 criteria with unidimensional measurement are to be used for 
measurable disease response evaluation [11].  
8.[ADDRESS_1266572] 
currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations  (e.g., for body scans but not for 
lung).Lesions on a chest X-ray may be considered measurable lesions if they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and ≥10 
mm in diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. Ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  
Protocol 2011-[ADDRESS_1266573] one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
• [ADDRESS_1266574] scan (CT scan slice thickne ss no greater than 5 mm; when CT scans have 
slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness). 
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_110704] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable). • [ADDRESS_1266575] X -ray. 
• Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1266576] scan (CT scan slice thickness is recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783]-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be 
considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. • ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable if 
they meet the definition of measurability de scribed above. However, if non-cystic lesions 
are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Non-measurable lesions Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. 
• Lesions with prior local treatment, such as those situated in a previously irradiated area 
or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  Target Lesions • All measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all involved org ans, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. • Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter) and be representative of  all involved organs, as well as their suitability for 
reproducible repeated measurements. • All measurements sho uld be recorded in metric notation using calipers if clinically 
assessed. A sum of the diamete rs (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions Non-target Lesions All lesions (or sites of disease) not identified as target lesions, including pathological 
lymph nodes and all non-measurable lesions, should be identified as non-target lesions and be recorded at baseline. Measur ements of these lesions are not required and they 
should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, ‘unequivocal progression’.  
 
8.4 Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR): 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  32 Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathol ogical lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR  nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. 
 
8.5 Confirmation 
In non-randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and 
CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. 
This will also permit appropriate interpretation of re sults in the context of historical data 
where response has traditionally required confirmation in such trials. 
However, in all other circumstances, (i.e., in ra ndomized phase II or III trials or studies 
where stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints), confirmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination of the requirement for respons e confirmation may increas e the importance of 
central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies which are not blinded. 
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is defined in the 
study protocol. 
 
  8.6 Prostate Cancer Specific Response criteria: [12]  
 For measurable disease response, RECIST criteria  1.1 will be used [11]. The Prostate Cancer 
Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2) criteria  will also be used to determine a response in 
non measurable disease [12]. PCWG2 recommends a two-objective paradigm in metastatic 
CRPC: (1) controlling, relieving, or elimin ating disease manifestations that are present when 
treatment is initiated and (2) pr eventing or delaying disease  manifestations expected to occur. 
PSA decline and changes in imaging will also  be reported. The progression for measurable 
disease will be per RECIST criteria, and for bone metastases will be defined as above. 
 
 8.7 Response Evaluable Patients  
 All patients registered on the protocol and complet ing a minimum of one cycle of therapy  
 followed by [CONTACT_2085], and radiologic or PSA assessment of disease status.  
 8.8 Toxicity- Evaluable patients  
 All patients registered on the protocol and star ting therapy with protocol medication, will be 
considered toxicity evaluable. 
 
 
8.9 Follow up /Overall survival 
Overall survival will be measured from date of registration to death or last follow up.  
After treatment is discontinued for any reason patients will be followed every 3 months for progression and survival for a maximum of 24 months after discontinuing protocol therapy.  
 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  33 9.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL TREATMENT:  
 
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study or be dr opped from it at the discretion of the 
investigator at any time. Patients may be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occur: 
a) Lack of efficacy 
b) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) 
c) Unacceptable Adverse event(s) 
d) Abnormal laboratory value(s) 
e) Abnormal test procedure result(s) 
f) Protocol violation 
g) Subject withdrew consent 
h) Lost to follow-up 
i) Administrative problems 
j) Death 
j) New therapy for disease being investigated k) Disease progression  
 
 
10.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES 
Pharmacokinetic Studies: Treatment Schedule:  
On day 1, docetaxel will be given as 1- h intravenous infusion over 1 hour, followed by 
[CONTACT_902989].  The subsequent doses of docetaxel will be given 
every 21 days (i.e., on days 22, 43, 64…), and subsequent doses of pasireotide will be given every 
28 days (i.e., days 29, 57, and 85…). The PK  evaluation is optional a nd will be done on a 
maximum of 12 patients. 
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluation:  
In vitro  liver microsome and in vivo animal studies have indicated that pasireotide is highly 
metabolically stable.  Therefore, docetaxel is not expected to influence the PK of pasireotide.  
However, pasireotide was found to be a we ak inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2E1 and 
CYP3A4/5 with IC5 0 values ranging from ~10 to >100 μM, and a moderate inhibitor of 
CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 with IC50 values of ~5 μM.  Though no drug -drug interaction between 
pasireotide and CYP450 substrates such as docetaxel  is expected at the intended therapeutic 
levels (<0.1 μM) of pasireotide, we will examine the PK of docetaxel in the presence of steady -
state concentration of pasire otide in all treated patients.   
 
Sampling time: 
      Cycle 1 day 1 (to characterize base line docetaxel PK):  Samples will be collected at predosing, 
end of infusion, 2, 3, 4 , 7, 24 and 48 h timepoints afte r the start of docetaxel infusion. A time 
window of +/- 2 hours is permitted for the 24 and 48 hour PK draws.   Cycle 1 day 43: (to characterize the PK of docetax el in the presence of steady-state concentration 
of pasireotide). A time window of +/- [ADDRESS_1266577] 42 days of 
therapy, therefore the docetaxel PK will be obtained on day 43.   
Blood samples will be collected at: pre-dosing (f or docetaxel and pasireotide), at the end of 
infusion, 2, 3, 4, 7, 24 h (day 44), and 48 h (day 45) after the start of infusion. A time window of +/- 2 hours is permitted for the 24 and 48 hour PK draws.    Trough (pre-treatment) samples for pasireotide will be obtained on days 29, 57, and 85 prior to 
the administration of pasireotide. 
 Sample processing: 
     At each time point specified above, 4 ml blood sample will be collected into a heparinized 
tube, and immediately placed on ice or in refrigerator (4
0C) until processed.  The actual day and 
time of sample collection will be recorded on the PK  worksheet.  Within 1 h of the collection, the 
blood sample will be centrifuged at 40C, at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and plasma will be collected 
immediately after centrifugation and transferred to 2 screw-cap polypropylene cryogenic tubes (2 aliquots, each with ~1 ml plasma).  The tube will be labeled with the patient’s initial, study 
number, sample collection day and time, and frozen at -70
0C or below until analysis. 
 The PK samples for docetaxel will be shipped to the Karmanos Cancer Institute Pharmacology Core for analyses.  The shippi[INVESTIGATOR_205116]:

Bioanalysis assays: 
     The plasma concentrations of docetaxel  will be determined using a validated high-
performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods in 
the Karmanos Cancer Institute Pharmacology Core Laboratory, Detroit, MI.  The plasma 
concentrations of pasireotide will be determined in a Nor vatis laboratory. 
 
SOM-[ADDRESS_1266578] asma concentration. Immediately after blood is drawn into EDTA tubes, 
they should be inverted gently several times to ensure the mixing of tube contents. Prolonged 
exposure to the rubber stopper should be avoided. The  tube should be placed upright in tube rack 
surrounded by [CONTACT_902990]. Wit hin 20 minutes, the sample should be centrifuged 
between 3 and 5ºC for 10 minutes at approxima tely 1000 x g. Immediately after centrifugation, 
1.0 mL plasma should be transferred to a polypropyle ne screw cap tube immersed in dry ice. The 
storage temperature for PK samples  should be at or below -18°C.

Pharmacodynamic Studies 
 
Chromogranin A and NSE levels in serum will be tested at baseline and on days [ADDRESS_1266579] demonstrated correlation with 
prognostic outcome in prostate cancer [ 13]. Also since neuroendocrin e differentiation is a 
possible mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy, assessment of these markers will enable us to 
study the effect of combination of docetaxel and pasireotide on the neuroendocrine component of 
metastatic prostate cancer. The local CLIA certified laboratory would be performing these 
tests.  
 The somatostatin analogues affect the dimeriz ation of the IGF-[ADDRESS_1266580] hence resulting in 
downregulation of secretion of IGF-1 protein in prostate cancer cell lines such as LNCaP. [ 14] 
Plasma IGF-1 levels will be evaluated by [CONTACT_902991], and on days 22  and 43 
[15]. The local CLIA certified laboratory would be performing these tests.  SOM-[ADDRESS_1266581] therapy could be useful as an early predictor of 
outcome. Plasma IGF-1 levels will hence be evaluated by [CONTACT_902991], and on days 22 and 43 of the study.  
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) 
 
In metastatic CRPC, CTC are gaining importance as a method to assess response. In a disease 
where the sites of metastases are mainly in bon e which is not measurable disease the CTC counts Jean Paul Freche

Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  36 are a critically important less invasive method of predicting response and outcome. CTC counts 
will be measured at baseline (day 1), day [ADDRESS_1266582]-therapy  CTC 
counts ;<5/7.5 ml which is considered favorable, vs  >5/7.[ADDRESS_1266583] been shown to be prognostic in metastatic CRPC patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy [ 16].  In multivariable analysis, CTC count using Veridex technology was an 
independent risk factor, influencing overall survival (O S) in a multivariable analysis.  The 
differences in survival associated with CTC count status were clinically and statistically 
significant (e.g., ~1 year, depending on the comparison).  Investigators are now exploring the 
role of CTC counts as surrogate markers of surviv al in CRPC, especially when used in 
conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy. The CTC counts would be performed by [CONTACT_716147].  
Recently, phenotypic characterization of CTCs is  gaining interest in several cancer types, 
especially with regard to prognosis [ 17].  In metastatic CRPC, ERG gene rearrangement and 
PTEN expression have been  demonstrated in CTCs, establishing  the feasibility of biomarker 
evaluation in CTCs in our population of interest [18].  Furthermore, we pi[INVESTIGATOR_902963], when we correlated disease recurrence to the proportion of micrometastatic cells actively proliferating [ 19].   
As new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_902964], development of pr ognostic biomarkers needs to 
occur simultaneously, but has tended to lag behind, and is currently an unmet need in appropriate selection of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_902965] . Identification of bi omarkers that correlate 
with clinical outcome will result in enrollment of an  enriched patient population for targeted 
therapy trials, and aid in the identific ation of mechanisms of resistance.  Most importantly, it will 
assist clinicians in choosing between the thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_902966].    
In metastatic CRPC, CTCs likely emana te from metastatic deposits in the skeleton and 
other metastatic sites (as opposed to the primary t umor), because the metastatic sites carry the 
heaviest tumor burden.  Therefore, the biology of CTCs is likely to reflect the biology of the 
metastatic deposits.  Based on our pre-clinical work, we hypothesize that pre-treatment CTC 
phenotype with regard to the PTEN-PDGF and PTEN-MT1-MMP axes will reflect the biology of the metastatic deposits and thus be prog nostic with regard to TTP and survival.  In addition, 
assessment of post-treatment phenotype may allow insights into mechanisms of treatment resistance and disease progression.  The CTC phenotype will be performed only if funding is 
available.  
   
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
 11.1 Study Design, Objectives, and Endpoints  
 The Treatment Plan (see Section 5 above) predefines 3 dose levels of the SOM 230 and 
docetaxel (and prednisone) combination.   This t rial will utilize a traditional Phase I study design 
with dose cohorts of 3-6 patients to determine the MTD (which will  also be the RP2D).   The 
MTD will be one dose level below the MAD.   At whatever dose level is eventually determined to be the MTD, we plan to expand that dose cohort to 12 patients to further assess the PK/PD 
profiles of the drug regimen.   The prednisone dose is constant throughout the trial.  The objectives and outcome measurements for the study are listed below:  Primary objective:  To establish the MTD level of SOM 230 in combination with  
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  37     docetaxel and prednisone. 
The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
/g120 Occurrence of DLTs and the associated NCI CTCAE grade 
/g120 Occurrence of adverse events and the associated grade per NCI CTCAE 
version 4.0 
/g120 Identification of the MTD of SOM 230 in combination with docetaxel and prednisone. 
 
Secondary objectives:  
1) To evaluate the safety and tolerabilit y of the combination in metastatic CRPC. 
The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
●  All specific types of toxicity will be assessed via NCI CTCAE Version 4.0, and  
 be tabulated separately by [CONTACT_902992]. 
 
 
2)  To evaluate preliminary efficacy of the combination of SOM 230 and docetaxel and prednisone as defined by [CONTACT_313346] (measurable and PSA per PSA working group II criteria, see section 8.9), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS).  
 
The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
/g120 Measurements of tumor using RECIST criter ia before and after treatment with 
the combination of SOM 230 in combination with docetaxel.   
/g120 Percentage PSA decline noted. 
/g120 TTP (defined in Section 8.6) 
/g120 OS   (defined in Section 8.12) 
 
3) To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (P K) of the combination. 
The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
/g120 PK parameters, including, but not limited to, maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C
max), time to maximum plasma co ncentration (tmax), plasma 
terminal half-life (t 1/2), area under the plasma concentration –time curve 
(AUC), maximum observed plasma concentra tion at steady state (Css, max), 
and minimum observed plasma concentrat ion at steady state (Css, min). 
 
4) To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the combination as seen by [CONTACT_902974]-1, serum chromogra nin A (SCA), and neuron specific enolase 
(NSE), and to associate them with TTP and OS. 
The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
●    Measurement of levels of IGF -1, SCA, and NSE, pre-therapy, post-therapy, 
and the change between timepoints. 
●    Duration of TTP and OS   
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  38  
5) To assess the pretherapy circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts and the change in CTC after 
therapy, and to associate them with TTP and OS.  
                    The outcome measures associated with this objective are the following: 
/g120 Measurements of CTC counts  pre-therapy, post-therapy, and the change 
between timepoints. 
/g120 Duration of TTP and OS   
 
 11.[ADDRESS_1266584] DLT at a dose 
level then this will be considere d MAD and patients will then be treated at one dose level lower 
which will be considered the MTD (maximum tolerated dose). Once MTD is determined, a total of 12 patients will be tre ated at this dose level. 
 
The absolute minimum number of patients required for this Phase I trial would result from the 
unlikely (but possible) scenario in which there were ≥ 2 DLT’s among the first 3 patients treated at dose level 1, such that it became the MAD.   We would then treat 3-6 patients at a new dose level -1 (to be determined after conferring with the sponsor), and that dose level would likely 
then become the MTD.   We would then treat an additional 6-9 patients at dose level -1 to 
complete the goal of an MTD ex pansion cohort of 12 patients.   In this scenario, the absolute 
minimum number of patients re quired for this Phase I trial would then be 3 + 12 = 15. 
 The maximum  number of patients required for thi s Phase I trial would result from the 
following scenario:  first, needing a full cohort of 6 patients at each of dose levels 1-3; and then 
finding dose level 3 to be the MTD.   As per Section 6.1, that would make dose level 2 the MTD, and we would treat an additional 6 patients at th at dose to complete the goal of an MTD  
expansion cohort of 12 patients.  Thus, the maximum number of patients required for this Phase I 
trial would then be (6*3)   + 6 = 24.  
    
11.3    Expected Accrual Rate and Accrual Duration  
    Our anticipated accrual ra te is 12-15 metastatic CRPC patients/ye ar.   Hence it would take 20-
24 months to accrue the maximum of 24 patients for this Phase I stud y.   Should fewer patients 
be required to determine the MTD, then the  trial would be completed even faster. 
 
 
11.4    Statistical Analysis of Endpoints  
 The Primary Objective of determining the MTD, as well as the specific DLT’s is just an 
identification process, hence no statisti cal analysis or estimation is required. 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  39  
For the Primary Objective of determining all adverse events, and for Secondary Objectives 1 and 
2, the occurrence rate of binary endpoints (eg, spe cific types of toxicity at a certain dose level 
and severity grade, response, etc.) will be de scribed by [CONTACT_902993] 90% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for proportions using Wilson’s method.    
 For Secondary Objectives 3-4, the continuous endpoints (e.g., PK and PD parameters, and the pre/post therapy change in PD parameters)  will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics (N, median, IQR, mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, and the 90% CI for 
the mean).   Statistical graphics (e.g., dot plots, box plots) will also be used to better visualize the PK and PD distributions and summary statistics.   For Secondary Objective 5, similar descriptive 
statistics will be computed for CTC counts:  pre-t herapy, post-therapy, and the pre/post therapy 
change. 
 
For Secondary Objective 5, purely exploratory anal ysis of the association of each of the 3 PD 
endpoints (IGF-1, SCA, NSE) and CTC count wit h clinical outcome (e.g., TTP and OS) will be 
performed, using all the  pa tients.   For the pre-therapy levels of each of the [ADDRESS_1266585] ratio (HR) be ing > 1 or < 1, how far away from 1, and its 
90% CI width, respectively.   These HR estimate s would provide a hint as to whether there might 
be any potential relationship between a given pre-therapy PD endpoint (or CTC count) and the 
duration of TTP.    A similar exploratory investigation of the a ssociation of each of the [ADDRESS_1266586]-therapy  levels of the 3 PD endpoints and CTC count with TTP will 
also be explored.   These 4 associations (and those involving the pre/post therapy change in the 
same 4 predictors) will utilize the landmark method [20].   A suitable landmark timepoint (e.g., 
12 weeks, a point at which therapy should be completed in all patients in consideration of Section 5.8) will be chosen.   Post-therapy levels of the 4 candidate predi ctors will be determined 
at the landmark.   A univariable Cox regression m odel of each of these 4*2 = 8 predictors will be 
fit to the TTP as measured from  the landmark (thus changing the definition of TTP time zero).   
Patients who are censored before the landmark or die without prior evidence of progression must be excluded from landmark analyses.      A similar exploratory investigation of the association (using the landmark method) of the 
post-therapy  levels and the change  in each of the 3 PD endpoints and CTC count with OS will 
also be undertaken. 
 
   
 
12.0    ADVERSE EVENTS REPORTING  
 
12.1  Regulatory and reporting requirements-  
These will be followed per IND requirements (if applicable) as well as [COMPANY_001] Inc. 
requirements and WSU IRB requirements. 
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  40  
12.2 REPORTING OF SERIOUS TREATME NT EMERGENT ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
An adverse event for the purpose s of this protocol is the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-
existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) occurring after signing the 
informed consent even if the eve nt is not considered to be relate d to the study drug(s). Please 
refer to the adverse event section of the protocol  for the protocol-specific definitions of study 
drug and study treatment. 
Adverse events will be assessed according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
[CTCAE] version 4.0. If CTCAE grading does not exis t for an adverse event, the severity of 
mild, moderate, severe, a nd life-threatening, or grades 1 - 4, will be used. CTCAE grade 5 
(death) will not be used in this study; rather , this information will be collected in the End of 
Treatment or Survival Information CRF page. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for 
at least [ADDRESS_1266587] dose of study treatment. Adverse events (but not serious adverse events) o ccurring before starting study treatment but 
after signing the informed consent form are re corded on the Medical History/Current Medical 
Conditions Electronic Case Report Form. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute 
adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
significant or require therapy (e.g., any hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or 
cytokine treatment); and should be recorded  on the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, 
symptoms or diagnosis associated with them. In addition, isolated abnor mal laboratory values 
that are considered clinically significant (e.g ., cause study discontinuation or constitutes in and of 
itself a Serious Adverse Event) should be record ed on the Adverse Events CRF. SAEs occurring 
after signing the Informed Consent are recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient at 
each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by 
[CONTACT_24479], laboratory test, or other 
assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
1. The severity grade (CTCAE grade 1-4) 
2. Its relationship to each study drug (suspected/not suspected) 
3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
4. Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study 
drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse  event; concomitant medication taken; 
non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
5. Whether it is serious, where a serious adve rse event (SAE) is defined as one which: 
/g120 Is fatal or life-threatening 
/g120 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
/g120 Constitutes a congenital  anomaly/birth defect

Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are mon itored continuously and have special 
reporting requirements; see protocol sec tion on Serious Advers e Event reporting. 
All adverse events should be trea ted appropriately. Such treatme nt may include changes in study 
drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_89392], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be 
followed until its resolution, an assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if 
necessary) of any changes in its severity, its suspected relationship to the study drug(s), any of 
the interventions required to treat it, and its outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known  about the investigational drug can be 
found in the [Investigator’s Brochure] or will be comm unicated between IB updates in the form 
of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the pa tient informed consent 
and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. To ensure patient 
safety each serious adverse event must also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning 
of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
which: 
/g120 is fatal or life-threatening

12.4 WSU HIC Adverse Event reporting  
All adverse event reporting will be done  in compliance with the Wayne State Human 
Investigation Committee as follows: 
A. Death or Life Threatening Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
If a death or immediately life-threatening Adverse Reaction/Unexpected Event occurs, it 
must be reported to the HIC office within three (3) business days of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455134], even if the information in the report is incomplete. As more information is 
forthcoming, one or more additional reports should be filed with the HIC. The initial report of the Adverse Reaction or Unexpec ted Event and follow-up reports should be 
filed using the HIC Adverse Reaction and Unexpected Event Form.  
 
B. Serious Adverse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
Protocol 2011-031 Version date July 27, 2011, Sept 29 2011, Nov 18 2011, Dec 27, 2011, Dec 4, 2012  44 If a Serious Adverse Reaction/Unexpected Event occurs (one that necessitates or 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in a permanent or significant disability or congenital 
anomaly, or is judged to be serious by [CONTACT_458]), and is unexpected , (not 
listed in the consent form) it must be reported to the HIC within five (5)  business days of 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455134]. If the Serious Adverse Event is listed in the consent form but a 
relationship to the study intervention/activity cannot be ruled out by [CONTACT_978] , it must be 
reported to the HIC within five (5)  business days. If the information is incomplete on the 
initial filing, follow-up reporting is require d. The HIC Adverse R eaction and Unexpected 
Event Form should be used in all reports pertaining to these reactions/events.  
 
C. Non-Serious (Moderate or Minor) Adve rse Reaction or Unexpected Event:  
If a non-serious Adverse Reaction occurs that is unexpected  (not listed in the informed 
consent), it must be reported to the HIC withi n ten (10) business days of awareness, 
unless the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_902970]. If a non-serious Adverse Reaction occurs that is expected (listed in the 
informed consent), but is more frequent, more int ense or longer lasting that expected, or 
requires medical treatment, it must be reported to the HIC within ten (10) business days. 
If the reaction that is listed in the consent form occurs as described in the informed consent, it does not need to be reported to the HIC.  
If an Unexpected Event occurs, it must be reported to the HIC within ten (10) business 
days of the awareness by [CONTACT_079]. The Adverse Reaction/ Unexpected Event Form should be used for these submissions.  
 
D. Possibly-Related Adverse Re actions/ Unexpected Events 
In the rare case where a sponsor requires that a non-reportable (i.e., possibly related) 
Adverse Reaction/ Unexpected Event be re ported to the HIC, an amendment should be 
submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_764745]-reportable safety report be appended to the HIC file. It remains the primary responsibility of the WSU PI, the study sponsor, and any associated DSMB to identify trends that mi ght require the event to be elevated to 
definitely or probably related status.  If a trend is identified that eleva tes the Adverse Reaction to definitely or probably related 
status, an Adverse Reaction/ Unexpected Ev ent Form should be completed, along with an 
amendment for consent form changes, if needed, and submitted to the HIC.

MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY WITH DOCETAXEL 
 
Severity of Symptoms Treatment Guidelines 
Mild  symptoms: localized cutaneous 
reactions such as mild pruritus, 
flushing, rash  · consider decreasing the rate of infusion until 
recovery from symptoms, stay at bedside and 
monitor patient 
· then, complete  docetaxel (Taxotere/g163) 
infusion at the initial planned rate 
Moderate symptoms: any symptom that 
is not listed above (mild symptoms) or 
below (severe symptoms) such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic 
 
BP > 80 mm Hg  
 · interrupt docetaxel (Taxotere/g163) infusion 
· give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with or 
without dexamethasone 10 mg IV; monitor 
patient until resolution of symptoms  
· resume docetaxel (Taxotere/g163) infusion after 
recovery of symptoms; depending on the 
physician’s assessment of the patient, 
docetaxel (Taxotere/g163) infusion should be 
resumed at a slower rate, then increased 
incrementally to the initial planned rate , 
(e.g. infuse at an 8 hour rate for 5 minutes, 
then at a 4-h rate for 5 minutes, then at a 2 -
h rate for 5 minutes, then finally, resume at 
the 1-h infusion rate) 
· depending on the intensity of the reaction 
observed, additional oral or IV premedication 
with an antihistamine should also be given 
for the next cycle of treatment, and the rate 
of infusion should be decreased initially and 
then increased back to the recommended 1-
hour infusion,  (e.g. infuse at an 8 hour rate 
for 5 minutes, then at a 4-h rate for 5 
minutes, then at a 2- h rate for 5 minutes, and 
finally, administer at the 1-h infusion rate)  
Severe  symptoms: any reaction such as 
bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, 
systolic BP /g100 80mm Hg, angioedema · immediately discontinue docetaxel 
(Taxotere/g163) infusion  
· give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with or 
without dexamethasone 10 mg IV and/or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_30481]; m onitor patient until 
resolution of symptoms 
· the same treatment g uidelines outlined under 
moderate symptoms (i.e. the third and fourth 
bullets) should be followed.

MANAGEMENT OF EDEMA / FLUID RETENTION WITH DOCETAXEL  
 No dose reduction is require d.  Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_153102], progression of 
existing edema, or another sign of fluid retention (e.g. 2 pound weight gain) are to be treated with oral diuretics.  Regimens fo und to be effective in the management of fluid 
retention due to Taxotere are listed below.  
/g120 HCTZ/triamterene (Dyazide
/g163, or generic equivalent) one capsule po daily, increase 
up to tid. 
/g120 Furosemide 40 mg (Lasix/g163 or generic equivalent) po daily if edema progresses 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_902972]/g163 (or equivalent) therapy.  Potassium supplementation should be 
given as needed. 
/g120 If after a two week trial, furosemide 40 mg po da ily is ineffective, the patient may be 
treated with furosemide 20 mg po daily plus metolazone 2.5 mg po daily with 
potassium supplementation as needed. 
 Further therapy should be customized de pending upon the clinical situation.  The clinical 
tolerance of the patient, the overall tumor response and the medical judgment of the 
investigator will determine if it is in the patient’s best interest to continue or discontinue treatment.

2. Introduction & Study Rationale  
Unwanted excess fat is a common medical and aesthetic concern .  Surgical interventions may yield  
definitive results of fat reduction and body contouring, however  invasive modalities  require long  recovery 
time and may be associated with significant  risks.   
A variety of non -invasive body treatments are available for medical aesthetic indications such as 
circumference reduction  and fat lipolysis. These include devices based on optical energy such as lasers and 
Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), devices based on ultrasound technologies, radiofrequency (RF), Cryolipolysis, 
suction - massage, or combined technologies.      
 
Non -invasive  modification of the adipocyte by [CONTACT_592955], thermal destruction, cavitational destruction, 
or creation of a temporary adipocyte cell membrane pore1. As a non -invasive option, these technologies 
have been developed to reduce cellulite and body circumference with minimal recovery time and risks2.   
Through these mechanisms, the final result is that the sizes of the adipocytes are either temporarily or 
permanently reduced and/or the number of adipocytes is reduced, which will result in a measurable 
reduction of fat and circumference of the treated area.  
 
RF technology for fat related indications is vastly used and clinically studied. RF delivers a thermal stimulus 
to the skin and subcutaneous  adipose tissue causing neocollagenesis and  thickening of the dermis and 
enhancement of lipolysis - fat cell metabolism, resulting in reduction of adipose tissue volume and 
circumference s3.  
 
Electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) also known as Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES), or 
“electromyostimulation”, is the application of current to elicit a muscle contraction. There are a few 
studies that investigate the effect of NMES on abdominal muscles4-7. Alon and colleagues5-7 found that 
NMES applied to the abdominal musculature was well tolerated and strengthened muscles by [CONTACT_2902] 14% 
to 22%.

4. Device Description  
The Trim II applicator is a hands -free medical aesthetic device applying combined bi -polar RF energy and 
muscle activation.  
The non invasive bi -polar RF treatment is targeting the dermal and subdermal tissues. The EMS repeatedly 
contracts muscles by [CONTACT_592956].  
The RF and EMS energies are applied automatically in alternating manner to the treatment area during 
the same treatment session. The application is controlled by [CONTACT_183782]. The TRIM II  device includes a belt  
and 4 applicator  units, which contain  RF and EMS emitting electrodes.   
Each unit has electrodes and a cable connected to the system.  Figure 1 demonstrates the TRIM II  
applicator unit.

Each applicator comprises the following parts :

RF energy is delivered between electrodes 1 -6 having one polarity 
and electrodes 7 -9 having opposite polarity.  
 Each electrode has embedded temperature sensor.  
Connector  Connector 10 connects the applicator to the cable  
 
Trim II  hands -free applicator units are applied to the abdominal area using a single -use adjustable belt set. 
The belts enable an easy and comfortable setting of the applicator units onto the patient skin . 
The System provides individual adjustment of RF and EMS intensity level to achieve maximum efficacy, 
safety and comfort for each patient. The System provides enhanced safety while minimizing possible side 
effects  by [CONTACT_248835].  
Another safety feature is a  hand-held switch (Figure 2) that interrupts the treatment process and switches 
the system to pause  state until the operator re -enables it.  The patient can use the hand-held switch to 
pause the treatment if the discomfort becomes excessive.  
5. Study Objectives  
The Primary Objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Trim II  treatment for 
lipolysis and abdominal circumference reduction.   
6. Study Endpoints  
6.1 Primary  Endpoints  
• Efficacy of the Trim II  treatment for lipolysis and abdominal circumference reduction.  
Evaluation of change in abdomen circumference using tape measurements in cm at the 3 months 
follow -up visit comparing to baseline.  
Success criteria: Statistically significant  reduction in abdominal circumference tape measurements at 
the 3  month s follow -up visit compared to baseline . 
* The primary effectiveness endpoint will be calculated based on those patients whose weight 
remains stable during the study period. A subject is defined as having maintained her weight during 
the treatment period if it remained within ±3% (inclusive) of bas eline for the respective period.

• Place the patient in the  position, th at the treatment area  is fully accessible and treatment can be 
easily performed.  
• Remove any jewellery in the area of the application site.  
• Ensure that the subject skin in the entire treatment is clean. The skin should be cleaned with 
water and soap and long/coarse hairs in the treatment area should  be shaved.   
• The choice of treatment settings should take into consideration not only the severity of the 
treated condition , but also the subject’s comfort.  
• Ensure that the skin is clean and dry.  Long and dense hairs may affect the treatment and should 
be shaved according to PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
• Thin layer of conductive ultrasound gel should be applied to the electrodes or to the treated area.  
• Belt will be used to attach the units to the treatment area.  
• Application of the device near the thorax may increase risk of cardiac fibrillation . 
• Avoid application of device over the head, eyes, across the mouth and front of neck . 
• The caregiver shouldn’t leave the patient unattended during treatment  
• The skin should be observed for excessive erythema or edema. If observed, stop the treatment 
and move to another treatment zone.  
• The patient can use the Hand -held switch to pause the treatment if the discomfort becomes 
excessive . Activate the treatment by [CONTACT_592958].  
• Set RF power : Always start with a lowe r setting level (20 energy level) to check the patient’s 
tolerance to the treatment parameters. Increase the settings gradually. Check that skin 
temperature starts rising after a few cycles.  
• Set Cut -off temperature: Start with 40.5 °-41° gradually increasing to 43 ° according to pat ient 
comfort .  
• EMS p ower level to be set according to patient tolerance, starting at 5 intensity levels.  Increase 
gradually to see muscle contraction.  
• The longer the treatment time, the better the results. The treatment will last approximately [ADDRESS_782342]’s comfort.  
• Slight erythema and edema are a typi[INVESTIGATOR_592947]. However, when there is excessive 
tissue reaction, stop treatment. For excessive heat sensation, you may decrease the parameters .

9. Adverse Events Reporting  
9.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event:  
An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study participant 
during their participation in the study.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that:  
• Led to death  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that resulted in a life -threatening illness 
or injury  
• Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
• Required in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_592948] -invasive Lipolysis and Circumference 
Reduction of Abdomen . 
Protocol No:  DO609924A    SIRB ID:  8659                 Rev. Date:   Jun 3 2022 
 
22 
 
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or 
a body function  
• Led to fatal distress, a congenital abnormality, birth defect or death  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Event:  
An unanticipated adverse event is any serious, device -related adverse event, if that event was not 
previously identified in the risk analysis and Informed Consent form in nature, severity, or frequency.  
AE Severity:  
Adverse events are graded according to severity as follows  (Table 2): 
Mild  Sign or symptom, usually transient, requiring no special treatment and 
generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate  Sign or symptom, which may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_39508]; yet, may interfere with usual activity.  
Severe  Sign or symptom that are intense or debilitating and that interfere with 
usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by [CONTACT_123768].   
Relationship to Device:  
The relationship of the adverse event to the treatments or procedures is defined as follows (Table 3): 
Most Probably Related:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device 
delivery/retrieval and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_26562]’s clinical data or the surgical 
procedure applied.  
Possibly Related:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study device 
delivery/retrieval but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_123769].  
Probably not Related:  Temporal association is such that the study device is not likely to 
have had any reasonable association with the observed event.  
Unrelated  No relationship to study device activation is perceived

[CONTACT_1034].  
All study reports will be signed by [CONTACT_123773], analysis, results and 
conclusions.  
AE related reporting requirements are specified above.  
12. Monitoring Plan  
12.1 General Considerations  
Monitoring functions will be performed in compliance with Good Clinical Practices, EN ISO [ZIP_CODE], and as 
outlined in 21CRF§812.43(d) and 21CRF§812.46. InMode Ltd procedures detail monitoring procedures and 
monitor responsibilities.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_123774], per Sponsor discretion .  
12.2 On-Site Visits  
Periodic on -site monitoring visits are intended to assess the Investigator’s adherence to the protocol, 
maintenance of records and reports, and review of source documents for accuracy, completeness, and 
legibility, and monitoring of Adverse Events.  
During periodic visits the monitor is required  to: 
• Assess the progress of the study towards meeting study objectives.  
• Identify any concerns that stem from observations of device performance and/or review of the 
subject’s CRF, study management documents, and informed Consent documents.  
• Monitor AE reporting and investigations.  
Reports of on -site visits will be submitted by [CONTACT_123775], as applicable, resolution of 
concerns, completion of appropriate follow -up activities, completion of assigned tasks, and corrective 
actions. Some ‘visits’ may be performed using a  video /conference call and will not be actual physical visits.

responsibility according to regulations.  
13. Risk/Benefit  Analysis  
13.1 Expected Risks:  
As indicated in section 9.2 possible Trim II  applicator  adverse effects include but are not limited by:  
• Pain  
• Excessive redness (erythema)  
• Swelling (edema)  
• Muscles spasm  
• Treatment area infection  
• Skin burn  
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_592949]  
• Scar  
*Erythema and edema lasting not longer than 24h is typi[INVESTIGATOR_592950].  
*Skin irritation and burns beneath the electrodes have been reported with the use of powered muscle 
stimulators.  
 
These risks are m inimal  when compared to other  methods of lipolysis  and circumference reduction  that 
are being utilized  (such us surgical liposuction ).  
13.2 Expected Benefits:  
The expected benefit of using the Trim II  is achieving the desired lipolysis and circumference reduction  via 
a non -invasive technique. As previously indicated, individuals seeking body contouring are currently most 
likely to do so via liposuction. It is obvious that the low risk profile of the Trim II  greatly benefits the 
individual seeking such treatments  as it significantly minimizes the risks associated with the pro cedure .

13.3 Conclusion:  
It can therefore be claimed that the expected benefits associated with the use of the Trim II  outweigh its 
risks.  
14. Data analysis  
14.1 Analysis Sets  
• Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set will include all subjects using Embrace  procedures at least a single time.  
• Performance Analysis Set  
Performance analysis set will consist of all subjects providing at least one post treatment performance 
measurement.  
• Treatment of Missing Values  
Only observed data will be used; i.e. missing data will not be imputed.  
14.[ADDRESS_782354] will be 
computed to assess changes in before treatment and follow -up scores. Statistical significance will be 
calculated and two -tail significance level of 0.0 5 will be used.  
15. Data Management Plan  
Case Report Forms  and questionnaires will be retrieved by [CONTACT_592961]. Documents will be delivered to InMode Ltd onsite data management

• At screening visit, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592952].  
• Two US measurement points will be selected  and images will be captured  (according to the 
applicators positioning)  
• A transparency will be created at baseline for each patient, with treated area, identification marks 
(umbilicus, spots/moles) and the measurements points marked, to ensure USI of the same point at 
baseline and FU visit.  
• US probe should be applied to measure abdominal subcutaneous fat in the area of the two 
measurement points (identified according to the transparency).  
• Each measurement of fat later thickness should be repeated 2 times and an average value will be 
recorded.

Five photographs should be taken at each specified time point  
• Front  
• 45º from the right side  
• 90º from the right side  
• 45º from the left side  
• 90º from the left side  
The subject’s arms should remain out of the way; it  is best to either cross them over each other in front of 
the chest or hold them up at a 90° angle to the body, ensuring that they do not rest on the chest or touch 
the body and that they do not cast a sha dow in the photograph.

Appendix 4.0: Circumference Measurements  
The following steps are necessary to achieve consistent measurements:  
• The measurement tape should be parallel to the floor during the measurement  
• Prior to circumference measurement, mark the area to be treated in order to perform the 
measurements within the defined area for treatment. The area to be measured must be at 
height that includes the area to be treated.  
• Baseline measurement should be taken at the level of the widest part of area (most 
protruding convexity) – horizontal midline. This height level should be recorded for follow 
up assessments. Two additional measurements will be taken at 2 inches/5 cm above this 
baseline and 2  inches/5  cm below it.  
• The consecutive measurements should be performed at the same height recorded at 
enrollment. In order to assure that measuring tape is parallel to the floor, several reference 
points should be marked around the treatment area and the measuring tape should b e 
placed such that it is aligned with them.  
• The tape should be placed under the reference points in order to maintain repetitive height 
of the measurement  
• The measurement device should be placed  at a constant tension to achieve an exact 
measurement of the circumference  
• The same trained evaluator will  preferably perform the circumference measurement to 
avoid bias in results. In case that evaluator is not available, another trained person will 
perform the procedure.  
The circumference measurement:  
• Position the subject next to a fixed height measuring device. Such a device could be a 
wooden/metal  measurement stick, fixed perpendicular to the floor.  
• Alternatively, a medical height measuring device will be employed.  
• The height reference line should  be at the widest part of the marked treatment area 
(horizontal mid -line).  
• This height should be kept as the  reference in the follow up throughout all measurements 
of the same treatment area.  
• In order to ensure a reproducible posture, position the subject as close as possible to the 
measurement stick.  
• Arms will be crossed over the chest with hands placed in the opposite axillae. The head will 
be held up with  eyes level and looking straight ahead.

• Have the subject rotate slowly to produce the height reference line. This line should be 
marked on the skin as  the subject rotates. Make sure that the height reference points cover 
the entire length of the circumference, at  front, back and two sides.  
• In the subject file, record the height of the horizontal mid -line of the treatment area (the 
distance from the  floor). This will enable the operator to re -measure the subject at the same 
height in the follow up visits for  the evaluation of the change in the circumference.  
• Place the measurement tape at the widest part of the marked area . The measurement tape 
should  be placed below the reference line.  
• Record the measured circumference in the subject file  
• Measure circumference at 2  inches/5  cm above the horizontal midsection of the marked 
treatment area  
• Measure circumference at 2 inches/5 cm below the horizontal midsection of the marked 
treatment area .

Appendix 6.0:  Calliper  measurements  
• Take two measurements next to the belly button from both sides. If measurements are not the same, 
record the average  
• Pull out the fold of skin with the underlying layer of fat  
• Place the jaws of the caliper on the pulled skinfold  
• Release the trigger of the caliper so the entire force of the jaws is on the skinfold  
• Keep holding firmly the fold of skin with the fingers so that the caliper is measuring just the thickness of 
the fold of skin  
• When the caliper is placed on the skinfold it may move a little and slow down after a few seconds, then 
the measurement should be taken.  
• Note the reading on the scale before releasing any pressure off the calipers.  
• Maintain consistency with regards to type of caliper used, landmark site measured

Protocol #:  18- [ADDRESS_751378] Title:  Enhanced Pupil Dilation in Patients Taking Alpha -
Blockers for Potential Treatment of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome using Brimonidine Tartrat e    
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_572154], MD  
Version Date:   02/22/2019         
 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims:  
 Hypothesis:   In patients who have  poor pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572155] 
α-1 blocker use (ex: tamsulosin), treatment with an α-[ADDRESS_751379] , 
such as brimonidine tartrate .2%,  [ADDRESS_751380] 
pharmacological dilation will lead to improved pupil lary dilation.   
 Primary Aim:  To determine the average increased pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572156] α-[ADDRESS_751381] treated eye compared to the untreated eye in 
patients with a history of taking tamsulosin (or another systemic α 
blocker) .   
 Secondary Aim:  To determ ine the increased pupil dilation of the 
treated eye after bromidine tartrate .2% for 7 days compared to the initial dilation prior to brimonidine treatment.  
 II. Background and Significance :  
 Each year, millions of people suffer from poor pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572157]. Poor pupil dilation leads to inadequate visualization of pathology by [CONTACT_572173] -based 
exams. Even more importantly, the surgical work area of the eye is severely diminished in these patients.  Narrowing a surgeon’s work area 
has significant implications for surgical safety and patient outcomes and contributes to higher rates of complications.

the U.S. up to $35 million annually.4 
 
One cause of poor pupil dilation is due to secondary systemic effects of α blockers.  Poor pupil dilation in these patients has been newly termed Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) .   This 
class of drugs is often prescribed in middle- aged to older men 
diagnosed with Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH).  IFIS is composed 
 
Protocol Template  Page 2 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 of a triad of intraoperative characteristics: 1) a floppy iris that “billows” 
in response to irrigation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] , 2) tendency of the iris to 
prolapse out of the wound, and 3) progressive pupil constriction during surgery despi[INVESTIGATOR_572158].  IFIS was first identified as problematic in patients taking tamsulosin in [ADDRESS_751383] indicated that the incidence of Intraoperative 
Floppy Iris Syndrome is 2% of all total patients undergoing eye operations (3.[ADDRESS_751384] surgeries are performed in the [LOCATION_002] each year)
5.   In patients taking tamsulosin the incidence of IFIS 
is up to 90%6.  Simply discontinuing the α -blocker does not resolve the 
symptoms, which means any patient who has taken a tamsulosin at any point in their life is at high risk for having IFIS and suffering surgical complications. Complications i nclude  capsular r upture, loss of vitreous, 
iris prolapse, iris stroma atrophy, capsulorhexis tear, or anterior chamber hemorrhage.  History of tamsulosin use in operative patients has an associated 2.3- fold increase risk of complications compared to 
patients who have never taken tamsulosin
7.  
 For surgical ophthalmologists, poor pupil dilation is problematic because the smaller pupil results in less light entering the dilated eye and an obstructed view during surgery.  This is highlighted by [CONTACT_716] d iagram and equation for the area of a circle:  
 
 
 From the above equation, we can see that an eye surgeon’s work area (A) inside of a circular pupil is most influenced by [CONTACT_572174] (r). As dilating eye drops are applied to the eye, the radius of the pupil  
increases and the surgical work area increases exponentially. If the radius of a pupil doubles, the surgical work area quadruples. Similarly, if the dilated pupil size decreases by [CONTACT_572175] 8mm to 4mm, the surgical work area decreases by a factor of four.  
  III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:   
  There is currently no FDA approved cure or treatment to prevent or 
lessen the symptoms associated with IFIS.  Current research is 
targeted at identifying patients most at risk for surgical complications by [CONTACT_572176] 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_751385] not yet showed 
promising results as they only improve pupil dilation modestly.  A solution not yet explored is to create a temporary, pharmacologically  
induced Horner’s Syndrome, resulting in the temporary upregulation of α-[ADDRESS_751386], but in the presence of α-1 selective dilating drops such as phenylephrine, the result would be 
a “supersensitive” response and substantial pupil dilation in an eye that would otherwise not dilate adequately for surgical intervention.  
 Through disease mimicry, our method uses topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] α -2 agonists to 
create a pharmac ological Horner’s Syndrome. Since activation of pre-
synaptic α -2 receptors activates the negative feedback mechanism, this 
treatment will decrease the release of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) into the synaptic cleft. The lack of NE in the synaptic cleft will upregul ate the 
post-synaptic α -[ADDRESS_751387] such as 
phenylephrine or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]:  
 
   
  Our initial research shows promising results. Preliminary data collected in one healthy human showed that pre- treatment with brimonidine 

 
Protocol Template  Page 4 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_751388] prescribed for 
glaucoma treatment, resulted in increased dilation when compared to 
the non- treated eye. Specifically, after 4 day s of pre- treatment with 
brimonidine in only one eye, the brimonidine- treated eye had an 84.4% 
greater surgical working area compared to the non- treated eye 
(11.16mm2 vs 20.59mm2).  
 A preliminary IRB -approved study is currently under way looking at 
pupil dilation in patients with Horner’s Syndrome who have previously 
been on a systemic α -1 blocker.  This study titled “Exploration of Pupil 
Dilation in Horner's Patients Taking Flomax” studies the 
hypersensitivity that the effected Horner’s eye has to α -1 rece ptor 
agonists.   
 
Horner’s Syndrome represents the classical triad of unilateral miosis (pupil constriction) and anisocoria (asymmetric pupil size), ptosis (abnormal low -lying upper eyelid), and anhidrosis (loss of sweating 
ability).   This unilateral  synd rome results from the destruction of 
autonomic sympathetic nerve axons leading to the loss of sympathetic 
innervation to one of the eyes and surrounding skin and subsequently, 
supersensitivity to α agonists (such as norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) . This 
supersensitive state can be described through the Law of Denervation Supersensitivity (Cannon’s law) first described in 1939 .   Specifically, 
for the eye, the iris is covered in α- 1 and α -2 receptors.   These 
receptors result in pupil dilation via the bonding to the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  I n a normal physiologic state, there is 
a set level of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_572159] α -1 receptors at a normal level.  In Horner’s Syndrome, 
however, there is a lack of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_572160]. The absence of the sympathetic neurotransmitters in Horner’s syndrome results in an upregulation of 
alpha receptors onto the muscle fibers responsible for pupil dilation.  
The increased number of alpha receptors on the iris is responsible for the supersensitive state that results in an exaggerated dilation of the pupil.     
 The final results of this ongoing study will serve as the proof of concept study to evaluate how pharmacologic mimicry of an induced Horner’s state for the eye may result in the ability to offset poor pupil dilation in patients with IFIS.  
 IV. Research  Methods  
 A.  Outcome Measure(s):   
The primary hypothesis for this study is that application of routine dilating medications (Phenylephrine Hydrochloride 10%, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%, and 
 
Protocol Template  Page 5 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 cyclopentolate 1% ophthalmic solutions) will dilate the brimonidine tartrate pre-
treated eye more than the non- treated eye in patients previously treated with 
tamsulosin.  
 
The primary outcome measure for this single arm study is pupil diameter size post dilation (using standard dilating medications of phenylephrine 10%, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%, and cyclopentolate 1%) of the brimonidine tartrate pre- treated eye compared 
to the non- treated eye.  
 
The secondary outcome is the change in pupil diameter of each eye after dilation 
at the start of the study, compared to pupil post dilating drops at the end of the study .   
 
B. Descripti on of Population to be Enrolled:   
This study will recruit from the  Denver Health Medical Center Eye Clinic.  Adult 
subjects who  have any history of taking tamsulosin and do not meet one of the 
exclusion criteria will be approached for consent. .Adult pati ents must be able 
to consent for study participation by [CONTACT_1029].  Exclusion criteria that will eliminate potential subjects for enrollment includes:  
1) Subjects with untreated hypertension, baseline BP >160  
2) Subjects with thyrotoxicosis  
3) Pregnant women  
4) Priso ners 
5) Inability to consent  
6) Subjects with anatomical narrow angles who have never had a dilated exam  
7) Subjects currently prescribed brimonidine tartrate for glaucoma  
8) Subjects who require topi[INVESTIGATOR_78519] α agonists  
9) Any eye disease that would alter pupil dilation 
 
C. Study Design and Research Methods   
Single Arm, Superiority Trial  
 This is a single arm study. All enrolled subjects will receive the interventional drug, Brimonidine tartrate 0.2%, to be applied to ONE eye only.  Brimonidine is currently 
an FDA approved drug with a favorable safety  profile,  thus an internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_572161] -label use of Brimonidi ne to treat IFIS .  The 
internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_572162])  data will be used to 
improve the estimation of variance in response to these medications, since the therapy approach is novel and there are no published data. In addition, the internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_572163]- assess recruitment methods, as well as patient satisfaction 
and adherence.     
 This study will investigate the resulting difference in pupil dilation in the treated eye 
(Brimonidine Tartrate .2% for 7 days) eye compared to the non treated eye. The 
 
Protocol Template  Page 6 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 investigators hypothesize that in patients with IFIS, brimonidine tartrate .2% is 
superior to the current standard of care for pupil dilation for surgical preparation.   
 
The primary outcome is pupil dilation sized of the treated eye compared to the non-treated eye, and the secondary outcome is pupil dilation of the treated eye 
compared to the pre- treatment pupil dilation size of that same eye.  
 Patients will be screened a t their annual Denver Health Eye Clinic examination.  
Clinical examinations will involve a medication history and baseline vitals, as per standard of care, and any patient taking a systemic α blocker (such as tamsulosin) will be approached for consent if t hey do not meet any exclusion criteria.  
 For all patients, consent will occur in person in the Denver Health Eye Clinic in a private setting  at the first study visit, or at a standard of care visit which will include 
study procedures .  Consent will be obt ained by a member of the research team.  
Once consent has occurred, the principal investigator (PI) will examine the patient’s anterior eye segment and measure the subject’s pupil diameter prior to instilling the dilating drops.  Pupil measurements will oc cur with the use of a Digital 
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187] (NeuroOptics Inc, Irvine, [LOCATION_004], [LOCATION_003]).  The Digital Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572164].   
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_572165]- operative dilating 
cocktail given in the pre- operative phase of cataract surgery.  The dilating cocktail 
is composed of phenylephrine 10%, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%, and cyclopentolate 1% 
drops .   All of these drugs have a well known safety profile and thus we expect 
minimal side effects during this clinical trial.  Measurement for  post dilation pupil 
size will occur  at 15,  30, and 45 minutes after instillation of these medications.  
After the pupil measurement with the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187], the study related activity for the initial visit will be complete.  If patients are in the clinic for their regular examination, the clinic specialists will commence the exam at that time.   
 After this initial visit, a 20 -day washout period will ensue.  During this time, the 
patient will be asked to not use any topi[INVESTIGATOR_78519] α-agonists.   They may 
continue to use systemic α -receptor blockers such as tamsulosin.  After this 20-
day washout period, patients will begin treatment using brimonidine tartrate 0.2% three (3) times per day in the right eye.  This dose and frequency is the FDA approved dose for glaucoma patients, and at this dose the side effect profile is well tolerated.   
 After 7 days of treatment, the patient will return to the Denver Health Eye Clinic.  Again, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572166]’s anterior eye segment and measure the subject’s pupil diameter prior to instilling dilating drops.  Pupil measurements will 
occur with the use of the NeurOptics Digital P upi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]. After measurement of 
both pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572167], the routine eye drop cocktail for 
 
Protocol Template  Page 7 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_751389] surgery (phenylephrine 10%, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%, and 
cyclopentolate 1% drops) will be placed on both of the subject’s ey es by [CONTACT_978].

database will be deleted after the study concludes, but the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_572170] -identified medical data.  
 We are seeking Investigational New Drug (IND) application exemption for brimonidine tartrate 0.2% for the following reasons:  
 
 
Protocol Template  Page 9 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 1. Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% is an α  adrenergic agonist lawfully marketed 
in the [LOCATION_002] indicated for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in 
patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.  
2. The investigation is not intended to be reported to the FDA as a well -
controlled study in support of a new indication for use of the drug product.  
3. The investigation is not intended to support a significant change in advertising to an existing lawfully marketed prescription drug product.  
4. The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a patient population or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the r isks) 
associated with the use of the drug product. Dosage and administration in this study will be exactly the same as is indicated and FDA approved for open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: “One drop in the affected eye(s), three times daily, approx imately 8 hours apart”.  
Furthermore, we will only be using this medication for 7 days.  This is far shorter of a treatment course than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_83576].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this medication is used continuously for many years/decades to treat the above eye condit ions.  
5. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in FDA regulations [ADDRESS_751392] give consent in order to enroll.  
6. The investigation will be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations 
21 CFR 312.7: Promotion and charging for investigational drugs. We will not represent the off -label use of the drug f or this study as safe and 
effective or otherwise promote it. The medication used in this study will be obtained and paid for by [CONTACT_093], and will not be charged to the subject or subject's insurance.  
 F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
 Cases and Controls: Each treated eye (Case) has two Controls: 1) the baseline measurement of the treated eye prior to commencing pre- treatment and 2) the left, 
untreated eye after pre -treatment is completed. The two controls (baseline and 
untreated eye) are necessary to assess the possible role of systemic effects of the 
α-[ADDRESS_751393] (which could affect the untreated eye).   Our primary and secondary 
endpoints are the change in pupil diameter of the treated right eye compared t o 
the pre- treated pupil dilation size, and compared to the untreated left eye pupil 
dilation size.   
 
Tertiary endpoints are noted side effects from the administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_572171] .2% TID for [ADDRESS_751394] minimal 
 
Protocol Template  Page 10 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 systemic effects by [CONTACT_572177] (punctal occlusion) 
during drop instillation to minimize systemic effects.  
 Assumptions for sample size:  All calculations assume two -tailed tests, with 80% 
power and 95% confidence. The overall sample size is initially calculated based on published data on healthy volunteers and patients on tamsulosin. After 50% enrollment in each arm, we will re- calculate the variance based on acquired data 
and re- estimate the final sample size.
8 This initial comparison will be considered 
as an interim look using the O’Brien- Fleming alpha spending function. All samples 
size calculations will be conducted using PASS Power Analysis an d Sample Size 
Software (2015, NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass). Based on Theodossiadis et al. (2), normal individuals show a 2.9 ± 0.5 (standard deviation) fold change in pupil minimum aperture after phenylephrine 10% compared to 2. 7 ± 0.5 (standard deviation) fold change in patients taking 
tamsulosin for >=[ADDRESS_751395] deviation 
of 0.45,  and 30% attrition rate, [ADDRESS_751396] a minimum 
difference in pupil aperture fold change of 0.3 (effect size=0.6).   
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
BPH is the most commonly diagnosed condition for male patients age 45- 74.
9 It is 
estimated that up to 90% of men between the age of [ADDRESS_751397] line therapy for BPH by [CONTACT_11676], is the selective α -1 blocker (e.g.: 
tamsulosin) that target α -1 receptors in the genitourinary (GU) system. The risk of 
IFIS among men taking tamsulosin was as high as 90% in [ADDRESS_751398] surgeries 
are performed each year in the [LOCATION_003] alone, 20 million worldwide. An estimated 2% of these surgeries have IFIS (72,000 cases each year in the [LOCATION_003]).
[ADDRESS_751399] 
and BPH population is only expected to increase over the next 30 years due to population aging.
11 
 This study will provide data on the potential treatment of IFIS. Currently no adequate treatment for IFIS exists. This potential treatment method creates a “pharmacologically induced Horner’s Syndrome”, resulting in an increased response to mydriatic medications.  This is accomplished by [CONTACT_572178], whsera ich upregulates α -[ADDRESS_751400] IFIS -related surgical complications.

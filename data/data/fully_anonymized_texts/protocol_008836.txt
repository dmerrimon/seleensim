INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Background  
Adipose tissue is a loose type of connective tissue specialized to store lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. The majority of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_832123].  It is 
not uniformly distributed in the body.  The major adipose depot is subcutaneous (about 80% of 
all body fat).1 In men , it normally represents 15 -20% of body weight and in women, 20 -25% of  
body weight.  A certain amount of body fat is necessary for normal female reproduction and 
health. Subcutaneous adipose tissue helps to shape, cushion and insulate the body and provides 
padding to some organs.  
 
Liposuction is a procedure that can help sculpt the body by [CONTACT_509997].2,3,4 The increasing popularity of this procedure is associated with the evolution of 
techniques and equipment for fat removal, body reshapi[INVESTIGATOR_509989]. Besides the 
traditional su ction -assisted lipoplasty, other options include ultrasound -assisted and external 
ultrasound -assisted liposucti on, power -assisted liposuction and laser lipolysis , as well as low -level 
laser -assisted liposculpture.5  
 
The efforts in the search for alternati ve non -invasive or mini mally -invasive techniques and new 
tools aim mainly at reducing downtime  and facilitating treatment for reduction of the localized 
fatty tissue areas.  New minimally -invasive technologies include subcutaneous injection of 
phosphatidyl choline. This drug was initially used in emergencies and in the treatment of atheroma 
plaques in cardiac diseases.  Recently, it has also been used in the treatment of localized fat 
deposits, with mixed reviews.6

The VelaShape device is a commercial device cleared by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) 
under 510(k) K071872 indicated for the relief of minor muscle aches and pain, relief of muscle 
spasm, temporary improvement of local blood circulation, temporary reduction in the appe arance 
of cellulite, and for temporary reduction of thighs circumferences.  It combines controlled infrared 
(IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with mechanical manipulation. The 
VelaShape II, the next generation VelaShape, is a CE -cleared device since 2009, which also 
combines controlled infrared  (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with 
mechanical manipulation.  The VelaShape II device has 65W RF energy.  
The VelaShape III, the newest generation VelaShape, is a device based on the  CE-cleared 
VelaShape II  and FDA -cleared Transcend device (K120510). All devices combine controlled 
infrared  (IR) light and conducted bipolar radiofrequency (RF) energies with vacuum.  The 
VelaShape III device is indicated for relie f of minor muscle aches and pain, relief of muscle spasm, 
temporary improvement of local blood circulation, temporary reduction in the appearance of 
cellulite, and for temporary reduction of thighs and abdomen circumference.  
The VelaShape III device has 15 0W RF energy.  
 
The UltraShape® Contour I VER 3.1 is a device cleared by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA 
– K133238) and Health Canada (HC). The UltraShape, the next generation of Contour I VER 3.1, is 
a commercial device cleared by [CONTACT_46924], Health Cana da and by [CONTACT_2165] 
(FDA – K141708) , which uses focused ultrasound to produce localized mechanical motion within 
fat tissues and cells for the purpose of producing mechanical cellular membrane disruption. It is 
intended for reduction  in abdominal circumference.  The newest generation UltraShape device, 
UltraShape Power, includes a small transducer (U-Sculpt Power) , and is FDA -cleared ( K170370 ) 
for lipolysis (breakdown of fat) to provide a non -invasive approach to achieve a desired aest hetic 
effect. It is intended for non -invasive reduction in abdominal circumference and fat reduction in 
the flanks and thighs.  
 
Device Descriptions  
VelaShape Device  
The newest generation, VelaShape III, is composed of a console to which two applicators, 
VContour  and VSmooth , are connected via an umbilical cable. Each applicator incorporates an 
operation panel to enable the operator remote control of the system  in addition to the system’s 
touch screen operation panel. Prior  to treatment, the  applicators are fitted with a replaceable 
cap, which keeps the skin from coming in to direct contact [CONTACT_832130] . These caps can be cleaned between treatments for reuse for the same subject, since 
multiple treatments are typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] . During  treatme nt with the VelaShape III device , the applied

suction repeatedly pulls the skin into a chamber in the middle of the cap . There, the  skin is 
exposed to the combined elōs technology (electro optical synergy - IR light and RF) using gentle 
vacuum  suction with  or without mechanical manipulation.   
 
The VSmooth a pplicator contains rotating elements that create a massaging motion. The system 
enables the user to adjust the RF energy, optical energy and vacuum levels, thereby [CONTACT_832131]/anatomical area .

General:  Tissue selectivity is achieved by a proprietary knowledge of ultrasound parameters 
ensuring specific destruction of the fat ce lls only within the target area. All other types of tissue, 
such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves remain intact. There are no thermal effects. 
Fat cell destruction is achieved by [CONTACT_2207] -induced mechanical effects during a very short 
expo sure time.  
The Ultrasonic Transducer : The ultrasonic transducer is an electro -mechanical device that 
converts an electrical signal into mechanical (acoustical) energy. Its functionality is based on  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_832124] s ize when a voltage is applied. Thus,  
applying an alternating voltage frequency across such pi[INVESTIGATOR_832125], producing sound waves. The spherical shape of that pi[INVESTIGATOR_832126] a narrow focal region , which is the target

Pre-Treatment Procedures  
 It is expected that the screening and baseline procedures will be conducted during the same visit 
as the treatment . All visit procedures should take up to 2 hours.  
Screening  
1. ICF - Prior to any study –related activities , informed consent will be obtained.  When the 
subject fully understands the possible benefits and risks of the study, the subject will be 
asked to sign an d date the informed consent form (ICF).  The subject will be given a copy 
of the signed ICF.  
2. Medical History - A medical history will be obtained to determine if the  subject  meet s the 
study criteria, including a list of all prescribed and over -the-counter medications.   
3. Skin Exam - The subject will undergo a routine skin exam to determine if he/she  meet s 
the study criteria including the presence of fatty tissue deposits in the treatment area.   
4. BMI – the volunteers’ height and weight will be taken for calcu lation of BMI.  
5. Pregnancy Screen – female subjects who can become  pregnant will undergo a urine 
pregnancy test. This will be repeated prior to all treatments, and at the end of the study 
(last FU visit).  If the Screening and Treatment procedures are not co nducted on the same

Measurements  
Measure the Fat Thickness at the Area to be treated   
The procedure can be per formed only in areas where the fat thickness is ≥1.5 cm as measured by 
a skin fold caliper (or ≥3.[ADDRESS_1155195] ), and ≥2.5 cm as measured by a skin 
fold caliper  after strappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Marking Area for UltraS hape Power Treatment  
The mark of the area to be treated should be copi[INVESTIGATOR_99628] a transparent template (for each side: 
Right and Left ) to ensure consistent marking of the same area for same patient during the 
subsequent visits.  
During copying the treatment area to the transparent template, th e following signs will be marked 
on transparency according to the following table  (Table 4):

treated condition (fat layer), but also the subject’s skin type, tendency to bruise, the specific 
anatomical location (i.e. thigh ), and comf ort. 
7. There should be a complete seal between the applicator and the skin  during the treatment 
session .  In curved or bony areas , careful  attention is required when treating. A slight change 
in the orientation of the applicator may solve the problem.

Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For device studies, part 21 CRF 812.3(s)  uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect  which 
is defined as an y serious adverse effect on health or safety or  any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with the  device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementa ry plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
Significant device failure may constitute an adverse event if an undesirable experience occurs.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions 
for use or the deployment of the device, or any event that is a result of a user error.  
 
All unanticipated adverse e ffects will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate:  Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884], and may i nterfere with usual activity.  
Major:  Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and 
that interferes with usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by 
[CONTACT_590113].  
Severe:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   
 
The relationship of the adverse effect to the study is defined as follows:  
Probable:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and 
another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study device, 
and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the 
potential relationship to study device.

Probably not:  An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship t o the study device 
and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not related:  An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much 
more likely alternative etiology.  
Reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE ) 
Anticipated Adverse Events:  Anticipated adverse events in this study include Purpura , blistering,

RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
Risks  
Syneron has determined that the VelaShape III  and the UltraShape Power system s are 
non-significant risk device s. As indicated in the AE section, the anticipated risks associated with 
the use of both of the systems  are: 
➢ Purpura   ➢ Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  
➢ Blister  ➢ Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  
➢ Bruising  ➢ Soreness  
➢ Bullae  ➢ First-degree burn  
➢ Erosion  
➢ Pain  
➢ Hair pulling  ➢ Second -degree burn  
➢ Erythema  
➢ Damage to natural skin structure 
(scratching, crusting)  
 
Over 2,[ADDRESS_1155206] some 
benefit from the treatment procedures as would be expected for the commercial device s 
(VelaShape III  and UltraShape  Power ). Subject will receive all treatment procedures at no cost.  
This study will benefit the advancement of medicine by [CONTACT_832142], such as liposuction.  The re sults of this study will help to determine 
whether th is device is  safe and effective for improvement of localized subcutaneous fat.  
Conclusion:  
Considering  the potential benefits of non -invasive circumference and fat reduction  relative to its 
risks, the po tential benefits associated with the use of the VelaShape III and UltraShape Power 
System s outweigh its risks, supporting study initiation.

APPENDIX IV  ‐ PHOTOGRAPHY  
At each of the specified time points; photographs of the treated areas should be taken by 
[CONTACT_510016].  
• Photographs should be taken in a private room or area of the clinic under 
controlled conditions, including the distance from the camera to the subject, 
height of the camera, background, camera positioning, subject's positioning and 
lighting to achieve high -quality before & after sets.  
• Consistent lighting - Lighting s hould be projected from about 45º angle in order to 
emphasize the body appearance.  
• It is important to keep a constant distance between the subject’s feet (use “sticky 
feet” or another way of marking) in order to properly present the effect of the 
treatment . The  recommended distance between the feet is ~20  cm, but the main 
point is not to make this distance too small, so that the thighs touch each other, 
or too large.  
• The disposable underwear should be used for all photographs of treatment areas  
at each stud y visit . 
• For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study 
photographs, particularly  for the same area and subject.  
• Small plain labels (with the date, subject ID, subject initials, Investigator name, 
and identity of the specific area  photographed, if  necessary) should be placed in 
the same location within each frame at each photography time point. The label 
should not cover the treated area . 
• All digital files should follow a consistent standard naming scheme.  
Specific photography deta ils: 
Four  photographs of each thigh (angles below) should be taken at each specified time point : 
• Front  of the thigh  
• 90º from the front (right side of the body)  
• 90º from the front (left  side of the body)  
• Back of the thigh  
Subject s’ arms should remain out of the way; it  is best to either cross them over each other in 
front of the chest or hold them up at a 90° angle to the body, ensuring that the  arms  do not rest 
on the chest or touch the body and that they do not cast a shadow in the photograph.

Study Design : This will be a Phase 1 multicenter, dose - and schedule -finding, 
open -label, single -agent study of RX -3117 administered orally 
to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors followed 
by a 2 -stage Phase 2 study design.  Subjects will be treated for 
up to 8 cycles of therapy.   In the Phase 1 portion of the study 
subjects with any advanced solid tumor malignancies will be 
enrolled. During the Phase 1 portion of the study, the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended phase 2 dose (RP 2D) 
and schedule will be determined and the pharmacokinetics of 
RX-3117 characterized in eligible subjects.  In the Dose 
Expansion , subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 diagnosis groups: 
relapsed or refractory pancreatic, colorectal or advanced 
bladder canc ers.  In the Phase 2 portion, subjects will be 
enrolled in 1 of 2 diagnosis groups: relapsed or refractory 
pancreatic or advanced bladder cancers .  The Dose Expansion 
and Phase [ADDRESS_346294] 10 response -evaluable subjects  enrolled in that disease 
group. Approximately 40 additional subjects will  be enrolled in 
each of the disease indications.  Subjects will be treated for up 
to 8 cycles of therapy.  
Sample Size:   Number of planned subjects is approximately 152 subjects (40 subjects in the 
Phase 1, depending upon the number of dose levels needed to identify the maximum tolerated

Safety Parameters :  Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version  15.1) and will be graded using the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version  4.03).  The CTCAE will also 
be used to grade abnormalities  in vital signs , laboratory assessments that include serum 
chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis  and electrocardiogram s (Phase 1) . 
 
Statistical Considerations:    
Analysis Methods:  
In the Phase 1 portion and the Dose Expansion the statistical methods will be descriptive in 
nature.  Appropriate data analysis sets will be defined. The full -analysis set will include data from 
all subjects who receive  1 dose of study therapy; other data sets (responding and evaluable 
data sets) will be defined in a separate statistical analysis plan and will include data from subjects 
who have sufficient  baseline and on -study measurements to prov ide interpretable results for 
specific parameters of interest.  
Subject characteristics and study results will be described and summarized by [CONTACT_283646]-3117 dose 
level, schedule  and overall for the relevant analysis sets.  
Based on the full -analysis set, informat ion regarding study treatment administration, study drug 
compliance, and safety variables will be described and summarized.  Using data from the 
relevant evaluable data sets, RX-3117  plasma concentrations, pharmacokinetic parameters, and 
pharmacodynamic ma rkers will also be described and summarized.  Calculated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be derived using non -compartmental methods.  
For endpoints relat ed to tumor assessment , analyses will be done based on the full -analysis, 
responding, or evaluable data sets, as appropriate.  Continuous and categorical variables will be 
summarized.  Changes from baseline in categorical variables and changes from baseline in 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using appropriate methods.  Time -to-event endpoints will 
be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methods.  
The Phase 2 portion  of the study will follow a 2 -stage design  (Simon, 1989) . An interim analysis 
will be conducted when 1 0 response -evaluable subjects, treated with the recommended phase 2 
dose (RP2D) of RX -3117,  in ea ch tumor indication are enrolled and have had the  opport unity to 
complete a minimum of [ADDRESS_346307] discontinued therapy due to progressive 
disease (PD). The critical value for evaluation of each tumor type to proceed to the second  stage 
of the Phase 2 is 2 in 1 0 subjects (20%) measured by a benefit in PFS (stable disease for at least 
4 months) or [ADDRESS_346308] with an objective clinical response  (partial or complete response)  
supported by [CONTACT_283647] c onduct of the study by [CONTACT_4520], medical monitor and sponsor .. In the second  stage of the Phase 2 objective clinical

Sample Size Calculation : 
In this dose -escalation Phase [ADDRESS_346311]-cycle DLTs at each dose level  and schedule .  The planned accelerated 
design followed by a sequential 3+[ADDRESS_346312] National Cancer Institute (NCI) definition of MTD (starting dose 
associated with DLT in <  33.3% of subjects during the fi rst cycle of therapy).  The dose group 
size and dose -escalation rules establish a low probability of increasing the dose if the true rate of 
DLT is high while there is a high likelihood of escalating or proceeding to the next stage of the 
study if t he true underlying proportion of DLT is low.   Once the recommended phase 2 dose or 
MTD  and schedule  is identified  approximately 12 subjects will be treated in the Dose Expansion.  
The maximum number of subjects needed for Phase 2 is approximately 100 (50 pe r tumor 
indication ).  An estimated 20 subjects (10 per indication) will be enrolled in the first stage of the 
Phase [ADDRESS_346313] stage  of the Phase 2 .  
A formal statistical analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock.

Protocol Number:  RX -[ADDRESS_346332]:  RX -[ADDRESS_346333] statistics  (American Cancer Society, 2013), cancer causes 
around 7.6 million deaths worldwide each year.  Deaths from cancer a re projected to 
continue rising  to an estimated 21.4 million worldwide in 2030 (American Cancer 
Society, 2011).  
For patients presenting with  confined local -regional cancer , the development of systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_283610] d elaying recurrence of disease.  However, for patients who present with 
large primary tumors or me tastases or who develop recurrent metastatic disease, cancer 
becomes a life -threatening  disorder.  T herapy for patients with advanced cancer has 
focused on the sequential use of systemic treatments to impede the disease progression 
that leads to disabling symptoms and death .  Depending upon the tumor type, hormonal 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, or tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors may 
be employed, and most commonly, cytotoxic chemotherapy in various sequences and  
combinations is administer ed.  
The development of newer agents in the past [ADDRESS_346334] been widely used as antivirals and for the treatment of various 
types of cancer, both hematologic as well as solid tumors .  These agents  include 
cytarabine, 5 -azacytidine , 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine (decitabine)  and gemcitabine .  
Among these, gemcitabine is the most broadly use d anticancer agent.  Initially 
developed as an antiviral agent, gemcitabine (2’,2’ -difluoro -2’-deoxycytidine) is 
structurally similar to cytarabine  differing due to a fluorine substitution at po sition 2’ of

phosphorylation.  Within the cell, gemcitabine is phosphoryl ated to gemcitabine 
monophosphat e (dFdCMP) by [CONTACT_283648] - or triphosphate forms (gemcitabine diphosphate [dFdCDP] and 
gemcitabine triphosphate [dFdCTP];  Heinemann et al 1992) . 
Gemcitabine appears to have several intracellular targets.  Much of its anticancer 
properties, however, inv olve inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (Gandhi 
and Plunkett 1990, Heinemann et al 1990, Hertel et al, 1990) .  Gemcitabine diphosphate 
is an inhibitor of DNA poly merase (Gandhi and Plunkett 1990)  and is also physically 
incorporated into DNA which can lead to termination of chain elongation (Huang et al 
1991) . The nonterminal positioning of dFdCTP in DNA preven ts detection and repair of 
that sequence by [CONTACT_283649], which ultimately induces apoptosis (Gandhi and 
Plunkett 1990, Schy et al 1993) .  A metabolite of gemcitabine , which is most likely 
dFdCTP, can also incorporate into ribonucleic acid (RNA) (Ruiz  van Haperen et al 
1993) .  Other activities  associated with gemcitabine metabolites inc lude inhibition of 
cytidine triphosphate synthetase (CTP synthetase) and inhibition of deoxycytidylate 
deaminase (dCMP deaminase) by [CONTACT_283650] (Heinemann et al 1992) .  Gemcitabine can 
also affect topoisomerase I, which suggests that induction of topois omerase I mediated 
DNA break formation can contribute to the cytotoxic potential of this drug (Pourquier et al 
2002) . 
Initial Phase 2 studi es with gemcitabine as a single -agent (800 mg/m2 weekly for 3 
weeks) demonstrated a n overall  response rate (ORR) in chemotherapy -naive patients 
with metastatic adenocarcinoma of th e pancreas in the range of  6% to 11% (Carmichael 
et al 1996, Casper et al 1994) .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_283611], clinical benefit 
was derived. In the Phase 2 study that  led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval, clinical benefit was defined as improvement in pain, performance status , or 
weight without deterioration in any other factors (Rothenberg et al 1996) .  Clinical benefit 
was reported at 27% as compared to the objective response rate of 11% in 126 patients . 
In addi tion to its indication in metastatic pancreatic cancer (Burris, III et al 1997) , 
gemcitabine is used in combination treatment in non -small cell lung cancer (Sandler et al 
2000) , bladder cancer (von der Maase et al 2000) , breast cancer (Albain et al 2004) , 
ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, and head/neck cancers (Mini et al 2006) .

2.2.1  RX-3117 Structure  
RX-3117  is a small -molecule , cyclopentyl pyrimidyl nucleoside being developed by 
[CONTACT_283651], Inc.  RX-3117 was synthesized as a  new oral antimetabolite 
with the p otential  to overcome gemcitabine resistance and offer a favorable 
pharmacologic profile.  Its chemical n ame is 4-amino -1-[(1S,4R,5S) -2-fluoro -4,5-
dihydroxy -3-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopent -2-en-1-yl]pyrimidin -2-one. The RX-3117  
monohydrate  drug substance is a white to yellow crystalline solid. The molecular weight 
is 257.22 daltons for the anhydrous form and 275.2 4 daltons  for the monohydrate  form. 
Its molecular formula is C10H12N3O4F•H 2O. 
2.2.2  Mechanism of Action and Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies  
The mechanism of action of RX-3117  has been investigated extensively. RX-3117  is an 
antimetabolite  that mimics the buildi ng blocks of DNA or ribonucleic acid ( RNA ).  
Antimetabolites are incorporated into DNA or RNA of cells , where they interfere with cell 
division. RX-3117  is activated by  [CONTACT_10834] -cytidine kinase ( UCK ), and thus differs from  
gemcitabine, which is activated by  [CONTACT_56614] .  In addition, gemcitabine is 
inactivated by [CONTACT_283652] e at a fast rate, whereas RX-[ADDRESS_346338] ivity.  
In vitro mechanism studies characterized the effects of RX-3117  on cell cycle, apoptosis, 
and further elucidate d its mode of action. Cell -cycle analysis by [CONTACT_283653]-3117  inhibited the cell cycle in G1 phase and also induc ed 
programmed cell death (apoptosis). The sensitivity  of RX -3117 to a variety of 
antimetabolite -resistant cell lines was tested, and it was  shown that RX-3117  was 
effective in wild -type cells as well as cells with acquired antimetabolite resistance. 
RX-3117 showed a variable resistance pattern in the cell lines tested, with a marked 
cross -resistance for the intrinsically gemcitabine -sensitive  A2780  and gemcitabine -
resistant AG6000  ovarian cancers, a moderate cross -resistance for  CCRF -CEM  acute 
lymphoblastic  T-cell leukemia  cells, and an enhanced sensitivity for gemcitabine -
resistant SW1573/G  non-small cell lung cancer cells.  The effect of RX-3117  on DNA and 
RNA was evaluated; the majority of cell lines investigated showed a concentration -
Protocol Number:  RX -[ADDRESS_346339]:  RX -[ADDRESS_346340], cervical, colon, liver, lung, 
muscle, ovary, pancreas, prostate, renal, and skin .  
Deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is responsible for the methylation of 
cytosine residues on newly synthesized DNA and also reg ulates and maintains 
methylation patterns. DNMT1 is often overexpressed in cancer cells, potentially resulting 
in aberrant methylation patterns  that can further cancer progression . It has been shown  
that RX-[ADDRESS_346341] 
on DNMT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. While the basis for this activity of RX -3117 
on DNMT1 is unclear, t his additional action of RX -3117 could contribute to its an ti-
cancer activity.  
In vivo studies in nude mice evaluated the e ffects of RX-3117  on tumor 
proliferation/growth.  RX-3117  displayed antitumor activity in nude mice implanted with 
human tumors (COLO 205 colorectal adenocarcinoma, HCT116 colorectal carcinoma, 
MV-522 and A549 non -small cell lung carcinoma s, H460 large -cell lung carcinoma, H69 
small -cell lung cancer, Caki -1 renal carcinoma, CTG -0298 and Mia PaCa -2 pancreatic 
carcinoma s, and OVCAR3 ovarian carcinoma).  
The e fficacy of RX-3117  in subcutaneous xenograft models  (Colo-205, H460, H69 and 
CaSki models ), which are m oderately sensitive or resistant to gemcitabine, indicates  that

significant myelotoxicity was observed on canine and rat bone marrow . 
2.2.3  Nonclinical Safety Pharmacology Studies  
Safety pharmacology studies b y the oral route evaluated potential functional effects of 
RX-3117  on the cardiovascular system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], and central nervous system. 
Effects on the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system were also 
evaluated as part of the 28 -day o ral repeated dose toxicity study in dogs.   In vitro,

inhibition, no cardiac cytotoxicity, and had no effect on spontaneous beating in Cor.At ® 
pure embryonic stem cell derived ca rdiomyocytes.  In vivo, RX-3117  did not elicit any 
changes in blood pressure parameters, electrocardiography (ECG) parameters, or heart 
rate in dogs. RX-3117  had no significant effects on respi[INVESTIGATOR_283612]. In 
addition, RX-3117  had no effects on the central or autonomic nervous systems, or on 
peripheral motor and sensory systems in both mice and dogs. Finally, RX-3117  had no 
effects on electroencephalography activity following an intravenous ( IV) dose of 
100 mg/kg in monkeys.

In CD -1 mice, RX-3117  displayed dose -dependent pharmacokinetics upon oral

to 10.3 hours .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 108  In Beagle dogs, linear pharmacokinetic properties were evident following both IV and 
oral administration, at th e dose ranges of 100 to 400 mg/kg and 30 to 300 mg/kg, 
respectively.  The absorption of RX-[ADDRESS_346348], resulting in an early Tmax (0.25 hour 
postdose).   Administration of 10 mg/kg RX-[ADDRESS_346349] absorption of RX-3117  in female dogs relative to solution; although Tmax was 
slightly delayed (0.5 -1 hour postdose), relative exposure was the same.  Oral 
bioavailability was determined to be grea ter than 100%.   The t½ values rang ed from 3 to 
5.35 to 39 hours f ollowing oral administration and 3.25 to 4.7  hours following IV 
administration.  
The pharmacokinetic properties of RX-3117  were investigated in male C ynomolgus 
monkeys following a single bolus  IV administration dose of 2.5 mg/kg (not conducted 
under Good Laboratory Practice [non -GLP] study), or an IV  infusion for 6 minutes at 100 
to 300 mg/kg.  Monkeys were dosed via IV administration since RX-3117  display ed poor 
oral bioavailability (11%) in m onkeys.  Analysis of RX-3117  after IV infusion showed that 
increasing the dose from 2.5  to 35 mg/kg resulted in a supraproportional increase in 
exposure (greater than twice the expected value), suggesting nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics.   However, IV administra tion of RX-3117  between the dose range of 
35 to 300 mg/kg displayed linear kinetics.  RX-3117  was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_283613] (CL) and volume of distribution (V z) after low - and 
moderate -dose IV administration.  The t½ values r anged from 1.28 to 11.25 hours.  
RX-3117  showed low permeability (<  5×10-6 cm/sec) in Caco -[ADDRESS_346350] into 
the blood, as well as from the blood into tissue s, possibly by [CONTACT_283654] (hENT).  
RX-3117  was tested for plasma protein binding in vitro, in mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and 
human plasma, at concentrations of 1 to 500 μM.  No measurable percentage of protein 
binding was obser ved in any of the species and concentrations examined.  
Early nonclinical pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic investigations in dogs and monkeys 
characterized the plasma deaminated metabolite profile of RX-3117 .  Deamination of 
RX-3117  was faster in monkeys t han in dogs (T max= 2.5 and 5 hours).  Relative plasma 
exposure for the deaminated metabolite was higher in monkeys than in dogs (area under 
Protocol Number:  RX -[ADDRESS_346351]:  RX -[ADDRESS_346352] quantifiable 
concentration [AUC 0-last] of metabo lite and AUC from 0 to time extrapolated to infinity 
[AUC 0-∞] of RX-3117  were  56% and 30% in monkeys and dogs, respectively), and the 
observed elimination of the metabolite was slower than the elimination of the drug for 
both species.   Due to its longer t ½, the deaminated metabolite exposure following 
repeated administration equaled or exceeded RX-[ADDRESS_346353] of the parent drug  was 197% and 93%, respectively, 
after 5 daily IV administrations of 35  mg/kg RX-3117  and 4 doses of 150  mg/kg 
administered IV twice weekly.  In dogs, accumulation of the metabolite was less 
pronounced, with an increase of the exposure ratio to around 50% upon repeated 
administration.  
Interspecies comparison of the in vitro metabolism of RX-3117  in mouse, rat, dog, 
monkey, and human liver microsomes revealed that RX-3117  does not undergo 
cytochrome P450  (CYP) -mediated  metabolism in any of these species.  RX-3117  
metabolism was further investigated in human transformed cel l lines.  It was shown that 
RX-3117  was not phosphorylated by [CONTACT_56614] , but by [CONTACT_283655], into an active 
nucleotide form (mono -, bi-, or triphosphorylated RX-3117 ) and further incorporated into 
both RNA and DNA.   It was also shown that RX-3117  deamin ation was cytidine 
deaminas e -mediated, although its extent and rate are relatively very low.  
RX-3117  excretion was studied using 300 mg/kg of 3H-RX-3117  orally administered to 
mice.  RX-3117  excretion was relatively rapid with about 80% of the radioactivi ty 
eliminated during the first 24 hours.   Total recovery following 1 week was 94%, with 48% 
of dose radioactivity excreted in the urine and 46% in the feces.  
When tested in vitro in human liver microsomes, RX-[ADDRESS_346354] or time -dependent inhibition of any of the CYP enzyme s tested, namely CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5.  
When tested in vitro in human transporter -transfected polarized cell monolay er/vesicles, 
RX-3117  did not inhibit any of the transporters studied, namely organic anion transporter 
(OAT)1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, breast cancer resistance protein , 
P-glycoprotein , and bile salt export pump , at clinically relevant concentra tions (up to 
5 mM).  The effect of RX -3117 on CYP induction has not yet been evaluated .

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 108  2.2.5  Nonclinical Toxicology  Studies  
In mice, a single oral administration of RX-3117  at doses up to 1000 mg/kg did not 
induce toxicity signs on the day of treatment or during  a 14-day recovery period, at any 
of the doses tested.  Following daily oral administration of RX-3117  at 180/100 
mg/kg/day (male/female mice), 60 and 30  mg/kg/day (both male and female mice) for up 
to 28  days, mortality occurred at the high dose in male a nd female mice (180  and 100 
mg/kg, respectively) and in the mid -dose female mice (60  mg/kg) .  Consequently , dosing 
of the high -dose groups was terminated early.  Clinical signs were observed mainly in 
high-dose groups and included hunched posture, pi[INVESTIGATOR_283614], decreased activity, 
lethargy, tremors, semi -closed eyes, and cold to touch.  Clinical signs mostly appeared 
just prior to the death or unscheduled sacrifice of the animals.  Marked reductions in 
body weight and food consumption were observed in high -dose groups and to a lesser 
extent in mid -dose groups with complete recovery at the end of the recovery period.  
Hematology investigations showed anemia, thrombocytosis, and leukopenia to be dose 
dependent, with partial recovery at the end of the recovery period. In clinical chemistry, 
reductions in glucose, and elevated globulin and creatine kinase levels were seen.  At 
necropsy, atrophy was seen in the thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow.  
Histopathologic examinations revealed  reductions in the n ormally present 
intracytoplasmic glycogen contents and single -cell necrosis in the liver , sporadic cases 
of vacuolation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_283615], moderate inflammation of the 
intestinal mucosa associated with atrophy of the villi, and sp oradic presence of ulcers in 
the cecum and atrophy of the ovary corpora lutea.  Partial recovery was seen at the end 
of the recovery period.  The dose of 60 mg/kg/day was considered as the severely toxic 
dose (STD).  
In a non -GLP study in mice in which RX-3117 was given orally 3 times a week at 500, 
1000, and 1500 mg/kg  for a total of 5  administrations, a similar pi[INVESTIGATOR_283616], yet at much higher doses as compared with the daily dosing regimen.  
Mortality occurred in the mid - and the high -dose  groups (1000 and 1500  mg/kg, 
respectively).  Clinical signs were observed in the mid - and high -dose groups and 
included pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], hunched posture and decreased activity.  Reduction in body 
weights and food consumption were mainly observed in high -dose  groups.  Hematologic 
changes included significant reductions in reticulocytes and anemia, thrombosis, and 
leukopenia to be dose dependent. The dose of 500 mg/kg/day was considered to be the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  in this study.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 108  In dogs, the main eff ects following a single oral administration of RX-3117  at doses up to 
300 mg/kg were bone marrow toxicity, consisting of significant changes in hematologic 
parameters, and reductions in weights of the thymus and male sexual glands in mid - 
(100 mg/kg) and h igh-dose (300 mg/kg) groups.  Following daily oral administration of 
RX-3117  for up to 28  days at doses of 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg , isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_283617], along with reductions in body weight and food consumption, were seen 
in high -dose groups.  Hematologic changes were noted in high -dose groups, consisting 
of decreases in erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, reticulocytes, and leucocytes and 
elevations in platelets, which were fully recoverable by [CONTACT_283656]. At 
necropsy, thymus weights were reduced in high -dose groups and mid -dose female dogs, 
with complete recovery in 3 of 4 animals.  Thymus atrophy was noted at histopathologic 
examinations in 1 male dog given the high dose.  The changes seen in the thymus were 
potentially secondary, related to stress -associated with the administration of high dose.  
No changes were observed in weights or histopathology of male sexual glands.   The 
dose of 5  mg/kg/day was determined as the highest nonseverely toxic dose (HNSTD) 
while t he dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day was determined as the no -observed -adverse -effect level 
(NOAEL).  
In a non -GLP study in dogs in which RX-3117  was given orally at doses of 15 and 
30 mg/kg [ADDRESS_346357] dose.  Overall, the toxicity profile of RX-3117  in this study 
was similar to that observed during the 28 -day repeated dose toxicity study, yet toxic 
effects were observed at higher doses in the thrice -weekly dosing regimen.  The dose  of 
30 mg/kg/day was considered to be the MTD in this study.  
Intravenous administration of high doses of RX-3117  in dogs and monkeys was 
associated with marked central nervous system toxicity, which was not observed in any 
of the tested species following d osing by [CONTACT_149260].   In dogs, a single IV dose of 400 
mg/kg induced tremors of the head and convulsions 10 hours postdose.  No such signs

RX-3117  was tested in a dedicated electroencephalography study in monkeys, in order 
to set safe dose s and exposure levels based on electroencephalography measurements.  
Following a single IV dose of 100  mg/kg, no effects were noted on 
electroencephalographic activity and no clinical or electrophysiologic findings suggesting 
proconvulsant or seizure liability were observed.  Exposure levels measured at this safe

Hungary.  Subjects  had advanced solid tu mor and had not received any chemotherapy 
for 2 weeks prior to receiving th e study drug.  
The primary study objective was to determine the absolute oral bioavailability of 
RX-3117  from a single dose administered to subjects  with solid tumors.  The secondary  
objectives were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of RX-3117  
administered either orally or IV and to evaluate dose proportionality of 2  single dose 
levels of RX-3117  administered orally.

setting.  The in-patient observation  period was from Study Day [ADDRESS_346362] s completed 
the study.  All 9 subjects  were included in the safety and pharmacokinetic analyses . 
Following oral administration, RX-3117  exposure parameters for the 50 -mg and 100 -mg 
dose levels were not markedly different.  For the respective 50- and 100 -mg doses, the 
mean  Tmax was 2.16  and 2.49 hours , the mean C max was 303 ng/mL and 311 ng/mL , the 
mean AUC 0-∞ was 2440  ng•h/mL and 2986 ng •h/mL , and mean t½ values were 14 hours 
and 21 hours (with the concentration -time profiles after the peak showing an initial 
distribution phase followed by a slower terminal elimination phase ).  After a single IV 
bolus admin istration of 20 mg RX-3117 , plasma concentrations declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], 
resulting in a multiphasic profile with a rapid initial decline followed by a slow terminal 
elimination phase, with mean t ½ of 21 hours.   The calculated absolute oral bioavailability 
(F), based on non -crossover data, was 55.7% for the 50 -mg dose and 33.4% for the 
100-mg dose.   The mean V z calculated was [ADDRESS_346363] results, vital sign measurements, ECG, or physical examination

2.3 Selection of Starting Dose  
The starting dosage of RX-3117  selected for this study is 30  mg/day  administered in 
repeated 4 -week cycles comprising administration of the drug 3 time s per weekly for 
3 weeks with a 1 -week hiatus.  This starting dosage selection is based on the results of

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 108  28-day toxicology studies in both mice and dogs and is in compliance with the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) S9 guideline.  
Repeated oral dose toxicity  studies with RX-3117  were conducted up to 28 days in mice 
and dogs followed by [CONTACT_283657] 28 days.  Dosages evaluated in mice 
were 180/100  mg/kg/day (male/female mice), 60  mg/kg/day and 30  mg/kg/day (both 
male and female mice), which were c onverted into human equivalent doses (HED) of 
540/300 mg/m2, 180 mg/m2, and 90 mg/m2, respectively.  Dosages evaluated in dogs 
were 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg/day with HED s of 20 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, and 100  mg/m2, 
respectively.  
Using  data from rodents, the initial s tarting dose in humans is calculated as 1/10 of the 
HED  that produces severe toxicity in 10% of the animals (STD 10).  The STD 10 in mice 
was determined to be 60 mg/kg, which is converted to an HED of 180 mg/m2; with 
application of the 1/10 safety factor, the starting dose in humans would  be 18  mg/m2.  
For an adult (60  kg) with an average body surface area of 1.6 m2, this calculates to  a 
dose of 28.8 mg/ subject .  
Using  data from nonrodents, the initial starting dose is calculated as 1/6 of the human 
equivalen t of the HNSTD.   In the case of RX-3117 , the HED is calculated according to 
body surface comparison as described by [CONTACT_283658] (2010) .  Thus, the STD 10 of 5 
mg/kg in dogs is conve rted to a HED of 100  mg/m2; with application of the 1/6 safety 
factor, the starting dose based on this species is 16.7  mg/m2.  For an adult (60  kg) with 
an average body surface area of 1.6 m2, this calculates to  a dose of 26.7  mg/subject . 
Therefore, the hu man starting doses of RX-3117  calculated from 28 -day toxicity studies 
in mice and dogs are comparable, at 28.8 or 26.7 mg/ subject , respectively.  Thus an 
appropriate starting dose is [ADDRESS_346365] sensitive tumo r cell line to date,

simulated population PK model was created and then validated with the  clinical 
pharmacokinetic data collected in the current study at 3 times per week dosing  
administration (doses 30 to 2 000 mg 3 times per week ). At each dose level, [ADDRESS_346369] 
dose levels, the clinically measured concentration profiles were gene rally within the 
middle 90% of the simulated profiles and often were close to the median concentration 
line, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a positive visual predictive check of the model. Using the 
population PK model, potential RX -3117 plasma exposures were predicted  for proposed 
5 and 7 times per  week dosing schedules. In the revised dosing schedule  (Table 2) , the 
total weekly doses, total weekly exposures (AUCs), and total cycle doses are initially 
planned not to exceed doses administered previously on a 3 times per  week dosing 
schedule  (Table 1) .  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open -label , single -agent study of RX-3117  administered 
orally to subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors , with a dose expansion at the 
MTD or recomme nded Phase 2 dose  and schedule  followed by a 2 -stage (Simon, 1989)  
Phase 2 study design  in subjects with relapse/refractory pancreatic cancer or advanced  
bladder cancer .  The study consists of a screening period ( up to 14 days ; up to 21 days 
for tumor ima ging assessments ), repeated 28-day treatment cycles  for up to [ADDRESS_346370] dose of 
RX-3117.   Additional cycles of therapy may be provided following discussions with the 
investigator, sponsor and medical monitor.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 108  The drug will be administered orally in repeated 4 -week cycles comprising administration 
of the drug 3  times per weekly , 5 times per week, or daily (e.g., 7 days  per week)  for 
3 weeks with a 1 -week hiatus.  These dosing regimen s and schedules are  supported by 
[CONTACT_105]-clinical toxicology studies performed in the mouse and dog , clinical pharmacokinetic 
data from the current study and pharmacokinetic simulation data .  
In the Phase 1, t he initial starting dose level of RX-3117 will be 30 mg/day.  The dose 
escalation will begin with an accelerated design in single subjects  (Simon et al., 1997) .  
After the occurrence in Cycle 1 of a single ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_346372] 3 + 3 design using a modified 
Fibonacci sequence (see Section 6.2 for details).   
In the Phase 1 portion of the study subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies will 
be enrolled.  During the Phase 1 portion of the study, the maximum toler ated dose 
(MTD) or a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule will be determined and 
the pharmacokinetics of RX -3117 characterized in eligible subjects.  Following 
determination of the MTD or RP2D dose a Phase 1 Dose Expansion will occur.  In the 
Dose Expansion , subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 3 diagnosis groups: relapsed or 
refractory pancreatic, colorectal or advanced  bladder cancers .  In the Phase 2 portion, 
subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 2 diagnosis groups: relapsed or refractory pancreatic or  
bladder cancers .  The Phase 2 part of the study will follow a 2 -stage design  (Simon, 
1989) .  An interim analysis will be conducted when [ADDRESS_346373] stage.

necessary, until the adverse event resolves or stabilizes to an acceptable degree 
(generally to the pretreatment severity grade).  If appropriate, more frequent laboratory 
monitoring may be instituted  until abnormalities have recovered  to the pretreatment 
severities .  Thereafter, RX-3117  may be reinstituted, but the dose  and/or freq uency  of

dose level  and/or frequency  (see Table 1 and Table 2) or as directed by [CONTACT_1034] .  
Subjects who required an intra -cycle dose and/or frequency  reduction , during the current 
cycle  of therapy , should have the dose  and/or frequency  in the next cycle of therapy 
administered at no higher than the highest dose and/or frequency  tolerated in the current 
cycle .  Successive inter-cycle adjustments to progressively lower dose levels and/or 
frequenc ies can be made.   If the subject cannot tolerate RX-3117  at Dose  Level  1 
(30 mg/dose) then the subject s hould be discontinued from RX-3117  therapy.  
Subjects receiving a lower dose and/or frequency  but who the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_283622], may after discussions with the Sponsor, receive a higher 
dose and at more frequent dosing, for which there is already safety data.  
6.6.3  Dose Re -Escalation  
After a dose  and/or frequency  is reduced, the dose and/or frequency  need not be re -
escalated, even if there is minimal or no toxicity with the reduced dose  and/or frequency .  
However, if the subjec t tolerates a reduced dose and/or frequency  of RX-3117  for 
≥ 4 weeks then the RX-3117  dose may be increased to the next higher dose level  and/or 
frequency , at the discretion of the investigator.  Such re -escalation may be particularly 
warranted if further evaluation reveals that the adverse event that led to the dose and/or 
frequency  reduction was not RX-3117 -related.  Successive adjustments to progressively 
higher dose and/or frequency  levels can be made at 4 -week intervals  but the dose 
and/or frequency  must not exceed the highest  dose  and/or frequency  level for which 
there is already Cycle 1 safety data .

The date the subject is withdrawn from study treatment or from the study and the reason 
for discontinuation will be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
When a subject is withdrawn from study treatment or is permanently removed from study 
treatment (regardless of the reason), all of the evaluations required at the end -of-
treatment visit should be performed and any additional evaluations sh ould be completed 
that may be necessary to ensure that the subject is free of untoward effects.  The

Antiemetics are not allowed prior the admin istration of RX -3117 on Cycle 1  Day 1.  
However, antiemetics c an be administered on subsequent treatment days and in 
subsequent cycles, based on the judgment of the treating physician  and local 
institutional practices.  
At the occurrence of drug-related nausea or vomiting of severity Grade   1, it is 
suggested that t he subject receive an oral or transdermal serotonin antagonist ( e.g., 
dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960], palonosetron).  The neurokinin 
receptor antagonist, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], may also be considered.  Other classes of antiemetic 
medications that m ay be employed include dopamine antagonists or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 108  6.8.9  Drugs with Potential for Interactions with RX -3117  
As described in Section 2.2.4 , in vitro studies indicate that RX -3117 does not inhibit drug 
transporters or CYP enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations;  thus, it is not 
expected that RX -[ADDRESS_346438] of RX -3117 on CYP induction has not been evaluated.  
6.8.10  Erythropoietin and Granulocyte Colony -Stimulating Factors  
Use of erythropoietic  agents (e.g., erythropoietin or darbepoetin  alpha ) is not permitted 
during Cycle 1 of therapy.  Thereafter, such agents may be administered for Grade  3 
anemia, but their use in this study is discouraged . 
Granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimula ting factor (GM -CSF) should not be 
administered given the potential for GM -CSF-related inflammatory symptoms.  
Use of granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF)( e.g., filgrastim, PEG -filgrastim, 
lenograstim)  is not allow in Cycle [ADDRESS_346439] ion, etc., may be considered at 
the investigator's discretion

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 108  6.8.11  Immunization  
Due to its potential effects on lymphoid cells, RX -3117 might theoretically impair primary 
or secondary responses to immunization.   For subjects who are at substantial risk of an 
infection ( e.g., influenza) that might be prevented by [CONTACT_15199], consideration should 
be given to providing the vaccine prior to initia tion of study therapy.  
If a vaccine is administered during RX -3117 therapy, vaccination should not be 
performed during Cycle 1 or during any other cycle in a period when the patient is 
experiencing Grade  [ADDRESS_346441] not yet been established, it is 
recommende d that the study drug be stopped  2 days before radiation and re -started 
 2 days after the completion of the course of radiation.  Before treatment occurs, the 
investigator should discuss the method/frequency of radiation administration with the 
sponsor . 
6.8.13  Surgery  or Other Invasive Procedures  
The effects of RX -3117  on coagulation or wound healing  are unknown .  Potential 
RX-3117 myelosuppressive or immunosuppressive effects could enhance the risk of 
peri-procedural bleeding or infection.  
Elective surgical p rocedures (other than placement of IV access devices) should be 
avoided during study drug administration.  However, subjects may undergo necessary 
surgical or invasive procedures for serious intercurrent medical problems; in these 
circumstances, study drug  should be interrupted.   Investigators should use appropriate 
medical judgment in determining whether to resume study drug in the post -procedure 
period.  For subjects resuming study drug, any myelosuppressive effects of the drug 
Protocol Number:  RX -[ADDRESS_346442]:  RX -[ADDRESS_346443] should be clinically stable before

up periods.  
 Any injury or accident occurring during the screening, study drug administration, or 
follow -up periods. If a medical condition is known to  have caused the injury or 
accident (e .g., a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and 
the accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate adverse events.  
 Any abnormality in physiological testing or a physical examination findin g that

or discontinuation unless it is associated with an already reported clinical event. If the 
laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, the syndrome or diagnosis (e .g., 
anemia) not the laboratory result (e .g., decreased hemoglobin) should be recorded.  
 A complication related to pregnancy or termination of a pregn ancy (see Section  9.7.2  
for additional information).  
None of the following events is considered an adverse event:  
 Laboratory abnormalities not requiring clinical intervention or further investigation. 
Such abnormalities will be captured as part of overall laboratory monitoring.  
 A diagnostic, medical or surgical procedure (e .g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth 
extraction, transfusion). However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse e vent. For 
example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period 
should be reported as the adverse event and the resulting appendectomy should be 
recorded in the subject’s medical records and eCRFs.    
 A pre -existing disease o r condition or laboratory abnormality present or detected 
before the initial screening visit and that does not worsen.

9.2 Other Events Requiring Rapid Reporting  
DLTs  are events [toxicities] specifically identified in this protocol that must be reported to 
the Sponsor  or designee in an expedited manner.  Information regarding DLTs should be  
recorded on  a protocol -designated DLT report form and faxed or emailed to the study 
sponsor or designee  within 24 hours of site personnel becoming aware of the event.   
DLTs  may or may not be serious adverse events  as Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected  adverse eve nt is defined as an event that has a nature or severity, or 
specificity that is not consistent  with the applicable investigator brochure or that is 
symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to a known toxicity but differs because 
Protocol Number:  RX -[ADDRESS_346477]:  RX -3117

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 67 of 108  of greater severity  or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator brochure only 
referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism 
and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the 
investigator brochure only listed cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously 
observed and  reported rather than an experience that has not been anticipated based on 
the pharmacological properties of the study drug.   
9.2.[ADDRESS_346478] following initiation of study drug administration . The type of  
question asked should be open -ended, e .g., "Have you had any new health problems?”  
or a similar type of query.  
9.3 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_283665]. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the 
event on the basis of signs, symptoms and/or other clinical information. In such cases, 
the diagnosis should be documented as the adverse event and/or serious adverse event 
and not descr ibed as the individual signs or symptoms. The following information should 
be recorded:  
 Description of the adverse event using concise medical terminology  
 Description as to whether or not the adverse event is serious ( see Section  9.1.2) 
 The start date (dat e of adverse event onset)  
 The stop date (date of adverse event resolution)  
 The severity of the adverse event (see Section  9.4) 
 A description of the potential relatedness of the adverse event to study drug or a 
study procedure (see Section  9.5)

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 68 of 108   The action taken due to the adverse event  
 The outcome of the adverse event  
9.4 Grading of the Severity of an Adverse Event  
The severity  of adverse events will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), Version  4.03 ( available at 
http://ev s.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the highest severity grade attained 
should be reported.   
If a CTCAE  criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life -threatening), or 
Grade 5 (fatal) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. For purposes of 
consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table  4. 
Table  4. Grading of Adverse Event Severity  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
Grade [ADDRESS_346480]’s overall health and well -
being, does not interfere with the subject’s usual function, and is not 
likely to require medical attention.  
Grade [ADDRESS_346481] clinical 
status, and may require medical intervention.  
Grade 3 Severe  Sign or symptom is incapacitating or significantly affects clinical status 
and likely requires medical intervention and/or close follow -up. 
Grade 4  Life-
threatening  Sign or symptom results in a potential threat to life.  
Grade 5  Fatal  Sign or sym ptom results in death.  
 
The distinction between  the seriousness and the severity of an adverse event should be 
noted.  Severe is a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a 
serious reaction.   For example, a headache may be severe  in intensity, but would not be 
classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious events listed in Section 
9.1.2 above.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 108  9.5 Describing Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug and Study 
Procedures  
The relationship  of an adverse event to study  drug should be assessed using clinical 
judgment, describing the event as either unrelated (no) or related (yes) consistent with 
the following definitions:  
 No: Evidence exists that the adverse event had an etiology other than the study 
drug. For serious ad verse events, an alternative causality must be provided (e .g., 
pre-existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  
 Yes:  A temporal relationship exists between the adverse event onset and 
administration of the inve stigational medicinal product that cannot be readily 
explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Furthermore, 
the adverse event appears with some degree of certainty to be related to the 
study drug based on the known therapeutic an d pharmacologic actions or 
adverse event profile of the investigational medicinal product. In case of 
cessation or reduction of the dose, the adverse event abates or resolves. In case 
of interruption and rechallenge, the event reappears upon rechallenge.  
Of note, even in circumstances  when the study drug is given intermittently or is 
interrupted temporarily before the onset of the adverse event, consideration should be 
given as to whether the study drug may have contributed to the event.  
The relationship t o protocol -mandated study procedures (e .g., procedures such as 
venipuncture or performance of an ECG ) should be assessed using the following 
considerations:  
 No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study 
procedure.  
 Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of a protocol -mandated procedure .  
9.6 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
9.6.1  Site Reporting Requirements  
Classification of an event as serious or nonserious ( see Section  9.1.2) determines the

progress notes, autopsy reports, laboratory and 
diagnostic  test results, discharge summaries)  
Within [ADDRESS_346484] information  
Abbreviations:  CRF=case report form, IRB=institutional review board  
 
For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Report Form must  be completed 
in addition to  completing the adverse event portion of the CRF.  The information in the 
adverse event portion of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form(s)  and CRF  must 
match or be reconciled.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent  manner. For example, the same adverse event term should be 
used on both forms.  
Particularly for fatal or life -threatening events, copi[INVESTIGATOR_283638], autopsy reports, 
laboratory and diagnostic test results, discharge summaries, and other relevant 
documents should be e -mailed or faxed when requested  and applicable.  Follow -up 
information to the serious adverse event should be clearly documented as “follow up” in 
the serious adverse event report form and must be faxed or emailed to these same 
parties.   The study sponsor  may request additional information from the investigator to 
ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
The subject’s name, address, and other personal identity information should be 
obscured on any source documents ( e.g., progress notes, nurses’ notes, laboratory and 
diagnostic test  results, discharge summaries) but without losing the traceability of a 
document to the study subject identifiers.   Only the subject’s study number, initials, or 
date of birth are to be provided.

event or death, comment on the relationship to particip ation in the study.  The 
designated study sponsor medical monitor should also indicate whether they concur with 
the details of the report provided by [CONTACT_1704].  
For regulatory reporting purposes, the event is classified as related if any of t he 
investigator or study sponsor medical monitor determines that the event is related to the  
study drug (see Section  9.5).  For reporting purposes, an adverse event will be 
considered expected if the study sponsor determines that the event is expected (see  
Section 9.2).  
The study sponsor a wareness date will be used  in determining adverse event  regula tory 
reporting timelines . The study sponsor a wareness date is defined as the earliest date the 
study sponsor  or an agent ( e.g., a site monitor) becomes aware  of an adverse event.

criteria for overdose prescribed by [CONTACT_760] (see Section  11.7).  In cases of a  
discrepancy in drug accountability, overdose will be established only when it is clear 
that the subject has taken excessive amounts of drug  or the investigator has reason 
to suspect that the subject has taken excessive amounts of drug .

site of the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Neither a pregnancy itself nor an induced elective abortion to terminate the pregnancy 
without medical reasons is consider ed an adverse event; such occurrences should be 
reported on the appropriate pregnancy report forms.  However, if the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event ( i.e., 
spontaneous abortion, induced abortion due  to complications, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted fetus]), the investigator should follow 
the procedures for reporting serious adverse events, i.e., report the event to the sponsor

Additional information  regarding reporting pregnancy outcomes  may be required :  
 Any spontaneous abortion, including miscarriage and missed abortion will be 
reported as a serious adverse event.  
 An induced therapeutic abortion to terminate any pregnancy due to complications or 
other medical reasons will be recorded as a serious adverse event.  The underlying 
medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the adverse  event term.  
 All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_346491] to causali ty, as serious adverse events.  In addition, any infant death after 1 
month that the investigator assesses as related to the in -utero exposure to the study 
drug should also be reported.  
 In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of 
birth ( i.e., there is no required minimum follow -up of a presumably normal infant 
before the Pregnancy Outcome Report CRF can be completed).  
 The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_283669] -abortion laboratory findings suggestive of a congenital anomaly, 
in which case pathologic examination should be requested.

should be reported on the Pregnancy Outcome Report Form within 5 days of the  
conclusion of the pregnancy.   If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has 
been completed, the outcome should be reported directly to the study sponsor .

Section  9.1.2).  If a DLT is also a  serious adverse event, it should be reported both on 
the DLT report form and per the instructions for reporting serious adverse events (see 
Section 9. 6.1). Recording of a DLT in the relevant CRFs will also be required.

10.2 Analysis Conventions  
10.2.1  Analysis Sets  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Full Analysis Set  
The full -analysis set includes all subjects who receive  [ADDRESS_346497] characteristics, study drug treatment 
administration, safety  (including first -cycle DLTs) , overall response rate , and progression 
free survival . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Responding Analysis Set  
The responding analysis set includes subjects in the full -analysis set who ha ve 
measurable tumor , who can be evaluated for tumor response with both baseline and on -
study tumor evaluations, and who achieve a complete response  or partial response . This 
analysis set will be use d in the analyses of time to response and duration of resp onse . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluable Analysis Sets  
The evaluable analysis sets include subjects in the full -analysis set who have baseline 
and on -study measurements to provide interpretable results for specific parameters of 
interest.  
These analysis sets will be used in the a nalyses of RX-3117  plasma pharmacokinetics, 
and changes in biomarkers .  
10.3 Sample Size Considerations

2 or greater adverse even t or the investigator, medical monitor and  sponsor  requesting 
that additional subjects be treated at a dose and/or schedule.   
The Dose Expansion of Phase 1 will enroll approximately 12 subjects at the 
recommended Phase 2 dose or MTD and schedule.  
For the Phase 2 portion of the study, the primary objective is to estimate the antitumor 
activity of RX -3117  in subjects with advanced solid malignancies.   
The maximum number of subjects needed for Phase 2 is approximately 100 (50  per 
solid tumor).   An estimated 20 subjects (10 per indication) will be en rolled in the first 
stage at the recommended Phase [ADDRESS_346500] 4 months and/or 1 objective clinical 
response in a specific tumor indication in order for evaluation of that indication to 
advance to Stage 2.  
In Stage 2, the goal is to further evaluate primary and  secondary endpoints, of efficacy .  
The number of subjects to be enrolled in the second stage will be approximately 80 (40 
per solid tumor indication).  
10.4 Randomization a nd Stratification  
Randomization will not be used in this study.  I n the P hase 2 part of the study, subjects  
will be enrolled in a disease group based on their cancer diagnosis.  No stratification is 
planned for this study.  
10.5 Interim Analysis and Early Stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_283639] 1 are related to the 
review of available data during the dose escalation phase of the study.  The decision to 
escalate to the next dose level  and schedule  will be made after t he evaluation of safety

the 2 major indications enrolled in the Phase 2 portion will be evaluated independently, 
and could be subjec t to enrollment hold by [CONTACT_283673].   
The number of subjects to be enrolled in the second stage will be determined as outlined 
in Section 10.3.   
10.5.1  Data Handling Conventions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Methods  
By-subject listings will be created for important variabl es from each eCRF module. 
Summary tables for continuous variables will contain the following statistics: N (number 
in population), n (number with data), mean, standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) on the mean, median, minimum, and maximum.  Summary tables for categorical 
variables will include: N, n, percentage, and 95% confidence interval s on the 
percentage. Unless otherwise indicated, 95% confidence interval s for binary variables 
will be calculated using the binomial distribution (exact metho d) and will be 2 -sided.  
Data will be described and summarized by [CONTACT_53816], dose level , dose schedule and 
timepoint. As appropriate, changes from baseline to each subsequent timepoint will be 
described and summarized. Similarly, as appropriate, the bes t change from baseline 
during the study will also be described and summarized. Graphical techniques ( e.g.,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 80 of 108  waterfall plots, Kaplan -Meier curves, line plots) may be used when such methods are 
appropriate and informative.  
The baseline value used in each ana lysis will be the last (most recent) pre -treatment 
value. Data from all sites will be pooled for all analyses. Analyses will be based upon the 
observed data unless methods for handling missing data are specified. If there is a 
significant degree of non -normality, analyses may be performed on log -transformed data 
or nonparametric tests may be applied, as appropriate.  
Unless otherwise specified, all analyses will be 2 -sided at the 0.05 level of significance.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Calculation of Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Pharmacok inetic parameters for RX-3117  will be calculated using non -compartmental 
methods. Only plasma concentrations greater than or equal to the validated lower limit of 
quantitation (LLQ) will be used in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Actual blood sampling 
times will be used in all pharmacokinetic analyses. Per -protocol times will be used to 
calculate mean plasma concentrations for graphical displays.  
The C max and T max will be taken directly from the subject’s data. The elimination rate 
constant, z, will be calcu lated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log -linear 
segment of the plasma concentration -time curve. The range of data to be used for each 
subject and treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_283674] a semi -logarithmic plot 
of concentration ve rsus time and will comprise  3 data points along the elimination 
phase. Elimination t ½ will be calculated according to the following equation:  
zt693.0½
 
The AUC to the final sample with a concentration LLQ (AUC 0-t) will be calculated using 
the linear trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity (AUC ) using:

[IP_ADDRESS]  Calculation of Tumor Control Variables  
Tumor control assessments will be based on the standardized RECIST  ver 1.1 , as 
specifically modified for this study (see Appendix C).  Tumor control will be  documented 
at each assessment by [CONTACT_115188] ( e.g., CR, PR, SD, PD) as defined for each 
response parameter, tumor dimension value s, percentage change in tumor dimension 
values from baseline or nadir, date that response is first documented, date that  response 
is confirmed, and date of disease progression.  
For time -to-event endpoints, only events occurring  30 days following the permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment will be considered as events; for subjects with events 
occurring >  30 days fol lowing the permanent discontinuation of study treatment, the data 
will be censored.  The following censoring conventions will be applied:  
 Duration of Response ( DOR ): Data from surviving, non -progressing  subjects will be 
censored at the earliest of the time  of initiation of antitumor treatment other than the 
study treatment or the last time that lack of tumor  progression was objectively 
documented while on study treatment.  
 Progression Free Survival ( PFS): Data from surviving, non -progressing  subjects will 
be censored at the earliest of the time of initiation of antitumor treatment other than 
the study treatment or the last time that lack of tumor  progression was objectively 
documented while on study treatment.

Plasma concentrations and derived pharmacokinetic parameters (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
will be listed and graphs of individual subject concentrations by [CONTACT_283676] -logarithmic axes.  Pharmacokinetic data will be summarized by [CONTACT_283677], dose  level and schedule .  The 
data may be evaluated by [CONTACT_283678], weight, body -mass index, 
age, and cancer type.  
The relationship between the parameters C max, AUC inf, and AUC 0-24 and dose will be 
examined using the power model, i.e., 
P = a  Doseb 
where P represents the parameter and a and b are constants. A value of b of 
approximately 1 indicates linear pharmacokinet ics.  
As appropriate, data regarding plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetics parameters

Prior, concomitant, and post -treatment medications will be coded by [CONTACT_283679] (WHODRUG) dictionary into 
Anatomical -Therapeutic -Chemical classification (ATC) codes.  
Descriptions of prior medication use will be focused on drugs and regimens used as 
treatments for cancer.   As appropriate and if available, information on the sequencing, 
and type of p rior regimens will be collected . 
The type and timing of use of concomitant medications will be listed and summarized. 
Information regarding the typ e and use of specific supportive medications ( e.g., 
antiemetics, antidiarrheals, hematopoietic growth factors, corticosteroids) during study 
treatment will be described.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be listed. The focus of adverse event summariza tion will be on 
treatment -emergent adverse events.  A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as

Adverse events will be classified usi ng MedDRA (http://www.meddramsso.com) with 
descriptio ns by [CONTACT_1196], High -Level Group Term, High -Level Term, 
Preferred Term, and Lower -Level Term. The severity of adverse events will be graded 
by [CONTACT_178993],  Version  4.03 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_201 0-06-

for a specific type of adverse event, the grade corresponding to the appropriate adjective 
will be used by [CONTACT_283680]: 
Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life threatening), or 
Grade 5 (fatal). The relationship of the adverse event to the study drug will be 
categorized as related or unrelated.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will  be summarized. Summary tables will be

 Dose -limiting adverse events occurring in Cycle 1 of therapy  
 Study -drug-related adverse eve nts 
 Adverse events that are Grade  3 in severity  
 Adverse events leading to study drug interruption and/or dose modification  
 Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation  
 Serious adverse events (with categorization of the primary reason that the 
adverse event is considered serious, e.g., death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], etc)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Evaluations  
All laboratory data will be listed. Summaries of laboratory data will be based on observed 
data and will be reported using conventional units.  The focus of laborat ory data 
summarization will be on treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities.  A treatment -
emergent laboratory abnormality is defined as an abnormality that, compared to 
baseline, worsens by  [ADDRESS_346514] dose of study treatment.  If baseline data are missing, then any 
graded abnormality ( i.e., an abnormality that is Grade  1 in severit y) will be considered

number of subjects by [CONTACT_283682].  For 
parameters for whic h a CTCAE scale does not exist, the frequency of subjects with 
values below, within, and above the normal ranges will be summarized.  Subjects will be 
characterized only once for a given assay, based on their worst severity grade observed 
during a period o f interest ( e.g., during the study or from baseline to a particular visit).  
Shift tables for hematology and serum biochemistry will also be presented by [CONTACT_283683].  For parameters for which a 
CTCAE s cale does not exist, shift tables will be presented showing change in results 
from baseline (normal, low and high [or abnormal]) to each visit (normal, low and high [or 
abnormal]).  Tables will be prepared to show frequencies adjusted for baseline values; 
for this frequency, subjects with the same or worse toxicity grade at baseline are not 
considered.  
Separate listings and summaries will be prepared for laboratory abnormalities that are 
Grade   3 in severity.

 QTc interval increases from baseline by >  30 m sec and ≤  60 msec  
 QTc interval increases from baseline by >  60 msec  
QTc data will be presented in shift tables consistent with these categories.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Oxygen Saturation Values  
All oxygen saturation data will be listed.  Summaries of oxygen saturation data will b e 
based on observed data and will be reported as percent ( %) saturation.  Data and 
changes from baseline will be summarized.  Summary tables will be presented for 
values below 92% and for declines from baseline of  5% to show the number of 
subjects with c orresponding percentages.  Subjects will be characterized only once for 
each of these categorizations, based on their lowest value observed during a period of 
interest ( e.g., during the study or from baseline to a particular visit).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Categorical Endpoints  
As appropriate depending up the level of activity and the numbers of patients with 
individual tumor types that are accrued, ORR, CR and PR rates may be determined and 
described. In the analyses of ORR, subjects who do not have sufficient baseline or on -

Thus, if the true underlying proporti on of DLT is low ( e.g.,  10% at the current dose 
level, there is a high probability (  0.91) of dose escalation to the next dose level. 
Conversely, if the true underlying proportion of DLT is high ( e.g.,  60%) at the current 
dose level, there is a low pr obability (  0.08) of escalation to the next dose level.  
The trial employs the standard NCI definition of MTD (starting dose associated with DLT

13.5 Publication Policy  
To coordinate dissemination of data from this study, the s ponsor encourages the 
formation of a publication committee consisting of several principal investigators and 
appropriate sponsor staff.  The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance 
from other investigators and the s ponsor staff as appropriate.  Membership on the 
committee (both for investigators and the s ponsor ’s staff) does not guarantee 
authorship —the criteria described below should be met for every publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
(International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, 2005), which states:  
 Authorship credit should be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception 
and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting 
the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content; (3) final 
approval of the version to be published.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 2, 
and 3.  
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should 
identify the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These 
individuals should fu lly meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
 All persons designated as authors should qualify for authorship, and all those  
who qualify should be listed.

(Eisenhauer et al, 2009 ) 
 Definitions  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized measurable or 
non-measurable as follows:  
- Measurable Disease  - the presence of at least one measurabl e lesion. If 
the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature 
should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
- Measurable Lesions  - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension with longest diameter  [ADDRESS_346572] X -ray or  [ADDRESS_346573] scan.  
- Non-measurable Lesions  - all other lesions, including small lesions 
(longest diameter <[ADDRESS_346574] X -ray or ≥ 10 but <  [ADDRESS_346575] 
scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardi al 
effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic 
lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
[CONTACT_15218]; and.  
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler  
or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible 
to the beginning of treatment and never more than 28 days before study day 1.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identi fied and reported lesion throughout the trial.  
 Clinical lesions ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes ) will only be 
considered measurable target lesions when they ≥ 15 mm . For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a  ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 Lymph nodes that are < 10 mm will be considered non -pathological  
 
Methods of Measurement  
 CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to 
measure target lesions selected fo r response assessment. Conventional CT and 
MRI should be performed with cuts no greater than [ADDRESS_346576], abdomen and pelvis. Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specif ic protocols.  
 When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, 
ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph 
nodes, subcutaneou s lesions and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be 
useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually 
assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
 The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has 
not yet be en fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require

in some centers. Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should b e restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers. 
However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained.  
 Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response and 
complete response in rare cases ( e.g., after treatment to differentiate between 
residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions in tumor types such as 
germ cell tumors).  
 
Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” Lesions  
 All measurable lesion s up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured during screening.   
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions  with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements 
(either by [CONTACT_14217]).   
 A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseli ne sum LD will be used as reference 
by [CONTACT_62441].  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded during screening. Measurements of these lesions 
are not require d, but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughout the study.  
 
Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
* Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions .  Any pathologic 
lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) mush ha ve 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm  
* Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters  of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum 
diameters  
* Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters  of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum 
diameters  recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions .  In addition the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
Appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression.  
* Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, 
taking as reference the smallest sum diame ters while 
on study.

Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
* Complete Response (CR):  Disappe arance of all non -target lesions.  All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (i.e., < 10 mm 
short axis)  
* Incomplete Response/          
Stable Disease (SD):   Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)  
* Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions

Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as r eference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the subject 's 
best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria

 Subjects  with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progres sion at that time should 
be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made 
to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 108 of 108   In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual dise ase from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this 
determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status.  
 
Confirmation  
 The main goal of  confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating 
the response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not 
feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of such studies that 
the responses are not confirmed.  
 To be assigned a status of partial response or complete response, changes in 
tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_283694].   
 In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria no 
earlier than 49 days after the date of enrollment/randomization during the study.    
 
Duration of Overall Response  
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for complete response or partial response (whichever status is recorded 
first) u ntil the first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively 
documented, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
 SD is measured from the start of th e treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started.

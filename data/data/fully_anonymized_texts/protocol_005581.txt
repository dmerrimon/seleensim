PI: [INVESTIGATOR_506040], MD  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Specific Aims  
 To determine onset -, maintenance -, and offset -effect of vorapaxar on thrombin generation 
kinetics (clotting time, thrombin generation, platelet -fibrin clot strength, and clot lysis) in 
antiplatelet naïve patients and patients on mono and dual antiplatelet therapy.  
 To determine onset -, maintenance -, and offset -effect of vorapaxar on platelet reactivity 
induced by [CONTACT_123962], collagen, arachidonic acid, and SFLLRN.  
 To determine the effect of vorapaxar  on plasma platelet/endothelial and inflammatory 
biomarkers in a ntiplatelet naïve patients and patients on mono and dual antiplatelet therapy.  
 
Hypothesis  
 Vorapaxar will reduce TIP -FCS, clot generation kinetics, and plasma biomarkers associated 
with haemostasis  and inflammation in patients on standard of care antiplatelet regimens.  
 Vorapaxar effects will be more marked in patients with high TIP -FCS, a risk factor for post -
PCI ischemic events.  
1.2 Background and Significance  
The occurrence of coronary arterial thr ombotic events during acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and 
percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) are critically dependent on reactive platelets. Antiplatelet 
therapy plays a central role in preventing stent thrombosis and recurrent myocardial infarction in these 
high risk patients. Platelet activation involves multiple signaling pathways activated by [CONTACT_49690], 
thromboxane A 2, adenosine diphosphate  (ADP) and collagen that interact with specific receptors. 
Simultaneous and optimal blockade of these pathways  is essential to ensure effective inhibition of 
platelet function and attenuation of thrombotic events. However, it remains unclear which pathway is 
central to the generation of thrombotic events in an individual patient. Emerging data suggests that 
activa tion of the protease -activated receptors (PARs) by [CONTACT_506068] -dependent thrombin 
generation may be patient specific. Evidence for this concept is present in the significant residual risk 
(~10%) present in high risk patients treated with potent P 2Y12 blockers and ASA . 
Translational antiplatelet therapy studies thus far have largely focused on the measurement of platelet 
aggregation and agglutination to fibrinogen -coated beads in anticoagulated blood. These studies 
ignore the characteristics of pla telet-fibrin clot formation as a potential contributor to the development 
of adverse events (i.e. no study of platelet -fibrin interactions). In addition to platelet function, 
thrombin mediated platelet -fibrin clot characteristics may play an important role  in the development 
of ischemic events and stent restenosis.  In support of this hypothesis, the POST -STENTING study 
clearly demonstrated  that studying platelet function in isolation may have an important limitation in 
predicting ischemic events as well as determining effective strategies to reduce recurrent adverse 
events . In the latter study , we found that high platelet reactivity was a comparatively poor indicator of 
ischemic events following stenting , relative to measurements of platelet -fibrin clot char acteristics.  
Adverse events were more or less equally distributed in the middle two quartiles of post -treatment 
platelet aggregation. Most importantly, thrombin -induced maximum platelet -clot strength (TIP -FCS) 
measured at discharge was the most powerful p redictor of [ADDRESS_652899] -stenting ischemic events 
with a sensitivity of 74%, specificity of 89% , and odds ratio 22.6 ( 1st quartile vs. 4th quartile). In the 
 
VORAPAXAR                                                                                                                                                         IHV 
 
Vorapaxar Protocol Version 2.0 Page 4 of 35 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_506040], MD  latter study, 74% of patients with ischemic events had high TIP -FCS (>72 mm, upper quartile value ). 
These results indicate that platelet -fibrin clot strength may play important roles in the development of 
adverse ischemic events. Those  subjects  who form the most robust platelet -fibrin clots carry the  
greatest risk for recurrent thrombotic event occurr ence. Of critical importance, these results also 
indicate that current long term antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_506042]. Novel, longer -term treatment strategies directed at reducing thrombin function in 
selected  patients may have significant impact in reducing adverse events.  
Thrombin potently activates platelets through the protease -activated receptor (PAR -1). PAR -[ADDRESS_652900] suffered ACS. Vorapa xar 
is a novel antiplatelet agent that selectively inhibits the cellular actions of thrombin through 
antagonism of PAR -1. In the TRA 2P trial, in patients with a history of heart attack or with peripheral 
arterial disease ( PAD ) who had no history of stroke  or transient ischemic attack (TIA), vorapaxar 
added to standard of care was associated with a significant 17 percent relative risk reduction over the 
three years in the combined events of cardiovascular (CV) death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, 
and urgent coronary revascularization (UCR) [event rate 10.1 percent vs. 11.8 percent for placebo]. 
For the key secondary composite efficacy endpoint of CV death, MI , and stroke alone, vorapaxar 
produced a significant 20 percent relative risk reduction in thes e patients [7.9 percent vs. 9.5 percent 
for placebo].  Based on these results, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved 
Zontivity (vorapaxar) to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death for secondary 
prevention in pat ients with a history of MI and peripheral vascular disease.  
Currently, there are no data available regarding the effect of vorapaxar on clot generation kinetics or 
TIP-FCS when added to standard of care antiplatelet regimens. Potential reduction of TIP -FCS and 
clot generation kinetics by [CONTACT_506069].

4 STUDY METHODS  
4.1 Reactive Hyperemia -Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (RH -PAT)  
Noninvasive flow -mediated vasodilation (FMD) is a widely used me thod to assess endothelial 
function, but its technical difficulty and problems remain obstacles for use in clinical practice. 
Reactive hyperemia -peripheral arterial tonometry (RH -PAT) was developed as a simpler and more 
reproducible method. Endothelial fun ction will be assessed using the ENDOPAT system (Itamar 
Medical Ltd) at pre -dose (Visit 2) and after 3 -4 weeks of maintenance therapy (Visit 4).  
4.2 Blood and Urine Sampling  
Phlebotomy sites will be carefully chosen to minimize risk  and the blood will be coll ected into 
Vacutainer® tubes (Becton -Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,  NJ). After discarding the first 2 -3mL of free 
flowing blood, the tubes will be filled to capacity and gently inverted 3 to 5 times to ensure 
complete mixing of the anticoagulant. Tubes containing 3.2% trisodium citrate (n=2) will be used 
for light transmission aggregation, Calibrated Automated Thrombogram and for platelet/ endothelial 
and inflammatory biomarker assays.  One 17 USP/mL lithium heparin tube will be  used for TEG -6S 
PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_124365] .  
4.[ADDRESS_652913], a disposable CORA Cartridge is inserted into the instrument. Blood or WQC 
material is added to an entry port on the cartridge a nd drawn into the cartridge under instrument 
control. Once in the disposable, the sample is automatically metered into as many as four separate 
analysis channels, depending upon the assay being performed. Reconstitution of reagents dried 
within the cartrid ge is accomplished by [CONTACT_506075], under the control 
of microfluidic valves and bellows within the cartridge. After each sample has been mixed with 
reagent, Cora Hemostasis Analyzer System (Cora®) will be used to assess qualitat ive and 
quantitative  assessment of the hemostasis . Two cartridges will be used in the study.  
Citrated Multi -Channel cartridge  is used to measure hemostasis including thrombin generation

4.8 Study Treatment/Intervention -  
This phase IV, open label, pharmacodynamic investigation will be conducted in patients between 
18-75 years of age with multiple coronary artery disease risk  factors (antiplatelet naïve patients) and 
patients with prior MI or P AD on antiplatelet therapy (Figure 1). Informed consent will be obtained 
from subjects meeting the inclusion criteria before the initiation of any study -specific procedures. 
Subjects will be grouped according to their current antiplatelet regimen. Subjects with 
cardiovascular risk factors not on antiplatelet therapy will be included in either G roup 1  or 2. 
Patients on ASA  alone will be included in Group 3 and patients on dual antiplatelet  therapy will be 
in Group 4.  
• Group 1  (control group) : vorapaxar 2.08mg orally  once daily  
• Group 2: clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] 75mg orally once daily + vorapaxar 2.08mg orally once daily

4.9 Consent  
Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required 
by [CONTACT_6617]), IRB/IEC/REB -approved informed consent,  If the subject is capable of doing 
so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_24491] a separate assent form.  Informed consent  must be obtained before conducting any 
study -specific procedures (i.e., all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of 
obtaining informed consent should be documented in the subject source documents.  
5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS/DATA ANALY SIS  
5.1 Sample Size   
This is an exploratory study; we assume that a sample size of 25 qualified subjects (see study 
schematic) in each group is sufficient to assess the difference in platelet inhibitory effect of  
vorapaxar 2.08 mg, administered alone or in addition to an antiplatelet agent (clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  75mg), 
and/or  acetylsalicylic acid  81mg.  
5.2 Primary and Secondary Analysis  
5.2.1 Primary Analysis  
The primary endpoint  measure s are a change in platelet -fibrin clot genera tion kinetics by 
[CONTACT_195754] (R, TIP -FCS, TG) and thrombin generation kinetics ( Lag time, peak thrombin 
production, time to peak thro mbin generation, and endogenous  thrombin potential ) as measured by  
[CONTACT_506080] (3 -4 weeks vorapaxar treatment) 
compared to pre -dose within and between each treatment group.   
5.2.2 Secondary Analysis  
Secondary Analysis endpoint measures are a change in:  
 Platelet -fibrin clot generation kinetics by [CONTACT_506081] (R, TIP -FCS, TG ) at onset and 
offset vorapaxar treatment compared to pre -dose within and between each treatment group.  
 Thrombin generation kinetics (Lag time, peak thrombin production, time to peak thrombin 
generation , and endogenous thro mbin potential) as measured by c alibrated automated 
thrombogram  during onset and offset of vorapaxar treatment  compared to pre -dose within  and 
between each treatment group.   
 5µM ADP -, 15µM SFLLRN  (TRAP) -and 4µg/ml collagen - induced maximal and final

6 Statistical calculations  
Statistical calculations will be carried out using SAS® for Windows, version 9.3 or later  (Cary, NC) . 
Within group analyses of change scores (pre and post vorapaxar) will be performed using a paired t -
test, or the Wilcoxon signed ranks test if the change scores are sufficiently non -normal. The Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -
Wilk test will be used to determine if the change sco res are non -normal. A calculated P -value < 0.[ADDRESS_652915] of 1996 (HIPAA).   Each 
subject screened and enrolled will be as signed a subject identification number (ID) and a list of 
subjects with their corresponding subject ID will be maintained separately from collected data. 
Physical CRFs will be stored in the research site in a locked office and electronic subject data will 
be locked in a password protected file on a secure internet server, accessed only by [CONTACT_506084].   
7.2 Records Retention  
The Investigator will maintain the records of drug disposition, final CRFs (CDROM copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]),

8.8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.8.1 Adverse Event (AE) Definitions   
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a  patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product which does  not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An a dverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(e.g., including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality (i.e., whether or not it is considered to be 
drug-related). This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in 
severity or frequency since the administration of the study treatment/intervention . 
A suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a r easonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
An adverse reaction means any adverse eve nt caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of 
all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not

An SAE is defined as an event that : 
 is fatal or life -threatening;  
 results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
 routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration i n condition  
 elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
 treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
 social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s 
general condition  
 is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the subjec t or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

The descriptions and grading scales found in NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4. [ADDRESS_652931] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded (http://ctep.cancer.gov). This version of CTCAE is MedDRA v12.0 (Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Termino logy) compatible at the AE term level where each 
CTCAE term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term). Each AE term is associated with a 5 -point 
severity scale.  Bleeding will be documented using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 
(BARC) standard definitio n (Appendix A) (Mehran et al., 2011).  
8.8.4 Procedures for Recording and Reporting of A dverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All AEs will be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_506059]. For 
both serious and non -serious AEs, the investigator has the primary  responsibility for AE 
identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution to the study 
treatment/intervention. The sponsor will consider the investigator’s view when assessing the 
safety of the drug and determining whether to report expe ditiously to the FDA and other 
regulatory agencies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs occurring  from the start of study medication administration through the last day of study 
participation must be recorded on the AE CRF with the following information:  
 The intensity grade  (grade 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5; see CTCAE v4.03 grading)  
 The relationship to the s tudy drug(s)

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_506040], MD   Attribution: An assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical 
intervention (i.e., study drug administration). After naming and grading the event, the 
clinical investigator must assign an attribution to the AE using the following attribution 
categories:  
 
RELATIONSHIP  ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION

 Occurrence (known risks for study drug/s, underlying illness or population)  
o Expected  
o Unexpected  
 Other contributing causes  
 Action taken with study drug  
 Any other actions in response to event  
 Outcome  
o Death related to AE  
o Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
o Not recovered/resolved

o Unknown  
 Whether it constitute s a serious adverse event (SAE)  
8.8.[ADDRESS_652932], or other assessments. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study drug are considered AEs only if they 
worsen after starting the study drug. Abnormal laborator y values or test results constitute AEs 
only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require 
therapy. Abnormal values that constitute a SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of 
study drug must be repo rted and recorded as an AE. Adverse event collection will commence 
when the subject starts taking study medication.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_506040], MD  All AEs s hould be treated appropriately and managed as according to standard of care, at the 
discretion of the inve stigator. The action taken to treat the AE should be recorded on the AE CRF. 
A detected AE should be followed until its resolution or until the subject completes the study. 
Assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any c hanges in 
severity, relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Treatment for Bleeding Events   
Bleeding will be documented using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 
standard definition (Appendix A)  (Mehran et al., 2011). Bleeding events should be treated 
according to standard clinical practice, depending upon the location and severity of the bleed. 
Withholding vorapaxar for a brief period will not be useful in managing an acute bleeding 
event becaus e of its long half -life. There is no known treatment to reverse the antiplatelet 
effect of vorapaxar .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment for Allergic Reactions  
Subjects will be observed for signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction while taking study 
drug/s and managed with appropriate therapy. The investigator may use his discretion in 
determining the regimen to be used according to standard clinical practice and tailored to the 
specific clinical situation (i.e., symptoms and severity of the reaction and responsiveness). Any  
occurrence of allergy signs and symptoms is cause for discontinuation of study treatment/s.

signs informed consent and until 4 weeks (28 days) after the subject has stopped study 
participation must be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_411715] [ADDRESS_652934] continu ed or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in study drug/s Package Insert (new occurrence) and is  
thought to be related to the Zontivity (vorapaxar), the investigator may urgently require further 
information from the i nvestigator for Health Authority reporting. MERCK or designee may need

located in the [LOCATION_002].  
PHASE OF 
DEVELOPMENT  Phase 3.  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objective  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oliceridine in patients 
with moderate to severe  acute pain for which parenter al opi[INVESTIGATOR_882929].  
 
Secondary objective  
 To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of oliceridine . 
STUDY DESIGN AND 
PROCEDURES  This phase 3, open -label, safety study in surgical and medical 
patients will be conducted in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882930], ambulatory surg ical care centers , and emergency 
departments  (EDs) . Patients recruited in EDs may continue  
oliceridine treatment if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882931] . 
Representative  surgeries include orthopedic (eg, total hip 
replacement, total knee replacement, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), abdominal (eg, upper  
or lower  abdominal, perineal), gynecologic (eg, total abdominal 
hysterectomy), vascular, soft tissue, and surgical procedural pain.  
Representativ e medical conditions include acute pancreatitis, acute 
exacerbation of existing noncancerous chronic pain, 
musculoskeletal pain, sickle -cell disease, inflammatory orofacial

confound the evaluation of oliceridine are excluded, such as acute 
pain without a specific etiology , undifferentiated acute a bdominal 
pain, acute breakthrough pain in palliative “end of life” care, and 
pain a ssociated with advanced cancer (somatic, visceral, or 
neuropathic)  or with concurrent use of chemotherapeutic  or 
biologic  agents  for the treatment of cancer . 
Representative ED conditions include visceral pain ( eg, renal colic, 
upper abdominal pain, abdomin al pelvic pain); nonvisceral pain 
(eg, traumatic and atraumatic acute musculoskeletal pain, chest 
wall pain, burns, orofacial pain/headache, cutaneous  and soft tissue 
pain); procedural analgesia (eg, reduction of orthopedic fractures 
and dislocations, absc ess incision and drainage); acute painful 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_80799] a medical condition (eg, sickle cell painful 
vaso-occlusive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ). Oliceridine  will not be used to 
intentionally suppress a patient’s level of consciousness (procedural 
sedation and anal gesia  as defined by [CONTACT_882970] [ACEP]).  
The study has four phases: a screening/baseline phase, a treatment 
phase (consisting of a predose period and a dosing period), an 
end-of-treatment phase, and a follow -up phase.  
Scree ning/baseline phase  
Written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol -
related activities are conducted. All screening procedures will be 
completed within [ADDRESS_1235329] of care assessments (eg , chemistry, hematology, urine or 
serum pregnancy test , urine  or serum toxicology screen, 
electrocardiogram ( ECG )) obtained before informed consent may 
be used as study data  if protocol specifications and timeframes are 
met. 
When screening and baseline proc edures are anticipated to occur 
within 48 hours of each other, they may be executed as a single 
procedure, unless the clinical condition of the patient has 
significantly changed since screening.  
Adverse events ( AEs) occurring from time of informed consent to 
the follow -up phase will be recorded in source and will also be

Adverse Events ( SAEs ) occurring from time of informed consent to 
the follow -up phase or [ADDRESS_1235330] dose of oliceridine 
(whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and eCRF ; 
ongoing SAEs after this time frame will be followed until the 
investigator, medical m onitor, and sponsor agree that the SAE is 
satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by [CONTACT_882971], regardless of the time of onset after treatment, 
should be reported . 
Prior medications taken or administered within the [ADDRESS_1235331] dose of oliceridine  was

oliceridine . 
The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by [CONTACT_882972][INVESTIGATOR_2538] . In current practice , 
parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882932] -needed for up to several days . 
Although preclinical toxicology studies support intravenous ( IV) 
administration of oliceridine  for up to 14 days, it is unlikely that 
patients will receive oliceridine for that duration in the context of 
this study.  
Predose period  
Before dosi ng with oliceridine , vital signs (blood pressure, heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ), oxygen saturation , and somnolence/sedation 
will be measured . Somnolence/sedation will b e measured using the 
Moline -Roberts Pharmacologic Sedation Scale  (MRPSS) . During 
the pre dose period, an additional, post -surgical ECG will be 
performed only in surgical patients.  Prior medications and 
AEs/SAEs will be recorded . 
Pain intensity  will be measured using a 0-10 point numeric pain 
rating scale (NPRS).  
Predose period procedures will occur within 30 minutes before the

During  dosing with oliceridine , vital signs , oxygen saturation , and 
somnolence/sedation will be measured  at any and all times during 
the dosing period consistent with individual patient need and 
institutional standards of care  for a patient receiving a parenteral

performed at this time . 
Within  1 hour after completion of the treatment phase,  vital signs, 
oxygen saturation , and somnolence/sedation will be measured, and 
concomitant medications and A Es/SAEs will be recorded.  
Within 3 hours after completion of the treatment phase , blood will

severe acute pain for which parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882934] , 
inclusion of patients that would unduly increase patient risk or 
confound the evaluation of olice ridine’s safety and tolerability  is 
not acceptable. The state d exclusion criteria are not exhaustive and 
prudent clinical judgment must also be applied.

Confidential  Page 10 of 67 STUDY DRUG  Oliceridine  will be administered as-needed (PRN) via the IV route. 
Depending on the clinical considerations for which parenteral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_882934] (eg , anticipated duration of therapy, 
clinical site /setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using 
clinician -administer ed bolus dosing or PCA dosing. A patient  may 
receive both methods of administration.  
As in current practice, patient need, analgesic efficacy , and adverse 
responses will guide oliceridine  use. Consistent with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_882935], oliceridine  should not be 
administered on a fixed, around -the-clock dosing schedule.  
The oliceridine dosing regimen should be initiated for each patient 
individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, 
patient response and prior analgesic treatment experience.  
Individually titrate oliceridine to a dose that provides adequate 
analgesia and minimizes AEs. Continually reevaluate patients 
receiving oliceridine to assess the ma intenance of pain control  and 
the relative incidence of AEs.  
Clinician -administered bolus dosing  
For clinician -administered bolus dosing, the oliceridine initial dose 
is 1 mg to 2 mg. If clinically indicated, a 1 mg supplemental dose 
may be administered as  early as 15 minutes after the initial dose. 
Subsequent doses are 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours PRN based on 
individual patient need and previous response to oliceridine.  
In settings where rapid analgesia is targeted (e.g., ED or post -
anesthesia care unit ( PACU)), the oliceridine initial dose is [ADDRESS_1235339] of a loading 
dose, a demand dose, and a lockout interval without a continuous 
baseline infusion.

 Loading dose: 1.5 mg.  
 Demand dose: 0.5 mg.  
 Lock out interval: 6 minutes.  
If clinically indicated, throughout the treatment phase, a 1 mg 
supplemental dose may be administered PRN, taking into account 
the patient's utilization of PCA demand doses, individual patient 
need and previous response to olicerid ine. 
DURATION OF 
TREATMENT  The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by [CONTACT_882972][INVESTIGATOR_2538]. In current practice,  
parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882932] -needed for up to several days.  
Although preclinical toxicology studies support IV administration 
of oliceridine  for up to 14 days , it is unlikely that patients will 
receive oliceridine  for that duration in the context of this study.

MEDICA TIONS  Concomitant non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_416063]. If a concomitant 
parenteral or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882936], oliceridine  treatment will cease, and the patient will be

follow -up phase procedures as scheduled.  
Unless specifically prohibited, other medications are permitted, 
including common treatments of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse effects (eg, 
antiemetics, antacids, stool laxatives) and medications used to  treat 
underlying medical conditions .

Patients receiving  medications known to inhibit the CYP2D6 
enzyme or  potent cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) inhibitors may 
require less frequent dosing of oliceridine . Given that oliceridine  is 
administered PRN , differential dosing instructions are not required 
for these patients.  
MAIN PARAMETERS 
OF SAFETY  AND 
TOLERABILITY  The safety and tolerability of oliceridine  will be measured as the 
incidence of self -reported or observed A Es, including those related 
to vital sign measurements, oxygen saturation measurements , 
somnolence/sedation scores , physical examination findings , and 
clinical laboratory assessments.  
MAIN PARAMETERS 
OF EFFICACY  Analgesic effi cacy will be measured using NPRS at the following 
time points:  
 During the predose  period.  
 30 minutes +/-[ADDRESS_1235340] dose of oliceridine . 
 At any and all times during the dosing period consistent with 
individual patient need and institutional standards of care  for a 
patien t receiving a parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] .

1.1 Background  
Inadequately treated pain has significant short - and long -term consequences, including prolonged 
emergency  department  stays, psychological disturbances, and dissatisfaction with medical care. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_882941], fentanyl, and hydromorphone are mainstays of acute pain 
management; however, their use is hampered by [CONTACT_10070] -known adverse events (AEs) , such as 
respi [INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea, vomiting, and sedation  (Lubawski, 2008 ) (Philip , 2002 ). 
Ultimately , the unmet medical need in acute pain therapy is an increased level of efficacy with 
acceptable tolerability.  
Beta-arrestin knock -out animals treated with morphine were shown to experience improved 
analgesic efficacy, less respi[INVESTIGATOR_882942] , compared with  wild-type 
animals  (Bohn, 1999 ) (Raehal, 2005 ). This led to the hypothesis that analgesia and AEs are 
mediated by [CONTACT_882976] μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_882943] a selective 
μ-opi[INVESTIGATOR_882944] G protein signaling without stimulating β -arrestin 
recruitment could be a better analgesic.  
Oliceridine  selectively binds to the μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_306458] r with high affinity; however, oliceridine  is a 
G protein biased ligand at the μ -opi[INVESTIGATOR_882945] G protein signaling without 
stimulating β -arrestin recruitment. In preclinical species, this biased signaling profile has led to 
potent a nalgesic efficacy , with less respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], slowing of gastrointestinal motility, 
and sedation, compared with morphine.  
To date, oliceridine  has been evaluated in phase [ADDRESS_1235349] received single intravenous ( IV) infusions of oliceridine  (0.15 mg to 7 mg), and 
[ADDRESS_1235350] received multiple IV infusions  (<=4.5 mg every 6 hours; 4 mg every 
4 hours)  in phase [ADDRESS_1235351] received IV infusions of oliceridine  (0.5 mg to 4 mg) in two phase  [ADDRESS_1235352] acebo - and active -controlled, 
2-stage, adaptive -design , phase 2  study  (Viscusi, 2016 ). A total of 339 subjects received 
oliceridine  (0.5 mg to 4 mg every 3  or 4 hours ), morphine  (4 mg every 4 hours) , or placebo. The 
oliceridine  dosing frequency of every [ADDRESS_1235353] stage of the 
study; thus, the frequency  was shifted to every 3 hours in  the second stage . Oliceridine  2 mg

4 mg (-1.3, P=0.0023) administered every 4 hours produced analgesic efficacy , as measured by 
[CONTACT_5586]-weighted average change from baseline in numeric rating scale ( NRS ) pain intensity score s 
over 48 hours , compare d with placebo. In a pre -specified secondary analysis , oliceridine  3 mg 
resulted in significant improvement ( P=0.01 4) in NRS scores over [ADDRESS_1235354] dose , compared with placebo ( P<0.0001) and morphine ( P=0.0005  and 
P<0.001, respectively). The majority of subjects rece iving oliceridine  >=[ADDRESS_1235355] frequently reported AEs following treatment 
with oliceridine  were nausea, dizziness, headache, and vomiting. AEs and their severity were 
generally dose related.  
Oliceridine  was evaluated for the treatment of moderate  to severe acute pain following 
abdominoplasty  in a double -blind, randomized, placebo - and active -controlled, phase 2 study.  
Study treatments were delivered by a patient -controlled analgesia  (PCA ) regimen, consisting  of a 
loading dose, deman d dose, and a lockout -interval . For the first half of the study, the oliceridine  
regimen was a 1.5  mg loading dose ( as two 0.75 mg  doses separated by 10 minutes ), 0.1  mg 
demand dose s, and a 6 -minute lockout interval. The morphine regimen was a 4  mg loading dose 
(as two 2 mg doses separated by 10 minutes ), [ADDRESS_1235356] the oliceridine  PCA regimen after review of existing 
efficacy, safety and tolerability, and utilization data. Fo r the second half of the study, the 
oliceridine  demand dose was 0.35  mg with a 6 -minute lockout interval . Oliceridine  demonstrated 
statistically significant pain reduction compared to placebo and similar efficacy to morphine 
(oliceridine  0.1 mg regimen red uced average pain scores [LS mean change in time -weighted 
average over 24 hours] by 2.3  points [ P<0.0001 vs. placebo]; oliceridine  0.35 mg by 2.1 points 
[P=0.0003 vs. placebo]; morphine, by 2.1 points [ P=0.0001 vs. placebo]). The mean oliceridine 
utilizati on over the 24 -hour treatment period for the 0.1 mg group was 7.6 mg, and for the 0.35 
group, 14.8 mg. Rescue pain medication use was similar for both oliceridine  (31% with 
oliceridine  0.1 mg, 21% with oliceridine  0.35 mg) and morphine (25%), and less than  half the 
rate for placebo (64%; post hoc P<0.0005 for all three active groups  vs. placebo ). For the 
purpose of this study, hypoventilation events were defined as apparent and persistently decreased 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], respi[INVESTIGATOR_882946].  Oliceridine  had a significantly lower 
prevalence of hypoventi lation events , nausea, and vomiting than the morphine group (post hoc 
P<0.05 for both oliceridine  regimens vs. morphine) :

Oliceridine  preclinical and clinical data are summarized in the current investigator ’s brochure  
(IB).  
1.2 Rationale  
Consistent with the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) requirements for premarketing safety 
databases, the proposed population  in this clinical study  is sufficiently diverse to adequately 
represent the target population  (patients with moderate to severe acute pain for which parenteral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_882947]) (Food  and Drug  Administration, 2005 ). 
Consistent with the known pharmacological properties of oliceridine  and clinical observations 
obtained from completed studies  with oliceridine , essentially, only patients with 
contraindications to opi[INVESTIGATOR_882948] , tolerability , or efficacy data have been excluded. Eligibility criteria therefore support 
evaluation of oliceridine  in patients with a range of conditions warran ting parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_288988] , treated across a clinical trial environment characterized by [CONTACT_882977] 
(institutions, investigators) within the [LOCATION_002] , for variable durations of treatment . 
Oliceridine  will be administered as-needed ( PRN ) via the IV route. D epending on the clinical 
considerations for which parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882934] (eg, anticipated duration of 
therapy, clinical setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using clinician -administered bolus 
dosing , PCA, or  both bolus and PCA . 
1.3 Study Endpoint s 
1.3.1 Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability of oliceridine  will be measured as the incidence of self -reported or 
observed AEs, including those related to vital sign measurements, oxygen saturation  
measurements , somnolence/sedation  scores , physical examination findings , and clinical 
laboratory assessments. Somnolence/sedation will be measured using the Moline -Roberts 
Pharmacologic Sedation Scale (MRPSS; see  Section  9.1) (Moline, 2012 ). The MRPSS is 
designed to provide a consistent method of assessing pharmacologic sedation and assist in the 
decision -making process regarding the administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], seda tives, and other agents 
which produce sedation. For patients receiving a parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882949] , intensive 
monitoring is the standard of care. This monitoring will be used in the current study to evaluate

Sentinel Event A lert for the safe use of opi [INVESTIGATOR_882937]  (The Joint  Commission, 2012 ). 
1.3.2 Efficacy Endpoints  
The a nalgesic efficacy of oliceridine will be measured using a 0-10 point numeric pain rating 
scale ( NPRS , see Section  9.2). NPRS was selected given its  frequent use in clinical practice and 
clinical research  (McCaffery, 1989 ). The NPRS may be explained or shown to the patient, who 
responds by [CONTACT_124439] a number ( Hjermstad , 2011 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_1235357]  (IP). No other benefits of participation are anticipated.  
The potential risks of study participation include  lack of analgesic efficac y, known or unknown 
serious or non -serious AEs, and unknown risks inherent in the evaluation of an IP. Additional 
risks are those associated with  medical evaluation, such as those associated with venipuncture.  
Oliceridine  preclinical and clinical data are summarized in the current IB. Investigator s must 
become familiar with all sections of the IB before the start of the study.

3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This phase 3, open -label, safety study will be conducted in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882930], ambulatory surgical care centers , and emergency departments  (EDs) . Patients 
recruited in EDs may continue oliceridine treatment if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882950].   
Representative surgeries include orthopedic (eg, total hip replacement, total knee replacement , 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), abdominal (eg, upper or lower abdominal, perineal), gynecologic (eg, total abdominal 
hysterectomy), vascula r, soft tissue , and surgical procedural pain.  
Representative medical conditions include acute pancreatitis, acute exacerbation of existing 
noncancerous chronic pain, musculoskeletal pain, sickle -cell disease, inflammatory orofacial 
muscle pain , and renal colic. Medical conditions that could confound the evaluation of 
oliceridine  are excluded, such as acute pain without a specific etiology , undifferentiated acute 
abdominal pain, acute breakthrough pain in palliative “end of life” care, and pain as sociated with 
advanced cancer (somatic, visceral, or neuropathic ) or with concurrent use of chemotherapeutic  
or biologic  agents  for the treatment of cancer . 
Representative ED conditions include visceral pain (eg, renal colic, upper abdominal pain, 
abdomina l pelvic pain); nonvisceral pain (eg, traumatic and atraumatic acute musculoskeletal 
pain, chest wall pain, burns, orofacial pain/headache, cutaneous and soft tissue pain); procedural 
analgesia (eg, reduction of orthopedic fractures and dislocations, absce ss incision and drainage); 
acute painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_80799] a medical conditio n (eg, sickle cell painful vaso -occlusive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]). Oliceridine will not be used to intentionally suppress a patient’s level of consciousness 
(procedural sedation and analg esia as defined by [CONTACT_882978] 
[ACEP]).  
The study has four phases: a screening/baseline phase, a treatment phase (consisting  of a predose 
period and a dosing period), an end -of-treatment phase, and a follow -up phase.

3.1.1 Screening/baseline phase  
Written informed consent will be obtained before any protocol -related activities are conducted. 
All screening procedures will be completed within [ADDRESS_1235358] of care assessme nts (eg, chemistry, hematology, urine or serum pregnancy test, 
urine or serum toxicology screen, electrocardiogram (ECG)) obtained before informed consent 
may be used as study data if protocol specifications and timeframes are met  (see Section  3.6.1 ). 
When screening and baseline procedures are anticipated to occur within 48 hours of each other, 
they may be executed as a single procedure, unless the clinical conditio n of the patient has 
significantly changed since screening.  
Adverse events (AEs) occurring from time of informed consent to the follow up phase will be 
recorded in source and will also be recorded in eCRF if the patient receives oliceridine. Serious 
Advers e Events (SAEs) occurring from time of informed consent to the follow -up phase or 
[ADDRESS_1235359] dose of oliceridine (whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and 
eCRF; ongoing SAEs after this time frame will be followed until the investig ator, medical 
monitor, and sponsor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by [CONTACT_882979], regardless of the time of onset after treatment, should be 
reported.  
Prior medications taken or administered  within the [ADDRESS_1235360] dose of oliceri dine was administered  and that the patient will no longer be treated 
with oliceridine . 
The duration of treatment for each patient will be determined by [CONTACT_882980][INVESTIGATOR_2538]. In current practice,  parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882932] -needed for up to several days.

up to 14 days, it is unlikely that patients will receive oliceridine for that duration in the context of 
this study.  
3.1.3 Predose peri od 
Before dosing with oliceridine, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), oxygen 
saturation, and somnolence/sedation will be measured. Somnolence/sedation wi ll be measured 
using the MRPSS. During the predose period, an additional, post -surgical ECG will be 
performed only in surgical patients.  Prior medications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.  
Pain intensity will be measured using a 0 -10 point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS).  
Predose period procedures will occur within [ADDRESS_1235361] oliceridine dose. If the 
dosing period is delayed, predose period procedures (except the additional, post -surgical ECG 
performed only in surgical patients ) will be repeated.  
3.1.4 Dosing period  
Oliceridine IV infusion may be a dministered either by [CONTACT_30223] -administered bolus, PCA, or 
both bolus and PCA, according to the clinical situation.  
During dosing with oliceridine, vital signs, oxygen saturation, and somnolence/sedation will be 
measured at any and all times during the dosing period consistent  with individual patient need 
and institutional standards of care for a patient receiving a parenteral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. An ECG will be 
obtained [ADDRESS_1235362] dose of oliceridine, and at every 24 hours of oliceridine 
treatment. Blood will be collected f or oliceridine pharmacokinetics and future cytochrome P450 
2D6 (CYP2D6) genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.  
NPRS assessments will also be completed at 30 minutes +/ [ADDRESS_1235363] dose of oliceridine was admin istered  and that the 
patient will no longer be treated with oliceridine , the treatment phase is complete and the end of

Within 1 hour after completion of the treatment phase, vi tal signs, oxygen saturation, and 
somnolence/sedation will be measured, and concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs will be 
recorded.  
Within 3 hours after completion of the treatment phase, blood will be collected for clinical 
laboratory tests. Concomitant me dications and AEs/SAEs will be recorded.

3.4 Early Discontinuation  
All patients will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any  reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable attempt should be made by [CONTACT_882981]; however, patients must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  
If a patient  is discontinued early , the investigator will make every effort to complete  
end-of-treatment phase and follow -up phase procedures . 
An electronic case report form (eCRF)  should be completed for every patient  who receives 
oliceridine , whether or not the patient  completes the stud y. The reason for the early 
discontinuation should be indicated on this form . The following standard categories  should be 
used to select a primary reason for early discontinuation : 
 Adverse event : clinical or para-clinical  events occurred that, in the medic al judgment of 
the investigator for the best interest of the patient , are grounds f or discontinuation. This 
includes serious and non -serious AEs regardless of relation to the IP. 
 Lack of efficacy  
 Withdrawal of consent : the patient  desired to withdraw from further participation in the 
study in the absence of an investigator -determined medical need to withdraw. If the 
patient  gave a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the eCRF.  
 Investigator decision  
 Protocol deviation : the investigator or patient was noncompliant with study procedures 
or the patient did not satisfy the entry criteria for the study  
 Lost to follow -up: the patient  stopped coming for visits and study personnel were unable 
to contact [CONTACT_102] . 
 Other : the patient was discontinued for a reason other than those listed above, such as 
“dosing limit ”, pregnancy  or termination of study by [CONTACT_456].  The reason(s) should be 
recorded in the eCRF .

3.5.2 Oliceridine Dosing  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General considerations  
Oliceridine  will be administered PRN via the IV route. Depending on the clinical considerations 
for which parenteral opi [INVESTIGATOR_882934] (e g, anticipated duration of therapy, clinical 
site/setting), a patient could receive oliceridine  using clinician -administered bolus dosing or PCA 
dosing. A patient may receive both methods of administration.  
As in current practice , patient need, analgesic efficacy, and adverse responses will guide 
oliceridine  use. Consistent with current opi[INVESTIGATOR_882953], oliceridine  
should not be administered on a fixed, around -the-clock dosing schedule.  
The oliceridine dosing regimen should be initiated for each patient individually, taking into 
account the patient's severity of pain, patient response and prior analgesic treatment experience.  
Individually titrate oliceridine to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and  minimizes AEs. Formatted:  Font color:  Blue

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing schedule  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Clinician -administered bolus dosing  
For clinician -administered bolus dosing, the oliceridine  initial dose is 1  mg to 2 mg. If clinically 
indicated, a 1  mg supplemental dose may be administered as early as 15 minutes after  the initial 
dose. Subsequent doses are 1  to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours PRN based on individual patient need 
and previous response  to oliceridine . 
In settings where rapid analgesia is targeted (e.g., ED or post -anesthesia care unit (PACU )), the 
oliceridine  initial dose is 1  mg to 3 mg. If clinically indicated, 1 mg to 3 mg supplemental doses 
may be administered every 5 minutes PRN.  Subsequent doses are 1 to 3 mg every 1 to 3 hours 
PRN  based on individual patient need and previous response to oliceridine .

lockout interval without a continuous baseline infusion.  
Oliceridine  PCA regimen:  
 Loading dose: 1.5  mg. 
 Demand dose: 0.5  mg. 
 Lockout interval: 6 minutes.  
If clinically indicated , throughout the treatment phase , a 1 mg supplemental dose may be 
administered PRN, taking into account the patient's utilization of PCA demand doses, individual 
patient need  and previous response to oliceridine .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosing Limit   
For the current study, the dosing limit for oliceridine will  be [ADDRESS_1235369] be  administered by [CONTACT_882983]: 1653E3C7-322F-4FA6-A431-A5C272CAAA9C

Concomitant non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_416063]. If a concomitant parenteral or oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_882954] , oliceridine  treatment will cease, and the patient will 
be discontinued early and will underg o the end -of-treatment phase and follow -up phase 
procedures as scheduled.  
Unless specifically prohibited, other medications are permitted, including common  treatments of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related adverse effects  (eg, antiemetics , antacids, stool laxatives ) and medication s used to 
treat underlying medical condition s. 
As with conventional opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], prior and concomitant use of anxiolytics , sedative -hypnotics , or 
other potential CNS depressant s requires elevated vigilance, consistent with the  Joint 
Commission Sentin el Event Alert  for the safe use of opi [INVESTIGATOR_882937]  (The Joint  Commission,

(American Society of Anesthesiologists 2016 ). 
Supplemental oxygen will be recorded as a prior and/or concomitant medication.  
3.5.6 Drug -Drug Interactions  
Both non -clinical and clinical data show that oliceridine is metabolized by [CONTACT_882984]3A4 and 
CYP2D6 , with each enzyme  contributing approximately 50% to the clearance of oliceridine .

clearance of drugs metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6. For example, a bout 7 %-10% of the Ca ucasian 
population may have low functiona l levels of CYP2D6 in the liver  and are classified as “poor 
metabolizers”. The clearance of oliceridine  in subjects who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 
substrates is reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 50% relative to extensiv e metabolizers. Patients who are 
taking concomitant medications known to inhibit the CYP2D6 enzyme (eg , paroxetine , 
fluoxetine, quinidine, buprop ion) will have a similar reduction in oliceridine  clearance  compared 
to poor metabolizers . Patients who are CYP 2D6 poor metabolizers, or who are taking a 
concomitant drug known to inhibit the CYP2D6  enzyme , may require less frequent dosing of 
oliceridine . Given that  oliceridine  is administered PRN , differential dosing instructions are not 
required for these patients.  
Patients  receiving oliceridine concomitantly with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (eg , clarithromycin, 
indinavir, itraconazole, ritonavir,  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfi navir, 
posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir,  telithromycin, voriconazole ) will also show a reduction in 
clearance of oliceridine  of about 50%.  These patients may require less frequent dosing of 
oliceridine . Given that oliceridine  is administered PRN , diffe rential dosing instructions are n ot 
required for these patients .

The investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs, 
during scheduled safety and tolerability evaluations and whenever such information is brought to 
their attention. This section of the protocol provides definitions and detailed procedures to be 
followed.  
During each visit, the  investigator will question a patient about AEs using an open -ended  
question approach, making sure  not to infl uence that  patient’s answers, eg, "Have you noticed 
any change in your health?” or “How do you feel? .”

An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintend ed sign, including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the IP, 
whether or not it is considered to be IP related. This includes any  newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency from time of informed consent . 
Examples of an AE include:  
 Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition , including either an increase in frequency and/or 
intensity of the c ondition.  
 A ne w condition  detected or diagnosed.  
 Signs or  symptoms of a drug interaction.  
 Signs or  symptoms of a suspected overdose of either IP or a concurrent medication (overdose 
per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  
 A new laboratory abnormalit y that results in patient withdrawal from the study or medical 
treatment or further follow -up. 
NOTE : abnormal laboratory values obtained during screening  that preclude a patient from 
entering the study are not considered AEs, but they will be recorded.  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures ( ie, invasive procedures, modification of patient’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Symptoms or signs anticipated for a surgical or medical patient will not be recorded as AEs 
unless they are of greater severity and/or intensity than would be expected . Investigators will use

(c) Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
NOTE:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329887] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or ou tpatient 
setting. Complications that occur d uring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287407] c riteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the  AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from

driven circumstances ( eg, transportati on issues).  
(d) Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance , such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) , which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes

events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note that the te rms “serious” and “severe” ARE NOT synonymous. The term “severe” is 
often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical 
significanc e (such as a severe headache). This is NOT the same as “serious,” which is based 
on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above and are usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or functioning. A severe AE  does not necessarily 
need to be considered serious. For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration may 
be considered  severe nausea but not an SAE. On the other hand, a stroke resulting in only a 
minor degree of disability may be consi dered mild  but would be defined as an SAE base d on 
the above noted criteria. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporti ng obligations.  
4.1.3 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as A dverse 
Events and S erious Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings ( eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments ( eg, vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_762723] , if they meet the de finition of an AE or SAE . Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are detected during 
the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen from time of informed consent  will 
be reported as AEs or SAEs . 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant.  
Liver chemistry thresholds have been desi gned to assure patient safety. When patients meet the 
hepatic transaminase threshold criteria (AST or ALT >=3 × ULN), the patient should undergo 
close observation, including monitoring for symptoms (clinical symptoms of hepatitis  or 
hypersensitivity, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, 
or rash) and hepatic function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and fractionated bilirubin) at 
least every  48 hours, until symptoms and/ or hepatic function  abnormalities resolve, stabilize, or 
return to baseline values. This event must be reported to Trevena within [ADDRESS_1235388] or hepatology consultation should be considered in cases of protocol -mandated IP 
discontinuation.

traveled outside [LOCATION_003] or Canada in past 3 months).  
 Serum creatine phosphokinase and LDH . 
 Record the appearance or worsening of cli nical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity, fatigue, decreased a ppetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, 
fever, or rash , as relevant , on the AE report form.  
 Record the use of concomitant medications, including acetaminophen, herbal remedies, 
other over the counter medications, putative hepatotoxins, or alco hol on the concomitant 
medications report form.  
 The following are required for patients with AST or ALT >=3 × ULN and 
bilirubin  >=2 × ULN but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:

microsomal antibodies.  
o Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to 
evaluate liver disease.  
4.1.4 Evaluating A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed on two  descriptive parame ters: intensity and relationship to  the IP: 
 Intensity refers to the severity of an event and references impact on a patient ’s 
functioning.  
 Relationship refers to the likelihood that the event being assessed was caused by [CONTACT_33249].

Confidential  Page 48 of 67 [IP_ADDRESS]  Severity Rating  
Each AE will be classified according to the following criteria:  
Mild   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated . 
Moderate   Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity . 
Severe   Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity . 
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. An event is defined as 
“serious” when it meets one of the predefined outcomes as descri bed in Section 4.1.2 . 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the experience should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of 
days, those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Relationship to Investigation al Product  
For AEs and SAEs, the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions:  
Not R elated  There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the 
suspected event.  
 
Unlikely Related  It is doubtful that there is an association between the study treatment and 
the suspected event. The event could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the patient.  
 
Possibly Related  The suspected AE may or may not fo llow a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study treatment administration. The event could have been produced 
or mimicked by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_882987].  
 
Probably Related  The suspected AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study 
treatment administration, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_129156]’s clinical state.  
When assessing the relationship to  the IP, the follow ing criteria will be considered:  
 Positive rechallenge .

Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as separate events ( ie, a new record 
started).  
The investigator should report all AEs on the AE page(s) of the eCRF and source documents, 
regardless of serious ness, severity,  and causality. Whenever possible, an AE will be reported 
using a diagnostic term, (eg, “common cold” or “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” rather than “runny 
nose, cough, mild fever”) and should be described with the attributes  described in Section  4.1. 
4.2.2 Serious Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed to determine whether it meets seriousness criteria ( see Section  4.1). If 
the AE is considered serious, the investigator should report this event to the sponsor . 
Additionally , a site using a local institutional review board (IRB) / Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)  will report the event to that  body  according to its standard operating 
procedures.  For sites using a central IRB/IEC, Trevena , or designee, will report to the central 
IRB/IEC . 
SAEs occurring from time of informed consent to the follow -up phase or [ADDRESS_1235395] 
dose of oliceridine (whichever occurs later) will be recorded in source and eCRF ; ongoing SAEs 
after this  time frame will be followed until the investigator, medical monitor, and sponsor agree 
that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. SAEs considered by [CONTACT_882988], regardless of the time of onset after treatment, should be re ported .

Examples of acceptable source documentation include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, and recorded data from automated instruments, 
memoranda, and pharmacy dispensing records.  During the st udy, select eCRF data may be used 
as original data collection tools as long as a description of this documentation process is 
maintained in t he investigator’s study files.  
The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction  of any noted inconsistencies. Procedures for 
correcting eCRF are des cribed in EDC  guidelines. As representatives of the sponsor, CRAs are 
responsible for notifying project management of any noted protocol deviations.  
By [CONTACT_81593]’s Agreement, the investigator agrees to me et with the CRA(s) during 
study site visits; to ensure that study staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed; to provide the 
CRA(s) access to all study documentation and  to the clinical supplies dispensing and storage 
area; and to assist the monitors in t heir activities, if requested. Further, the investigator agrees to 
allow Trevena or designee auditors or inspectors from regulatory agencies to review records and 
to assist the inspectors in their duties, if requested.

part of this protocol. The investigator and appropriate personnel will be periodically requested to 
attend meetings/workshops organized by [CONTACT_88466]. 
The study may be subject  to audit by [CONTACT_613994]. If such an audit 
occurs, the investigator must agree to allow access to required patient  records. By [CONTACT_130720], the investigator grants permission to personnel from the sponsor, its representatives, 
and appropriate regulatory authorities , for on -site m onitoring of all appropriate study 
documentation, as well as on -site review of the procedures employed in eCRF generation, where 
clinically appropriate.  
7.[ADDRESS_1235411] arrange for retention of study records at the site for 2 yea rs after the IP’s 
new drug application  is approved , or the IND is withdrawn, as required by [CONTACT_1260]. The 
investigator should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.  
7.6 Use of Study Findings  
By [CONTACT_882998], the investigator agrees to the use of the study results for the 
purpose of natio nal and international registration. If necessary, the authorities will be notified of 
the investigator’s name, address, qualificatio ns, and extent of involvement. A clinical study 
report  will be prepared by [CONTACT_230025].  
7.7 Publications  
As a multicenter trial, the sponsor intends to publish clinical data from all centers participating in 
the investigation. Additional publications may represent segments of the study; for example, 
publications based on site topology (inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347], 
ambulatory surgical care center , ED), nature of pain (visceral or non -visceral), or method of 
administration (bolus, PCA, both bolus and PCA)  may be developed.  
In conformity with the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals 
published by [CONTACT_691129]  (Kassirer, 1991 ), 
investigators whose contribution consists solely in the collection of data will not be named

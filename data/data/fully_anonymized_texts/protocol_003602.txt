IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/09/[ADDRESS_82677] 3 years, the High  Risk  Children’s Clinic at UTP  (HRC C) has been 
providing a me dical home for medically complex children. We have  demonstrat ed 
major benefits (e.g., 50% fewer  serious  illnesses & 55% fewer  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598])  and 
savings  (~$1 0K/chi ld/year) from the comprehensive  care provided in our 
enhanc ed medical home to hi gh-risk chronically ill children--including patients with 
chronic lung disease (CLD). These benefits have not been previo usly shown for 
medical homes for patients of any kind or age.1,2 These  benefits result  primarily  
from 24/[ADDRESS_82678]. The clinic offers same  day appointmen ts and provides

Study Design and Methods 
 
 
 
 
 
Overview: 
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_76097] (RCT) will enroll 92 children from 6 months to 
 
<[ADDRESS_82683] chronic lung disease (CLD) such as broncho pulmonary 
dysplasia  during two seasons  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_76098] 1st October to 31st 
March of each year (2015-2016 Season and 2016-2017 Season). If the min imum 
number  of patients (n=92) in Season [ADDRESS_82684]  paren tal cons ent will be  
given  a baseline EKG, a nasal as pi[INVESTIGATOR_337], an oscil lometer reading (over 2 years of age 
 
only), and a three to six month supply of either  the medication or the place bo at an 
initial study visit. Both me dications will be  taken once  a day for three days a week: 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The azithromycin medication will be  dosed  at 5 
mg/kg/day. Adjustmen ts in dosage  amo unt will be  made with a ny new weights 
obtained during the trial perio d. Any child  that  is eligible to receive Palivizumab 
will be  given  this every 28-30 days in clinic as per usual care.  Patients  will be 
followed on a monthly basis and closely  monitored for adverse  reactions;  this will 
occur by [CONTACT_648], in clinic during their regularly scheduled  appointmen ts, and/or 
during any necess ary illness visits. Any children with adverse  reactions  will 
discon tinue the medication, but will cont inue to be followed clinically. At any clin ic 
visit in which  a child presents with respi[INVESTIGATOR_76099] s, inclu ding pneumonia,

an oscill omet er reading performed. Data  will continue to be collected  for the 
following 2 months (April 1st to May 31st), to moni tor for respi[INVESTIGATOR_76104]. 
 
 
Study Population: 
 
High risk children between the c hronolo gical age of  6 months and 6 years who atte nd 
either  the High  Risk  Children’s Clinic or the  High Risk  Infant  Clinic at UTP  will be 
screened by [CONTACT_76140], and additional help will be  provided by [CONTACT_76141]. The high risk infant  clinic follows prema ture infan ts born  before [ADDRESS_82686] 2 years of life; the high  risk pediatric clinic  follows medically 
complex children who have had at least 3  ED visits, 2 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and/or [ADDRESS_82687] ye ar for a chronic health condition. 
 
 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: 
 
Children who belong  to either the H igh Risk  Infant Clin ic or the High Risk  Children’s 
Clinic and that  have been diagnosed with a chronic lung disease as defined by [CONTACT_76142] a 
medical provider will be inclu ded.3 Chronic lung disease (CLD) is the final common 
pathway of a he terogeneous  group of pulmonary disorders that s tart in  the neonatal 
perio d. Often the inciting factor  is bronchopul monary dysplasia  (BPD), a ch ronic 
condition that can develop  after  prema ture birth and respi[INVESTIGATOR_76105]. Myriad other  conditions  can also cause airway and 
parench ymal inflam mation that lea ds to ch ronic airflow obstruction, increased work of 
breathing, and airway h yper reactivity. Usually  the inciting facto rs are not o nly the 
underlying disor ders, but also the  effects  of the supportive treatme nt, inclu ding 
mec hanical ventilatio n, barotrau ma, and oxygen toxicity. These aggressive 
interventions  for serious  neonat al and infant lung diseases are often responsi ble for 
much of the chronic pulmonary abnormalit ies that fo llow. 3Exclusion criteria  inclu de

airway against the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_76108].  A bas eline EKG will be  obtained on all 
patients. 
 
 
Study Procedures: 
 
Patients will be  randomized by [CONTACT_76144] a double blind 
man ner. Parents will t hen be provided with a medication or place bo for the duration of 
the study. Patients would be recruited  for this study on a rolling basis from Octob er 1st 
to Decem ber 31st, and all patients comple ting the intervention part of  the protocol  on 
31st March at the end of the season. Half of the patients will receive azithromycin at a 
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-14-0476  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/09/2015   dose of 5 mg/kg to be  given once a day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The other 
half, the control group, will be  provided with a place bo medication of similar  taste, 
color, texture, and consis tency, also to be taken  once  a day on Monday, Wednesday, and 
Friday. Both the  study me dication  and the placebo will be  dispensed from Corner 
Compounding Phar macy, mixed with a fish-oil base  to ensure a shelf  life of more than 
six months, and flavored with citrus to impro ve palatability. Parents will be  cont acted 
biweek ly, either  in clinic or by [CONTACT_648], to moni tor for any adverse  reactions, including 
rash,  nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If a significa nt adverse 
reaction  occurs, the medication will be  discon tinued. If an aller gic reaction (such as 
rash or shortness of breath) is noted, the blind  will be  broken by [CONTACT_76145]-Rubio, who is not involved with the project.  This un-blind ing will be  done 
to no te if it is an allergy to the  medication. 
 
 
After the initial appointmen t, at any face to face  encounter (unsc heduled sick  visit or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76109]) in which  the patient presents with 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_76110], the patient will be  eval uated by [CONTACT_76146]-investigators.  Specificall y, if a patient presents with the following symptoms: cough, 
wheeze,  tachypnea, rhinorrhea,  increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_76111],  hypoxemia, and/or an 
increased oxygen requireme nt, an additional nasal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76112]/and trac heal 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76103], and an oscill omet ry reading (for patients over 2 years of age)  will 
be performed. These  samples  will also be  stored in the office of [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_29422]. At the 
concl usion  of the 3-6 months  trea tment  phase, a fin al nasal as pi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/and trac heal 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76113] e. Oscillo meter reading will also be performed for those 
above 2 years of age while the patients are in clinic for an office visit at the end of the 
study visit and during each sick  clinic visit for respi[INVESTIGATOR_76100]. There will be no 
expected/a dditional study visits and no compensation will be  provided for paren ts or 
patients. 
 
 
Risk s: 
 
Pote ntial risks  inclu de an allergic reaction  or adverse  reaction  to the medication or 
place bo. Examples of  poten tial side effects  include nause a, vomiting, diarrhea,  and skin

with the increased use of antibiot ics. Another  adverse  outcome  of azithromycin has 
been an increase in pyloric stenosis  with both prenatal and infant exposure for the first 
[ADDRESS_82690]  from home or work for the patients’ paren ts and, 
poten tially, decreased health care  related cost s.

collecting 2-8 nasal as pi[INVESTIGATOR_76118]. Nasal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76119]; we will also use ELISA tests to measure the 
levels of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, inclu ding IL-[ADDRESS_82695] visit, the final visit, and during any

These  samples  will all be  frozen and stored until the completion  of the trial.  For the 
collection, the child will be  placed supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 2 ml of  normal saline will be  instilled into one 
nostril,  and then  an 8 or  10 French suction  catheter (depending on the size of the 
patient) will be  used  to remo ve the mucus. This procedure will be performed  once  on 
each nost ril. After the specimen  collection from both  nostril s, [ADDRESS_82696] bag

freezer until Monday morning. For during the weekend epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], sam ples will be 
collected on Monday and properly  marked with date and time of ER/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76124].  Samples will be stored for one year after  the 
completion of the stu dy at [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_29422]’s la boratory, and will be  destroyed after  the on e- 
year perio d. Neither sam ples nor data will be sha red outside of the University of [LOCATION_007]. 
 
 
Labeling 
 
 
 
Specimens  collected  for this study must be easily distinguishable  from other  labo ratory 
specimens  stored in the Department  of Pathol ogy refrigerators and laboratory freezers. 
ID numbers  will be  pre-assigned and pre-printed on a label f or each specimen.  The date 
(mm/dd/yr) and time (hh:mm) of specimen  collection  must be written on the label. The 
ID number used for the case  report form must match the  ID number  used on the 
specimen  (eg, first patient 001 should be typed on the specimen  labels and case  report 
form). Specimens will also be  labeled  with date (mm/dd/yr) and time (hh:mm) of 
symptoms onse t. 
 
 
Laboratory Procedures 
 
 
 
The level of  myeloperoxidase will be  measu red using reagent tests, and seve ral cytokines 
that are mar kers of inflammation will be tested using E LISA tests.  These  tests are  
routinely  performed in [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_29422]’s la boratory and details of  the primers and pr obes to 
be used  are found  in a [ADDRESS_82698] the presence of 5- 
6 major respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398],  and the rema ining volume of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76125]. Nasal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_76126] 4 cytokines and chemo kines. Samples  will be  tested acco rding to the  
IRB NUMBER:  HSC -MS-14-0476  
IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  10/09/2015   manu factu rer’s instructions.  Samples a nd serial dilutio ns of the cytokine standards will 
 
be incub ated with anti-human  cytokine-coat ed beads in a [ADDRESS_82699] and Bayesian analyses will be performed  using an  intent-to- 
treat  approach.  Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], total ER visits (counting  one day for each ER 
visit), and unsc heduled  clinic visits (counting  one day for each visit) for respi[INVESTIGATOR_76127] (Azithromycin vs Plac ebo), 
with logistic regression models and the trea tment  group as a co varia te and random 
intercept to acco unt for within patient correlation (due to m ultiple ED visits). To 
assess the probability of benefit, we will use Bayesian hiera rchical models with 
interaction  terms between treatme nt groups (Azithromycin vs Place bo) and 
predefined poten tial moderators.  The groups will be s tratified  by [CONTACT_76148]. The conser vative Bayesian 
approach  of Dixon and Simon  allows us to shrink the subgroup estimat es to the 
overall  mean treatme nt effect.  For all Ba yesian analyses, prior distributions  for 
main  effects  will be  neutral ~N(0,1000), and Uniform (0,1000) for SD paramet ers. 
Neut ral and skeptical priors will be  used  for interaction  terms. Point estimat es of 
trea tment  effect and 95% credible intervals will be reported along with probability 
of trea tment  benefit. 
 
 
Sample  size and power 
 
Based  on data from our HRCC, we expect the  control group to have 1.6 encounters 
per child-year (SD=1.66). Assu ming a two-sided alpha =  0.05, a sample  size of 90 
(45/group)  will have 80% power to detect a difference  of 1 in the encount er rate 
between placebo and azithromycin groups (i.e., 1.6 vs 0.6 in encounter rate or 38% 
reduction).  Power  will be more limit ed for secondary outcomes  but Bayesian 
analyses will pro vide an estimate  of the probability of benefit in these outcomes.

invasive nature of both  the nasal as pi[INVESTIGATOR_76128]. In addition, paren ts may  opt out of partic ipating if the ir child’s medical 
diagnosis  or current health status is too  emoti onally overwhelming, or if they  have 
concerns  regarding the prophylactic admin istrat ion of an  antibiot ic for 3-[ADDRESS_82701] samples  on the next busin ess day 
morning. Parents may also not a dhere to the admin istering the medication/place bo 
three days a week. 
 
 
Confidenti ality 
 
 
 
Every effort will be  made to protect  the privacy  of the subjects. Unique identifiers will 
not be  stored in the final database that  will be  used  for analytic purposes. Informat ion 
such as age,  sex, and race will be  collected to examine  the patterns of interaction  in 
different  demo graphic subgroups.  
 
 
Specimens  will be s ent to Baylor College of Medicine for processi ng and testing. 
Specimens  will be  coded with study  ID numbe rs and will not have  any person al 
informat ion. 
 
 
Upon completion  of the study, elect ronic data will be  retained by [CONTACT_1961]  (R. Mosqu era) at his  University of [LOCATION_007] Medical School office. All data

6) demonstrate  cost -effectiven ess of mac rolides use. Understa nding the anti- 
inflammatory effects  of azithromycin when used as a prophylactic drug will provide 
important insight into the preven tion of more serious  sequelae  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776].  In particula r, this proposal  will contribute  to understa nding disease in

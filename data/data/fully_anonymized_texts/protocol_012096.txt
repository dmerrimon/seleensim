 Section 5 - Lay Language Summary
5) Provide a summary or synopsis of the proposed study using non-technical language (not more than 1 
paragraph)
Veteran suicide is a national problem; social disconnection is an important contributor to suicide 
risk. This study will recruit Veterans to take part in a peer-centered group called Caring Cards 
(CC). CC gives Veterans who have a history of increased suicide risk the opportunity to make 
cards that are then sent to Veterans who are currently at high-risk for suicide. CC is an 
innovative group that was developed at VA San Diego and pi[INVESTIGATOR_78803]. Since 
its inception, several CC groups have started in various clinics at the VASDHS, as part of 
standard clinical care. This project will directly benefit Veterans and contribute to the quality of 
services provided by [CONTACT_78854] a safe, creative space for Veterans with lived 
experience related to suicide risk to join together to provide messages of hope, community, and 
resilience to their peers at risk for suicide. Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_78804] a 
bridge for social connection, which may help prevent Veteran suicide. This intervention may also 
improve Veterans’ satisfaction with VA healthcare and engagement with mental health treatment.
 Section 6 - Specific Aims
6) Provide a statement of specific aims and  that serve as the basis for this protocol.  Emphasize hypotheses
those aspects that justify the use of human subjects.
Aim 1: Establish the feasibility and acceptability of Caring Cards for Veteran card makers and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (i.e., 70% average group attendance, > 75% average satisfaction with group 
participation and card receipt, and 70% average follow-up response). Establish feasibility and 
acceptability for optional meetup groups (i.e., 70% average meetup group attendance 
[feasibility] and > 75% average satisfaction with meetup groups [acceptability]).
Aim 2: Evaluate pre/post changes in thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness 
among card-makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
Aim 3: Evaluate pre/post changes in social connectedness and suicide risk among card makers 
and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
 Section 7 - Background and Significance
7) Provide a succinct discussion of relevant background information to justify performing the proposed study.
Veteran suicide is an epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]; from 2005-2016, suicide rates have risen 26% despi[INVESTIGATOR_78805]. Suicide prevention is VA’s highest priority. Efforts to expand and develop 
innovative services are required to address this ever-growing problem. Thwarted belongingness 
and perceived burdensomeness are potent transdiagnostic social risk factors for suicide. 
Unfortunately, few interventions have directly targeted these constructs to reduce suicide risk. 
The overarching goal of this project is to refine and evaluate Caring Cards, an innovative peer-
centered intervention that aims to reduces suicide risk by [CONTACT_78855]. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_78806], 
Caring Cards employs a novel approach to social recovery by [CONTACT_78856]’ lived 
experience with mental health conditions. In Caring Cards, Veterans compose messages of hope 
and unity by [CONTACT_78857]-of-a-kind cards in outpatient groups. These cards are then sent to 
their anonymous peers who identified to be at elevated risk for suicide.
In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_78807] (IRB #H190032), preliminary data 
indicate Caring Cards is highly feasible and acceptable to both Veteran card makers and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. These data also suggest Caring Cards benefits both Veteran card makers and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78808] a safe, creative space to connect with others for a 
common purpose (targeting belongingness and perceived burdensomeness), and card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78809] (targeting 
thwarted belongingness). Caring Cards is a scalable and low intensity, intervention that bi-
directionally targets suicide prevention and promotes social recovery among two at-risk Veteran 
populations.
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_78810]; all (100%) of the card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78811] a positive experience. A total of 14 (77.8%) said the card had an impact on their 
experience following discharge and recovery; all “yes” responses for this item were positive. A 
total of 16 (88.9%) Veterans denied any negative aspects to receiving the card; however, one 
Veteran mentioned uncertainty about privacy (i.e., asked if the card makers knew who they 
were; interviewer confirmed their anonymity) and another mentioned they felt some negative 
emotions, as receiving the card reminded them of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
In addition, when surveyed, all group members (100%) said they would recommend this group to 
other Veterans. When asked if the group has positively impacted their lives, the majority (90%) 
said “yes,” one Veteran did not answer this question; none said “no.” The majority (90%) said 
they believed this group should be a permanent clinic offering. When asked how long they would 
like to stay in this group, the majority (50%) said “other,” (four Veterans wrote in an 
undetermined amount of time [e.g., “forever,” “ongoing”] and one said, “not sure”). Other 
Veterans indicated they would like to participate in the group for “more than 6 months” (10%), 
“4-6 months” (10%), and “1-3 months” (30%). No Veterans said they would like to stay in the 
group for “less than 1 month.” 
Provided the positive feedback we received from our two cohorts of Veterans (card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78812]), Caring Cards is a minimal risk intervention that is highly acceptable to Veterans at 
elevated risk for suicide. 
This simple, yet potentially powerful intervention may help to meaningfully reduce suicidal 
ideation, attempts, and completions, as well as psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], contact [CONTACT_78858]. We successfully 
established feasibility and acceptability of Caring Cards with Veterans discharging from 
the VASDHS' inpatient psychiatry unit (pi[INVESTIGATOR_78813]). In an effort to understand 
if Caring Cards is feasible and acceptable with other groups of Veterans at risk for suicide, we aim 
to examine Caring Cards with a new group of at-risk Veterans, those with inactive high-risk flags 
(card makers) and those with current high-risk flags (card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). 
Prior to assessing the impact Caring Cards has on VASDHS' Veterans' suicide risk within these 
two new populations, noted above, two important initial steps should be taken: 1) determine if it 
is feasible for Veterans with inactive high-risk flags to make these cards, and to send these cards 
and collect Veterans with active high-risk flags feedback, and 2) determine if these groups 
of Veterans find making and receiving these cards acceptable (i.e., satisfaction). The current 
project aims to address these initial steps, as well as preliminary examine the impact Caring 
Cards has on suicide risk and social connectedness-related constructs (i.e., thwarted 
belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, perceived rejection, lonliness, and emotional 
support) within these two groups.
Last, based on Veterans' feedback from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], we will be inviting participants to 
attend optional meet-up groups, as an opportunity to socially connect with one another. Because 
this type of group has not been examined yet, feasibility and acceptability of these groups will 
also be investigated.
 Section 9 - Design and Methods
9) Describe the research design and the procedures to be used to accomplish the specific aims of the 
project.  Provide a precise description of the planned data collection (include what systems or databases will 
be used/accessed to gather data), analysis and interpretation.  For chart review studies, include the timeframe 
of collection.  Address sample size, inclusion of women and minorities.  Define in clear terms exactly what will 
 be done to the human subjects.
We plan to recruit a total of 80 participants- 30 Veterans with inactive high-risk flags (HRFs) for 
suicide will be recruited to serve as the Caring Cards group members (i.e., card makers), and [ADDRESS_86205] developed 
a targeted/planned enrollment specifically to ensure the inclusion of and racial/ethnic women min
. orities The VA San Diego serves a diverse population of Veterans, including by [CONTACT_547], ethnicity, 
age/era and mental health and physical diagnoses. Recent data indicate that 15% of the Veterans 
accessing the clinic were females and 14% were African-American and 11% were Hispanic/Latino. 
We will systematically monitor the gender and ethnic composition of the screened and recruited 
sample and contrast proportions with known gender and ethnic composition of Veterans on the 
inactive and active high-risk for suicide list. Should substantial discrepancies present (>10%) in 
regard to the rate of those screened or enrolled compared to the anticipated rate, our 
investigative team will review procedures and identify potential remedies. Children (persons 
under the age of 18) will not be recruited into the study. 
 The VASDHS keeps record of all Veterans with inactive and active HRFs. A waiver : Recruitment
of HIPAA authorization will be obtained in order to extract CPRS contact [CONTACT_3031] (i.e., mailing 
address and telephone number) of Veterans with inactive and active HRFs. The study coordinator 
will mail a letter to prospective participants introducing the study (see letter attached to protocol 
submission). Per standard protocol, two weeks after the letter is sent, the study coordinator will 
contact [CONTACT_78859]. 
For inpatient prospects, the study coordinator will consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Veteran’s 
treating inpatient teams to determine the appropriate timing of approaching Veteran on the unit. 
If appropriate, the study coordinator will conduct screening on the unit, and if agreeable to 
participate, consent and baseline assessments may be completed prior to or following discharge.
In our original protocol, we were approved to recruit participants by [CONTACT_78860] a telephone call two weeks after the letter.
We would like to amend our approach by [CONTACT_78861]. 
Specifically, we would like to approach VA healthcare providers/clinics (e.g., Primary Care Mental 
Health Integration, Center of Recovery Education, Mood Clinic, PTSD Clinic), with information 
about the study, asking them to share this information with their Veterans. 
Providers will share study information verbally and/or via study flyer (see below) with Veterans 
during their standard clinical interactions. If a Veteran is interested in learning more about the 
study, providers will ask their permission to have our study personnel reach out to them to 
discuss screening/enrollment. Providers will alert study personnel to interested Veterans via 
encrypted VA email or adding them as additional signers to Veterans’ CPRS progress notes.
Last, providers will inform Veterans that they can directly reach out to our study personnel if they 
are interested in participating. Contact [CONTACT_78862].  
To facilitate recruitment via providers, we would like to share a study flyer with providers/clinics 
so they can distribute to their Veterans. Please see attached for a draft of our flyers – one for 
card makers and one for card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Moreover, we have an information flyer for providers, 
which we have included as well. 
: Screening As noted above, Veterans with inactive and active HRFs will be introduced to the 
study via a letter and subsequent phone call. The study coordinator will screen potential 
participants based on the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Inclusion criteria for  card-makers : (1) VASDHS Veteran with an inactive high-risk flag, (2) 18 
years of age or older, (3) access to transportation to attend the group, and (4) decisional capacity.
: (1) VASDHS Veteran with an active high-risk flag, (2) [ADDRESS_86206] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78814], and (3) decisional capacity. (1) Exclusion criteria for card makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
the absence of a mailing address, working phone number, and email address, (2) inability to read 
and write in English, (3) previous or current experience as either card maker or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and (4) 
currently employed by [CONTACT_78863]. If COVID-[ADDRESS_86207], Veterans will also 
be screened for access to reliable computer, tablet, or smartphone with camera and internet 
access, as well as the willingness to participate in this study remotely. Participants' decisional 
capacity for informed consent in order to meet eligibility for this study will be assessed during 
consent (separate from screening call) via the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Brief Assessment 
of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) will be collected by [CONTACT_9137]. 
Given that we will likely be conducting at least some of our groups via telehealth, we would like to 
amend our inclusion criteria for card makers by [CONTACT_78864]. 
telehealth groups for criterion #3, which will be amended to (3) access to transportation to 
attend the group (if being held in person).
We would also like to amend our exclusion criteria for card makers by [CONTACT_1583]  (5) if participating 
in group via telehealth, the absence of access to reliable computer, tablet, or smartphone with 
camera and internet access.
Enrollment- Consent and Baseline Assessment : Following the screening procedures outlined 
above, Veterans will be invited to participate as either a card maker or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (depending on 
their HRF status). Consent and baseline assessments will be completed either via phone, VA 
Video Connect (VVC), WebEx, or in-person. If consent is obtained via phone or VVC, or WebEx, 
we will adhere to current approved guidelines (i.e., use My Health-e-Vet, using MS Azure, have 
 fax, or have the study coordinator Veteran send signed consent form via email, have Veterans
take a screen shot of the signed consent during their VVC or WebEx session).
Following consent, Veterans will complete a baseline assessment battery that consists of the 
following questionnaires: Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS), Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS), Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ-15), and NIH Toolbox Adult 
Social Relationship Scales.
If a Veteran is conserved, the study coordinator will obtain their conservator's consent for study 
enrollment, as well as the assent of the conserved Veteran.  
Caring Cards Groups (Veteran card makers with inactive HRFs) : Our study will include 
three groups, each with 10 Veterans; they will meet separately for [ADDRESS_86208] remotely, this may increase 
recruitment; however, due to the scope of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], enrollment will be capped at 10 
Veterans per group (a total of [ADDRESS_86209] makers). Group members will be assessed for suicide risk 
at enrollment and follow-up. In addition, the groups' facilitator will remind Veterans at the start of 
each group to please let them know before the end of group if they are experieicing any thoughts 
of suicide or homicide. If group is conducted virtually, the Veteran may ask the facilitator to call 
them after the group has concluded. If suicide is reported, the group's facilitator will further 
assess their risk by [CONTACT_12550] a C-SSRS; if the Veteran's C-SSRS is positive, the facilitator will 
contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78815]. 
: A total of six cards, one Sending Caring Cards (Veteran card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78816])
per month, for six months will be mailed. Veterans recruited from psychiatric inpatient care will 
be mailed a card within the week following their discharge; cards will be sent on a monthly basis 
thereafter. This is consistent with post-discharge caring contacts recommendations. The study 
coordinator will contact [CONTACT_78865]. Because card-recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78817]-up, they will 
not be directly assessed for suicide risk following the mailing of each card. 
Optional Meet-Up Groups (card makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) : All study participants will be invited 
to attend one or more monthly, 120-minute optional, unstructured meetup groups at the VASDHS 
facilitated by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. A total of four meet-up groups will be offered throughout the study's 
duration. Again, if COVID-[ADDRESS_86210] and these groups cannot meet in person, 
they will be invited to meet via WebEx. Meet-up groups will begin with an introduction to the 
purpose of the group (i.e., the facilitator will explain that this is an opportunity for the card 
makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78818]) followed by a review of basic group rules (i.e., limits 
of confidentiality will be reviewed, group members will be informed that they are free to come 
and go as they please, meaning they can arrive later than the designated start time and leave 
earlier than the end time, and the facilitator will be available if anyone has any questions or 
concerns). The facilitator will remind meet-up group attendees that if they are having thoughts of 
suicide or homicide, they should speak directly to them. If group is conducted virtually, the 
Veteran may ask the facilitator to call them after the group has concluded. If suicide is reported, 
the group's facilitator will further assess their risk by [CONTACT_12550] a C-SSRS; if the Veteran's C-
SSRS is positive, the facilitator will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78815]. 
: All follow-up assessments will be collected in-person or via remote Follow-up Assessments
methods described above by [CONTACT_9137].
Follow-up assessment battery includes: Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS), C-SSRS “Since 
Last Contact,” Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ-15), NIH Toolbox Adult Social Relationship 
Scales, and Intervention Satisfaction Questionnaire (developed by [CONTACT_976]).
 Veterans are expected to participate in the Caring Cards groups for six months. Card makers:
Follow-up assessments will be collected within one month of the last group meeting. If a card 
maker drops out prior to the group's end date, follow-up will be collected within one month the 
last group meeting they attended. : Follow-up assessments will be collected Card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78819]. If a card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78820], 
follow-up will be collected within one month after the last card they received. 
 Feasibility for card makers will be assessed by [CONTACT_78866] & Acceptability:
enrolled Veterans who attend all scheduled Caring Cards groups. Feasibility for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78821]. For all participants, feasibility will be measured 
by [CONTACT_78867] 1) referred for screening, 2) determined eligible, 3) enrolled
/completed baseline, and 4) complete follow-up assessments. Feasibility of the optional meet-up 
groups will also be evaluated based on average attendance. Acceptability for all participants will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_78868], a measure that will be developed by 
[CONTACT_78869]’ satisfaction with their participation in the Caring 
Cards and meet-up groups (if attended), as well as asks for feedback about Caring Cards and 
assesses reasons for study dropout or non-attendance to meet-up groups.
: Participant Compensation Participants will be paid a total of $120 to complete the baseline 
and follow-up assessment ($60 each). No recruitment will take place year two. We would like to 
pay participants $120 at baseline, or $60 at each assessment (baseline and follow-up). 
: For groups, Caring Cards is a manualized intervention and the facilitator (trained by [CONTACT_78870]) will run the groups. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_78822] a fidelity rating 
scale, and feedback will be shared in weekly supervision. To assess fidelity for sending cards, 
quantity, timing, and receipt of the cards will be recorded by [CONTACT_1758]’s research assistant. The 
study coordinator will monitor the accuracy of this record.
In our original protocol we were approved to use VA-approved audio recording devices to record 
the groups to ensure fidelity. Given that some groups are likely to take place via telehealth, we 
would like to amend our protocol to include recording groups via WebEx. VA WebEx has a 
recording features and for all telehealth groups, we propose to use this feature to record the 
sessions. The recordings of these WebEx groups will be stored via within the VA WebEx account 
used to facilitate the group. These recordings will be stored via password protection behind VA 
firewall and encrypted VA-specific WebEx account (i.e., veteransaffairs.webex.com). Only study 
personnel will have access to these recordings. 
12.15.21 Amenment Meet-up Groups for Former Participants: We plan to invite former 
study participants - i.e., those who have completed thier follow-up assessments, to participate in 
our optional meet-up groups. As noted above, we plan to hold 120-minute optional, unstructured 
meetup groups at the VASDHS (Rio or LJ clinics) facilitated by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/research personnel. 
One to four meet-up groups may be offered throughout the study's duration. Meet-up groups will 
begin with an introduction to the purpose of the group (i.e., the facilitator will explain that this is 
an opportunity for the card makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78818]) followed by a review of 
basic group rules (i.e., limits of confidentiality will be reviewed, group members will be informed 
that they are free to come and go as they please, meaning they can arrive later than the 
designated start time and leave earlier than the end time, and the facilitator will be available if 
anyone has any questions or concerns). The facilitator will remind meet-up group attendees that 
if they are having thoughts of suicide or homicide, they should speak directly to them. If group is 
conducted virtually, the Veteran may ask the facilitator to call them after the group has 
concluded. If suicide is reported, the group's facilitator will further assess their risk by [CONTACT_12550] 
a C-SSRS; if the Veteran's C-SSRS is positive, the facilitator will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78823]. 
Former participants who agreed at consent to be re-contact[CONTACT_78871]-up groups. See telephone script. In addition feasibility and 
acceptability data will be collected from those who join. Specifically, we will record attendance 
(feasibility) and one to two weeks following the final meet-up group offered, former participants 
will be called and invited to answer follow-up questions based on their participation the meet-up 
groups (acceptability). See script.

written plan is available, attach a copy of the plan to the submission form.
Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation: This is a challenging aspect the study and so we have developed 
our procedures to be consistent with the recommendations of organizations such as NIH in 
clinical research in people with elevated suicide risk (e.g., Issues to Consider in Intervention 
Research with Persons at High Risk for Suicidality). We will further refine our procedures by [CONTACT_78872]. The referral sources for this study are 
VASDHS’ Veterans with inactive and active high-risk suicide flags. Veterans with active high-risk 
suicide flags are closely monitored and regularly assessed for suicide risk by [CONTACT_78873]’ 
Suicide Prevention Coordinator (SPCs). At baseline, participants are administered the C-SSRS55. 
Veterans are informed during consenting that all suicidal behavior is documented in Suicide 
Behavior Reports in CPRS if not already entered. If ideation exceeds a score of 2, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78824] a telephone evaluation and refer the screened potential participant to 
the SPCs or emergency services as necessary. Our safety monitoring guide details these 
procedures, how they are recorded, and what the staff, facility, and investigator responsibilities 
are. All Veterans are provided the contact [CONTACT_78874]’ Crisis Line. Any new 
suicidal behavior will be documented in the Suicide Behavior and Overdose Report in CPRS by 
[CONTACT_3647]. Participants who elect to withdraw from the study will continue to receive suicide 
prevention services per VA San Diego’s protocol. We will monitor these protocols during the 
course of the study and will make adjustments to inclusion/exclusion criteria or safety protocol in 
case of adverse events. 
All research personnel will complete VA TMS trainings pertinent to suicide prevention.
Confidentiality: In order to protect confidentiality, all participant data will be de-identified by 
[CONTACT_19917] a unique ID in computer files, and all physical files from the study will 
be kept in a locked cabinet in study offices at the Veterans Medical Research Foundation building 
in San Diego. All electronic data and files will be stored on a secure server. Only study 
investigators and personnel will have access to these data. All documentation will identify 
participants only by [CONTACT_78875]. 
 Section 9.11 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_3270]/Video Recordings of Patients
9.11) Describe the purpose of photographs (facial), or audio, or video recordings of patients.  Describe 
whether the recordings will contain, or potentially contain, identifiers.  Note: use of photographs or recordings 
must be covered in the informed consent process and documented consent documents (e.g., consent form, 
information sheets, telephone screen scripts).
To ensure fidelity of the Caring Cards groups, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78825]'s 
treatment delivery using a fidelity rating scale; feedback will be shared with the group leader in 
weekly supervision. Audio recordings of the Caring Cards groups will contain Veterans speaking; 
Veterans in the group may say the names of one another; however, other identifying information 
(e.g., SSN) will likely not be shared out loud by [CONTACT_78876]. 
The delivery of the assessments (baseline and follow-up) will also be audio recorded for quality 
assurance and fidelity. 
In our original protocol we were approved to use VA-approved audio recording devices to record 
the groups to ensure fidelity. Given that some groups are likely to take place via telehealth, we 
would like to amend our protocol to include recording groups via WebEx. VA WebEx has a 
recording features and for all telehealth groups, we propose to use this feature to record the 
sessions. The recordings of these WebEx groups will be stored via within the VA WebEx account 
used to facilitate the group. These recordings will be stored via password protection behind VA 
firewall and encrypted VA-specific WebEx account (i.e., veteransaffairs.webex.com). Only study 
personnel will have access to these recordings.
 Section 9.12 Off Station Activities
9.12) Describe each off-station activity including where it occurs, subject involvement, and any additional 
required protections.  Note:  if the off-station activity is being conducted under the approval authority of another 
institution, this is not VA offsite research and should be described as collaborative research effort.  Please contact 
[CONTACT_78877]-station activities will only apply if COVID-19 precautions are still in effective and participants 
cannot safely participate in the study in-person. 
In this case, off-station activity (e.g., Veterans' homes) will refer to: 1) Caring Cards group 
participation via WebEx, 2) optional meet-up groups via WebEx), and 3) collection of 
assessments via phone, VVC, or WebEx.
 Section 10 - Human Subjects
10) Describe the characteristics of the proposed subject population. Include age, gender, ethnicity, and health 
status as appropriate.  Note: Data about people are still considered “human subjects” by [CONTACT_1201], so even if you 
do not intend to contact [CONTACT_3282], you still describe the characteristics related to 
   the subjects whose charts you will review.
Provide inclusion and exclusion criteria as appropriate.  Provide a statement how non pregnancy is 
confirmed if pregnancy is an exclusion criteria.
For multisite studies, provide the total number of subjects from all sites and include description of the 
local site's role as a coordinating center if applicable.
Indicate the number of VA participants to be studied.
Indicate the estimated number of  subjects that will fail the screening process, if any. consented
The subject population in this study will be a total of 80 male and female Veterans (30 with 
inactive high-risk suicide flags and 50 current high-risk suicide flag). Potentially eligible 
participants will be screened by [CONTACT_3647]. Our inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected 
in order to increase the generalizability of our sample and broad reach. Participants will be of 
either gender and any race/ethnicity, decisional capacity, and at least 18 years of age. Complete 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are as follows:
Inclusion criteria for card makers: (1) VASDHS Veteran with an inactive HRF, (2) 18 years of age 
or older, (3) access to transportation to attend the group, and (4) decisional capacity.
Inclusion criteria for card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: (1) VASDHS Veteran with an active high-risk flag, (2) 18 
years of age or older, and (3) decisional capacity.
Exclusion criteria for all participants : (1) the absence of a mailing address or working phone 
number, (2) inability to read and write in English, (3) previous or current experience as either a 
card maker or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] (in original pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]), and (4) currently employed by [CONTACT_78878].
If COVID-[ADDRESS_86212], Veterans will also be screened for access to reliable 
compter, tablet, or smartphone with camera and internet access, as well as the willingness to 
participate in this study remotely. Participants' decisional capacity for informed consent in order 
to meet eligibility for this study will be assessed during consent (separate from screening 
call) via the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent 
(UBACC) will be collected by [CONTACT_9137]. 
 Section 10.2 Pregnant Women
10.2a) Are pregnant women the focus of the research?
  Yes    No
10.2b) Provide the justification for including pregnant women and address any special risks, protections, and 
safeguards.
Being pregnant is not an exclusion criterion for this study; they are not an explicit focus of this 
research. There are no risks associated with this study that would apply specifically to pregnant 
women.
 Section 11 - Recruitment
11) Describe, step-by-step, the plans for recruitment of subjects (or selection of subjects as in record review). 
This description must include how, when, and where potential subjects are approached as well as procedures 
for identifying potential participants (through medical records, physician referral, third-party 
sources, etc.).  Include how selection is equitable.  Indicate if vulnerability to coercion may be present and if so 
plans to ensure voluntary participation.
Recruitment: The VASDHS keeps record of all Veterans with inactive and active HRFs. A waiver 
of HIPAA authorization will be obtained in order to extract CPRS contact [CONTACT_3031] (i.e., mailing 
address and telephone number) of Veterans with inactive and active HRFs. A letter to prospective 
participants introducing the study (see letter attached to protocol submission) will be sent. 
Letters to Veterans with inactive HRFs will be sent by [CONTACT_78879], Eric Granholm, 
who is a co-I of this project. Letters sent to Veterans with active HRFs will be sent by [CONTACT_78880] (via phone and 
mail). Per standard protocol, two weeks after the letter is sent, the study coordinator will contact 
[CONTACT_78881]. 
For inpatient prospects, the study coordinator will consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Veteran’s 
treating inpatient teams to determine the appropriate timing of approaching Veteran on the unit. 
If appropriate, the study coordinator will conduct screening on the unit, and if agreeable to 
participate, consent and baseline assessments may be completed prior to or following discharge.
In our original protocol, we were approved to recruit participants by [CONTACT_78882] a telephone call two weeks after the letter.
We would like to amend our approach by [CONTACT_78861]. 
Specifically, we would like to approach VA healthcare providers/clinics (e.g., Primary Care Mental 
Health Integration, Center of Recovery Education, Mood Clinic, PTSD Clinic), with information 
about the study, asking them to share this information with their Veterans. 
Providers will share study information verbally and/or via study flyer (see below) with Veterans 
during their standard clinical interactions. If a Veteran is interested in learning more about the 
study, providers will ask their permission to have our study personnel reach out to them to 
discuss screening/enrollment. Providers will alert study personnel to interested Veterans via 
encrypted VA email or adding them as additional signers to Veterans’ CPRS progress notes.
Last, providers will inform Veterans that they can directly reach out to our study personnel if 
they are interested in participating. Contact [CONTACT_78883]. 
To facilitate recruitment via providers, we would like to share a study flyer with providers/clinics 
so they can distribute to their Veterans. Please see attached for a draft of our flyers – one for 
card makers and one for card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Moreover, we have an information flyer for providers, 
which we have included as well.
 Section 11.1 Recruitment Materials
11.1) Identify all recruitment materials (flyers, advertisements, letters, etc.) that will be used; include the web 
address for any web-based advertisements. The text of all communications with prospective participants must 
be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_3313].  You will be reminded to attach copi[INVESTIGATOR_3271].  Note:  Posting of flyers with pull tabs is not permitted 
within VASDHS (including the VMRF building).  However, you may request to advertise on the e-boards (located 
 at the elevators and throughout the facility) or on the VASDHS Research Opportunities web-page.
Below are the two introductory letters that will be mailed to each set of prospective participants 
(i.e., Veterans with inactive HRFs and active HRFs).

Card Makers (Inactive HRF)
XX/XX/20XX
Dear [INSERT VETERAN’S NAME],
My name [CONTACT_78919]. Eric Granholm. I am the Chief of Psychology at the San Diego VA. The reason for 
my letter is to inform you about a new research study taking place at the San Diego VA. Based 
on our records, you were identified as someone who may be eligible to participate. 
The study is called “Caring Cards.” This project focuses on creating opportunities for Veterans to 
help other Veterans who share similar mental health experiences. 
What is Caring Cards?
Caring Cards is a project where Veterans with lived mental health experience create handmade, 
one-of-a-kind cards that are sent to Veterans who may be in need of extra support. 
We would like to invite you join a weekly group where you and other Veterans will make caring 
cards for your fellow Veterans. These cards will then be sent to anonymous Veterans at the San 
Diego VA; they will not know your identity.
Caring Cards Group
Caring Cards group will meet once per week for [ADDRESS_86213] convenient for you. If we are unable to safely meet in person due 
to COVID-19, the groups may meet remotely (i.e., WebEx or VA Video Connect). 
These groups are considered to be a standard clinical service, so you may be eligible to receive 
travel reimbursement for your attendance. 
What would I need to do if I participated?
If you are eligible and choose to be in the study, you will be asked to participate for 
approximately [ADDRESS_86214], or online. 
You will also be invited to attend one or more monthly, 2-hour meet-up groups at the San Diego 
VA (La Jolla). These groups are completely optional, and you do not have to attend them as part 
of your participation in this study. These groups are meant to give Veterans who created the 
cards the opportunity to meet the Veterans who receive the cards. A total of four meet-up 
groups will be offered. Again, if COVID-[ADDRESS_86215]. 
As a thank you for your participation and taking the time to answer the two sets of 
questionnaires, you can earn up to $120 ($60 for each set of questionnaires completed). 
Will my information be kept secure?
We will keep your answers confidential and will not share your personal information with anyone 
outside of our research team. Participation in this study may involve a loss of privacy, but 
information about you will be handled as confidentially as possible. Your survey responses will be 
identified by a randomly generated number that will not be associated with any of your 
identifying information. Any research records that identify you will be kept only as paper records 
in a secure San Diego VA location or as electronic files behind the secure San Diego VA computer 
firewall.
What happens after this letter?
In approximately two weeks, a member of our research team will reach out to you by [CONTACT_78884]’re interested in participating in this study. Participating in this study is optional. 
If you do not want us to call you, please feel free to let me know by [CONTACT_78885], or you may decline via phone when the research team member reaches out.

during the consent process include exculpatory language through which the participant or legally authorized 
representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the participant’s legal rights or release or appear to 
release the Researcher, Sponsor, the VA or its agents from liability for negligence.
  Yes    No
12.1c) A master list of all VA subjects consented (written or not) under this protocol will be maintained.
 Agree  Disagree
12.1d) Identify the circumstances under which consent will be obtained including where the process will take 
place; any waiting period between describing the research and obtaining consent including sufficient time for 
the prospective participant to consider participation, and any steps taken to minimize the possibility of 
coercion or undue influence.
An introductory letter will be sent to all prospective participants, describing the research (see 
11.1 Ads & Flyers for details). Letters to Veterans with inactive HRFs will be sent by [CONTACT_78895], Eric Granholm, who is a co-I of this project. Letters sent to Veterans with active 
HRFs will be sent by [CONTACT_78896] (via phone and mail).
Prospective participants will have approximately two weeks to consider participation. Following 
two weeks from the date the letter was sent, a member of the research team will reach out to 
the Veteran via phone to determine if they are interested in being screened for the study. To 
minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence, the letters do not guarantee Veterans 
any direct benefits and clearly state participation in the study is options. There is also 
information in the letter for Veterans to opt out of being called by a member of the research 
team, as well as contact [CONTACT_78897], VA Research Service, 
VA Regional Counsel and the VASDHS Institutional Review Board should they have any questions 
or concerns about this study or their prospective participation. 
For all study prospective participants, after they have been screened, determined to be eligible 
to participate, and agree to participate, a member of the research team (e.g., study coordinator) 
will obtain Veterans' consent to participate in the study and assess decisional capacity for 
informed consent at this time. Consent may be obtained in person (at VA San Diego La Jolla or 
Rio clinic locations), via phone, WebEx, or VA Video Connect. As previously mentioned, if consent 
if obtained remotely, we will adhere to current approved guidelines (i.e., use My Health-e-Vet, 
using MS Azure, have Veteran send signed consent form via email, have Veterans fax, or have 
the study coordinator take a screen shot of the signed consent during their VVC or WebEx 
session).
For inpatient prospects, the study coordinator will consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Veteran’s 
treating inpatient teams to determine the appropriate timing of approaching Veteran on the unit. 
If appropriate, the study coordinator will conduct screening on the unit, and if agreeable to 
participate, consent and baseline assessments may be completed prior to or following discharge.
If a Veteran is conserved, the study coordinator will obtain their conservator's consent for study 
enrollment, as well as the assent of the conserved Veteran. 
Due to the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we plan to enroll participants via telehealth. 
In our original protocol, we received approval to obtain consents via telehealth. Per our original 
protocol, “If consent is obtained via phone or VVC, or WebEx, we will adhere to current approved 
guidelines (i.e., use My Health-e-Vet, using MS Azure, have Veteran send signed consent form 
via email, have Veterans fax, or have the study coordinator take a screen shot of the signed 
consent during their VVC or WebEx session).” We would like to amend this approach to include 
obtaining consent via the WebEx File Transfer feature. Below are the procedures that will be 
taken to obtain consent via this method.

The study investigators are requesting to use DocuSign (eSig) to consent participants. We 
received approval to use DocuSign (eSig) by [CONTACT_78903] 2/3/2021. 
ORD is providing us with 150 envelopes for this study. We've been instructed to work with our 
local IRB/research office to integrate the SOPs, which have been sent to the IRB team, into the 
local processes. I have corresponded with Debra Van Etten about next steps for setting up this 
process. 
Below are the steps the research team will take to use DocuSign (eSig) to consent participants:
1) Potential subjects will be mailed our IRB approved introductory letter explaining the study and 
providing a study staff contact [CONTACT_31308]. (These letters have already been IRB approved for 
both card makers and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]).
2) During the screening phone call with the potential subject (scripts have already been IRB 
approved), if the potential subject screens eligible and is interested in learning more about the 
study, the study team member will schedule a time to go over study documents (Informed 
Consent Form and HIPAA Authorization [or combined ICF/HIPAA]) using DocuSign. 
3) At the time of remote consenting, the study team member/consenter will send a DocuSign 
envelope (email containing links to the study documents) to the potential subject. The email will 
contain a reminder for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78836]. (See “Email Script” and “Stand Alone eSig service SOP,” section 3 [attached and 
highlighted for reference]).
4) At the scheduled time, the study team member (referred to as “consenter”) will contact [CONTACT_78904], VA Video Connect (VVC), or other approved secure communication 
method (i.e., WebEx). The consenter will guide the potential subject to open the DocuSign 
envelope (email) and the linked study documents therein. The consenter will open a copy of the 
study documents on their own computer as a reference. The consenter will review the study 
documents with the potential subject, ask questions to gauge comprehension, and answer any 
questions and concerns. If the potential subject agrees to participate in the study, the consenter 
will guide them to fill in the fields in the study documents (e.g., “Last, First, Middle Initial” name 
[CONTACT_78925], Last 4 SSN field, etc.) and to sign the documents. When the subject has signed the 
documents, they will click “FINISH” to finalize the documents.
5) While still on the phone/VVC (or other approved secure communication method, i.e., WebEx) 
with the subject, the consenter will receive an email notification to log into DocuSign. The 
consenter will verify that all fields are completed accurately and, if necessary, subsequently sign 
the document(s) (e.g., ICF). The consenter will guide the subject on how to download a copy
(ies) of the signed document(s) to the subject’s personal computer for their record. The 
consenter will thank the subject and end the call. 
6) The consenter will download a copy(ies) of the signed document(s) (see “Stand Alone eSig 
service SOP,” section 3) to a study folder in VA network drive (i.e., R:\Ehret) as study record. If 
necessary, the consenter can sign the ICF and save it back to this folder. The consenter will also 
place another copy(ies) of the signed document(s) in another study-specific folder (e.g. W:\) for 
HIMS to upload the documents into Electronic Health Record (EHR; i.e., VistA/CPRS or Cerner) 
(or other ways as agreed upon by [CONTACT_78905]). The consenter should notify HIMS that the 
documents need to be placed in the EHR (per local agreement). The consenter will then check 
the EHR one week later to ensure the documents have been uploaded. If the documents have 
been uploaded, the consenter will remove the documents from the W:\ drive. If the documents 
have not been uploaded within one week, the consenter will re-notify HIMS to upload the 
documents into the EHR.
7) The consenter will document the consenting process as a “Research/Informed Consent” note 
in the subject’s medical record (in CPRS). The note will specify that consent was obtained over 
phone/VVC/WebEx and DocuSign on the specific date. HIMS will attach the signed documents to 
this note.
 Section 12.6 Decisional Capacity Assessment
12.6a) Describe the method(s) for determination of decisional capacity: (see  for guidance)  ? Please note that 
 documentation of the assessement is required.
Participants must have decisional capacity for informed consent in order to meet eligibility for 
this study. To ensure this, the University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to 
Consent (UBACC) will be used. The UBACC is a 10-item questionnaire tailored to specific study 
procedures. It queries participants about the basic procedures, risks, benefits, and purpose of 
the study, along with participant rights. Each item on the UBACC is scored on a 0 (incapable) to 
2 (capable) scale. This will be administered at the time of obtaining informed consent. 
The following are the questions and answers to this study's UBACC for card makers and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:

 Section 12.7 Consent by [CONTACT_78906] (Surrogate Consent)
12.7a) Where endorsed by [CONTACT_1201], the following persons may be authorized to consent on behalf of persons 
 who lack decision-making capacity in the indicated order of priority: (a) Health care agent (i.e., an individual 
 named by [CONTACT_78907] a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (38 CFR.17.32(a)(iii)); (b) Legal 
 guardian or special guardian; (c) Next of kin in this order: a close relative of the patient 18 years of age or 
 older, in the following priority: spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild; (d) A close friend 
 [however, [LOCATION_004] Health and Safety Code §[ZIP_CODE] does NOT include the close friend category]  
 Agree  Disagree
12.7b) Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs) will be told that their obligation is to try to determine what 
 the subjects would do if able to make an informed decision. If the potential subject's wishes cannot be 
 determined, the LARs must be told they are responsible for determining what is in the subjects' best interests.
LARs generally assume the same rights and responsibilities as the individuals who lack decision-making 
capacity in the informed consent process.
 Agree  Disagree
12.7c) If feasible, the investigator will explain the proposed research to the prospective research subject even 
when the surrogate gives consent.  Although unable to provide informed consent, some persons may resist 
participating in a research (i.e., if they dissent) protocol approved by [CONTACT_78908]. Under no 
circumstances may a subject be forced or coerced to participate in a research study even if the LAR has 
provided consent.
 Agree  Disagree
12.7d) For subjects with fluctuating decision-making capacity or those with decreasing capacity to give 
consent, a re-consenting process with surrogate consent will be employed when needed
 Agree  Disagree

 Section 12.10 HIPAA Waivers and Alterations
12.10a) Describe the purpose/nature of the HIPAA waiver or alteration and list specifically, what identifiers 
and health information are being requested under the waiver/alteration and identify whether the waiver is 
for access, use, and/or collection of this information.
The purpose/nature of the HIPAA waiver is for screening activities; the study coordinator will 
need access to CPRS to collect and use potential subjects' names, telephone numbers, mailing 
address, SSNs, as well as CPRS medical records (notes) as they apply to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and the use of VASI. The following will be collected from the Veteran during the initial 
telephone screen. 
Inclusion criteria for card-makers: (1) VASDHS Veteran with an inactive high-risk flag, (2) 18 
years of age or older, (3) access to transportation to attend the group, and (4) decisional 
capacity. Inclusion criteria card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: (1) VASDHS Veteran with an active high-risk flag, (2) 
18 years of age or older, and (3) decisional capacity. Exclusion criteria for card makers and 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: (1) the absence of a mailing address, working phone number, and email address, (2) 
inability to read and write in English, (3) previous or current experience as either card maker or 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and (4) currently employed by [CONTACT_78863]. If COVID-[ADDRESS_86220], Veterans will also be screened for access to reliable computer, tablet, or smartphone with 
camera and internet access, as well as the willingness to participate in this study remotely. 
Participants' decisional capacity for informed consent in order to meet eligibility for this study will 
be assessed during consent (separate from screening call) via the University of [LOCATION_004] San 
Diego Brief Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC) will be collected by [CONTACT_20234]. 
12.10b) The proposed access, use, and/or disclosure of PHI involves no more than a minimal risk to the 
privacy of individuals.
 Agree  Disagree
12.10c) The plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure is adequate.
 Agree  Disagree
Describe the plan
To prevent improper use and disclosure of identifies, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78837], as stored it on a secure VA computer within a 
password protected file.
12.10d) An adequate plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the 
research, unless there is a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or such retention is 
otherwise required by [CONTACT_2371].
 Agree  Disagree
12.10d2) Describe the plan:
The secure database with identifiers will be destroyed at the earlier opportunity, consistent with 
RCS-10 guidelines.
12.10e) By [CONTACT_78909], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_78838], except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the 
research project, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information would

anemia records), by [CONTACT_78910] [INVESTIGATOR_78839], directly or 
indirectly, any individual patient or subject in any report of such research or otherwise disclose patient or 
subject identities in any manner. (Ref:  38 U.S.C. 7332(b)(2)(B))
 Agree  Disagree
12.10f) The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration.
 Agree  Disagree
12.10f2) Describe how the waiver/alteration enables the research to be conducted
The waiver is essential is for screening subjects and having access to CPRS to collect and use the 
names, telephone numbers, mailing address, as well as CPRS medical records (notes) as they 
apply to the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see 12.10a for details on what information will be 
collected during the telephone screens).
12.10g) The research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.
 Agree  Disagree
12.10g2) Describe why it would be impracticable to conduct this research without the PHI described 12.10a. (v3
/8/18)
Access to and use of the PHI is critical to identifying eligible participants, sending them an 
introductory letter to the study, and conducting a telephone screen thereafter. The present study 
depends entirely on access to this PHI and could not be completed without it.
 Section 13 - Alternatives to Participation
13) Describe the alternatives to participation in this research study (see  for guidance) ?
The alternative to participation is to not participate. Veterans with inactive HRFs may participate 
in other VASDHS mental health groups; Veterans with active HRFs may continue receiving 
regular outreach by [CONTACT_78911]' Suicide Prevention Coordinators (e.g., phone calls).
 Section 14 - Potential Risks
14) Describe any potential or known risks or discomforts and assess their likelihood and seriousness (see  for ?
guidance)
There are minimal risks to participating in the Caring Cards group, meet-up groups (optional), or 
receiving cards. 
Disclosure or Identification of Suicidal Ideation or Intent to Harm Self: Participants to be enrolled 
are at elevated risk of suicide and reporting active suicidal ideation. During structured interviews 
concerning suicide (via the C-SSRS and BSS) or extemporaneous discussion with rater or other 
staff, participants may disclose a level of risk of harming themselves that would require a higher 
level of care. Further, during the intervention, participants may experience an increase in suicidal 
ideation beyond that which they reported at baseline. 
Assessments: The questionnaires are non-invasive clinical assessments associated with minimal 
risk. All measures are physically non-invasive, have been used in prior studies with seriously 
mentally ill participants, and have been found to elicit minimal distress and discomfort. 
Nevertheless, participation in the psychosocial evaluation and responding to questions will 
require time and attention. Some participants may become bored or fatigued completing the 
evaluation. Some participants may also become distressed during the psychiatric evaluation, 
which requires them to discuss their current symptoms.
Intervention Period: Risks involved in participating in this intervention are minimal. During the 
Baseline assessment and follow-up assessments, participants may experience feelings of anxiety 
or discomfort while talking about themselves and/or symptoms. Participants may also become 
fatigued by [CONTACT_78912]. 
In addition, card makers may experience some discomfort drawing upon their lived mental 
health experience to create caring cards for other Veterans in need. Card recipi[INVESTIGATOR_78840], as it may remind them of their mental health concerns. 
Participants do not have to answer any assessment question they do not want to, and can decide 
at any time to withdrawal from the study.
Confidentiality: As with any research study, a risk of disclosure of personal material exists.
COVID-19 Exposure: During the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face visits (i.e., group 
participation and assessments) present risk for virus exposure. 
 Section 15 - Risk Management
15) Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks/discomforts, and the 
adequacy of resources for conducting the study and resources participants may need as a consequence of the 
research.  When applicable, include detail of the following safety measures:   (a) The type of safety 
information to be collected, including AEs; (b) Frequency of safety data collection; (c) 
Frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data; (d) Statistical tests for analyzing the 
safety data to determine if harm is occurring; and (e) Conditions that trigger an immediate suspension 
of the research.  See  for further requirements. ?
During the telephone screening portion of our study, risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_2329] a set of 
screening questions that will elicit the least amount of sensitive or personal information 
necessary to assess eligibility. Only qualified interviewers with significant prior experience in 
treatment or assessment of relevant populations/conditions will conduct these assessments. All 
study personnel will be trained, observed, and certified by [CONTACT_1758]'s PI, who is a licensed 
clinical psychologist. The first three months of this study will be included focused training on 
assessment administration. For example, the C-SSRS has a standard series of training videos 
that study personnel will undergo to ensure proper administration of this instrument. Standardize 
trainings will take place for any instruments where this type of formal training is available. 
In addition, to further mitigate risk participants will be informed that they do not have to answer 
any question they do not want to, and can decide, at any time, if they want to withdrawal from 
the study. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_78841]. 
If during the course of the study participants experience an adverse reaction during screening, 
assessment administration, or group participation (i.e., for card makers), imminent risk for 
suicide is determined, or a suicide attempt (that has not been previously recorded) is disclosed, 
the research team will adhere to the following to ensure Veterans' safety. 
Monitoring of Suicidal Ideation: This is a challenging aspect the study and so we have developed 
our procedures to be consistent with the recommendations of organizations such as NIH in 
clinical research in people with elevated suicide risk (e.g., Issues to Consider in Intervention 
Research with Persons at High Risk for Suicidality). We will further refine our procedures by [CONTACT_78872]. The referral sources for this study are 
VASDHS’ Veterans with inactive and active high-risk suicide flags. Veterans with active high-risk 
suicide flags are closely monitored and regularly assessed for suicide risk by [CONTACT_78873]’ 
Suicide Prevention Coordinator (SPCs). At baseline and follow-up, participants are administered 
the C-SSRS and BSS. Veterans are informed during consenting that all suicidal behavior is 
documented in Suicide Behavior Reports in CPRS if not already entered. 
As such, if any of the following items are endorsed (respective item scores are noted below) on 
the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS) a LIP will be notified immediately:
• Item 4 (2)
• Item 9 (1 or higher)
• Item 13 (2)
• Item 14 (2)
• Item 15 (2)
• Item 16 (1 or higher)
• Item 17 (1 or higher)
• Item 18 (2)
• Item 20 (1 or higher)
If any of the following items are endorsed on the C-SSRS (initial screener):
• Item 4 (Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan) 
• If a Veteran answers "Yes" to the question about preparatory acts or behaviors within the past 
month - i.e., "Have you taken any steps towards making a suicide attempt or preparing to kill 
yourself (such as collecting pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], getting a gun, giving valuables away or writing a suicide note)?"
If any of the following items are endorsed on the C-SSRS (since last contact):
• Item 4, "Have you had any intention of acting on these thoughts of killing yourself? (As 
opposed to you have the thoughts, but you definitely would not act on them?)"
• Item 5, "Have you started to work out, or actually worked out, the specific details of how to kill 
yourself and did you intend to carry out your plan?"
• Item 6 "Have you done anything, started to do anything, or prepared to do anything to end 
your life?"
Our safety monitoring guide details these procedures, how they are recorded, and what the staff, 
facility, and investigator responsibilities are. All Veterans are provided the contact [CONTACT_78913]’ Crisis Line. Any new suicidal behavior will be documented in the Suicide Behavior 
and Overdose Report in CPRS by [CONTACT_3647]. Participants who elect to withdraw from the 
study will continue to receive suicide prevention services per VA San Diego’s protocol. We will 
monitor these protocols during the course of the study and will make adjustments to inclusion
/exclusion criteria or safety protocol in case of adverse events. 
Adverse events in this research project are expected to be extremely rare. However, we have 
established plans for resolving any adverse event should one occur. First, during screening for 
the project, trained research personnel will assess (using standardized screening tools) for any 
serious medical or psychological conditions that may require immediate medical attention or 
psychiatric treatment. The rationale for this is because the presence of serious medical or 
psychiatric conditions would make these individuals inappropriate for the proposed research 
study. Should attention be required, staff will provide these individuals with information about 
suitable referrals, including local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], clinics, and/or relevant healthcare and mental health 
professionals, and they will strongly encourage the individuals to follow up with these referrals. 
All research personnel will complete VA TMS trainings pertinent to suicide prevention.
Confidentiality: In order to protect confidentiality, all participant data will be de-identified by 
[CONTACT_19917] a unique ID in computer files, and all physical files from the study will 
be kept in a locked cabinet in study offices at the Veterans Medical Research Foundation building 
in San Diego. All electronic data and files will be stored on a secure server. Only study 
investigators and personnel will have access to these data. All documentation will identify 
participants only by [CONTACT_78875]. 
COVID-19 exposure: To mitigate participants' exposure to COVID-19, web (i.e., VVC, WebEx) or 
telephone-based visits may be used instead of face-to-face visits.
WebEx and DocuSign Consenting:
Veterans may feel uncomfortable using WebEx and DocuSign to sign consent forms. To mitigate 
this, we will offer alternative routes to obtaining signed informed consent, including the 
approaches in our original approved protocol (i.e., use My Health-e-Vet, using MS Azure, have 
Veteran send signed consent form via email, have Veterans fax, or have the study coordinator 
take a screen shot of the signed consent during their VVC or WebEx session).
Inclusion/exclusion criteria card makers:
With our additional exclusion criteria for card makers, we may exclude Veterans without access 
to reliable forms of technology. To mitigate this, we will either (1) invite Veterans to consider 
participating in an in-person group (if offered during study’s duration), or (2) remind Veterans of 
alternatives to participation (i.e., other VASDHS mental health groups).
 Section 17 - Potential Benefits
17) Discuss benefits that may be gained by [CONTACT_3315]  (see  ?
for guidance)
There is no guaranteed direct benefit to Veterans who participate in this study. This study has 
the potential to enhance our understanding the feasibility and acceptability of Caring Cards as a 
potential suicide prevention intervention, and may improve Veterans' satisfaction with VASDHS 
services. 
Participation in CC may not directly benefit to participants. However, benefits to the individual 
participants may include increased social connectedness and sense of purpose. Participants’ 
suicide risk and related behaviors may decrease. They may be more engaged in subsequent 
mental health appointments as well.
 Section 18 - Risk/Benefit Analysis
18) Discuss why the risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits to subjects and in 
relation to the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.
There are minimal risks to participants (e.g., Veterans may feel discomfort answering questions 
and/or making/receiving cards), and although there are no guaranteed direct benefits, there are 
potential benefits that could improve Caring Cards, as a suicide prevention intervention, as well 
as Veterans' satisfaction with VASDHS' services. In addition, participation may enjoy connecting 
with one another, receiving support from another Veteran, and doing something kind for another 
Veteran in need. COVID-19 exposure during face-to-face visits is another potential risk for 
participants. As such, web (i.e., VVC, WebEx) or telephone-based visits may be used instead of 
face-to-face visits.
 Section 20 - Compensation for Participation
20) Provide all details and justifications of the compensation plan.  See  for detailed requirements. ?
Participants will be paid a total of $120 to complete baseline and follow-up assessments ($60 
each). We elected to provide compensation for participation due to the time commitment these 
assessments will require. 
We would like to include two options to pay participants: 
Option #1 - pay $120 at baseline
Option #2 - pay participants at two assessment timepoints ($60 baseline and $60 follow-up)

In addition, the following OCT scan types will be captured for the P200TxE only (not available in P200TE)  
• Ultra -widefield Line – averaged scan 6 mm  
• Ultra -widefield  Extended Line – averaged scan 23mm  
• Ultra -widefield volume – 6mm x 6mm, 121 B scans  
• Ultra -widefield HD volume scan – 6mm x 3mm, [ADDRESS_1023091] comparison of grader scores will be  made between similar scans from the two devices, 
including: Line scans, Raster scans, Retina Topography scans, and ONH scans.  An analysis of grader’s 
scores fo r the 4 scan types available in the P200TxE but not the P200TE will also be made.  These scan 
types included:  Ultra -widefield line scan, Ultra -widefield extended line scan, ultra -widefield volume 
scan, and ultra -widefield HD volume scan.   
 
Image grading procedure  
B scan images will be assessed for clinical utility and image quality by [CONTACT_747746].  The results will be compared between the predicate device 
and the investigational device .   
 
All scans will be reviewed for image acceptance based on generally accepted industry standards, and 
scans that do not pass will be excluded (e.g., scans with blinks, eye movements, clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007],etc, are 
considered to be artifacts are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_747733]).  Scans will be reviewed based 
on specific image characteristics described in Appendix A.  Excluded scans will not be graded.  The 
operator will evaluate the scans for quality at the time of image acquisition.  Unacceptable scans w ill be 
re-captured until an acceptable scan is obtained  [up to three attempts to capture an acceptable scan] .   
 
For scans containing multiple B scans such as 3D cube or volume scans (e.g., Retinal topography scan), 
the entire set of B scans will be review ed and graded as a whole (one grade for entire B scan series 
within a single 3D volume).  All scans will be reviewed for grading using a Dicom viewer from Optos 
called OA (Optos Advance).  This viewing software will not provide any information about which device 
the scan came from or any other identifiable information.  Scans will be in a randomized order and 
numbered sequentially.  Graders will not compare scores and will perform all grading independently of 
each other.    
 
Three independent graders will a ssess the B scans for each scan type from each subject and grade 
them for clinical utility and image quality.  Graders will evaluate a single B scan at a time and will be 
masked to which device the B scan came from.   
 
Images will be graded based on both c linical utility and image quality.  Clinical utility means is there 
structural information present in the image that is helpful to aid in clinical decisions such as diagnosing 
or managing ocular diseases in the eye.  Image quality means does the image have  sufficient quality to 
clearly view the relevant structures within the eye.   
 
Statistics Summary  
In general, descriptive statistics (mean  and standard deviation) will be used to summarize the data by 
[CONTACT_747747].  Results for the clinical utility qu estions and the image quality questions will be 
presented separately.    
 
The total number of scans  taken  and the total number of evaluable scans will be summarized by [CONTACT_747748].  
 
A kappa analysis will be performed to determine the level of agreement between the graders and 
between devices.

Title:  Clinical Investigation Plan  REVISION  4 Part No:  SP1027F1  
Owner:  Clinical Trials Manager  Page  [ADDRESS_1023093] scanning laser ophthalmoscope and optical coherence tomographer 
intended for in -vivo digital imaging of posterior ocular structures, including the vitro -retinal interface, 
retina, retin al layers, optic disc, choroid and choroido -scleral interface. It is indicated for producing 
high-resolution, wide field, en -face reflectance images, auto fluorescence images, fluorescein 
angiography images, indocyanine green angiography images, and axial  cross -sectional images of 
the posterior ocular structures.   
 
The system shall enable practitioners to capture multi -modal images in support of detection , 
investigation and monitoring of retinal conditions.   
 
The P200TxE instrument uses red and green laser illumination for reflectance imaging, enabling it 
to image pathology throughout the layers of the retina, from the sensory retina and nerve fiber layer, 
through the retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_1836] (RPE) and down to the choroid. The image can be separated 
to present the distinct retinal sub -structures associated with the individual imaging wavelengths.  
 
The P200TxE instrument uses green laser illumination to excite autofluorescence (AF) emission 
from the naturally occurring lipofuscin in the human fundus.  
 
The P200TxE instrument uses infrared laser illumination for reflectance imaging simultaneously 
with OCT imaging. Infra -red reflectance images are used to track eye position during OCT imaging 
and are not available to the user. The P200TxE instrument uses i nfrared swept -source laser 
illumination for optical coherence tomography allowing a depth profile of the reflectance of the 
human fundus to be recorded.  
 
The P200TxE images the eye via two ellipsoidal mirrors arranged so that a focal point of one of the 
mirrors coincides with a focal point of the other mirror; a mirrored scanner is also located at this 
common focal point. The pupil of the subject’s eye is placed at one of the other focal points. A 
second mirrored scanner is located at the remaining focal point; a laser reflected off this scanner 
is relayed onto the second scanner by [CONTACT_747749]. The second scanning element is different 
for OCT a nd SLO imaging. The energy reflected back from the retina, or emitted by [CONTACT_747750]; the images are generated from the captured 
detector data.  
 
The P200TxE refers to the scanhead component of the system, tog ether with touchscreen and 
hand controller.   It is supported by [CONTACT_747751], which delivers patient management and image 
storage, as well as interfacing with the business systems and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747734].   The images are captured by [CONTACT_747752] a database structure to hold the images and patient 
information. For subsequent image review, a number of viewing PC’s are connected remotely or 
via a local area network to the image server. The patient records and images are then accessible 
in a distributed format suited to the physical layout of the eye -care practice.  
 
Images can be reviewed through OptosAdvance review software (K162039) either on the image 
server, or on individual review stations, or other DICOM compliant PACS viewers.

in what is called ‘Time Domain’ and scanned at speeds  of 400 A scans per second with a depth 
resolution of 10 microns (e.g., Stratus OCT).  Time Domain methodology utilized a moving reference 
arm to get structural information at different retinal depths.  More recently, a new methodology was 
developed called  Fourier Domain or Spectral Domain OCT (e.g., P200TE).  This method uses a 
stationary reference arm and employs a spectrometer and a Fourier transform to obtain structural 
information.  This allowed scan speeds to increase between 25,[ADDRESS_1023095] -band light source.  
Currently, the new investigational device (P200TxE) utilizes a third generation method called Swept 
Source OCT and can san at speeds of 100,000 A s cans per second.   
1.3 Device Risk Analysis and Risk Assessment  
The sponsor believes that the “ Comparative Qualitative OCT Image Grading Study of the Optos P200TE 
and the P200TxE  in Glaucoma Patients ” is a Nons ignificant Risk study because the Optos P200T xE 
device: 
- is not intended as an implant;  
- is not purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life;  
- is not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or 
otherwise preventing impairment of human hea lth; and  
- does not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject.  
 
Both the investigational and predicate devices also comply with ISO [ADDRESS_1023096] scans to compare the qualitative images produced 
by [CONTACT_747744] P200TxE to the FDA cleared Optos P200TE (K173707)  in glaucoma patients .  Qualitative 
imaging grading assessment of the scan types captured from the investigative P200TxE device and the 
cleared P200TE will be used to compare and determ ine whether the P200TxE scans are equivalent or 
better than the P200TE.  The qualitative evaluation will be based on the clinical utility and image quality 
of the B scans . 
2.2 Primary Endpoint   
The primary endpoint will be the qualitative assessment of the  B scans from each device based on pre -
specified grading criteria from three independent masked and qualified graders.

6.2.1  Optos P200T xE 
 
The Optos P200T xE Ophthalmoscope encompasses a widefield Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope 
(SLO) and an Optical Coherence Tomographer (OCT), allowing this one device to capture -high 
resolutio n images of the peripheral retina as well as its central structures. Widefield Scanning Laser 
Ophthalmoscope (SLO) fundus imaging is achieved using scanning red and green lasers. These laser 
wavelengths penetrate the retinal structures to different depths,  each wavelength providing information 
for interpretation . In autofluorescence (AF) mode, the device captures optomap af images using the 
green laser to illuminate the eye. This allows an image of the natural fluorescence of the eye to be 
captured. In addi tion to AF, the P200TxE can also capture FA and ICGA.  OCT imaging uses swept 
source OCT methodology to construct axial and cross -sectional scans.  
 
The P200TxE is a non -contact [CONTACT_747755] i n-vivo digital imaging of posterior ocular structures, including the vitro -retinal interface, 
retina, retinal layers, optic disc, choroid and choroido -scleral interface. It is indicated for producing high -
resolution, wide field, en -face reflectance images,  auto fluorescence images, fluorescein angiography 
images, indocyanine green angiography images, and axial  cross -sectional images of the posterior 
ocular structures.   
 
The system shall enable practitioners to capture multi -modal images in support of detection, 
investigation and monitoring of retinal conditions.   
 
 
6.2.2 P200T E (predicate device)  
The Optos P200TE Ophthalmoscope (K173707) encompasses a widefield Scanning Laser 
Ophthalmoscope (SLO) and an Optical Coherence Tomographer (OCT), allowing this one device to 
capture -high resolution images of the peripheral retina as well as its central str uctures. Widefield 
Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) fundus imaging is achieved using scanning red and green 
lasers. These laser wavelengths penetrate the retinal structures to different depths, each wavelength 
providing information for interpretation. I n autofluorescence (AF) mode, the device captures optomap af 
images using the green laser to illuminate the eye. This allows an image of the natural fluorescence of 
the eye to be captured. OCT imaging is achieved using an infrared broadband Super Luminesce nt Diode 
(SLD) source and spectral domain OCT methodology to construct axial and cross -sectional scans.   
 
The P200TE is indicated for use as a non -contact, scanning laser ophthalmoscope and optical 
coherence tomographer intended for in vivo viewing and di gital imaging of posterior ocular structures, 
including the retina, retinal nerve fibre layer, and optic disc.  It is indicated for producing high -resolution, 
widefield, en face reflectance images, autofluorescence images, and axial cross -sectional images of 
posterior ocular structures.  There are no known contraindications for the Optos P200TE  
6.3 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will not be recorded for this study , however if any adverse events described 
in section 8 occur during the trial,  the medications will be recorded .  
7 ASSESSMENT OF IMAGES  
B scan i mages  will be assessed for clinical utility and quality .  The results will be compared for the 
predi cate device and the investigational device.   Performance results that are similar or better for the 
investigational device’s images will provide clinical evidence for substancial equivalence of the images .

 All images will be reviewed in OA software and the images will be in a randomized order for grading and

7.1 Image Grading  
 
B scan images will be assessed for clinical utility and image quality by [CONTACT_747756] e is completed.  The results will be compared between the predicate device 
and the investigational device.   
 
All scans will be reviewed for image acceptance based on generally accepted industry standards, and 
scans that do not pass will be excluded (e.g.,  scans with blinks, eye movements, clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007],etc, are 
considered to be artifacts are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_747736]).  Scans will be reviewed based 
on specific image characteristics described in Appendix A.  Excluded scans will not be graded.  The 
operator will evaluate the scans for quality at the time of image acquisition.  Unacceptable scans will be 
re-captured until an acceptable scan is obtained  [up to three attempts to capture an acceptable scan].   
 
For scans containing multiple B scans such as 3D cube or volume scans (e.g., Retinal topography scan), 
the entire set of B scans will be reviewed and graded as a whole (one grade for entire B scan series 
within a single 3D volume).  All scans will be reviewed for grading using a Dicom viewer f rom Optos 
called OA (Optos Advance).  This viewing software will not provide any information about which device 
the scan came from or any other identifiable information.  Scans will be in a randomized order and 
numbered sequentially . Graders will not compa re scores and will perform all grading independently of 
each other.    
 
Three independent graders will assess the B scans for each scan type from each subject and grade 
them for clinical utility and image quality.  Graders will evaluate a single B scan at a time and will be 
masked to which device the B scan came from.   
 
Images will be graded based on both clinical utility and image quality.  Clinical utility means is there 
structural information present in the image that is helpful to aid in clinical decis ions such as diagnosing 
or managing ocular diseases in the eye.  Image quality means does the image have sufficient quality to 
clearly view the relevant structures within the eye.   
 
For clinical utility, the graders will assess specific structures and fea tures in each B scan including: 1)  
the RNFL, 2) inner and outer retinal layers, 3) RPE complex, and 4) choroid .  Note, the RPE complex is 
defined as the region in between the photoreceptor IS/OS boundary down to Bruch’s membrane which 
includes the RPE lay er proper.   Each structure will be graded on a 4 point scale (0 -3) described below.  
 
For image quality, the graders will assess the B scan as a whole (not specific features or structures).   
As a whole, the image will be graded on a 4 point scale (0 -3) desc ribed below.  
 
The four point grading scale is defined as follows:  
 
A score of 0  indicates the scan is a failure, and contains no clinically useful information.  No relevant 
structures are visible in the scan.    
 
A score of 1  indicates the condition of the structure or feature being assessed is poor , and it contains 
very limited clini cal utility.  Only limited structural information is available in the scan and the feature 
being evaluated is difficult to assess.  This type of scan provides only very limited clinical information 
and is not very helpful for making clinical decisions.  Th e clinical utility is low or poor.    
 
A score of 2  indicates the condition of the structure or feature being assessed is fair or average.  It 
contains some useful clinical information and therefore provides adequate clinical utility.  Relevant 
structures a re generally visible in the scan and the scan contains useful information to help guide 
clinical decisions.  The clinical utility of this scan is acceptable or average for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] B scan.

A score of 3  indicates the condition of the structure or featur e being assessed is good .  It contains 
useful clinical information.  Relevant structures are clearly visible and it is helpful to guide clinical 
decisions.  The clinical utility is high or good.    
 
For 3D cube or volumetric scans, all B scans will be revie wed and grading will be performed on the 
entire image set as a whole (all B scans graded together as a whole).  
 
The grading report form is shown in Appendix B.  A grading guideline  document  was used to define the 
grading scale and provide several examples of each category and is provided in Appendix C.  These 
examples of each grade category were reviewed and agreed to  by a retina specialist . 
[ADDRESS_1023105] of Adverse Events and Adverse Device 
Effects, including Anticipated Adverse Device Effects and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects.  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (including intercurrent illness) experienced 
by a subject during their participation in a clinical trial .  The adverse event may not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with trial treatment or device, but does have a temporal relationship with trial 
treatment or device.  
 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is any untoward or unintended response to a medical device.  This 
definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or 
the deployment of the device.  This definition also includes any event that is a result of user error.  An 
exacerbation of a p re-existing condition is an adverse event.  
 
Adverse events (AEs) and adverse device effects (ADEs) will be recorded as they are reported whether 
spontaneously volunteered or in response to questioning about well-being  at trial visits.  The questioning 
abou t AEs and ADEs will cover the current visit as well as the period of time between the previous and 
the current visit.   
 
All AEs and ADEs will be documented in the subject’s medical records and CRF.  All AEs and ADEs 
must be followed until resolution, or f or at least [ADDRESS_1023106].  
 
The investigator will assess causal relationship of the AE or ADE to the investigational device according 
to the following classification:  
 
• None: No relationship with i nvestigational device.  Other factor(s) certainly or probably causative.  
• Unlikely:  Time relationship non -existent or doubtful and/or other factor(s) certainly or probably 
causative.  
• Possible:  Time relationship exists.  Reasonable possibility that the eve nt was caused by [CONTACT_8121].  
Other possible causative factor(s) may exist.  
• Probable/Definite:  Time relationship exists.  The event was certainly or probably caused by [CONTACT_133238].  Other possible causative factor(s) may exist.  A specific laboratory inves tigation (if 
performed) has confirmed the relationship.  
 
The following definitions for rating severity of AEs and ADEs may be used:

• Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but these are easily tolerated and are transient mildly 
irritating only.  There is no loss of time from normal activities and symptoms do not require 
medication or a medical evaluation.  
• Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities or require therapeutic 
intervention e.g. concomitant medication.  
• Severe:  Incapa city with inability to do work or do usual activities.  
8.[ADDRESS_1023107] (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current protocol.  
 
Any serious adverse effects on health or safety or any life threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity 
or degree of incidence in the protocol or application (including a supplementary plan or application) or 
any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety or 
welfare of Subjects.  The occurrence of any Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect must be re ported to 
the Sponsor  within [ADDRESS_1023108]’s medical records and CRF.  All UADEs must be followed until resolution, or for at least 
[ADDRESS_1023109].  
Within 24  hours of the sponsor receiving and initial Serious Adverse Event (SAE) & Unatcipated Adverse 
Device Effect (UADE) Reporting Form, The Sponsor will conduct an initial review of the available 
information and determine if the event meets the requirements for  reporting to the regulatory authorities  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1023110] Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects can withdraw from the study at any time.  Subjects who cannot comply with imaging ca n 
withdraw but will be asked why they could not complete imaging;  this will be recorded for final results.  
or the investigator can with draw the subject if they have  an adverse event associated with the study 
procedure.  All adverse events must be followed  up until resolution, or for at least [ADDRESS_1023111] a wide range of

9.4 Methods of Analysis  
 
9.4.1  Statistical Plan  
In general, descriptive statistics (mean  and standard deviatio n) will be used to summarize the data by 
[CONTACT_747747].  Results for the clinical utility assessment  and the image quality assessment  will be 
presented separately.   
 
The total number of scans taken and the total number of evaluable scans will be summarized by [CONTACT_747758], device and subject population.  
 
A kappa analysis will be performed to determine the level  of agreement between the graders and 
between devices.   
 
These performance results will be reviewed to determine whether the investigational device’s images 
are similar or better than the predicate device.   
 
Analysis of Qualitative Imaging Grading Study Endpoints  
Analysis of the image grading results will include descriptive statistics for each scan type and each 
disease group for both devices.  Means  and standard deviation s will be compared.  Agreement between 
graders and between devices will be determin ed using a kappa statistic.   
 
Analysis of Safety Endpoints  
Adverse events reported will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
 
9.4.2  Primary Endpoint  
The clinical performance testing analysis will include all images that represent the range of equivalent 
scan patt ern for P200TE and the P200Tx E as detailed in 6.1.  The qualitative image grading will solely 
focus on the clinical utility and image quality of the B scans  (plus the clinical evaluation ).  Please refer

During all OCT imaging, the following criteria should be met:  
• The Scanni ng Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) image should have uniform illumination and 
there should not be any shadowing on the edges of the OCT image. The focus should be 
sharp and clear. The fovea or optic nerve head should be centered in the SLO image.  
• The OCT image should be centred on the fovea or optic nerve head. There should be 
minimal artefacts that may affect the signal of the OCT scan.  
 
Overall Signal Strength  
Overall signal strength is measured by [CONTACT_747762] -to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR is calculated by [CONTACT_747763]. SNR has a major impact on OCT image quality and 
therefore could determine the ability to define i nner retinal layers and retinal boundaries. The SNR 
indicator is displayed during and after the OCT image is captured. Higher SNR results in higher quality 
images. The SNR has a range of 10/10 (maximum) to 1/10 (minimum). SNR of 9/10 to 10/[ADDRESS_1023128] SNR is affected by [CONTACT_747764] -dependent (influenced) factors: patient -depen dent corneal 
birefringence, patient eye polarization, pupil size, dry eyes, voluntary and involuntary eye movements, 
poor focusing of the retina (object), and misalignment of the instrument in relationship to the eye/pupil.  
Local Signal Strength  
A local w eak signal can occur when areas of the image have little to no signal. This can occur even 
when other areas of the image have a strong signal. Areas with local weak signals appear as black or 
dark areas from which retinal layers cannot be easily identified . Often, local weak signals are the results 
of eye movement or blinks. Other causes of local weak signals include media opacities, dry eyes, 
floaters and improper alignment of the eye during the time the image was taken. If a local weak signal 
does not cov er essential parts of the image (i.e. fovea) the device operator should document the image 
as evaluable. If a local weak signal covers essential parts of the image, the device operator should 
document the image as non-evaluable .

 Eye Movements – It is possible that the patient may have an eye -movement during the scan 
acquisition.  This can result in a shift or shearing in the resulting image.  This can be visualized by a 
break in the blood vessel patterns or optic disc.  It can also make the fovea distorted and lose it 
regular round appearance.  Very small eye mov ements can be ignored as long as they do not affect 
important structures such as the fovea or optic disc.  If the eye movement is large or if it affects the 
fovea or optic disc, it should be excluded.  
The Optos software will automatically signal the presen ce of possible eye movements.  This is 
displayed on the image review screen (see Figure 3 below).  When eye movements are 
detected, the operator should review all B scans in the image to confirm the possible presence 
of eye movements.  A review of the B sc ans will show a strong and sudden shifting of key 
structures between B scans.  If these occur near the fovea or optic disc, the image should be 
excluded.  If the eye movements are not confirmed or do not affect the fovea or optic disc, the 
image can be acc epted into the study.  
 
 
Figure 3.  The software detected possible eye movements.  The B scans in this image should be 
reviewed to confirm the presence of eye movements that affect the fovea or optic disc.  
 
 
Eye Blinks  
 
 
Eye Blinks – It is possible that the patient may have an eye -blink during the scan acquisition.  This can 
result in a blank B scan (because the eye was closed when the B scan was captured.  This can be 
visualized by [CONTACT_46917] a blank B scan(s) within  the scan (see Figure 4).  If the blink occurs near 
the fovea or optic disc, the scan should be excluded.   
 
The Optos software will automatically signal the presence of possible eye blinks.  This is displayed on 
the image review screen (see Figure 4 below ).  When eye blinks are detected, the operator should 
review all B scans in the image to confirm the possible presence of eye blinks.  A review of the B scans 
will show a missing B scan(s).  If these occur near the fovea or optic disc, the image should be excluded.  
If the eye blinks are not confirmed or do not affect the fovea or optic disc, the image can be accepted 
into the study.

this case, the B scan is missing and the scan should be excluded.  
 
 
Clippi[INVESTIGATOR_747737] – When the operator takes a scan, they must ensure the retina is located within 
the scan window based on viewing a live OCT B scan image.  The height of the retina can be adjusted 
within this window based on z -motor position and working distance to the eye.  If the retina is too high 
in the window and it touches the top of the scan window, some of it may be clipped and there will be 
missing retinal data.  If the retina is too low in the window and it touches the bottom of the scan 
window, some of it may be clipped and there will be missing retinal data.  If there is clippi[INVESTIGATOR_747738], there will be missing data and the scan should be 
excluded.  If the clippi[INVESTIGATOR_747739], the scan may be 
accepted.  If it does occur near the fovea or optic disc within the measurement area, it should be 
excluded.

Centration of Essential Structures  
The fovea should be in the center of the image for all macula scans, and the optic disc should be 
centered for all optic disc scans. The device operator should document any images in which the 
alignment grid reaches the  edge of the image as non-evaluable .

 APPENDIX C – B SCAN IMAGE GRADING GUIDE AND INSTRUCTIONS  
 
This guide provides the descritpi[INVESTIGATOR_747742] B scans for Image content and Quality.  
It is useful as a training guide to explain the scoring system with examples.  
 
Below is a high quality B scan through the fovea that clearly shows and labels the major retina features 
that can be visible in a B scan (Figure 1).  Not all of these features in the retina will be graded, only 
major retina features including: 1) the RNFL,  2) the inner and outer retina layers, 3) The RPE complex, 
4) the choroid , and 5) overall quality.   
 
 
The following retina features will be assessed in the B scan grading Study.  
1) The RNFL  is the bright band at the top of the retina.  It is thickest on the  nasal side especially 
near the optic disc.  On the temporal side of the fovea, the RNFL becomes very thin and may 
not always be visible.

Red bracket shows the 
RPE complex in this B scan

2) The inner and outer retina layers  include: The ganglio n cell layer (GCL is the dark band just 
below the RNFL), the inner plexiform layer (IPL is bright band below the GCL), the inner 
nuclear layer (INL is dark band below the IPL), the outer plexiform layer (OPL is bright band 
below the INL), and the outer nuc lear layer (ONL is dark band below the OPL and above the 
RPE complex).  
 
3) The RPE Complex is the thick bright band at the bottom of the retina.  It is actually made up 
of severa l features including the IS/OS boundary (the boundary between the inner and outer 
segments of the photoreceptors), the RPE proper (true retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_747743]), and 
Bruch’s Membrane (BM is thin layer just below the RPE).  Sometimes these three fe atures 
can be distinguished as three bands, but at times they appear to merge into a single bright 
band.  
 
4) The Choroid is the area just below Bruch’s membrane and extends down to the sclera.  It 
consists of smaller and larger blood vessels.

5) Overall Image Quality is a general impression of the overall quality of the entire B scan.  It is 
not an evaluation of any specif ic feature, but an overall sense of the clarity of the image as a 
whole.  A gestalt view for quality.  
 
Scoring System  
Scoring will be based on the quality and clarity of the images.  Scores will be based on a 4 point 
grading scale (0 to 3), with 0 corresponding to failure, 1 is poor, 2 is fair, and 3 is good.  The details of 
the scoring are as follows:  
 
The four point scale is defined as follows:  
 
A score of 0  indicates the scan is a failure, and contains no clinically useful information.  No relevant 
structures are visible in the scan.   
 
A score of 1  indicates the condition of the structure or feature being assessed is poor , and it contains 
very limited clini cal utility.  Only limited structural information is available in the scan and the feature 
being evaluated is difficult to assess.  This type of scan provides only very limited clinical information 
and is not very helpful for making clinical decisions.  Th e clinical utility is low or poor.   
 
A score of 2  indicates the condition of the structure or feature being assessed is fair or average.  It 
contains some useful clinical information and therefore provides adequate clinical utility.  Relevant 
structures a re generally visible in the scan and the scan contains useful information to help guide 
clinical decisions.  The clinical utility of this scan is acceptable or average for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] B scan.   
 
A score of 3  indicates the condition of the structure or featur e being assessed is good .  It contains 
useful clinical information.  Relevant structures are clearly visible and it is helpful to guide clinical 
decisions.  The clinical utility is high or good.   
 
For 3D cube or volumetric scans, all B scans will be revie wed and grading will be performed on the 
entire image set as a whole (all B scans graded together as a whole).

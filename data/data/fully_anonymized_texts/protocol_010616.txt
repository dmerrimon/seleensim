Study  PX01 is designed to further evaluate the relationship between flortaucipir uptake as 
measured by [CONTACT_560446]  (PET)at baseline and the subsequent rate of 
cogni tive decline due to A lzheimer’s disease (AD) observed over an 18- month longitudinal 
follow up by [CONTACT_199385] a therapeuti c trial cohort that had fl ortauci pir PET scans and up to 2 y ears
ofcogni tive follow-up. The subjects whose scans will be read in study  PX01 were recruited to a 
PET substudy  of the I8D -MC-
AZES (AZES) therapeuti c clinical  trial evaluating the BACE
(Beta-site amylo id precursor protein -cleaving enzyme 1 )inhibitor AZD3293 (LY3314814) ,also 
known as lanabecestat, f or the treatm ent of  patients wi th early AD.  The A ZES study  was 
terminated early after an independent assessment concluded that the trial was not likely to meet 
the primary  endpoint upon complet ion and therefore, the trial was stopped for fut ility. 
Thesubjects enrolled in the PET substudy ofAZE Shad flortaucipir PET scans at baselin e and at 
multiple fo llow-up timepo ints.  At the time the study  was terminated/completed, 205 subjects
witha baseline flortauci pir PET scan had completed 18 m onth cogni tive follow-up evaluat ions.  
These subjects will be used as the primary  efficacy populat ion for study PX01. Although a subset 
of these subjects (approximately 90 subjects) compl eted the [ADDRESS_736647] comparison to the A05 Confirmatory Cohort (A05C) Phase [ADDRESS_736648] risk of clinically  meaningful  deteri orationas determined by  
[CONTACT_560447] ( CDR -SB)value change (1 point or more increase) 
within 18 m onths.The approach used is similar to study  A05C, which was a confirmatory  study  
for longitudinal  progressi on in subjects with cogni tive impai rment who had M ild Cognitive 
Impair ment (MCI) or dem entia wit h a suspected neurodegenerative cause and a Mini Mental 
State Examinat ion (MMSE) score of 20 -27 inclusive.

Page 6of 123. STUDY DESIGN
All training and reads will be conducted in accordance wit h the image review charter (IRC) . Five 
imaging physicians will be trained in -person on the flortaucipir F18 PET scan read m ethodol ogy 
using the previously established visual read m ethod (identical to that used for t he 18F-AV-1451-
A05CStudy )
.  
The training will consist of teaching the readers the steps of interpretation ,followed by  a practi ce 
session using a set of demo nstrati on and pract ice cases. After the training phase is co mplete, 
each reader will independent ly read 205flortauci pir F18 PET baseline scans fro m the Study  
I8D-MC-AZES “A [ADDRESS_736651] acebo -Controlled, 
Parallel -Group, Efficacy, Safet y, Tolerabilit y, Bi omarker, and Pharmacokinet ic Study of 
AZD3293 in Early  Alzheimer’s Disease (the AMARANTH study )”in a rando m sequence. For 
the flortaucipir PET imaging, a 30 min ute  PET acquisit ion was conducted approximately 75 min 
following an i.v. administration of approximately 240 MBq flortaucipir F 18 which is 
comparable to a 20 minute acquisit ion conducted approximately  80 minutes following an i.v. 
administration of approximately 370 MBq flortaucipir F 18 as obtained in studies A16 and 
A05C.  
The study  popul ation for study  AZES consi sted of subjects aged 55 to 85 y ears wi thMCI due to 
AD or probable AD by [CONTACT_45455] -Alzheimer’s Associatio n criteria(Albert 2011) , with MMSE of [ADDRESS_736652] global score of 0.5 (MCI), or 0.5 or 1 (AD) with a memo ry box score ≥
0.5, and a score of ≤85 on the Delayed Memory  Index of the Repeatable Battery  for the 
Assessment of Neuropsy chological Status .  All subjects were amylo id posit ive by [CONTACT_389759] r
PET or l umbar puncture. Qualified subjects were rando mized to receive eit her 0 (placebo), 20, or 
[ADDRESS_736653] ional scales including the core sca les used in other flortaucipir studies ( CDR , MMSE, FAQ 
and ADAS).  The study  also included a longitudinal sub -study  of flortauci pir F [ADDRESS_736654] -SB at 24 
months. Only the baseline flortaucipir F 18 PET scan is being read in the present study .

4.1. Selection and Number of Investigators (Readers)
Five qualified physicians will be used to perform the blinded reads. Readers will be selected 
using the fo llowing cri teria:
Board Certified in Radio logy or Nuclear Medicine
Experi ence interpreting PET scans
4.2. Selection /number of Images:
A total o f 205unique scans will be read for this study in a rando m sequence .  Scans are from a 
subset of AZES patients who received a baseline flortaucipir F [ADDRESS_736655] assessment.
4.3. Blinded Read Method:
Readers will be blinded to all demographic and clinical data. 
All readers will be trained in -person on the steps of image interpretation, using a set of demonstration and 
practice cases, prior to starting their independent reads.  A copy of the training materials will be provided 
to each reader for reference. The rea d methodology is briefly outlined below :
After scaling images to the cerebellar reference region and selecting an appropriate color scale, regions of 
the neocortex (the posterolateral temporal (PLT), occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], parietal and frontal regions) are evaluated f or 
increased tracer uptake, and scans are interpreted as either not consistent (τAD -), consistent with an AD 
pattern (τAD+), or consistent with an AD pattern and likely to progress (τAD++) using the criteria shown 
in Table 1. 
Table 1 Clinical Read Method Criteria 
Read Outcome Objective Image Features
Not consistent with AD pattern (τAD -)No increased neocortical activity, or increased neocortical activity 
isolated to the mesial temporal, anterolateral temporal, and/or frontal 
regio ns.
AD pattern (τAD)τAD+In either hemisphere, increased neocortical activity in the 
posterolateral temporal (PLT) or occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17717](s). 
τAD++In either hemisphere, increased neocortical activity in the 
parietal/precuneus region(s), or frontal region(s) with increased 
uptake in the PLT, parietal, or occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17717](s).

Flortauci pir scan read d ata will be collected usingelectroni c case report forms (eCRFs )designed 
for this study .All other data including the demographic/baseline characterist ics and all 
cogni tive/funct ional assessments ,for subjects included inStudy  PX01 , will be from the locked 
database of Study  AZES.   The locked AZES database was accessed by [CONTACT_560450] n of the study  
sponsor, Eli Lilly  and Com pany.   
4.5. Good Clinical Practice and Monitoring
All clinical studies performed under the direct ion of Avid/CRO will be conducted in accordance 
with applicable regula tory requi rements and International Conference on Harmonizat ion (ICH), 
Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP) and Avid/CRO Standard Operating Procedures.
Moni toring of study  data will be performed by [CONTACT_560451].
5. S TATISTICAL METHODS
5.1. General Statistical Considerations
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 9.0or higher. The specific 
analyses to address the object ives will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
5.2. Population for Analysis
Five readers will independent ly interpret the flortauci pir F 18 PET scans collected from the 
AZES PET substudy . No new subjects will be enrolled for purposes of this study . 
Valid images will be considered unevaluable in the present study  only if 3 out of 5 independent 
readers declare the image unevaluable for the same reason. Subjects with invalid or unevaluable 
PET data will be excluded from analyses. Criteria for declaring an image invalid or not evaluable 
will be specified in advance in the Im age Review Charter. The m ajority reads on each 
flortauci pir F 18 scan (baseline) from these [ADDRESS_736656].
The AZES study  was terminated early for futility,therefore not all subjects had the opportunit y 
to complete the full term fo llow up .To avoi d bias, i t was decided to include only th e subjects
thathad 1) a valid baseline flortaucipir scan (no later than [ADDRESS_736657] randomizat ion, 
considering thatthe flortauci pi[INVESTIGATOR_560442] A ZES); and 
2) a CDR assessment at [ADDRESS_736658] -SB at 18 m onths. In Study  TZAX , which had a similar 
design and entry  criteria,approximately 75% of subjects were rated as τAD++ and 25% wer e 
Protocol 18F-AV-1451 -PX01 Confidential
Page 9of 12rated as non -τAD++ . Am ong non -τAD++ subjects (reference group) , approximately  40% had an 
increase of [ADDRESS_736659] -SB change in this study  is similar to that for TZAX, a sample of 205 
subjects will provide  90% power to detect a risk ratio of 1.65 or larger, under a two -sided t ype I 
error rate of 5%.
5.4. Efficacy Analysis
5.4.1. Primary Objective Analysis
The primary analysis for this study  will eval uate whether or not the baseline tau status as 
determined by [CONTACT_560452] F [ADDRESS_736660] the risk of subjects’ clinically  meaningful  
cogni tive and funct ional deterioration within 18 months of scan. The clinical lymeaningful 
deteri oration (CMD) for the primary object ive analysis is defined asClinical Dement ia Rat ing 
Scale Sum  of Box (CDR -SB) change fro m baseline with an increase o f 1 point or more .
A Poisson regressio n model will be used to cal culate the rati o of risk for τAD++ subjects ov er 
non-τAD++ (τAD+/ τAD -)subjects. The risk ratio, along with a 95% confidence interval and the 
associ ated p -value will be provided.  CMD as defined in the section above will be used as the 
dependent variable, and the model will be adjusted for baseline a ge, CDR -SB score ,and 
therapeuti c treatm ent assignment from AZES study.
5.4.2. Secondary Objective Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical lyMeaningful Deterioration at 18 Months by [CONTACT_560453], these CMDs will be assessed for the secondary  
objective analysis : 
1) MMSE decreased by 3 points or more;
2) ADAS Cog- 11 increased by 4 points or more;
3)FAQ increased by  3 points or m ore;
4)CDR gl obal wi th any increase .
The analyses will be ident ical to what is described in sect ion 5.4.1, wi th dependent variables 1-[ADDRESS_736661] ment of corresponding baseline scores.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mean Change of Cognitive/Functional Assessments at 18 Months by 
[CONTACT_560444] (τAD++ vs.non-τAD++)
To assess the mean ch ange of  CDR -SB, MMSE, ADAS, and FAQ at 18 month by  [CONTACT_560454], a 
mixed model wit h repeated measures (MMRM) will be used. For each analysis, the change from 
baseline value from relative measurement will be thedependent variable, and the model will 
include the fixed effects of tau status ( τAD++ or non -
τAD++), visit (categorical covariate), tau 
status -by-visit interact ion,and therapeutic treatment assignment fro m AZES study , as well  as
corresponding baseline measurement score, and baselin e age as continuous covariates. The null 
hypothesis is that the least squared mean contrast between τAD++ and non -τAD++ groups at
month [ADDRESS_736662] variance -covariance. If the unstructured covariance structure matrix results in a lack of 
convergence, the fo llowing tests will be used in sequence: heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance 
structure, heterogeneous autoregressive covariance structure, and compound symmetry  
covari ance s tructure. The Kenward -Roger approximat ion will be used to estimate the 
deno minator degrees of freedo m.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Inter -reader Reliability
The inter -reader reliabilit y of flortauci pir scan interpretation (τAD++ vs.non-τAD++) across the 
5independent readers will be assessed using a Fleiss’ Kappa statist ics. The overall percent of 
agreem ent, Fl eiss’ Kappa, and 95% CI around Kappa value will be provided. 
5.4.3. Exploratory Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cognitive/F unctional Assessments Deterioration at 24 months, by 
[CONTACT_560455], analyses described fro m 5.4.1 –
5.4.2 (except [IP_ADDRESS]) will be repeated using subjects who completed both baseline and 24 month 
clinical assessments . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinically Meaningful Deterioration by τAD vs τAD- tau status
In addit ion, exploratory  analyses will  be planned to contrast scan visual interpretations of τAD

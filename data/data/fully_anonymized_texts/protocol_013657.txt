 7 1  INTRODUCTION  
1.1  Background and Rationale  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal neurodegenerative disease that 
affects motor neurons in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brainstem and motor cortex. Clinical featu res include 
fasciculations, muscle wasting and weakness, spasticity, and hyper - or hyporeflexia. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_653036], and the cause of death is generally 
the paralysis of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_312389] d iaphragm (Beghi et al ., 2007). Although the exact 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in ALS remain uncertain, a common 
pathological hallmark is the presence of ubiquitin -immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions in 
degenerating neurons,  followed by [CONTACT_653061] (McGeer and McGeer, 2002;  Bendotti 
et al. 2012; Malaspi[INVESTIGATOR_193112]., 2015). Prominent neuroinflammation can be observed in 
pathologically affected areas of the central nervous system (CNS) and in spi[INVESTIGATOR_653037] (McGeer and McGeer, 2002;  Philips and 
Robberecht, 2011 ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], inflammation in ALS is characterized by [CONTACT_653062]. Activation of glia is marked 
by [CONTACT_653063], inflammatory mediators 
such as COX -2, and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL -1β, TNF -α, and IL -6 (McGeer and 
McGeer, 2002). Major histocompatibility complex molecules a nd complement receptors are highly 
expressed by [CONTACT_653064][INVESTIGATOR_653038] (McGeer and McGee r, 2002; Sta et al., 2011 ). The major determinants of 
motor neuron death in ALS rem ain to be established.  
A motor neuron -specific death pathway has been suggested for ALS based on the finding that motor 
neurons isolated from transgenic  superoxide dismutase 1  (SOD1 ) mutant mice were more sensitive 
to Fas - or nitric oxide  (NO)-triggered c ell death than wild -type motor neurons (Raoul et al., 2002). 
Upon binding of FasL to the Fas receptor, the intracellular portion of Fas recruits the adaptor 
molecule FADD  (Fas Associated Death Domain ), which then activates a caspase cascade that 
culminates  in the death of motor neurons. This pathway was also activated in presymptomatic ALS 
mice (Raoul et al., 2006). Given that astrocytes and microglia produce NO and that astrocytes from 
SOD1 mutant mice produce FasL (Barbeito et al., 2004), glial cells coul d directly kill motor 
neurons. Another member of the same receptor family, the p75 neurotrophin receptor, has also been 
implicated in ALS -dependent motor neuron death (Pehar et al., 2004). Specifically, nerve growth 
factor secreted by [INVESTIGATOR_281608]1 mutant astrocyte s induced the death of motor neurons expressing p75 by a 
mechanism involving the formation of NO and peroxinitrite (Pehar et al., 2004). Peroxynitrite 
RNS60 -ALS V 3.0 Dated on November  12, 2018  
 8 converts tyrosine to 3 -nitrotyrosine (3 -NT), leading to protein nitration. Interestingly, high levels of 
nitrated proteins were found in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_653039] (PBMC) of 
mutant SOD1 animal models, already at a presymptomatic stage of the disease, and in PBMC of 
sporadic ALS patients (Casoni et al., 2005; Nardo et al., 2009; Nar do et al., 2011).   
Even though motor neurons are the main cells affected in ALS, increasing evidence points to the 
involvement of neighboring glia cells during pathogenesis (Clement et al., 2003; Yamanaka et a l., 
2008a ). Cell -specific deletion of mutant S OD1 in astrocytes and microglia reduced disease severity 
and boosted the survival of ALS mice (Boillee et a l., 2006; Yamanaka et al., 2008a ). Evidence for a 
role for non -neuronal cells has been obtained using chimeric mice selectively expressing SOD1 in 
neurons or in non -neuron al cells (Yamanaka et al., 2008b ). In chimeric mice expressing high levels 
of mutant SOD1 in 100% of motor neurons and oligodendrocytes, the presence of wildtype 
neighboring support cells substantially delayed the onset of motor neuro n degeneration. Gene 
expression profiling implies that inflammatory cascades are activated before the initiation of motor 
neuron degeneration, suggesting that inflammation could be involved in the presymptomatic phase 
of the disease (Vargas et al., 2008). Mutant SOD1, but not the wild -type protein, has been proposed 
to be secreted into the extracellular space via chromogranin vesicles, causing activation of microglia 
and resulting in motor neuron death in culture (Urushitani et al., 2006). Consistently, mut ant SOD1 
is present in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_653040] 
(Tikka et al., 2002). Moreover, intracerebral infusion of mutant S OD1 into wild -type mice induced 
microglial activation and cytokine production (Kang  and Rivest, 2007).  
Emerging evidence points to an involvement of the adaptive immune response in ALS disease 
progression. In fact, increased levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and dendritic cells were 
detected in close proximity to dying motor neurons  in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_653041]1 mutant mice (Chiu 
et al., 2008) and in the brain parenchyma of ALS patients (Kawamata et al., 1992; Henkel et al., 
2004). Infiltrating T cells (Th2 , Treg ) can be neuroprotective after secreting IL -4, which signals 
reactive micr oglia to produce neurotrophic factors such as insulin growth factor (IGF -1) (Chiu et 
al., 2008). In the case of ALS, as in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease  (PD)  as well 
as other neurodegenerative diseases in which microglia and astrocytes a re the primary contributors 
to inflammation, therapeutic approaches logically would aim to modulate the 
sensor/transducer/effector functions of the innate immune system, that is, TLRs, NF -B, and TNF -
α, respectively. These findings suggest that targeting i nflammatory pathways might be effective in 
preventing disease progression.  
RNS60 -ALS V 3.0 Dated on November  12, 2018  
 9 The only drug showing to improve su rvival in patients with ALS is r iluzole (Miller et al, 2007). 
However, the benefits consist in a three -month delay of death while disability and o ther outcome 
measures are virtually unaffected. This highlights the need to test novel approaches to slow the 
progression of the disease.  
1.[ADDRESS_876523] 
relevance for this study, intraperitoneal and intravenous (IV) injections of RNS60 in multiple rodent 
EAE models showed a remarkable improvement of clinical scores, reduction in the expression of 
inflammatory molecules such  as IL -17 and iNOS, reduced gliosis and CNS infiltration by 
[CONTACT_653065], and finally reduced demyelination .  Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of 
RNS60 caused significant down regulation of proinflammatory molecules in the brain, and neuronal 
protection in mouse models of AD and PD.  RNS60 inhibited microglial inflammation via type 1A 
phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase -Akt-CREB -mediated upregulation of I κBα and inhibition of NF -κB 
activation in cultured glial cells  (Khasnavis, S. et al ,2012) . Similarly, RNS60 suppressed NF -κB 
activation through differential modulation of type 1A PI(3)K pathways in a mouse model of PD, 
and thereby [CONTACT_653066]  (Khasnavis S  et al, 2014 ). In a rodent EAE 
model, RNS60 treatment achieved a remarkable improvement of clinical scores, reduction in the 
expression of inflammatory molecules such as IL -17 and iNOS, reduced CNS infiltration by 
[CONTACT_653065], and finally reduced demyelination  (Mondal, S. et al.  2012) .  
In both, in vitro  and in vivo  models of familial ALS carrying SOD1G93A mutation, w e recently 
observed a reduced up -regulation of iNOS induced by [CONTACT_303921] (LPS) in astrocytes (Fig  
1.A) and a protective effect of RNS60 on motor neurons. In an in vitro  model of ALS, consisting of 
co-cultures of astrocytes and spi[INVESTIGATOR_653042]1 with G93A mutation, RNS60 
led to a reduced spontaneous and selective loss of large mutant  motor neurons (Fig 1.B). In vivo , the 
intraperitoneal treatment of SOD1G93A mice with RNS60 at the onset of the disease (evaluated at 
their body weight peak)  caused  a significant delay in the appearance of motor dysfunction (Fig.1C) 
and a partial but sign ificant preservation of lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_653043] (Fig 1.D) and 
neuromuscular junctions (Fig 1.E). Moreover , RNS60  treatment  led to a small but significant  
activat ion of  the neuroprotective PI3K -Akt signaling pathway , as demonstrated by [CONTACT_653067] d 
phosphorylation of Akt in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (Fig 1.F). This demonstrates that the same pathways 
are modulated by [CONTACT_653068]60 across preclinical models of different neurodegenerative diseases.  
RNS60 -ALS V 3.[ADDRESS_876524] of RNS60 in SOD1G93A linked ALS models  in vitro  and in vivo . A) RNS60 reduces LPS -
induced iNOS in astrocytes cultures.  The iNOS mRNA is normalized to SOD2 mRNA levels. Data are 
mean ± SEM (n=4 independent experiments) and analyzed by [CONTACT_653069] (p value<0.001), Tukey 
Test: ****p<0.001 and **p<0.01 vs . untreated, $$$p<0.005 vs . LPS and §p<0.05 vs . LPS+RNS60. B) RNS60 
protects motor neurons in astrocyte -spi[INVESTIGATOR_653044] -cultures from SOD1G93A mice.  Data are mean ± 
SEM (n=5 ind ependent experiments) and analyzed using Two Way ANOVA (int. p <0.04), Tukey T est: 
**p<0.01 vs . NTG untreated, $p<0.05 vs . SOD1G93A untreated and §§p<0.01 vs . NTG NS. C) RNS60 
treatment delays the onset of neuromuscular symptoms in SOD1G93A mice . The age of onset is 
considered as the age at which  the mouse fails the grip strength te st for the first time (grip latency <90 sec). 
The curves are evaluated by [CONTACT_653070] -rank (Mantel -Cox) test (Chi square= 17.10, p <0.001).  D) RNS60 
treatment protects motor neurons in SOD1G93A mice . Motor neuron count from spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] L2 -L5 
segment (10 secti ons/mouse). The bar graph represents mean ± SEM (n=3 mice per group) . Data are 
analyzed using t -test (p<0.0001). E) RNS60 slightly protects neuromuscular junctions from denervation. 
Data represent denervated plaques as the percentage of  total plaques count ed in ten frames per section, five 
sections for each mouse, at 20X -magnification ( n=5). At symptomatic stage, SOD1G93A mice treated with NS 
show significant denervation (61.76%) , which is slightly reduced by [CONTACT_653071]60  (52.35%). 
Histograms show the mean ± SEM of [ADDRESS_876525] (p=0.0237). F) 
RNS60 activate s PI3K -Akt signaling in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] . Western blot of lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_653045] (p -Akt) is higher in S OD1G93A mice treated with RNS60 
as compared to NS-treated controls. The bar graph represents mean ± SEM (n=5 mice per group) . Data are 
analyzed using t -test (p=0.05).  
RNS60 -ALS V 3.0 Dated on November  12, 2018  
 11 Therefore, RNS60 presents itself as a promising candidate for the treatment of ALS . Its exceptional 
safety profile, demonstrated both in preclinical toxicology studies and Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA )-approved clinical phase I  studies upon inhaled and IV administration, 
supports testing of RNS60 in clinical phase II studies in ALS  patien ts. 
1.3 Pre-clinical Toxicology Data  
Extensive in vitro  and in vivo  preclinical testing of RNS60 has been completed at multiple 
institutions and in various models. RNS60 did not show any concerning signs of toxicity in any of 
the in vitro cell culture studies performed to date or in the animal toxicology studies conducted in 
accordance with FDA guidelines for Investigational New Drug (IND) Applications. The 
administration of the maximum deliverable dose of RNS60 by [CONTACT_653072] (10 mL/kg) or IV 
infusion for  6 (48 mL/kg) or 24 hours (96 mL/kg) daily for 28 days was well tolerated in albino 
rats. There were no RNS60 -related mortalities, clinical observations, ocular observations, abnormal 
laboratory results (serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), organ w eight changes, 
macroscopic or microscopic observations or genotoxic activity. The administration of the maximum 
deliverable dose of RNS60 by [CONTACT_653072] (10 mL/kg) or IV infusion for 6 (48 mL/kg) or 24 
hours (96 mL/kg) once daily for 28 days was well tolerated and did not reveal toxicity in any target 
organs in cynomolgus monkeys.  
In the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) using Salmonella typhimurium strains (TA98, 
TA 100, TA 1535 and TA 1537) and Escherichia coli WP uvrA in the presence an d absence of S9 
metabolic activation, RNS60 caused neither an increase in the number of revertant colonies nor a 
dose-related response in any of the teste d strains at any dose level. In the mouse lymphocyte assay, 
RNS60 similarly demonstrated minimal cytot oxicity and did not increase the mutation frequency 
relative to the vehicle controls in either the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Therefore, 
it was concluded that RNS60 was not mutagenic.  
1.4 Clinical Data to Date  
RNS60 has been well tolerated in  human safety studies, both after IV infusion and when 
administered by [CONTACT_12699]. In a Phase I safety and tolerability study (Clinicaltrials.gov # 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), RNS60 was administered to 9 healthy subjects as continuous IV infusion at 3 
subsequently incre asing rates of 100 mL/h, 150 mL/h, and 200 mL/h over 48 hours at each rate.  No 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported in this study and no subjects were discontinued from 
the study due to an adverse event (AE).  Furthermore, no clinically relevant ch anges were noted in 
clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, oral fluid intake or urine output. The 
most frequently reported AE was mild headache, which occurred most often in the highest infusion 
RNS60 -ALS V 3.0 Dated on November  12, 2018  
 12 rate of 200 mL/h, and was considered possibly related to the treatment.  However, there was an 
increase in overall incidence with the increased infusion rate for both placebo and RNS60 -treated 
subjects, with 55% of subjects in the RNS60 group and 33% of subjects in the placebo group 
reporting  mild headache.  Since headache is a common symptom of fluid (volume) load it is 
probable that the headaches were primarily a volume -related effect of the infusion.  Other AEs 
reported as treatment related were a single incidence each (11.1%) of mild arthr algia, mild limb 
discomfort, and moderate musculoskeletal pain.  Cardiac monitoring showed only mild, sporadic 
and infrequent  Electrocardiogram  (EKG ) changes from baseline ; however these changes were not 
attributed to use of RNS60.   
In a second Phase I st udy (Clinicaltrials.gov # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), RNS60 administered to [ADDRESS_876526] commonly reported treatment 
related AE was mild oropharyngeal pain, reported by 2 subjects (12.5%).  One subject (6.3%) 
reported a single incidence of moderate nasal mucosal disorder.  Other AEs reported as treatment 
related were all mild, and were single incidences (6.3%) of eye allergy, ocular hyperemia, chest 
discomfort, increased blood pressure, increased appetite, headache, somnolence, allergic sinusitis, 
cough, dyspnea, nasal congestion, throat irritation, and pruritus.  Additionally, RNS60 treatment did 
not cause bronchoconstriction, but rather demonstrated positive effects on f orced expi[INVESTIGATOR_4016] 1 second (FEV 1) and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_118756], as well as improved quality of life 
scores.  
In a third Phase I study (Clinicaltrials.gov # [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), RNS60 administered by [CONTACT_653073] a budesonide ( BD) dose of either 0.25 mg or 0.5 mg for 28 days, to subjects 
with mild to moderate asthma who were previously taking a prescribed corticosteroid, was also well 
tolerated.  57 subjects were treated with the combination of RNS60 and BD (RNS60 -BD).  No 
SAEs were reported and no discontinuation of subjects occurred that were related to use of RNS60 -
BD.  AEs attributed to the use of RNS60 -BD were sporadic, with single incidences (3.4%) of 
moderate migraine, moderate wheezing, moderate asthma prophylaxis, mild c hest discomfort, and 
mild increase in hepatic enzymes.  Furthermore, there were no significant findings noted in clinical 
laboratory tests, vital signs, or physical examinations.  Additionally, use of RNS60 -BD did not 
cause any incidence of clinically sign ificant bronchoconstriction; rather it demonstrated positive 
RNS60 -ALS V 3.0 Dated on November  12, 2018  
 13 trends in quality of life improvements and reduced use of rescue inhalers. For details of these 
studies refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for RNS60.  
An o ngoing interventional Phase II tri al with a weekly IV infusion of RNS60 in relapsing/remitting 
multiple sclerosis ( RRMS ) patients  is currently enrolling subjects at the  University hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653046] . 
An ongoing single center, open label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_653047]60 in ALS patients is enrolling at 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Subjects are receiving weekly IV infusion of RNS60 in addition 
to daily inhalation of RNS60  for six months while being monitored for disease progression  and 
microglial activation by [CONTACT_7816] . 
1.5 Description of RNS60  
Chemically, RNS60 consists of 0.9% sodium chloride and dissolved oxygen.  RNS60 is 
manufactured by [CONTACT_653074]’s patented Revalesio Pump (RP).  During 
operation of the RP, the fluid is exposed to very strong hydrodynamic , rotational, vortical and 
longitudinal shear forces, resulting in forceful dispersion of the oxygen.  The combined effect of 
these forces alters the physical relationship between gas and liquid, and has a concomitant effect on 
the electrical properties of  the fluid caused by a reorganization of ionic charges and the formation of 
associated electrical double layers.  RNS60 does not contain a chemical Active Pharmaceutical 
Ingredient (API).  
The observed bioactivity of RNS60 is, instead, based on the presenc e of charge -stabilized 
nanostructures (CSN) generated by [CONTACT_653075].  The CSNs consist of an 
oxygen core surrounded by [CONTACT_653076].  The 
electrical charges associated with the co re oxygen stabilize the layers of separated electrical charges 
and form CSN -associated electrical fields in RNS60.  
1.[ADDRESS_876527] conclusively demonstrated that the oxygen alone is not 
responsible for RNS60’s bioactivity, but that it is th e combination of oxygen with the processing in 
the RP that results in a physical quality of the fluid that is able to modulate the stress response of 
cells. As it is currently impossible to directly image CSNs in vivo , traditional pharmacokinetic 
evaluatio ns are not applicable to RNS60. Preclinical data clearly demonstrate , however,  that RNS60 
is able to modulate the type 1A PI(3)K signaling pathway  within the CNS after systemic 
administration. RNS60 induced the activation of type IA phosphatidylinositol -3 kinase (PI3K) in 
the substantia nigra of healthy  as well as MPTP -intoxicated mice within [ADDRESS_876528] injection  (Khasnavis S  et al, 2014 ). Thus, 
RNS60 is expected to mediate its ef fects both on peripheral immune cells as well on CNS targets, as 
reported earlier (Modi, KK. et al. 2014; Khasnavis,  S. et at. 2014; Mondal, S. et al.  2012) .

3 STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group, add-on 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_653048] .  Patients diagnosed with ALS who meet the study’s inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and sign the Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  will be enrolled.  There will be 
two groups making up a total of 1 42 subjects:  Group A ( 71 subjects) and Gro up B ( 71 subjects).  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with either RNS60 or plac ebo while 
concomitantly taking r iluzole (50  mg twice a day).  RNS60 or placebo will be administered 
intravenously once a week as well as inhaled via nebul ization every morning  (6 days a week on 
non-infusion days)  for 24 weeks.  All visit windows (± 1 or + 4 days according to study procedure) 
are consecutive calendar days and are calculated from the day the participant starts study treatment 
(the day of the Randomization -Baseline Visit).  
Blood samples will be collected five times for enrolled subjects  to measure  biomarkers. The first 
blood sample collection will be at baseline before the first infusion  dose. Safety and efficacy will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_653078], vital signs and AEs.  Changes in disability and quality of life 
will be assessed using the ALSFRS -R scale, FVC and ALSAQ -[ADDRESS_876531]  will be followed up for a maximum period of 48 week s 
(24-week treatment + 24 -week follow up) or until death or tracheotomy, whichever occurs first.

6.1    Study Drug Administration  
RNS60 or placebo supply will be sent to site by [CONTACT_653084][INVESTIGATOR_653055].  
RNS60 or placebo will be administered weekly intravenously (starting on Day 1) at the clinic site 
by [CONTACT_318372].  Subjects will receive 375 mL RNS60 or 
placebo infused at a rate of 700 mL/hr. Infusion documentation should i nclude recording infusion 
start and stop times, volume infused, and any interruptions to the infusion  using an ad -hoc form .    
During the remaining days of the week, treatment with  nebulized  RNS60  or placebo  will be 
performed  at home in the morning  on non -infusion days .  The subject will remove the kit box of [ADDRESS_876535] remove the 
tip cap of the syringe, then gently push the plunger down to dispense the full 2 mL of 
RNS60 /placebo  from the syringe into the nebulizer dosing cup. The procedure is then repeated with 
a second syring e to get to the full daily dose of 4 mL.  The dose should be nebulized immediately 
thereafter until the contents of the nebulizer cup are empty (approximately 15 minutes).  Subjects 
should try to dose at a similar time each morning.  Subjects will be provi ded with and trained to use 
a Pari Mini system and LC Sprint nebulizers  (Italian subjects) or Pari Trek system and LC Sprint 
nebulizers (US patients) . Dosing records fo r nebulization will be completed at home at the time of 
each daily nebulization.  The do sing record will include the date and time of nebulization as well as 
the number of syringes used.  
All subjects will conc urrently take 50 -mg r iluzole twice a day during the entire treatment period. 
According to the  European Medicine A gency  (EMA ) guidelines , riluzole can be discontinued when 
the plasma transaminase levels exceed by [CONTACT_653085].  
The first dose of r iluzole should be taken each day at the end of infusion or nebulization. The 
second dose should be taken after 12 ± [ADDRESS_876536](s)  
[…] 
RNS60  
RNS60 for infusion , i.e. in the IV bags, is produced using 0.9% Sodium Chloride for injection. 
RNS60 for inhalation, i.e. in the syringes, is produced using 0.9% Sodium Chloride for irrigation.  
Both RNS60 for infusion  and RNS60 for inhalation are processed in the Revalesio Pump with 
elevated levels of oxygen.  RNS60 is supplied for single -use only and contains no preservatives.   
Syringes and IV bags are to remain refrigerated at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F) when not in use. RNS60 
meets its stability specification for 12 months.  
Placebo  
Normal saline (NS)  for infusion , i.e. in the IV bags, is packaged 0.9% Sodium Chloride for 
injection. NS for inhalation, i.e. in the syringes, is packaged 0.9% Sodium Chloride for irrigation.  
NS does not require refrigerated storage for use.  However, for blinding purposes refrigeration is 
required before distributing to subjects.  NS meets stability specifications for 24 months.

- Abnormal l aboratory value(s) deemed of medical concern;  
- Administrative problems;  
- Female becoming pregnant;  
- Severe p rotocol deviations  (at the Study Coordinator judg ment) .  
If a subject withdraws or fails to return for visits, the investigator must determine the prim ary 
reason for the subject’s premature withdrawal from the study, and record this information on the 
study -completion visit. Subjects must return all unused/remaining study drug to the investigative 
site. For subjects who are lost to follow up, the investi gator should show “due diligence” by 
[CONTACT_653086], e.g., dates of telephone 
calls, registered letters, etc. Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will not be 
replaced.  
Discontinu ed use of riluzole during the treatment period implies the discontinuation of the 
experimental drug. The subject will undergo a final safety evaluation and data collected up to the 
time of drug discontinuation wil l be used in the data analysis.  
 
6.12  Modi fication of Study Intervention/Investigational Product for a Subject  
Any dosage adjustment, including the reason for and dates of adjustment, will be documented in the 
CRF for each subject requiring this manipulation. The PIs or licensed physician Sub -Investigator  
may reduce the dosage of study drug or discontinue the study drug in its entirety for AEs thought to 
be related to the study drug or for other reason during the trial (the reason for, and dates of 
RNS60 -ALS V 3.[ADDRESS_876540] be documented).   If the AE is mild or moderate, the dosage may 
be reduced until the event improves.  The PIs may then choose to resume the higher dosage or 
maintain the subject at a reduced dosage. The option to continue with administration by [CONTACT_653087].  
If the event is serious or life threatening, and deemed to be definitely drug related, the study drug 
will be discontinued immediately. Study subjects must remain off the study drug permanently. 
Subjects may not resume study drug.  All AEs wi ll be followed to resolution.

If these events occur, the Investigator must  record them into the AE form.  
 
9.5 Follow up of AE/SAE/DAR/DAE/S[LOCATION_003]R  
Any AE/SAE /DAR/DAE/S[LOCATION_003]R observed from randomization up to the end of the study will be 
followed up to resolution.  Resolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline state of 
health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE.  
9.6 Data Monitoring Committee  
According to the EMEA GUIDELINE ON DATA MONITORING COMMITTEES  (January 2006) 
a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is a n external group of independent experts  assessing the

11 STATISTICS  
11.1 Sample Size Calculation  
We analyzed prelimin ary data on Cyp -A which showed an increase of 0.27 over six months (Nardo, 
G. et al. 2011). With [ADDRESS_876544] 80% power to detect a 4 4% decrease in the 
rate of progression in Cyp -A at a two sided p=0.05 significance level.  This assu mes a drop -out rate 
of 1.75% per month (10% over the study).  The calculation is based on the method  shown in 
(http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/biostatistics/node/42) . For the other biomark ers we only had data 
on the between patient variation and not on the within patient variation which could be used for 
calculating sample size for the proposed study. Usually the within patient variation is less than the 
between patient variation, so power calculated using the between patient variation is conservative. 
The T -reg values were assessed in slowly progressing vs. rapi[INVESTIGATOR_653057]43 and the 
estimated difference was used as the difference expected to slow the progression of the disease in 
patients receiving RNS60. A total of [ADDRESS_876545] deviation (SD) of 0.5. Similar 
assumptions were made for the other biomarkers for which, exce pt for Actin -NT (that would 
require 1542 patients), numbers range from 8 to 68 (Nardo, G. et al. 2009; Nardo, G. et al. 2011; 
Henkel, J. et al. 2013; Chiò A. et al., 2011):  
- MCP -1: a total of [ADDRESS_876546] deviation (SD) of 140;  
- Actin -NT: a total of [ADDRESS_876547] deviation (SD) of 0.7;  
- 3-NT: a total of [ADDRESS_876548] deviation (SD) of 40;  
- Cyp-A: a total of [ADDRESS_876549] deviation (SD) of 2.0.  
 
For ALSFRS -R, the software http://hedwig.mgh.harvard.edu/biostatistics/node/42  shows the 
variance parameters w hich are from the Celebrex Study.  
The variance  of the random effects is the matrix 31.8 (intercept), 0 .6687 (slope) with a covariance 
of 0.8527. The error has a variance of 2.[ADDRESS_876550] 80% power to detect a 43% decrease  in the rate of 
progression in ALSFRS over 6 months, at a two sided p=0.05 significa nce level.  The study is also 
powered (in this case p=0.05 two sided) to show an absolute 25% reduction in the proportion of 
patients becoming non self -sufficient at 24 wee ks, using a validated outcome measure with strong 
clinical significance  (Marin, B. et al. 2015). In two studies from our group (Beghi, E. et al 2013 ; 
Chiò, A. et al. 2010 ) the average proportion of patients becoming non self -sufficient after 24 weeks 
in the placebo arm was 85%.  
11.[ADDRESS_876551]   (Ref http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22987690) . Separate analyses will 
be performed in: 1. All randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of study medication 
(Intention -to-treat population); 2. Study completers: subjects completing  the 12 -month follow -up; 3. 
Study completers and compliers: subjects completing the [ADDRESS_876552] 
75% of assigned dose. 4. All randomized subjects excluding protocol deviations (Per protocol, PP 
population). Descriptive statistics will be performed comparing the two treatment groups and safety 
of RNS60 and placebo. Continuous variables will be described using mean and standard deviation 
or median and interquartile range; categorical variables will be described as counts and percenta ges.  
Biomarkers analysis:  
The primary analysis will be a repeated measures analysis of variance  (ANOVA)  with a treatment 
variable that is the same for all treatments at baseline and then differs at later observation times. We 
will use an unstructured vari ance covariance matrix.  The contrast of interest will depend on the 
outcome. Note that this is more general than a random effects model in situations where the 
observation times are fixed.  For biomarkers that progress over of time such as Cyp -A, the prima ry 
analysis will compare the rate of change in the biomarker over time in the placebo and active 
treatment groups .  In biomarkers that do  not progress but rather are elevated in patients , the primary 
analysis will be a comparison i n the treatment effect.   Both of these analyses are contrasts in a 
repeated measures ANOVA, the former by [CONTACT_3148] X time, and the latter being treatment X 
(time>0).  Each biomarker will be analyzed separately .  
Efficacy analysis:  
RNS60 -ALS V3.0 Dated on Novemb er 12 ,   2018   
 34 The numerical change of FVC, ALSFRS -R and ALSAQ -40 during the treatment and follow -up 
period will be assessed using repeated measures ANOV A, with an unspecified variance covariance 
matrix. The hypothesis will be tested using the time*treatment interaction which measures 
differences in the slope of the AL SFRS -R. Survival (time to death  or tracheostomy ) and time to 
functional disability (i.e., to reach a non self -supporting status  or death or tracheostomy ) will be 
assessed using actuarial methods with death and non -self supporting status as end -points. Surv ival 
will be described with the Kaplan -Meier method. Differences between the two treatment groups 
will be compared using the log -rank test.  The statistical significance will be set at the 0.[ADDRESS_876553].   
The repeated measures ANOVA will  use all available data, using Maximum Likelihood methods as 
suggested by (http://www.nap.edu/read/[ZIP_CODE]/chapter/1 ).  
 
Safety analysis  will be performed in all subjects receiving at least one dose of the experimental 
drug. All AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will be recorded, listed and 
compared in the two treatment arms at any follow -up visit and at the end of the study.  The number 
of patients reporting at least one AE or SAE will be compared between the treatment arms using the 
fisher exact test . The total number of AE and SAE will be compared between the treatment arms 
using a poisson model. MedDRA code system will be used for all recorded AE/SAE.   
Given the explora tory value of this study, multiple comparison adjustments for Type I errors will 
not be considered as a more conservative significance level would lead to miss any potential 
treatment effect.  Furthermore , if there is a suggestive benefit (p<0.1) in the cl inical measures and 
several of the biomarkers, this will be considered sufficient evidence for further study.  
If at the end of the patient enrolment period less than 50% of patients are enrolled, an interim -
analysis will be performed to decide whether or n ot to continue the trial.  
11.3 Compliance  
The compliance with the assigned at -home treatment will be measured by [CONTACT_653092]/unused syringes returned by [CONTACT_329914]. A subject will be considered non -
compliant if the amount of unuse d drug exceeds 25% of the assigned drug. The intake of less than 
50% of the total amount of nebulized drug for [ADDRESS_876554] (http://www.whocc.no), which employs the anatomical therapeutic 
chemical classification system. Medical history/current medical conditions  and adverse events will 
be coded using the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedRA) terminology (MedRA, 
2011).

Treatment cycle length: 7 days during paclitaxel. Propose using this therapy for the 12 weeks of adjuvant 
paclitaxel.   
Observation cycle length: [ADDRESS_312351] several weeks of therapy, 
become more prominent over time with continued drug use, and tend to improve over time, 
after paclitaxel is discontinued.  It is well accepted that these symptoms are related to nerve 
pathology and this has been termed chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), 
which is also caused by [CONTACT_257044].  
  
The EORTC CIPN -20 instrument was utilized in a recent NCCTG natural history trial 
(N08C1) to obtain paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy data.  Two cohorts of patients 
from this study have been analyzed: a group who received weekly paclitaxel (70- 90 mg/m
2) 
without another neurotoxic agent and another group who received higher doses of paclitaxel (i.e. 175 mg/m
2) every [ADDRESS_312352] cohort of patients are provided below; data from the second cohort show similar 
findings.[ADDRESS_312353] problematic, the changes from baseline were tested between each pair of variables. With this, the change in sensory 
scores was greater than the change in the autonomic scores and the change in the motor 
scores.

Figure 1:   
 
These sensory neuropathy changes were evaluated in mor e detail in this same cohort by 
[CONTACT_257045], which the EORTC CIPN-20 instrument contains (which are used, with other questions, to determine the sensory 
neuropathy subscale of this tool):  
• Do you have tingling fingers or hands?  
• Do you have numbness in your fingers or hands? 
• Do you have shooting or burning pain in your fingers or hands? 

 6 RU221511I 
  Figure 2 illustrates that, during the time of paclitaxel therapy, numbness and tingling are 
very closely r elated to each other, while pain is less prominent.  Three questions, similar to 
the ones above, are also asked by [CONTACT_20368] -CIPN20 instrument, relating to the toes 
and feet, as opposed to the fingers and hands. Data from the lower extremities closely 
replicate what is observed in the upper extremities. Data from the cohort of patients 
receiving higher dose paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks revealed similar data for both hands and feet.

Figure 2:  
 
 
Data from Hershman  et al. reveal that, while neuropathy tends to improve after completion 
of chemotherapy, about 50% of patients can still have some problematic paclitaxel -induced 
neurotoxicity a year following drug discontinuation.3  
  1.2 Paclitaxel acute pain syndrome (P- APS)  
 
Paclitaxel also produces a disabling syndrome of sub -acute aches and pains that had been 
commonly referred to as arthralgias and myalgias, in a majority of patients.
[ADDRESS_312354] with, symptoms of neuropathy. Based on animal data that illustrated that rat 
dorsal root ganglions had evidence of nerve toxicity 24 hours after they received a 
clinically appropriate dose of paclitaxel (illustrated by [CONTACT_257046]-3, a 
marker of nerve injury), it was hypothesized that this pain syndrome may be from nerve 
pathology.5  Subsequent discussions with patients suffering from this syndrome supported 
that the pains did not appear to be of joint or muscle origin.  To obtain further information, 
18 patients at the Mayo Clinic, who noted the presence of sub- acute aches and pains 
following paclitaxel, participated in structured int erviews to characterize their symptoms.6 
Eighty -three percent of the patients (15/18) specifically denied joint or muscle pain.  The 
pain commonly started 1-2 days after the paclitaxel infusion, with the median duration of 
pain being 4-5 days. Patients commonly described the discomfort as “aching” or “deep 
pain” that was “radiating,” “stabbing,” or “shooting.”  The pain was usually generalized 
and located in the back, hips, shoulders, thighs, legs and feet and, at times, radiated down the legs, arms, or back.  It was concluded that the sub -acute paclitaxel -induced pain 
appeared to be lik ely related to a pathologic process in nerve tissue (e.g. sensitization of 
nociceptors or nociceptive fibers) as opposed to being from a musculoskeletal injury.   
 
 

 [ADDRESS_312355] dose of paclitaxel, “Please rate any aches/pains that are NEW since your last dose of paclitaxel, and that you think might be related to your chemotherapy treatment by [CONTACT_257047]/pains at its WORST in the last 24 hours.” Seventy -one 
percent of the patients noted pain, ranging from 1-10 on a 0-10 scale. With each subsequent dose of paclitaxel, affirmative answers were seen in 56 -69% of respondents. The pain 
associated with paclitaxel administration peaked on day [ADDRESS_312356] -paclitaxel 
commencement.  Figure 3 illustrates the data from a cohort of patients receiving weekly 
paclitaxel, at a dose of 70 -90mg/m
2. 
 
Figure 3: 
  

 8 RU221511I 
  With regards to analgesic use for this problem, non -prescription medications were used, 
over the 12 weekly cycles of therapy by 30 -41% of patients per week, while opi[INVESTIGATOR_257009] 12-20% of patients during their weekly cycles of therapy (Figure 4). 
 
Figure 4:  
 
 
 
Data from the second cohort of patients, receiving higher paclitaxel doses every 3 weeks, 
demonstrated similar findings except that the pain was more severe (mean scores P -APS 
scores of about 4, on a 10- point scale, versus about 1.5, on a 10 point scale, with the lower 
dose weekly treatments) and patients took more analgesics.1  At this time, these data, in 
total, strongly support that it is much more likely that this acute pain syndrome is related to 
nerve injury as opposed to being related to muscle or joint pathology.  
 
1.3 Prevention/treatment approaches for P -APS and paclitaxel induced peripheral 
neuropathy  
 
Given that both of these pa clitaxel toxicity syndromes appear to be related to nerve 
pathology, studying agents that treat neuropathic pain makes sense, as a means of trying to 
prevent and treat both of these problems. The first published randomized, placebo-
controlled, double-blinded, cross -over trial published to date, examining a treatment to 
prevent the P -APS, was done by [CONTACT_27156], evaluating glutamine.7  More recently, we 
published the results of a placebo- controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], evaluating the utility of pregabalin 
for  P -APS and paclitaxel -induced peripheral neuropathy.  Unfort unately, the results did not 
support further evaluation of this approach.   
 
1.4 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_257010]  
 
A relatively recent review article, titled:  Supportive Cryotherapy: A Review from Head to 
Toe, details the history of cryotherapy as a part of the management of patients with cancer  
(Kadakia et al., 2014). Cryotherapy was initially reported to be helpful for decreasing Adriamycin -induced alopecia, with initial studies dating back to the 1970s.  There has been 
a recent resurgence of this approach with newer methods of providing scalp cryotherapy.  
Oral cryotherapy was first reported to be helpful for preventing 5- fluorouracil induced 
mucositis in 1991, in a manuscript published by [CONTACT_257048], by [CONTACT_257049] C mucositis guidelines, following multiple confirmatory trials.  
Cryotherapy has also been reported to be beneficial for decreasing 5-fluorouracil-induced 

 9 RU221511I 
  ocular toxicity.  Additionally, it has been shown to decrease chemotherapy -induced 
onycholysis (Matsu moto 2009). 
   
There are several sources of information that support that cryotherapy can decrease 
paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.  I (CLL) initially heard about cryotherapy potentially being 
helpful for preventing paclitaxel-associated neuropathy in about 2011, when  
 mentioned it to me.  I was aware of it being helpful for preventing docetaxel-
associated nail toxicity, but not neuropathy. 
 
In September 2012, I saw a communication from  who wrote the 
following: 
 
“I saw a [ADDRESS_312357] child later this month. 
Since Finger/Toe cryotherapy during taxane infusion has become standard at my 
cancer center, we have seen no more Grade [ADDRESS_312358] to go. ”  
 
Follow-up discussions in [ADDRESS_312359] of my recollection, a Canadian group was also trying to study this issue a few years ago.  Again, no report has become available regarding this effort.  
 In 2013/2014, I had a patient who had previously received paclitaxel and had developed 
marked fingernail toxicity along with some peripheral neuropathy.  A few years later, when 
I saw her again, she had developed another primary breast cancer.  Her neuropathy had 
resolved along with her fingernail problems.  This time, to preven t nail toxicity, we had her 
keep her fingers and toes in an ice slush bath during her paclitaxel therapy.  With this, she 
did not develop anything nail toxicity and she also did not develop any recurrent 
neuropathy. 
 
  

 [ADDRESS_312360] now at  contact[CONTACT_257050] e- mail message:  
 
“The reason that I am emailing you is because I have been having patients placing 
ice packs on hands and feet during taxane therapy...which has resulted of course in 
few if any cases of grade 2 changes BUT they are also reporting NO neuropathy, 
as you showed with ice chips for 5FU mucositis.”  
 After I asked him to provide more detail regarding how they provided the cryotherapy, 
because I thought this was worth studying furth er, I received the following message:  
 
“I was at the breast center today, and what they use (we tried the gel gloves but logistically not feasible, too much time, space were needed) is just small biohazard 
bags and ice from the ice machines patients use. We could standardize the size of 
the bags, and patients to hold them 15 before, during, and 15 min after. 
 
Pretty much every patient here is being given the ice bags, and anecdotally, no nail 
changes (as reported by [CONTACT_257051] 2005) and minimal to no neuropathy. Patients that are receiving taxanes for a second time as for recurrent disease are emphatic 
about the absence of neuropathy.” 
 
Additionally, a retrospective report, regarding docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy among [ADDRESS_312361] cancer patients, noted that patients who used frozen gloves and socks (40% of the patients) during treatment had a 44% reduction in subsequent neuropathy 
problems (P < 0.0001) (Eckhoff et al., 2013) .  
 When I presented this concept proposal at the 2015 Spring Allia nce meeting, three 
physicians claimed to be using topi[INVESTIGATOR_257011] (out of about 20 physicians 
present).  Afterwards, I spoke with  who noted that they have an 
ongoing phase II clinical trial (no control arm).  There was a patient advocacy group who was a strong proponent of this approach, not allowing her to have a control group. As of 
May 2015, they had enrolled [ADDRESS_312362] contributed to her symptoms.   
As far as proposing a mechanism that can explain why cryotherapy might be beneficial, there are data to demonstrate that patients receiving paclitaxel lose epi[INVESTIGATOR_257012] 
(Ko et al., 2014, Boyette-Davis et al., 2013, and Bennett et al., 2011).  Potentially, this is 
from a local reaction from chemotherapy getting to the distal epi[INVESTIGATOR_257012].  Cryotherapy should cause vasoconstriction and decrease the amount of paclitaxel getting to 
the distal epi[INVESTIGATOR_257012], thus resulting in decreased neuropathy.  
 A potential concern regarding this approach is that paclitaxel has a reported half- life of 
about five hours  (Gianni et al., 1995) . Given this, it would seem that decreasing blood flow 
during the time of chemotherapy administration would not have much effect.  However, docetaxel has a terminal half- life of 13.5 hours (Extra et al., 1993) , yet cryotherapy has 
repeatedly been shown to decrease nail toxicity  (Kadakia et al., 2014). Additionally, 
Adriamycin has reported half-life of 30 hours (Benjamin et al., 1977) , yet scalp cryotherapy 
can decrease alopecia, when only given for a couple of hours (Kadakia et al., 2014).  In all 

 11 RU221511I 
  three of these situations, it may be that the cryotherapy decreases blood flow to target 
tissues when there are peak drug concentrations in the plasma, and this decreases the 
toxicity.  
 The above data support further evaluation of cryotherapy as a means to prevent paclitaxel-
associated neuropathy.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_257013] a larger phase III, more definitive, trial.  The data from this trial will provide an estimate of the amount of 
potential benefit from this approach.  
 
1.5 Proposed Clinical Trial Design  
 
This trial will be a controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_257014] a control arm. There will not be a double- blinded placebo arm, as it is virtually impossible to try to 
replicate cryotherapy treatment, in a double blinded manner.

6.0  Registration/Randomization Procedures  
 
6.1  Registration Procedures  
 
6.11 To register a patient, access the ACCRU web page at 
 click on “Training Page” and enter the 
registration/randomization appli c ation.  The registration/randomization application is 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Back up and/or system support contact 
[CONTACT_15920].  If unable to access the Web site, call the 
Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) Registration Office at 
 between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time (Monday 
through Friday). 
 
The 
instructions for the registration/randomization application are available using the 
Help button.  Prior to initiation of protocol treatment, this process must be completed in 
its entirety and a ACCRU subject ID number must be available as noted in the 
instructions.  It is the responsibility of the individual and institution registering the 
patient to confirm the process has been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent.  Patient registration via the registration/randomization application can be 
confirmed in any of the following ways: 
 
• Contact [CONTACT_15921] .  If the patient was 
fully registered, the ACCRU Registration Office staff can access the 
information from the centralized database and confirm the registration.  
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Finding/Displaying 
Information about A Regi stered Subject.”  
 
6.[ADDRESS_312365] be on file (no less than annually) at the Registration Office 
  If the necessary documentation is not submitted in advance 
of attempting patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the 
patient may not be enrolled in the protoc ol until the situation is resolved.  
 When the study has been permanently closed to patient enrollment, submission of annual IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary.  
 6.13 Prior to accepting the registration/randomization, the registration/randomization 
application will verify the following:  
• IRB approval at the registering institution  
• Patient eligibility  

 14 RU221511I 
  • Existence of a signed consent form 
• Existence of a signed authorization for use and disclosure of protected health 
information   
 
6.[ADDRESS_312366] begin ≤ 28 days after 
registration.  
 
6.15 Pretreatment tests/procedures (see Section 4.0) must be completed within the 
guidelines specified on the test schedule.  
 6.[ADDRESS_312367] commence at an ACCRU institution under the 
supervision of a health care professional , with plans for all the paclitaxel to be 
given at this institution

6.2 Randomization Procedures  
 
6.21 The factors defined in Section 5.0, together with the registering membership, will 
be used as stratification factors.  
 6.22  After the patient has been registered into the study, the values of the stratification factors will be recorded, and the patient will be assigned to one of the following 
treatment groups using the Pocock and Simon dynamic allocation procedure which 
balances the marginal distributions of the stratification factors between the 
treatment groups (Pocock & Simon 1975):   
• topi[INVESTIGATOR_257018]

7.2 Methods of delivering cryotherapy  
 
Hands 
 
• Fill provided quart bag (with outside pocket/sleeve) 2/3 full of crushed ice.   
• Fill another quart bag (no sleeve on this one) 2/3 full of crushed ice.  
 15 RU221511I 
  • Put light cotton mitten on one hand and put the hand in the pocket/sleeve of the one 
ice bag  (use of th e mittens is recommended, but optional).  
• Place this bag (with the hand in the pocket/sleeve) in another one gallon bag.   
• Put the other bag over the hand, inside the gallon bag. 
• Put a towel underneath to catch any leakage and then consider putting all on a tray.   
• Repeat for the other hand.  
• Note that, if an IV is in a hand, then that site should not be covered by a glove or by [CONTACT_257054] (so that nurses and patients can see the site in the rare case that there is a drug extravasation).  The hand can still have the palmar surface on the ice.  
 
Feet 
• Fill provided quart bag (with outside pocket/sleeve) 2/3 full of crushed ice.   
• Fill a 1 -gallon ice bag ½ full of crushed ice.  
• Put light cotton ped on one foot  (use of the peds is recommended, but optional) . 
• Put one foot into the sleeve and then on the bottom of an 11 x 13 x 6 inch plastic container.  
• Put the second ice bag over the foot.  
• Repeat for the other foot.  
• Can use both feet in one container or use individual containers for each foot.   
• An alternative is to use a 1-gallon ice bag ½ full of crushed ice (instead of the pocket bag), 
put this bag in the container, place a foot on it and put another ice bag over the top of the 
foot. 
 
General  
• Make sure that ice is replenished if it melts.  
• If the treatment gets too cold, the patient can temporarily remove extremity from part or all 
of the ice contact, understanding that the goal is to keep the extremities as cold as is possible to decrease blood supply when there are high concentrations of t he paclitaxel in the 
blood.  
 
 7.3 At clinician’s discretion participants will also be recommended a usual regimen of non-
opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595] (acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed) for “breakthrough” pain 
on the days following chemotherapy (i.e. the paclitaxel acute pain syndrome) with the option of low dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_257020] (e.g., oxycodone 5mg every 1- 2 hours as 
needed).   
  
8.0 Treatment  Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 8.1    Cryotherapy   
 
 If the patient develops any clinically significant adverse event attributed to topi[INVESTIGATOR_257021], per nurse/physician 
discretion. Temporary cessation can consist of having a patient withdraw fingers/feet from 
the ice and put them back in the cryo therapy as tolerated.   The patient should continue to 
be followed according to protocol criteria; this includes completing questionnaires.  
 
9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care  
 
9.1 Other treatment as necessary for the control of chemotherapy related symptoms is allowed, 
with the exception of therapy for prevention of paclitaxel- associated acute pain syndrome 
and/or prevention of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (noting that treatment of 
pain can be used, as outlined in section 7.2).

Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, 
or welfare of subjects  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, 
the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 18 RU221511I 
   
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event.

13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of Patient   
  
13.1 A patient is deemed ineligible if at the time of registration, the patient did not satisfy each 
and every eligibility criteria for study entry. The patient may continue treatment off -
protocol at the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the 
patient was properly registered.  The patient will go directly off of the study.  
• If the patient received treatment, all data up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted

submitted.  The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at the discretion of the 
physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patient was properly registered.   
13.3 A patient is deemed a cancel  if he/she is removed from the study for any reason before any 
study treatment is given.  On -study material and the End of Active Treatment/Cancel 
Notification Form must be submitted.   
13.4 If the patient starts  any additional neurotoxic chemotherapy , or changes to a different 
paclitaxel treatment regimen,  the patient should be taken off study. All protocol procedures 
should be stopped. 
 13.5 If the patient stops topi[INVESTIGATOR_257023], the patient should continue 
to fill out weekly questionnaires on -study as long as the patient is on the paclitaxel.  
 
13.6 At the end of paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment, the patient will continue to be followed on 
study as part of the observation phase.  Monthly questionnaires will be completed for 6 months from the completion of paclitaxel treatment.  
 13.7  If the paclitaxel dose is delayed , missed , or skipped the patient should continue to fill out 
weekly questionnaires.   
14.0 Body Fluid Biospecimens : None

15.1 Nursing Guidelines:  
Educate the patient regarding the cryotherapy procedure.   
If a patient’s hand(s) or foot/feet become painful while receiving cryotherapy, then examine 
them to make sure that color is good.  If there is concern about frostbite or pain, then you 
can remove part (e.g., top bag) or all of the ice, temporarily or perm anently, as clinically 
indicated.   
 
  
 [ADDRESS_312374] a small difference between the two study arms, 
given the small patient numbers in t his pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] , if the true response is large , there is a 
high likelihood that we will observe a statistically significant difference (see Sec tion 16.3). 
 Due to the nature of pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], descriptive statistics and statistical plots will be mainly 
utilized.  Statistical hypothesis testings will be used in an exploratory manner and shall be 
interpreted accordingly.   The difference between the t opi[INVESTIGATOR_257024], if any, is 
clinically meaningful and important, and worthy of further studies.   
 
Statistical endpoints for goals 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 will be analyzed in similar manners, where 
means and 95% CIs will be produced for continuous data for both the topi[INVESTIGATOR_257025].  For categorical/discrete data, frequency counts and percentage will be produced.  The mean estimates will be com pared and differences in frequency 
distributions noted.

  16.3 Sample Size, Power, Accrual time, and Study Duration (primary endpoint completion time) 
 
Due to the exploratory nature of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the sample size of 46 (23 patients per arm) 
is determined by [CONTACT_257058], rather than based on a formal 
hypothesis testing of the primary endpoint. However, in terms of the prim ary endpoint of 
the CIPN -[ADDRESS_312376] at the α

  Power ( % )       [ADDRESS_312378] 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_312379] to complete accrual of 46 patients in approximately 10 
months. 
 
16.4 Adverse Event stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257029]. We do note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257030] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of 
the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event 
profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The st udy team may choose to suspend 
accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. 
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events that 
the study team considers to be at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e., an adverse 
event with attribute specified as “possible,” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy the 
following: 
 
If there are 10 or more patients on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_257031] a 50% increase in grade 4 or higher non -hematologic adverse events (compared to the control arm) 
in the first 20 treated patients; or a 25% increase in grade 4 or higher 
nonhematologic adverse events on the topi[INVESTIGATOR_257032] 20 patients total are accrued.  
 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or  
“unlikely to be related” to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.  
  
 [ADDRESS_312380] (DSMB). Early termination of accrual will be 
considered if there is evidence of unacceptable toxicity.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
 
Docu ment Date: 10/17/16  
  
Objective : 
Our objective is to compare the prolongation of pregnancy by [ADDRESS_490638] 
preterm labor by 48 hours  in more women compared to nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The primary 
outcomes measure d will be delaying preterm  delivery by 48 hours; secondary outcomes 
measured will include delay of delivery by 7 days and  decreasing delivery before 37 
weeks.  
 
Background:  
Preterm birth accounts for 70% of neonatal deaths, and 25 -50% of cases of long term 
neurologic  impairment in children. About 12% of all live births occur before term and 
50% of these were  preceded by [CONTACT_390952].[ADDRESS_490639] been well described in 
the literature and are  recommended to provide time for corticosteroid administration, 
transfer to a tertiary facility and  allow time for magnesium infusion. There are four main 
categories of tocolytics described by  [CONTACT_22448]: calcium channel blockers, prostaglandin 
inhibitors, magnesium sulfate and B2 agonists.  B2 agonists are no longer used out side 
of an acute setting due to significant maternal side effects;  a black box warning has 
been issued by [CONTACT_390953] a result.  Magnesium sulfate 
serves dual purposes in obstetrical medicine: it is used for neonatal  neuroprotecti on and 
as a tocolytic. However, a recent meta -analysis revealed that it is a weak  tocolytic agent 
compared to other tocolytics. It also revealed that both calcium channel blockers  and 
prostaglandin inhibitors are consistently ranked among the top three toc olytics in 
delaying  delivery by [ADDRESS_490640] the power or standardization of enrollment to  guide us 
clinically. Here we propose a multi -institutional randomized controlled study directly  
comparing nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390930]. We plan to 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_390931], and involve all five medical campuses in the state.  
 
Outcomes : 
1. To compare the prolongation of pregnancy by 48 hours after women are diagnosed 
with threatened preterm labor p rior to 32 weeks gestational age and treated with either 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390932]. The primary outcome measured will be delay of (preterm 
delivery) by 48 hours.  Secondary outcomes will be delay of delivery by 7 days and rate 
of delivery before 37 weeks.  
2. Other secondary maternal outcomes included will be maternal adverse side effects 
significant  enough to stop or delay medication use, need for a second tocolytic to halt 
preterm contractions.  Neonatal outcomes measured will be respi[INVESTIGATOR_390933] (RDS), interventricular  hemorrhage (IVH), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 
necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), intubation,  number of NICU days and neonatal mortality.  
 
Existing Knowledge : 
Specifically we intend to answer the question of which of these two tocolytics should be 
used as a first line agent. Again there is much evidence showing that calcium channel 
blockers and  prostaglandin inhibitors are the two classes of medications that are  
superior in delaying delivery for  up to [ADDRESS_490641] preterm labor. Using the optimal tocolytic 
agent initially can potentially  prevent or delay preterm birth with its resultant neonatal 
morbi dity and mortality.  
 
Previous Research : 
Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] a well -studied tocolytic. A Cochrane review in 2011 evaluated data on all 
calcium  channel blockers used for tocolysis; over [ADDRESS_490642]. Furthermore calcium channel blockers 
(compared to other tocolytics) decreased the  incidence of RDS, NEC, IVH and neonatal 
jaundice in the newborn.[ADDRESS_490643] two hours ; however , if there was a response to indomethacin within the 
first two hours, there was no difference  in delivery at [ADDRESS_490644] inclusion  
criteria for preterm labor.3 
The second randomized control study compared 3 different tocolytics: nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
indomethacin and  magnesium. This study had several flaws as well, including a small 
sample size (approximately 90 -114 in each group)  and tocolytic group cross over. 
Although tocolytic cross over was allowed, the  subjects remained in their initial group for 
analysis and for this reason this study does not allow for  direct comparison. In addition, 
twin gestations were included. This grou p is at high risk for preterm  delivery and 
neonatal morbidity at baseline, are thought to have a different mechanism for preterm  
delivery, and likely have a different response to tocolytic agents, all of which could 
potentially skew  data. They also reporte d a gestational age of enrollment from 20 to 32 
weeks. As the main goal of  tocolytic therapy is to administer corticosteroids (given 
between 24 -34 weeks gestation) and allow  transfer to a tertiary center, inclusion of 
patients less than 23 weeks gestation – who fall within the  non-viable range and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_390934], with tocolytic  treatment or 
corticosteroid administration, was problematic in this study.[ADDRESS_490645] line

Methods:  
This is a randomized controlled open -label trial comparing two groups of women with 
preterm labor  who are treated with either indomethacin or nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_53530] a tocolytic 
agent. The study will be  conducted at each of the five University of [LOCATION_004] medical 
center hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In order to be  admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390936], su bjects 
will have to be in preterm labor defined as  regular uterine contractions (at least 6 per 
hour) associated with changes in cervical dilatation  and/or effacement, cervical 
dilatation of > 2 cm at presentation or a change in cervical dilatation of  > 1 cm, and > 25 
to 50% effacement and/or a short cervical length (per institution’s policy) as  obtained by 
[CONTACT_390954] a positive fetal fibronectin.  All women 
will be treated in a uniform fashion with initial hydration, ev aluation for etiologic infection,  
administration of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal maturity, and magnesium 
sulfate for  neuroprotection. Magnesium will be administered according to each 
institution’s magnesium for  neuroprotection protocol. Wo men will be randomized to 
either tocolytic therapy with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390937].  
Nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390938]:  Subjects will be given nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10mg orally and repeated every 
[ADDRESS_490646] 48 hours of treatment. This is  a commonly used dose and has been 
described in a large meta -analysis reviewing nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390939] -Agudelo et al.1 Of the 26 studies reporting on  nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390940], the dosing ranged from a loading dose of 10 to 30mg orally or  sublingually, 
followed by 10 to 20mg orally every 4 -8 hours. 12 of those studies used a repeat  
loading dose every 15 -20 minutes. The decision was made to proceed with nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
10mg orally  and repeated every 20 minutes for a maximum d ose of 30mg followed by 
20mg every 6 hours since  it a commonly prescribed dosing for acute tocolysis.  
Indomethacin Treatment:  Those randomized to indomethacin will be given 100mg orally 
as a loading dose followed by 50mg  every [ADDRESS_490647] 48 hour s of treatment. 
This regimen was decided after reviewing the  Cochrane review on COX inhibitors for 
treating preterm labor.2 10 of the 13 trials included in the  review used indomethacin. The 
dosing ranged from 50 to 100mg loading dose followed by 25mg  to 50mg orally every 4 -
6 hours. The loading dose was mostly given rectally. A recent randomized  control trial 
compared indomethacin vs. two other tocolytics.3 The i ndomethacin dosing used was  
an initial 100mg suppository, repeated one time if contractions persisted after two hours, 
followed  by 50mg orally every 6 hours. This regimen was associated with increased 
incidence of fetal ductal  constriction (13/97) and olig ohydramnios (5/97) when 
compared to the other two treatment groups.  Therefore, we propose using a one time 
loading dose of 100mg orally followed by 50mg every [ADDRESS_490648] been 2 
case reports of reversible neuromuscular blockade in this setting.4,5 One of these case  
repor ts used a total dose of 500mg of magnesium5 – which is significantly more than 
what would  be administered for our neuroprotective dosing. There are studies, albeit 
small, that show  concurrent use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390941].6,7,8 One such  study describes expected hemodynamic changes with the 
concurrent use of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390942] a decreased mean arterial 
pressure, systemic vascular resistance and  increase in cardiac index.7 The magnesium 
dosing in the study was 5 grams over 20min followed  by 3g/hr which is a higher 
maintenance dose than any of the campuses uses for neuroprotection.  
One of the largest studies that examined maternal and neonatal outcomes in the setting 
of preec lampsia was the Magpie tr ial,8 which had about 30% concurrent use with 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390943]. While on magnesium, all [ADDRESS_490649] to monitor closely for magnesium toxicity 
including serial neurol ogic exams  and/or magnesium levels. If any early adverse signs 
are seen, magnesium will be discontinued  and/or calcium gluconate administered to 
reverse any neuromuscular blockade. For this reason,  concomitant use of magnesium 
with either nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390944].  
After [ADDRESS_490650] and the end of  the study particip ants’ time in 
the study. Gestational age at delivery will be collected as data but  analyzed in a 
dichotomous fashion i.e. prior to [ADDRESS_490651] 
of preterm labor (cervical dilation) or completion of betamethasone a dministration (e.g. 
[ADDRESS_490652] dose). The primary study outcome is extension of pregnancy by 
[ADDRESS_490653] 
or during subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059](s), data would be collected at the time of delivery. 
For the neonates, data will be collected through discharge. No  neonatal follow up is 
required. There may be subjects who deliver at another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the patient  gives 
permission, then we will obtain records from the appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
Subject’s privacy will be protected by [CONTACT_390955]. In addition, data will always be kept in a secured, 
locked location. Subject  screening, enrollment and case report forms will be kept in a 
binder that will be locked in a room /drawer at all times. These case report forms will be 
uploaded to a secure online database run by  a well -established company Tiatros. 
Tiatros uses online software to organize, analysis and allow  communication among 
principal investigators in the study. Most importantly this is done securely  and follows 
HIPPA regulations.  
 
Summary  
This comparative study of nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390945] 5 UC medical campuses (UC Irvine, UC Davis, UC San Diego, UC 
San Francisco, UC Los  Angeles) using the Reliance Agreement. UCI is the reviewing 
IRB. UC Davis, UCSD, UCSF,  UCLA are the relying IRBs. All tocolytic treatment will be 
given in the primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_390946]. Medication is discontinued once there is 
arrest of preterm labor, [ADDRESS_490654] dose  of betamethasone, or when delivery is 
deemed imminent or unavoidable, and depending on  institution’s policy at the time 
magne sium initiated for neuroprotection. No maintenance tocolytic  medication will be 
given (i.e. longer than 48 hours) and none will be given as an outpatient.

Statis tical Analy sis: 
The purpose of this study is to determine whether nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_390949] [ADDRESS_490656] 
preterm labor for 48 hours  in 72% of cases1 and the indomethacin group to arrest 
preterm labor for 48 hours 83% of cases.2 Using a power of 80%, alpha of 0.05 we 
calculate 225 subjects are needed in each group.  
The primary o utcomes and other dichotomous outcomes will be evaluated using Chi-
square. We also  anticipate a 25% difference between groups based on prolongation of 
pregnancy by [CONTACT_390956] a small RCT using nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_117342]. ritodrine conducted 
by [CONTACT_390957].3 Continuous  variables will be compared using Student’s t -test. Sub -
group analyses will be done to compare  differences across the sites. Regression 
analyses will be applied where appropriate such as for  neonatal complications and the 
consideration of gestat ional age.

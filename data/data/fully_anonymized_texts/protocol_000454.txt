RY & PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  
6A. In lay language,  briefly  summarize the objective and significance of the research.  
COVID -19 has impacted the health and social fabric of individuals and families living across the United 
States; and it has disproportionately affected people living in urban communities with co -morbidities, 
those working in high-risk settings, refusing or unable to adhere to CDC guidelines, and more. Social 
determinants of health (SDH), such as stigma, racial discrimination, xenophobia, incarceration, and 
poverty have been associated with increased exposure to COVID -19 and increased deaths. Marginalized 
com munities, defined as low -income and racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods, where residents 
experience increased barriers (e.g., inadequate housing, high -risk jobs) to prevention and treatment, 
bear disproportionately higher rates of co -morbidities associated with more severe cases of COVID-19. 
While effective and potent vaccines are becoming more available, it will take time to reach herd immunity and it is unclear how long newly -developed vaccines provide protection and how effective 
they are against emerging variants. Therefore, prevention methods recommended by [CONTACT_263632] (CDC) – i.e., testing, hand -washing, social distancing, contact [CONTACT_144842], 
vaccination, and quarantine -- are essential to reduce the rates of COVID -19 in marginalized

adapted and tested to help address COVID -19 prevention needs. Specifically, Navigation Services (NS) 
have been shown to increase HIV testing and adherence to treatment while addressing structural 
barriers that deter treatment engagement in high -risk communities; and Brief Counseling (BC) has been 
shown to increase HIV treatment engagement.  
[CONTACT_263685]
ndsor has an  ongoing grant (3 R01 MD010629-04S2 – From here after referred to as COVID -19 NJ 
Study) ) which aims to optimize an adaptive intervention to increase testing, and access to treatment and 
to prevention of COVID -19 infections in a medically or socially vulnerable sample of 670 people in Essex 
County, NJ. The COVID -19 NJ Study is under the North Jersey Community Research Initiative (NJCRI) IRB 
oversight,  entitled Optimization of a new adaptive intervention  to increase COVID -19 testing among 
people at high risk in an urban community , Protocol #: CWCOVIDSUPP -UIUC -NJCRI 102497-[ZIP_CODE]-
[ADDRESS_320727] to include a sample of 548 people in Illinois. We will use the same protocol that was used in NJ in addition to  de-identified data that is currently being collected by [CONTACT_25963] -19 NJ Study. The final study 
sample will include 670 people from NJ and 548 people from IL for a total of 1,218. Data from the 670 people in NJ will be treated as secondary data and data fr om the 548 people in IL will be treated as 
primary data under the COVID -19 IL Study IRB protocol. 
The COVID -1
9 IL Study will use Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and Community -Based 
Participatory Research (CBPR) principles and best practices to help facilitate recruitment and to make results readily available to the population. Illinois participants will be randomized two se parate times: 
First, into two distinct groups to receive: (1) navigation services or (2) informational brochure. We aim to 
help participants to get a COVID -[ADDRESS_320728] follow -up ([ADDRESS_320729] baseline ). 
Second, after completing th e first follow -up, participants are then randomized again to continue with the 
original intervention or switch to a new one. We then collect data at 2; 5 ; 12; and [ADDRESS_320730] -baseline 
follow-ups.  
The COVID -19 IL Study  specific aims  include: 
Primary Aims: (1) To examine the effectiveness of an adaptive intervention to increase COVID -19 testing 
and adherence to CDC-recommendations of preventive behaviors – social distancing, hand -washing, 
mask -wearing, vaccination - on comparable but distinct sa mples. We will control for baseline, time, 
demographics and COVID risk; (2) To examine the immediate and medium-term impact of the adaptive intervention on COVID testing and adherence to recommendations by [CONTACT_263633] 2,5,12, 
and [ADDRESS_320731] baseline.

they need. Those randomiz ed to Brief Counseling will complete one 15 minutes long phone session. 
Those randomized to Critical Dialogue will complete one 60 minutes long session in -person or online.  
7F. Narratively d escribe the research procedures in the order in which they will be conducted.  
This study will track participants for six months in order to capture changes over time in COVID -19 
testing and adherence to public health recommendations. We will use a Sequential, Multiple Assignment 
Randomized Trial (SMART) with a total sa mple of 1,[ADDRESS_320734] know we are looking for the participant because it is time for them to complete their follow -up 
survey. Participants may choose not to provide any contacts. Those who complete the baseline will then be randomized by [CONTACT_263634]: 
Navig
ation Services (NS): Navigation services include assessment and support with service referrals. Each 
participant randomized to this intervention will meet with a peer navigator in person or on Z oom 
Conferencing for 30 minutes to go over results from their social and health needs assessment that is retrieved from the base -line survey. The navigator shares information about COVID -19, answers 
questions about testing, and makes referrals to other needed services (e.g., housing, food, mental health, employment, transportation, primary care). The participant is then referred to the testing site and encouraged to get tested as soon as possible. The peer navigator calls participants who consent to follow up, find out what services they received, and what services they still need. The frequency of 
sessions is decided between the participant and the navigator. The peer navigator can then make new

COVID -19 testing (including where and how to get tested), and one with information about COVID -[ADDRESS_320736] between baseline and Follow -up 1 will be randomized to either continue to receive their 
original intervention (NS or Brochure) or to switch to receive Brief Counseling. Those who fail to get a COVID -[ADDRESS_320737] follow -up will be randomized to continue the original

 Counseling (BC): Brief Co uns eling is a [ADDRESS_320738] result s 
and offers recommendations and information about COVID -19 treatment and prevention.  Clinicians will 
be members of the research team and employed by [CONTACT_263635].  
Critic
al Dialogue (CD): Critical Dialogue includes one two -hour “f ocus group” session facilitated in person 
or online by a trained licensed facilitator. Group critical dialogue is prompted by [CONTACT_263636] ( NCCB) to foster a deeper understanding of 
how systematic stigma, feelings of rage as victims of discrimination, and/or apathy may impact participants’ beliefs and behaviors related to COVID -[ADDRESS_320739] procedures and HIPPA protected data collection and sharing: Enrolled participants

social distancing).  
After
 each assessment, participants will be asked to provide extensive locator information, on forms 
used for the parent study, including formal and informal contacts who can reach the participant in a 
variety of contingencies. During the follow -up period,  outreach workers will maintain monthly  contact 
[CONTACT_263638]. Randomization and data collection will be done online using Redcap.   We will voice record all Critical Dialogue sessions with 
participan ts’ consent and will randomly select 20% of them for analysis.  
The research team will randomly select 35 participants at each site who decline to be tested for COVID -
19 and invite each of them to complete an in -depth, one-on -one, qualitative interview la sting about 30 
minutes. After providing written informed consent, participants will be assigned code names and asked to talk about their experiences with the intervention, barriers they faced to testing and adhering to 
public health guidelines, and their i deas about how to address these barriers. The interviews will be 
digitally voice -recorded, transcribed and entered into Atlas.ti for storage and analysis. Transcripts and 
Atlas.ti files will be identified only by [CONTACT_263639].

and protocol modifications)?  [CONTACT_41214] and [CONTACT_263686] er will be responsible for overseeing all data 
collection and processing.  While the proposed study does not seek to test the effectiveness of drugs or a 
medical device delivered in multiple sites, it will test an adaptive intervention in communities with 
marginalized populations and there is potential for harm. Thus, we developed a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) and will create an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) including clinical, intervention, community members, and statistica l experts, to conduct periodic 
independent analyses of the evaluation data in the data collection phase.   
Any re
search staff member who learns of an adverse event is responsible for reporting the event to the 
Principal Investigators (PI), who are in turn responsible for discussing the event to make a joint decision about whether the event is serious or non -serious .  Events will be categorized as adverse or serious 
adverse according to NIH guidelines: “Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that may present itself during treatment or administration of an intervention, and which may 
or ma y not have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as 
any medical occurrence that results in death; is life- threatening; requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448]; creates per sistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defects.”  As such, adverse events (AEs) occurring during the course of the 
study will be collected, documented, and reported to the PIs. Each week a study investigator will review  
the AE Forms from the previous week for events that were reported as new or continuing.  
Any SAE will be reported to the IRB within 48 hours of the occurrence. The report of SAEs will include whether they were expected or unexpected, a rating of severity  of the event, a brief narrative summary 
of the event, a determination of whether a causal relationship existed between the study procedures 
Protocol Form
Revised: 02/07/2020  and the event, whether the informed consent should be changed as a result of the event and whether all 
enrolled participants should be notified of the event. Finally, as part of the annual progress report 
(noncompeting continuation application) to NIH, we would provide summary information on all SAEs 
that have occurred during that year.  
Any a
ctions taken by [CONTACT_1201] w ill be reported promptly to NIH via the Project Officer or appropriate 
parties. 
Additionally, the PIs and [CONTACT_263687] will closely monitor the validity and integrity of the data on an on -
going basis. The DSMB with also conduct biannual monitoring of the data through spot checks and independent preliminary analysis of the data. For instance, the PIs and the project staff will meet regularly with project interviewers to review assessments and coding of incoming data. The PIs will be 
responsible for ensuring that data are being coded, entered and cleaned appropriately. The full research 
team will meet every week for [ADDRESS_320748] the

member of the research team and all members of the NCCB and the Illinois Community Collaborative Board (ICCB) will be required to undergo human subject protection training and provide a certificate of completion to the  
IRB prior to any contact [CONTACT_80414].   Standards of confidentiality include the use of code 
numbers and code names for participants and other individuals they may mention. The only place participants’ names or other identifying information will appear is on informed consent for ms and  
locator forms (used for follow -up interviews after the baseline). These forms will be kept  electronically in 
REDCAP , in a folder separate from the data. Only full time, trained staff in the project  including the 
outreach works, project coordinator, research assistant, and PIs will have access to these files. Peer  
navigators will not have access to data from the individuals that are randomized  into their groups. They 
will receive a report from RedCAP highlighting any reported risk for COVID -19 exposur e that they will be 
discussing with the participant during the navigation.  
The electronic files generated through data collection will be identified by [CONTACT_263642]: 02/07/[ADDRESS_320750] -protected devices/servers, separate from identify ing 
information and available only to project staff. This helps to ensure that no identifying information will

that any of these recordings contain information that can put any of our participants in danger of being harmed , we will destroy the recording.
 
Our intervie wers are trained to watch participants carefully and will stop questioning if an individual 
appears uneasy. At every interview, participants will be informed that they may ask the interviewer to stop if they are feeling uncomfortable. Referrals to counselo rs are available if participants wish and

3. RISKS & BENEFITS  
13A. Describe all known risks to the participants for the activities proposed, such as risks to the 
participants’ physical well -being, privacy, dignity, self -respect,  psyche, emotions, reputation, 
employability, and criminal and legal status. Risks must be described on consent forms.  
The main potential risks of this study include inadvertent violation of confidentiality and emotional distress on the part of participant s. The use of code names and numbers along with other procedures 
described below are intended to prevent violations of confidentiality.  It is important to be aware that 
the prospect of testing positive for COVID -19 may be a cause of substantial fear and a nxiety among 
Protocol Form
Revised: 02/07/[ADDRESS_320756] staff are trained to carefully follow detailed 
procedures designed to assure that no information about any participant (or others they may mention) will be given to anyone other than members of the research staff included in the IRB protocol. Every member of the research team and all NCCB a nd ICCB members will be required to undergo human 
subject protection training and provide a certificate of completion to the IRB prior to any contact [CONTACT_263646]. Standards of confidentiality include the use of code numbers and code names for 
participants and other individuals they may mention. The only place participants’ names or other identifying information will appear is on informed consent forms and locator forms that are password protected in RedCap, the software used in the study. This identifying information is used for follow -up 
interviews after the baseline, to remind participants of Critical Dialogue group sessions if they are 
randomized to that condition and to locate participants if we are unable to reach them. Consent forms 
will be  stored in locked filing cabinets at CBHC, separate from any data. [CONTACT_263688], the Project Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_263619], will retain the keys to the filing cabinets at each location. Only outreach staff, [CONTACT_41214] , [CONTACT_263688], and the group facilitator s will have access to the identifying information.  
The electronic files generated through data collection will be identified by [CONTACT_41211] -protected and HIPAA -compliant devices/cloud, separate from identifying information and 
available only to project staff. This helps to ensure that no identifying information will be disclosed in the 
unlikely event that computerized data are stolen or otherwise seen by [CONTACT_35532]. All 
identifying electronic data will be destroyed immediately after data collection is completed. Signed 
consent forms and audio recordings will be kept for 3 years after study completion. De -identified

in the informed consent forms.  
Part
icipants will be protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality issued by [CONTACT_18121]. NIH issues COCs 
automatically upon  funding approval. Under terms of the Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to 
disclose information that may identify a participant, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or 
local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. However, the Certificate cannot be 
used to resist a demand from [LOCATION_002] Government personnel for information that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet th e requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Researchers may also 
disclose the identity of participants who report intentions to harm themselves or others or if researchers 
have knowledge those participants are abusing children or elderly persons  
Our int
erviewers are trained to watch participants carefully and will stop questioning if an individual 
appears uneasy. At every interview, participants will be informed that they may ask the interviewer to 
stop if they are feeling uncomfortable. Referrals to counselors are available if participants wish and 
trained clinical counselors are available at CBHC in the event that someone may need immediate 
assistance, whether it is during data collection or during the intervention sessions. The Critical Dialogue is an intervention developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Windsor and the NCCB, to ensure that the group discussions happen 
in a safe way, where everyone is encouraged to challenge their own assumptions by [CONTACT_263647]. This starts with operational components 
where the intervention is clearly described so that people know what to expect, and ground rules are 
collaboratively created and enforced during group discussions. In preliminary research on the 
intervention, there were many instances where the critical questions posed led to a heated dialogue where people were able to express their conflicting views while respecting each other and considering the possibility of changing their points of view. Dr. W indsor will train a doctoral level social work 
research assistant to facilitate the groups. The RA has a great deal of experien ce facilitating groups 
dealing with these sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_263620]. In the unlikely event a discuss ion escalates to the point that it may challenge the safety of the group, there is an emergency 
protocol in place where trained clinical staff and security can intervene and deflect potential violence or stabilize medical emergencies. During the development and testing stages of the intervention, with close 
to [ADDRESS_320758] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee

community members and agencies that we can mobilize in case the need arises (e.g., access to detox  and 
emergency services, legal support clinics). 
Finally, t
he research team and the clinical team will engage in weekly project meetings to receive 
ongoing training, discuss the progress of the study and identify and address any potential issues. 
13C. Indicate the risk level.  
 No more than minimal risk  
(The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated for participation in the proposed resear c 
h are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily enc ountered in daily life or during 
the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests). 
 More than minimal risk (answer 1 3D) 
13D. If you checked that the research is more than minimal risk , describe the provisions for monitoring 
the data to ensure the safety of subjects , such as who will monitor data and how often, what criteria 
will be used to stop the research, etc.  
The MPIs will oversee data management, including data storage, security, random assignment and 
quality  assu
rance procedures, REDCap, software and hardware, and will ensure that all staff adheres to 
Human Subjects guidelines. Data management activities and procedures, including data confidentiality, 
will employ an electronic data management system to enhance efficiency, security and integrity of study data.  The ICCB will also be updated during meetings on data management and adherence to IRB 
protocol.  
Additionally
, integrity assessments will be conducted, which  include: (1) a checklist completed by 
[CONTACT_263649]; (2) exit interview . The NCCB and ICCB will review preliminary findings presented 
by [CONTACT_263650] a bi -monthly basis to address any potential adverse reactions that may occur and any 
safety co ncerns that may arise. If any participants are found to be unresponsive to the intervention 
during the course of the study, the Board will discuss the case and the participant may be terminated from the study and referred to relevant services in the community. The MPIs will meet bi -weekly with 
study staff to review study protocol adherence and address any potential problems. MPI [INVESTIGATOR_263621]. 
Protocol Form
Revised: 02/07/2020  13E. Describe the expected benefits of the research to the subjects and/or to society.  
The potential benefits to participants in this study and other members of the community are significant 
and may be long lasting. Significant short-term benefits include detecting and treating cases of COVID -19 
and preventing further transmission of the dis ease. While participants are enrolled in the study, referrals 
to resources to address social determinants of health (e.g., housing, food insecurity) may provide 
immediate tangible benefits. In addition, if participants express a need for mental health assi stance at 
any time, the project team and the I CCB are well equipped to either provide service or make appropriate 
referrals. After engaging in the interventions, participants may experience increased feelings of empowerment and self -esteem, both of which have been associated with improved health outcomes. If 
the study succeeds in reducing medical mistrust and increasing health literacy, those benefits may belong-lasting. Both the short-term and long- term potential benefits of this study justify the potentia l 
risks involved in participation.  
13F. Weigh the risks with regard to the benefits. Provide evidence that benefits outweigh risks.  
Knowledge to be gained from this investigation is important for understanding and addressing COVID -[ADDRESS_320760] taken to minimize these risks. Although participants’ risk of experiencing COVID -[ADDRESS_320761] staff will employ every effort to maintain confidentiality and to minimize any other potential risks; should a serious adverse event occur, it will be reported to the DSMB, Project Officer, funding agencies and the UIUC  IRB within [ADDRESS_320762].

MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738156] received second- line treatment for aGVHD p rior to study 
screening, in order to evaluate remestemcel -L’s effects in the absence of other second -line 
agents.  The study plans to treat at least [ADDRESS_738157] Disease (aGVHD)  
following allogeneic hematopoietic stem  cell transplant (HSCT) that has failed  to respond 
to treatment with systemic corticosteroid therapy.  Subjects may have Grades C and D 
aGVHD involving the skin, liver and/or gastrointesti nal (GI) tract or Grade B aGVHD  
involving the liver  and/or GI  tract, with or  without concomitant skin disease.  
Acute  GVHD  Treatment  Response  Criteria

with the exception of one or more  of the following: 
Skin: no rash,  non-progressive stage 1 rash, or residual  erythematous rash  involving <25% 
of the body surface without bullae ( not including residual faint erythema or 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]); 
Liver:  resolving elevations of total serum bilirubin concentration or total serum bilirubin 
concentration  of <2 mg/dl or <25% of baseline at  enrollment

another 
No response (NR)- No change in any organ stage in any organ system and no improvement 
in organ stage 
Progression - Deterioration in  at least one organ system by [CONTACT_561809]- Subjects  who  achieve an  overall  response (OR)  
Non-responder- Subjects  who do not achieve an  OR.  
Efficacy  Assessments 
Primary  Endpoint 
The rate of overall response (OR) in the study population at Day [ADDRESS_738158] initiation of therapy  (Day  0) with remestemcel -L (MSC).  
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738159]  has failed  to respond to  steroid  treatment, with  failure  to respond defined  as 
any Grade B -D (IBMTR grading) aGVHD that shows progression within 3 days or 
no improvement within 7 days of consecutive treatment with 2 mg/kg/day of 
methylprednisolone or equivalent. 
4. Subject  must be able to  be treated with  remestemcel -L within  [ADDRESS_738160] had persistent GI GVHD, as manifested by [CONTACT_561810] < 500 mL/ day (for subjects >50 kg), or < 30 mL/kg/day (for subjects ≤50 kg). See Table 2 : GVHD Organ Severity Criteria for values in ml/m
2. In the 
absence of nausea or vomiting, subject may still be considered to have Grade B GVHD if  
a. other causes of diarrhea have been ruled out (e.g., C. difficile, adenovirus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,  oral magnesium administration)  
 
and if 
 
b. the low stool volume reflects the effects of fasting, narcotics, or anti- diarrheal  medications.  
 
6. Subject must have adequate renal function, as defined by a calculated creatinine clearance of >30 mL/min per 1.73m
2. For subjects 1 to 18 years of age, creatinine 
clearance  should be calculated  using the Bedside Schwartz equation: 
 
GFR (ml/min  per 1.73 m2) = [0.413  height (cm)]/Serum  creatinine (mg/dl) 
 
For subjects less than 1 year old, renal function should be determined using the Schwartz equation adjusted for this age group: 
 
Creatinine clearance (ml/min per1.73 m
2)= (height [cm] x 0.45)/ (serum creatinine 
[mg/dL]) 
 
7. Subject has a minimum Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Level of [ADDRESS_738161] (or legal representative where appropriate) must be capable of providing written  informed consent. 
9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (≥ 10 years of age) must use a medically 
accepted method of contraception and must agree to continue use of this method for 
the duration of the study and for the follow-up time period. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD ), or steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) 
in conjunction with a barrier method. Guidance on childbearing potential and pregnancy testing  is located in  Appendix 6. 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738162] agree to use adequate 
contraception (barrier method or abstinence) during the study, including the follow- up time period.  
11. The subject must be willing and able to comply with study requirements, re main at  
the clinic, and return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation, as specified in this protocol during the study period.

3. Subject has received systemic agents other than steroids and prophylactic agents for primary  treatment of acute GVHD.  
4. Subject  shows evidence of  diffuse  alveolar  hemorrhage or other active pulmonary 
disease, which is likely to require more than 2L of oxygen via face mask or an  
estimated FiO
2 of 28% via other delivery methods in order to sustain an O 2 
saturation  of 92%. 
5. Subject  has any underlying or current  medical  or psychiatric condition that,  in the

Treatment  Groups  
This is a single- arm study; all enrolled  subjects  are to be treated  with  remestemcel -L. 
Treatment  Plan  
The trial design,  including treatment  plan, is outlined schematically  in Figure  1, which  
follows this synopsis. 
 
Initial Therapy 
Subjects will be treated with intravenous (IV) remestemcel-L at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  
(actual  body weight at screening) twice per week  for each  of [ADDRESS_738166] be administered by [CONTACT_2006] 28 ± 2 days. 
 
Subjects may continue to be treated with a stable dose of systemic steroid therapy until they 
are eligible for steroid taper and may continue on an established regimen of baseline prophylactic therapy following initiation of remestemcel-L (Day 0). No other medications  
for the treatment of aGVHD are to be introduced to subjects during the initial [ADDRESS_738167] 10% of the dose per week, not exceeding 25% of 
the dose per week, is recommended as described in Appendix 5, with the goal of discontinuing steroid by 10 weeks after initiating  taper.  
 
Assessments  
GVHD assessments will be performed at screening and weekly, beginning on Day 14, until  
Day 100 (±7 days)/End of Study. Assessments must  be after the  2nd dose of remestemcel -L 
is administered for each assessment week of the Initial Therapy period (or after the 1st dose 
of remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). The weekly  assessment visits should be 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738168]’s GVHD status has progressed  
from baseline assessment (through Day 28), according to the definition of progression of 
disease , below. From Day [ADDRESS_738169]’s GVHD status has  
progressed. Rescue therapy may be administered if necessary. If new GVHD medications  
are administered as rescue therapy based on these assessment(s), no further remestemcel -L 
infusions will be allowed. Subjects would remain in the study regardless of response and would continue to be evaluated per the assessment  schedule.  
 
Progression of disease is defined as increase by [CONTACT_561811]/baseline assessme nt up to Day [ADDRESS_738170] recent prior 
assessment from Day 28 to Day 100. Progression is not defined as ‘mixed response’ according to the definitions described above under Acute GVHD Treatment Response Criteria . 
 
Day 28 Therapy Assessment:  
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 28 (±2 days) to determine treatment response and whether a subject will be provided continued therapy. The Day [ADDRESS_738171] dose of r emestemcel -L is administered.  
Continued Therapy  will be allowed  for subjects according to their response to  treatment,  as 
described  below. 
 
Day 56 Assessment  of Response to Continued Therapy 
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 56 (±2 days) from treatment initiation for subjects receiving Continued Therapy after Day 28, in order to determine treatment response to the Continued Therapy. The Day [ADDRESS_738172] administration of  remestemcel -L. 
 
Continued  Therapy 
Eligible subjects may receive an additional 4 once- weekly infusions of remestemcel -L at 
the same initial dose of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual body weight at screening, which would 
begin within one week after the Day 28 therapy assessment. Infusions will be given once weekly (± 2 days) and all infusions must be administered within 28 days (± 2 days) from the first infusion. No addi tional treatment with remestemcel-L is allowed at any other point 
in time  unless the criterion for GVHD flare,  as defined in this protocol, is met. 
 
Eligibility  for Continued  Therapy 
Eligibility to receive Continued Therapy after the initial [ADDRESS_738173]’s  response assessments at  Day  28, as defined  in 
Table 4, compared with baseline, as follows: 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738174]   
  
Complete Response (CR):  If a subject displays CR, then no additional remestemcel -L will  
be administered.  
 
No Response (NR): If a subject displays NR, then no additional remestemcel- L will be  
administered.  
 
Partial Response (PR): If a subject displays PR, the subject will receive Continued 
Therapy. 
 
Mixed Response (MR): If a subject displays MR, the subject will receive Continued 
Therapy. 
 
GVHD flare: Subjects who have a GVHD flare of Grade B -D, after achieving a CR and  
before Day [ADDRESS_738175] treatment initiation, may receive additional remestemcel- L treatment  
per the Initial Therapy plan, consisting of remestemcel-L, IV, at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  
actual body weight at screening, twice per week for each of 4 consecutive wee ks. GVHD 
flare is defined as any increase in aGVHD symptoms (measured by [CONTACT_561812] B -D) 
beyond [ADDRESS_738176] begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initi al and  
Continued Therapy (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she would be considered to have failed treatment and would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L therapy upon 
receiving  the other second -line GVHD therapy. 
Route  of Administration  and Dose  
Remestemcel -L (ex-vivo cultured  adult human MSCs)  will be administered  intravenously at 
a dose of 2 x106 MSC /kg of actual body weight at screening. Remestemcel-L is stored and 
distributed  in cryogenic bags and cryogenic vials.  
Duration  of Treatment  
Enrolled subjects will receive Initial Therapy for 4 weeks; eligible subjects will receive  
Continued Therapy for an additional four weeks, beginning within one week after the end of Initial Therapy  period. Subjects may  receive Flare Therapy for an  additional four weeks 
if flare  criteria  is met.  
Duration  of Study  
Subjects  may  receive treatment f or up to  8 weeks  and will be followed out to 
100 ± [ADDRESS_738177]  is up to 111 days to account 
for the 4 -day screening window and End of Study visit ±[ADDRESS_738178]   
  
 
An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB- GVHD002), subsequent to the present 
study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. 
Statistical  Analysis 
 
Sample Size  
The primary  objective of this trial is to confirm  efficacy  of remestemcel -L in  improving 
Day [ADDRESS_738179] size of  
20%, which has been deemed clinically meaningful based on discussions with clinical 
experts on aGVHD, was used to calculate the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis was calculated using 45% OR, a rate that is 20-points lower than the anticipated 65% OR rate to remestemcel -L. This estimated 45% response rate is supported by [CONTACT_561813] [ADDRESS_738180]  
of significance level 5% for a single proportion and a difference in proportion of 20%. This is equivalent to  one-sided testing at 2.5% of the null hypothesis that  the Day [ADDRESS_738181],  45%, versus the alternative  hypothesis that the Day 28 OR rate is  65% or greater.  
The minimum sample size required to meet the primary objective with 80% power is [ADDRESS_738182] 48 subjects will be enrolled. In order to account for dropouts/missing data and to ensure that this study has sufficient power, an additional increased  enrollment of up to 10% of the minimum required enrollment (48) is  planned. 
 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis Populations 
As this is a single arm study, the evaluable population for efficacy will be considered the full analysis set (FAS) , which will include all subjects who provided informed consent, 
were screened and found eligible to enter the study. The modified full analy sis set (mFAS)  
is the same as the FAS, but only for patients treated with IMP in cryogenic vials. The  
primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS population. The  
per-protocol (PP)  population will  include all  subjects from  the FAS p opulation who  had no 
major protocol violations during the study. The primary and secondary efficacy analyses performed on the mFAS and PP populations will be considered supportive. The safety  
population will include all subjects who have signed the informed consent form and have 
received at least one dose of study drug. We may conduct sensitivity analyses comparing 
results from patients treated with product in vials to results for all patients for each of the  
analysis  populations. 
 
General  Statistical Considerations : 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Continuous 
variables  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics  (n, mean,  standard deviation [SD],  
median,  minimum,  and maximum). Two-sided  confidence intervals at the 95% level  will 
MSB -GVHD001  
Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738183]   
  
be presented for estimates of proportions. All statistical tests will be two -sided at the 
alpha<0.[ADDRESS_738184] to onset of aGVHD and from onset of aGVHD to initiation of study drug will be summarized.  Involvement of the skin, lower  gastrointestinal (GI)  tract,  and liver  will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_561814], two organs, or all three organs involved at baseline.  
 
Efficacy  Analyses  
OR at Day 28 as response to remestemcel -L treatment is the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Missing data for the primary endpoint will be considered as non-responders. Details on  
imputation will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to database lock.  A 
hypothesis test will be performed to assess whether the percentage of responders is statistically significantly differe nt from the control percentage of 45% used to calculate the 
null hypothesis. 
 
Survival will be assessed from initial remestemcel -L treatment to the last date of  
assessment. The association between Day [ADDRESS_738185], the  
associations will be tested using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratifying by  
[CONTACT_561815].  Day [ADDRESS_738186]. The odds ratio for survival 
at Day 100 given responder status at Day 28 will be presented and tested for statistical significance (whether statistically  significantly  greater  than 1). 
 
Additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated. The rate of VGPR will be described.  
The number and proportion of VGPR responders, non-responders, and missing values, at Day 28, Day 56, and at Day 100 will be summarized. The rates of OR and VGPR at Day  
28, Day 56, and at Day 100 will be reported by [CONTACT_49230], gut (lower GI), or liver involvement at baseline.  The rates of OR and VGPR will also be reported by [CONTACT_561816]- 
only and “Not skin-only” categories. The number and percentage of responders at each  
time point and for each endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_561817].  The 
number and percentage of survivors at Day [ADDRESS_738187]

Clinical  Study  Protocol  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738204] disease (GVHD) is a progressive and lethal complication of hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor leukocyte infusion. Two clinically distinct forms of GVHD have been described, consisting of acute GVHD, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] [ADDRESS_738205], 
1 and chronic GVHD, which is characterized by [CONTACT_532448] .2 However, this arbitrary  
temporal  distinction between the acute and chronic forms of GVHD has been largely discarded 
with the recognition of these  forms  as discrete pathophysiologic conditions definable by [CONTACT_561818].  3,4 
 
Occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation is fairly common, with  
Grades II to IV aGVHD reported in approximately 39% of cases involving sibling donors and 59% of cases  with  unrelated  donors .
5  Overall,  an estimated  20% to 80% of patients who  receive 
allogeneic HSCT  develop acute GVHD,  even  after  prophylaxis with immunosuppressive 
agents.  6 
 
While aGVHD is common among patients with allogeneic transplantation, overall, it is a rare  
disease, affecting about 10,000 individuals per year worldwide, with an estimated 2,000 cases found in children (Table 1). Approxim ately  5,500 of worldwide aGVHD cases  are refractory  to 
steroid, 
4 1,000-1,200 of which are pediatric  cases.

In aGvHD, alloreactive T cells present in the donor cell transplant recognize the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
tissues as foreign  and mount an  immunological attack,  causing  inflammation  and tissue  damage

environment that is conducive to GVHD. The tissue damage leads to the increased secretion of  
proinflammatory cytokines, which promote donor T cell proliferation and differentiation and 
interaction with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175616].  Alloreactive donor T cells traffic to target  
tissues (skin, gut, liver) and release soluble mediators that mediate cytotoxicity and end organ damage.  Other  donor immune  cells,  including natural  killer  cells,  neutrophils and  monocytes, are 
also activated and recruited to target organs and contribute to host tissue destruction. 
9 This  
adverse immune reaction increases over time as the expanding tissue damage mediated by  
[CONTACT_532450]. A vicious cycle ensues:  
amplification of cytokine expression supports further proliferation and activation of alloreactive immune  cells, which in turn leads to further tissue  damage. 
7 
 
Consequently, aGVHD potentially  involves multiple  organ systems,  with varying degrees  of 
clinical  severity.  
 
Acute GVHD onset primarily affects  the skin, the liver,  and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract,  
though the GVHD reaction targets a number of different host cells, including those of the skin epi[INVESTIGATOR_561798], hair follicles, intestinal crypts, liver bile ducts, bone marrow, and immune system. 
1,[ADDRESS_738208] commonly  affected  organ  after skin;  symptoms of liver involvement 
include jaundice and increased alkaline phosphatase levels that indicate damage to the bile canaliculi and portend cholestasis.  The GI tract is the third organ among the tissues most 
commonly affected in acute GVHD, frequently presenting as nausea, vomiting, intestinal bleeding, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and diarrhea. GI involvement is often the most severe of the organs affected and can be the most difficult to treat.  The large  volumes of watery  diarrhea  common to intestinal 
involvement in acute GVHD often transitions into bloody diarrhea that prompt the need for frequent transfusions.

combining these stages to  yield an overall grade ranging from I  to IV (Table 3) . 
 
Another grading system, which will be used in the present study, was devised by [CONTACT_561820] (IBMTR) and classifies aGVHD severity on a scale of A to D.  While a modified Glucksberg grading system is recommended in the most 
current published consensus statement for diagnosis and management of aGVHD,

GVHD. MSCs demonstrate immunosuppressive activity in T cell-driven immune responses in animal models of allogenic skin graft rejection and GVHD.

inhibiting allogeneic T cell response and aGVHD. 6,38 In co -culture systems, MSCs alter the  
cytokine secretion profile of immune cells (dendritic cells, naïve and effector T cells, natural  
killer cells), decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, TNFα) and  
increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL- 4, IL -10) [ADDRESS_738216] of adverse events (AEs) possibly or probably related to remestemcel-L use is found in the 
Investigators Brochure. All AEs were events commonly expected in the treated population, independent of the infusions of hMSCs. The most common AEs observed for remestemcel -L in 
clinical trials of pediatric GVHD were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  
thoracic and mediastinal disorders. 
 
Infusion reaction though, uncommon (≥1/1,000 to ≤1/100), has been reported in subjects treated with reme stemcel -L. An acute infusion reaction may include fever, chills, urticarial, hypotension, 
shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, hypoxia or other signs of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_36645].

recommended  that subjects  receive premedication  with hydrocortisone and diphenhydramine. 
Premedication  should occur  30-[ADDRESS_738218] monitoring and appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis is 
recommended.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With consideration of the low incidence of ectopic tissue formation from the safety data, the risk of high radiation exposure from  computed tomography (CT) scans,  the required administration  
of contrast agents, and the potential need for anesthetics in an ailing pediatric subject population, Investigators may choose to omit CT/MRI scans at their own discretion, provided the rationale for omission is  documented in  the source documents.  
 
In theory, cells grown and expanded outside the body have the potential to be contaminated, and infection could be introduced to the subject at the time of infusion. This risk is made negligible  
by [CONTACT_561821] a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant production facility, utilizing a closed system, and then by [CONTACT_561822] a processing facility immediately  
prior to administration.  The potential risks of introducing a donor- derived infectious agent are

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Hypothesis 
Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), the primary component of remestemcel-L, are non- hematopoietic cells isolated from adult bone marrow and expanded in culture. In vitro studies 
show that MSCs can  inhibit alloantigen - and  mitogen -stimulated  T cell  prolifera tion and promote 
an increase in the proportion of regulatory T cells, (T
reg), which play an important role in 
inhibiting  allogeneic T cell response in  aGVHD.  54,[ADDRESS_738227].  
 
3.3 Secondary  Objectives  
1. To determine  the correlation  between  response to remestemcel -L at Day  28 and survival 
at Day  100. 
2. To obtain quality of life data on remestemcel-L- treated su bjects via the Pediatric Quality  
of Life Inventory™ (PedsQL™; Appendix 1 and Appendix 2) and the pediatric global 
health -related  quality  of life  (HRQOL) Parent Proxy  Report (Appendix 3) . 
3. To measure the functional status of remestemcel -L-treated subjects using the 
Karnofsky/Lansky scale (Appendix 4) . 
 
  
 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738228] 48 pediatric  subjects,  
male and female, between the ages of 2 months and 17 years inclusive with aGVHD following 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  transplant (HSCT) that has failed  to respond to treatment  with  
systemic corticosteroid therapy. Subjects may have Grades C and D aGVHD involving the skin, liver and/or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or Grade B aGVHD involving the liver and/or GI tract, with or without concomitant skin disease. 
 
Subjects  will be treated with  intravenous (IV)  remestemcel -L at a dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg  actual  
body weight at screening, twice per week for each of 4 consecutive weeks. Eligible subjects will receive Continued Therapy, an additional 4 once weekly infusions of remestemcel- L at the same 
initial dose of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual body weight at screening. Eligible subjects may also  
receive GVHD flare therapy, which consists of an additional 4 twice-weekly infusions of remestemcel -L at the  same  initial dose  of 2 x 10
6 MSC/kg actual  body weight at  screening.  
 
4.1.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint will be overall response (OR), defined as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR; see Table 4 ), of the study population at [ADDRESS_738229] initiation of therapy 
(Day  0) with remestemcel -L. 
 
4.1.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints in this study will be  the following: 
1. Overall survival at Day  [ADDRESS_738230] initiation of remestemcel-L therapy  
2. Rate of very good partial response (VGPR) at Day [ADDRESS_738231] initiation of remestemcel-L therapy, stratified by 
[CONTACT_561827] 
8. Rate of aGVHD progression requiring additional GVHD medications/ therapy  through 
Day [ADDRESS_738232]   
  
Any changes  in baseline prophylaxis regimen  should be recorded  in the eCRF  and reason  for 
change in regimen should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Changes in dose or 
prophylactic agent due to administration route intolerance or toxicities are allowed at the  
discretion of the investigator with prior approval from the Medical Monitor as these changes could be confused as second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Continued Therapy  
Eligible subjects will receive an additional 4 once weekly infusions of remestemcel- L at the  
same initial dose of 2 x 106 MSC/kg actual  body weight at screening,  which will begin within  
one week  after the  Day  28 assessment  (Table 10) . Infusions will be given once weekly  
(± 2 days) and all [ADDRESS_738233] be administered within 28 days (±2 days). No additional treatment with remestemcel -L is allowed at any other point in time unless the criteria for GVHD 
flare,  as defined in this protocol, is met.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eligibility  for Continued Therapy  
Eligibility to receive additional therapy after the initial 4 -week treatment period is dependent 
upon the results of the subjects’ response assessments, as defined in Table 4 , at Day 28, as 
follows ( Table 10) : 
 
Complete response (CR): If a subject displays CR,  then no additional remestemcel -L will be 
administered.  
 
No Response (NR): If a subject displays NR, then no additional remestemcel-L infusion will be 
administered.  
 
Partial Response  (PR): If a subject  displays PR, the subject will receive Continued Therapy. 
 
Mixed  Response  (MR): If a subject  displays MR, the subjects  will receive Continued  Therapy. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] GVHD  Flare  
Subjects who have a GVHD flare of Grade B -D after achieving a CR (after Initial or Continued 
Therapy) and before Day 70 may receive additional remestemcel -L treatment per the Initial 
Therapy plan (Table 10 ). GVHD flare is defined as any increase in aGVHD symptoms  
(measured  by [CONTACT_561828] B- D) beyond [ADDRESS_738234]   
  
remestemcel -L the rapy upon receiving the other second- line GVHD therapy. Subjects are 
eligible  for a single treatment for  flare.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other GVHD  therapy  
If a subject begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initial and Continued 
Therapy  (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she  would be considered to have failed treatment  
and would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L thera py upon receiving the other 
second -line GVHD therapy. 
 
Changes in prophylaxis regimen (change in dose or prophylactic agent) due to administration route intolerance  or toxicities  are allowed  at the  discretion  of the investigator with  prior approval 
from  the Medical Monitor and are not considered  second -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
4.2 Study  Duration 
Enrolled subjects will receive Initial Therapy for 4 weeks; eligible subjects will receive therapy  
for an additional 4 (Continued Therapy) to 8 (Flare Therapy) weeks. Subjects will be assessed  
according to a schedule of planned assessments, as summarized i n Table [ADDRESS_738235] will be up to 111 days to account for the 4- day screening  window and end of study visit ±7 days. 
 
4.3 Extension Follow- up Study  of Safety  and Health  Outcomes

Investigator should show “due diligence” by [CONTACT_561831], e.g., dates of telephone calls or registered letters.  The end of participation 
for a subject lost to follow-up is the date of the last known contact (e.g., visit or telephone 
contact).  
 
5.4 Rescreening  of Screen -Failed  Subjects  
Screen -failed subjects may be re -screened once at the Investigator’s discretion.  If the  
rescreening  takes place within one week of  the screen  failure, only the tests the  subject has  failed  
at screening should be repe ated at the rescreening.  If the rescreening occurs one week or more 
after the initial screening,  all screening  tests should be repeated.  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738248] (IMP)  
Subjects  may  discontinue IMP under the following circumstances:  
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from  the study 
• Subject  is withdrawn  from  the study at the  Investigator’s discretion  
• Subject  completes  study requirements  
• Death.  
 
Every effort should be made to complete the ‘End of Study’ assessments for all subject 
withdrawals  / terminations.  
 
If the subject discontinues from the treatment protocol and has an ongoing adverse experience at the time of discontinuation, the subject must receive follow -up for at least 2 weeks to clarify the 
nature of the AE.  If clinical  visit(s)  are necessary,  the procedures  performed  during the follow-up 
visit(s) will be recorded on unscheduled visit pages of the CRF. If the AE has not resolved after a 2-week period, a plan for further follow- up of the subject will be created by [CONTACT_561832]. 
 
5.6 Information to be Collected  for Screen  Failures  
Subjects who are consented and are screened for eligibility into the trial, but do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for trial entry, will be considered screen failures. Subjects who provide consent but discontin ue the trial prior to  being given IMP will also  be considered  screen  
failures.  
 
The following information must be recorded on the respective case report forms (CRFs) for all screen  failures:  
• Demography 
• Inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Adverse events  
• End of screening  disposition. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738249]: 
• The date of  the last  scheduled  visit for  the last  subject  
• The date of  death of the last  subject  
• The date of withdrawal of the last subject.  
 
Individual subjects will be considered to have completed the study when they have completed all 
required protocol procedures and assessments. For subjects with ongoing AEs at the last scheduled visit, the end of study date will be deemed the last scheduled visit date.  The study site 
staff will perform the  appropriate closeout/last visit assessments.  
 
5.8 Planned Follow- up Study  of Safety  and Health  Outcomes  
An extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. Subjects may be presented with the IRB/EC approved consents for MSB- GVHD001 and MSB- 
GVHD002  simultaneously  at the  time of consent onto this protocol.

6.3 Handling  and Accountability  
Remestemcel -L will be provided to the study sites by [CONTACT_16015]. Only the 
Investigator(s) or their designee(s) will be permitted to administer the IMP to subjects  
participating  in this protocol. 
 
The IMP must  be received  by a person designated by [CONTACT_561833], handled 
and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location that is accessible only by [CONTACT_561834](s). Upon receipt, the designee must update the IMP accountability records, including records of IMP order, and maintain and store the records in a secure location. The  
CRA  will review  the records at the monitoring visits.  
 
Details  regarding the accountability  records are provided in the study Investigational Medicinal  
Product (IMP) M anual.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_738251]  
Partially used IMP will be discarded according to the study site’s destruction policy, and the discarding will be recorded  in the accountability  log. 
 
Local or institutional regulations may require immediate destruction of any unused IMP for 
safety reasons.  In these cases, it may be acceptable for the investigational site staff to destroy  
unused IMP before a monitoring inspection, provided that source document verification is 
performed  on the remaining  inventory and reconciled  against the documentation of the quantity 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738252] be obtained from the Sponsor prior to the return or 
destruction of the IMP. 
 
7. STUDY PROCEDURE  
Table 11 Schedule of Assessments and Procedures, lists all planned assessments, which are marked with an “X” when the visits are performed.  Subjects should be seen for all visits on the 
designated day or at a time that is as close as possible to the designated day. The study assessment schedule in Table 11 outlines all procedures to be performed on subjects at the scheduled  visits.  
 
In order to minimize variability in evaluations, ideally, the same individuals should perform the same tests on all the  subjects at a given  trial site.  
 
7.1 Visit  Schedule  and Assessments  
7.1.1 Screening  Period  
Subjects  will enter  the screening  period  once the written  informed  consent has  been  signed. 
The following assessments  and procedures will be performed  at the  screening  visit:  
• Written  informed  consent  and written  authorization  for use and disclosure of  personal  
health  information

with regard to baseline disease burden and will also provide baseline for evaluation of 
future possible ectopic tissue formation. For CT, use intravenous (IV) contrast; if IV is  
contraindicated for any reason, oral contrast is acceptable even in the presence of GI  
GVHD.  A previous CT scan or MRI may be used if performed up to [ADDRESS_738254] IMP infusion or 24 hours after IMP infusion. 
NOTE:  CT/MRI  scans  are optional and  Investigators may  choose to  omit CT/MRI  scans  
at their own discretion, provided the rationale for omission is documented in the source documents.

[IP_ADDRESS] Special  Guidance  for Investigators During  IMP  Infusion  
During IMP  administration,  infusion should be stopped if:  
1. The subject shows signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_561799], cyanosis, 
complains of shortness of breath, etc. regardless of  the oximetry  reading. 
2. SaO2/SAT  decre ases    
 
3. IMP
 infusion may be stopped at the discretion of the Investigator if there is an AE that  
the Investigator believes is related to the IMP, if there is an issue with IMP infusion, or the subject withdraws consent. 
 
If the toxicity evaluation during an infusion resulted in a worsening of a subject’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_561800] (per the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] assessment criteria, Table 14, Section 8.1.3) in comparison to the pre-infusion status, and the respi[INVESTIGATOR_561801], the Investigator must contact [CONTACT_561835] t he subject  will be  precluded from additional IMP infusions. 
 
No other medications  should be given during the investigational agent  infusion unless 
determined medically  necessary  by [CONTACT_737]. 
 
7.2 Efficacy  Assessments 
7.2.1 GVHD  Assessments 
GVHD assessments will  be performed  weekly, from Day  14 (±2 days) until Day 100 
(±7 days). During assessment weeks in the Initial Therapy period, the assessments must be performed after infusion of the 2
nd dose of remestemcel -L for that week (or after the 1st dose of 
remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). The  weekly  assessment  visits should be conducted 
at least [ADDRESS_738258]   
  
Rescue therapy  may be administered  if necessary.  If new  GVHD medication(s)  are administered  
as rescue therapy based on the assessment(s), no further remestemcel -L infusions will be  
allowed.  Subjects will otherwise remain in the study regardless of response and will continue to 
be evaluated per the assessment schedule.  
 
Progression of disease is defined as deterioration of GVHD by [CONTACT_561836]/baseline assessment up to Day [ADDRESS_738259] recent prior assessment from Day 28 to Day 100. Progression is not defined as ‘mixed response’ according  to the definitions described above in  Table  4. 
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_738260] be  
after the 2nd dose of remestemcel -L is administered for each assessment week of the Initial 
Therapy period (or after the 1st dose of remestemcel -L during Continued Therapy). A schedule 
of the planned assessments is detailed in  Table 11. 
 
Day 28 Therapy Assessment:  
A therapy  assessment  will be performed  on Day 28 (±2  days) to determine  treatment  response 
and whether a subject will be provided Continued Therapy. The Day [ADDRESS_738261] dose of remestemcel -L is administered.  Continued 
Therapy will be allowed for subjects according to their response to t reatment, as described in  
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Day 56 Assessment of  Response to Continued Therapy 
A therapy assessment will be performed on Day 56 (±2 days) for all subjects. The Day [ADDRESS_738262]  dose of remestemcel -L is administered  
for subjects receiving Continued Therapy, in order to determine treatment response to the Continued Therapy. 
 
Ongoing GVHD assessments will be performed  to assess the subjects’  eligibility  for flare  
treatment  in accordance with Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738263] 
instructions for determining  these parameters  are provided in the following sections. 
 
7.3.1 Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including but not limited to a targeted examination for evidence of AEs, will be performed at Screening, Day 0, and at each weekly visits from Day 14 (±2 days) until Day 100 (±7 days). 
 
Information about physical examinations must be available in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to the start of the study drug must be included in the relevant CRF on medical history/current medical conditions.  Significant new 
findings made after the start of the study drug that meet the definition of an AE or SAE must be recorded  on the Adverse Event CRF. 
 
7.3.2 Vital Signs  
Measurements  of vital signs (BP, HR,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], temperature,  and oxygen saturation) 
should be assessed at Screening, Day  0, and at each weekly  assessment  from Day  14 
(±2 days) through Day 100 (±7 days). Manual or automated procedures for obtaining BP are acceptable as long as the same method  and same arm are used throughout th e study. 
Measurements of vital signs will include sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2, pulse oximetry), temperature, and  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (RR).  
 
Vital signs will be measured after approximately [ADDRESS_738264]’s  treatment period.  
 
Measurement of height from a standing position should be performed with the subject’s shoes 
removed, the knees  straightened,  and head  held upright. For infants, height should be measured  
with the child lying down, and measurements should  be recorded  as recumbent length. 
 
Measurement of weight should be performed without shoes or extra layers of clothing (e.g., sweater  or jacket)  during the measurement. Subjects  should be weighed  on the same scales  at all 
visits.  
 
7.3.4 Electrocardiogram  (ECG) 
Electrocardiogram  (ECG) will be  performed  at screening  and at the  End of Study/Day 100 
(±7 days) to assess any changes in cardiac physiology. Subjects should be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662]- supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683]  5 minutes prior to  the recording. The same recording position (supi[INVESTIGATOR_337409] -supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and the same equipment  should be used for each  subject  throughout the study. 
 
All ECG  tracings must be  (1) reviewed by  a medically  qualified member  of the  study team,  
(2) annotated to indicate any clinical finding, and (3) signed and dated by [CONTACT_561837], and (4) filed with the notes for the subjects. ECG parameters will be entered into the CRF,  and if any ECG abnormality  is associated with an  AE, it must be entered in  the AE  CRF.  
 
Heart  rate, PR, QRS and  QT durations should also be  noted on the CRF  along with the  ECG  
parameters.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_738265]’s  vital signs and SaO2/SAT via pulse oximetry  from  investigational agent  
administration  through two hours after starting infusion. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_738266] will be performed by [CONTACT_561838] (≥10 years of age) at screening. At post-screening visits, a urine dipstick test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential (≥10 years of age) as per  
Table 10. A positive dipstick test would require a serum sample to be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. Pregnancy test  dipsticks will be provided to the sites before study 
initiation.  Details on pregnancy testing requirements  are located in  Appendix 6. 
 
7.3.8 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
A designated laboratory (or laboratories) will perform t he analyses of all specimens collected.  
Collection, shipment of samples, and reporting of results by [CONTACT_532458] (if needed) laboratory (or laboratories) will be detailed in the laboratory manual provided to the Investigators. Collection for local labs should be performed for all subjects at screening. If the  
age/weight of the subject permits, collection for central labs should also be performed at screening, in addition, in order to facilitate comparison of later samples sent to the central lab. If age/weight of the subject does not allow for this additional blood volume, then local labs at screening will serve as baseline labs.  The laboratory tests to be performed for subjects in this 
study are listed in  Table 12. 
 
If necessary, laboratory assessments may be performed by a laboratory other than the designated laboratory. In this case, normal ranges of test values for this laboratory should be provided to the Sponsor. 
 
The Investigator at each site is required to review all clinically relevant laboratory results  
requested in the protocol and to record those results in the CRF. The diagnosis associated with  
any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be recorded as an AE on the CRF. The  
reported  AE should indicate  the underlying abnormality  or diagnosis (e.g., renal  insufficiency) as  
opposed to the observed deviation in laboratory results (e.g., elevated creatinine) if in fact the underlying abnormality  or diagnosis is known. If there  is no apparent underlying abnormality  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738267]   
  
7.3.9 Assessment  of Ectopic Tissue Formation (optional per Investigator’s discretion)  
To detect any ectopic tissue formation, a radiologist and an Investigator at each study site will 
compare the CT/MRI scan , if collected at screening, with the CT/MRI scan performed at study 
end to determine if there is ectopic tissue formation.  The same method of radiologic scan should 
be used for both evaluations. If the formation of ectopic tissue is suspected, further eva luation  
may be indicated, which could include positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning and possibly biopsy. 
 
With consideration of the low incidence of ectopic tissue formation from the safety data, the risk of high radiation  exposure from  computed tomography (CT) scans,  the required  administration  
of contrast agents, and the potential need for anesthetics in an ailing pediatric subject population, Investigators may choose to omit CT/MRI scans at their own discretion, provided the rationale for  omission  is documented in  the source documents.  
 
7.4 Long- Term  Safety  and Efficacy  Follow- Up 
Long- term efficacy and safety assessments will be performed at Days 56 and 100.  At Day 56  
(±2 days), a GVHD and remestemcel -L therapy assessment will be performed to determine  
whether subjects show response to Continued and/or Flare  Therapy, when  applicable.  At 
Day 100 (±7 days), assessments of GVHD  grade  and survival will be determined.  
 
In addition, an extension study under a separate protocol (MSB-GVH002), subsequent to the 
present  study, is also planned in order to capture health outcomes and safety  data out to Day 180. 
 
7.5 Missing  or Delayed  Study Visits  
Every effort should be made to ensure compliance with prescribed study visits. Missing of study 
visits is generally not permitted.  However, in exceptional situations and with the Sponsor’s 
approval, visits may be postponed. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_738268]  Demographics  and Other Baseline  Characteristics  
Demographic data will include: 
• Gender  
• Age 
• Race and ethnicity  
• Smoking Status  (Never  Smoked, Current  Smoker, Previous Smoker) 
• Weight  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738269] of care (i.e., maintenance of  
steroid  treatment  and other  prophylactic treatment for  aGVHD).  In addition, investigators should 
provide standard of care for prevention and treatment of viral infections, particularly if there is 
evidence of viral reactivation.  In some cases, such as those involving adenoviral treatment or 
where no other approved treatment is available, patients may be treated with experimental agents  
at the Investigator’s discretion. However, if a subject begins other second-line therapy for GVHD (e.g., anti-TNF or anti- IL-6 agents) within the period of Initial and Continued Therapy 
(through Day 56, if  applicable),  he or  she would be considered  to have failed  treatment  and 
would be ineligible to receive any further remestemcel -L therapy upon receiving the other 
second -line GVHD therapy. 
 
7.9.[ADDRESS_738270] is  
able to be tapered following initiation of remestemcel- L (Day 0).  Subjects may also continue 
any prior therapy used for prophylaxis at a stable regimen from baseline.  No other GVHD  
medications are to be introduced to subjects during the initial [ADDRESS_738271] begins other second-line GVHD therapy within the period of Initial and Continued 
Therapy  (through Day 56, if applicable), he or she  would be considered to have failed treatment  
and would be ineligible  to receive any  further remestemcel -L therapy  upon receiving  the other 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738272]   
  
second -line GVHD therapy. However these subjects would remain on the study for safety 
follow up. 
 
Second line agents to treat GVHD will be coded using the World Health Organization dictionary 
(latest  available version) and presented  by [CONTACT_561839].  
 
7.9.3 Steroid  Taper  
If improvement in  GVHD (CR or  PR) is observed for a period of 3-[ADDRESS_738273] 10% of the dose per week but not to exceed 25% of the dose per 
week  is recommended  as described in Appendix 5, with  the goal of discontinuing steroid by 
10 weeks  after  initiating  taper.  
 
7.9.4 Escalating of Steroid Therapy  
Protocol guidelines for escalating  steroid therapy of aGVHD for  worsening disease include: 
1. Worsening of symptoms for at least  [ADDRESS_738274] would 
remain  on study for safety  follow up and would not receive any  further remestemcel -L treatment.  
 
7.9.5 Supportive  Care  
In addition to prescribed  investigational agent  plus corticosteroids and prophylactic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  
all subjects  may receive the following: 
• Transfusion support per institutional practice.  Type  of transfusion and the number of 
units will be  recorded in  the eCRF.  
• Anti-infective  prophylaxis directed  towards: CMV,  gram  positive (encapsulated)  bacteria,  
pneumocystis carinii  and fungal infections per institutional practice.

8. SAFETY  GUIDANCE  
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1 Adverse Eve nt 
An AE is defined by [CONTACT_532459] (ICH) guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice as  any untoward medical  occurrence in a subject  administered  a pharmaceutical  
product and which does not necessarily  have a causal relationship with  the treatment.  
 
An AE can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated  with the  use of a  medicinal product,  whether  
or not considered related  to the medicinal  product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation  of an  existing  disease (a worsening in the character,  
frequency,  or severity  of a known condition) 
• Recurrence of an  intermittent medical  condition (e.g., headache)  not present  at baseline 

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738276]   
  
• Any deterioration in  a laboratory value or other clinical  test (e.g., ECG, X- ray) that  is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment  or discontinuation from study drug. 
 
Adve rse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening procedures such as biopsies etc.) are to be 
reported. 
 
Recording of AEs will begin upon signing of the informed consent form (ICF). Pre -existing  
conditions that worsen  during a study are to be reported as AEs. 
 
8.1.2 Serious  Adverse Event  (SAE) (Immediately  Reportable to the Sponsor)  
An SAE  is any  AE that  meets any  of the following  criteria:  
• Fatal  (i.e., the AE  actually  causes or  leads  to death)  
• Life threatening  (i.e., the AE, in the view  of the Investigator, places  the subject at  
immediate  risk of death) 
o This does not include any AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was 
allowed  to continue, might have caused death. 
• Requires  or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s  ability  to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug 
• Significant medical  event in  the Investigator's judgment (e.g., may  jeopardize the subject  
or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above). 
 
8.1.3 Severity  
A clinical determination will be made of the severity of an AE.  The terms “severe” and  
“serious” are not synonymous. Severity is a description of the intensity of the manifestation of 
the AE and is distinct from seriousness, which implies a subject outcome. Severity will be  
assessed  according to the US  National Cancer  Institute  (NCI) Common  Terminology Criteria  for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale. 63 (Table 14)  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738277] has signed the informed  consent should be  recorded  on the 
appropriate CRF  page.  
 
Any SAE (as described in Section 8.1.2) occurring after a subject has signed the informed 
consent should be immediately reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. All subjects with an SAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported until the event  is resolved or has stabilized. 
 
Upon occurrence of an  SAE,  the Investigator must: 
• Immediately notify the Sponsor’s designee, Quintiles Lifecycle Safety (QLS). SAE 
reporting will originate  in the electronic data capture (EDC) system  and an email will be 
sent to individuals with designated responsibility for safety. Primary and secondary cause(s)  of death will be recorded on  the eCRFs  for SAEs that are fatal.  
• The paper  SAE form  is in place as  a back -up in the rare event that  EDC is  not access ible 
to the reporter of the  SAE:  
o If the EDC is not available, email the  SAE  form  to the QLS safety  mailbox: 
 
• Provide copy of all relevant  source documents, including medical  history, and  
concomitant medications, as appropriate. 
 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study product will be reported by [CONTACT_532460] a 15-day report to the Regulatory Authorities as applicable  and to all 
participating  investigators. 
 
SAEs that are considered unexpected, related to the study and are life threatening, or result in death will be reported by [CONTACT_561840] a 7- day report.  
 
Each  investigator must notify the IRB/EC responsible for reviewing  the study at their  site of all  
15-day or 7-day safety reports required by [CONTACT_168086]/EC requirements and shall provide the Sponsor or its designee with written  confirmation of said  IRB/EC notification.  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738278] 
A Quintiles  Medical  Advisor is  available for  24/[ADDRESS_738279] in  this study.  If the Quintiles  
Medical Advisor is not able to provide 24/7 services for a period longer than 2 hours (e.g. for 
international business travel) or during vacations, adequate medical back-up with documented training on the protocol and experience with the therapeutic area will be arranged and communicated.  The system of 24/7 coverage ensures that a qualified medical advisor is 
available for advice within a safe and reasonable time frame.  
 
The following additional numbers are also  available for 24/[ADDRESS_738280]:

9.[ADDRESS_738282] results will appear on laboratory reports that are submitted directly from the  
central  laboratory. Local laboratory  results  should be recorded  on the CRF, if  applicable.  
 
Any laboratory result that fulfills the criteria for an SAE should be reported as both an SAE and 
as an AE  in the CRF.  
 
Any treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result that is clinically significant should be 
recorded as a single diagnosis in the CRF. A treatment -emergent abnormal laboratory result is 
considered  to be clinically  significant if  it meets  one or more  of the following conditions: 
• Is accompanied  by [CONTACT_12394]. 
• Requires change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation 
of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment).  

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738283]   
  
These conditions will apply to any protocol- and non-protocol- specified safety and efficacy  
laboratory re sults from tests performed after ICF signature [CONTACT_561868].  These conditions will not apply to any 
abnormal laboratory results that are outside the laboratory reference range, yet does not meet the 
criteria for clinical significance; these latter results will be analyzed and reported as laboratory  
abnormalities.  
 
In the event  of clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  test values,  the tests should be repeated  
and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or the abnormality is adequately explained or accounted for. If an acceptable explanation is established, it should be recorded  on the CRF. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_738284] experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, IECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
 
To determine reporting requirements for single AE cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness  of these events using the following reference documents: 
• IMP IB 
• IMP Development  Core  Safety  Information (DCSI) Document, if applicable.  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported  for the  study with the  severity  and frequency reported in the applicable reference 
document. 
 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness,  with allowance  for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738285].  All enrolled subjects  
will be treated with remestemcel -L. 
 
10.1.1 Sample  Size and Power 
The primary  objective of this trial is to confirm efficacy  of remestemcel -L in improving Day 28 
OR rate within the  full analysis set (FAS)  population. [ADDRESS_738286] size of 20%, which has been deemed clinically meaningful 
based  on di scussions with  clinical  experts on aGVHD, was  used  to calculate the null hypothesis. 
The null hypothesis was calculated using 45% OR, a rate that is 20-points lower than the anticipated 65% OR rate to remestemcel -L. This estimated 45% response rate as the null 
hypothesis is further supported by [CONTACT_561841] [ADDRESS_738287] population treated only with steroids was conservatively anticipated to be 65%,  
 Hence, p=0.65 was chosen as the alternative 
hypothesis. 
 
Accordingly, the null and alternative hypotheses are as follows: 
H0: p = 0.45 vs. H a: p ≠ 0.[ADDRESS_738288]   
  
10.2 Statistical  Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  will be prepared  prior to Database Lock  (DBL)  containing 
details of the statistical analyses and data -handling rules planned for this trial. Post- DBL  
changes to the SAP will be documented in the Clinical Study Report. An overview of main 
methods is given below. 
 
10.2.1 General  Statistical  Considerations: 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  Continuous 
variables  will be summarized  using descriptive statistics  (n, mean,  standard deviation [SD],  
median, minimum, and maximum).  Confidence intervals, if presented, will have a 95% 
confidence level.  
 
The baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non -missing observation taken prior to or 
on the first dose date of study treatment. By [CONTACT_561842], post- baseline is defined  
as data collected after first infusion (complete or partial) of study treatment.  Data collected at  
unscheduled time points will not be summarized at the unscheduled time points, but will be considered as for  baseline.  
 
The first dose date will be considered  the ‘Study Day 0’. The study day, the actual day  relative to  
start of treatment, will be  calculated  from  Study Day 0. 
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS population. Analyses of the mFAS and PP populations will be used to assess sensitivity  and thus will be considered  supportive. 
 
All statistical tests will be two -sided at the alpha=0.05 level of signif icance.  Confidence 
Intervals will be two sided  at the  95% level.  
 
10.3 Analysis Populations  
10.3.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
This is a single -arm study with no randomization after screening. All subjects who provided 
informed consent, were screened and found eligible to enter the study will belong to the FAS population. The FAS will be used for the primary  efficacy  analysis.  Secondary  efficacy  analyses  
will also be performed on the FAS population. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738289]   
  
10.3.2 Modified  Full Analysis  Set (mFAS) 
The mFAS  is all subjects  who  provided informed  consent, were  screened  and found eligible  to 
enter the study, however, were treated with IMP stored in cryogenic vials. Primary and  
secondary  efficacy  analyses  will also be  performed on the mFAS population. 
 
10.3.[ADDRESS_738290] one dose of study 
treatment  (complete or partial).  
 
10.3.4 Per-Protocol (PP)  Population 
The per -protocol (PP) population will include all subjects who had no major protocol violations 
during the study. In general, not meeting inclusion criteria or meeting any exclusion criteria would be assessed  as major protocol violations. 
 
The primary effi cacy analysis will be repeated as a sensitivity analysis on the mFAS and PP  
populations. The key secondary efficacy analyses will be repeated for the mFAS and PP populations for Overall Survival at Day [ADDRESS_738291] characteristics will be summarized.  Descriptive  
statistics [e.g., n umber of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum]  will be calculated for  continuous variables [e.g. age and  weight] and frequency  
counts will be tabulated for categorical demographic variables [e.g. gender, ethnicity, race, underlying malignancy or leukemic disease at transplant, donor type, donor compatibility, HSCT source, grade of aGVHD at onset, grade of aGVHD at baseline].  Time from HSCT to onset of  
aGVHD  and onset of aGVHD to  initiation  of study drug will be summarized.  Involvement of 
the skin, lower  gastrointestinal (GI)  tract,  and liver will be summarized  by [CONTACT_561843], two organs, or all three organs involved at baseline.

11. DATA COLLECTION,  MANAGEMENT  AND  QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The overall  procedures for quality  assurance of clinical  study data are described  in the Sponsor’s 
(or designee’s) Standard  Operational Procedures (SOPs).  
 
Data for this study will be  recorded  using the Medidata Rave System and  eCRF.  
 
The site is expected  to respond to  all SAE  queries within  [ADDRESS_738310] up- to-date version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) [ADDRESS_738311] (DSMB)  
A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be set up for the trial to oversee the management of the trial, review the overall safety data, and propose appropriate actions if necessary.  The independent DSMB will consist of physicians with expertise in oncology, stem 
cell transplantation, and conduct of clinical trials and an independent biostatisti cian.  The 
composition of the DSMB and its specific working procedures will be described in a separate charter.  This charter  will clearly  specify  attendees,  rules  and responsibilities,  procedures, review  
meeting  schedule and the data to be analyzed.  
 
The DSMB will follow the  DSMB  charter  and data analyses  will be  done according  to the 
DSMB  charter.  
 
In addition to the regular monitoring of safety, one interim analysis is planned for this study as described in Section 10.1.3. The DSMB will review the data for futility and may make a  
recommendation  on whether  to stop the trial for futility,  as a result  of this  interim analysis.

An extension study (MSB-GVHD002), subsequent to the present study, under a separate 
protocol is being conducted in order to capture health outcomes and safety data out to Day 180. Subjects may be presented with the IRB/EC approved consents for MSB- GVHD001 and MSB- 
GVHD002  simultaneously  at the  time of consent onto this protocol. 
 
13. LAWS,  REGULATIONS,  AND ETHICS  
13.1 Local Regulations/Declaration of Helsinki  
This clinical study shall be conducted in full compliance with current material and relevant laws and regulations and the Investigator will use best efforts to ensure such compliance. This clinical study will also be conducted in compliance with principles outlined in the “Guideline for Good Clinical Practices” ICH tripartite Guideline 
70 and with the ethical principles of the “Declaration  
of Helsinki”  [ADDRESS_738313]’s participation in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. For subjects who are not qualified to or are incapable of giving legal consent, written consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative. In cases where both the subject and his/her legal representative are unable to read, an impa rtial 
witness must be present during the entire Informed Consent discussion. After the subject and  
representative have orally consented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature [CONTACT_561869]. The Investigator or designee must also explain that subjects are free to refuse to enter or  withdraw from  the study at  any time and for any  reason, that a copy of the consent 
would be provided to the subject, and that the process by [CONTACT_561855]. The CRFs for this study would contain a section for documenting subject informed consent, which must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant changes in the benefit/risk assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All subjects, including those already being treated, should be informed of the new information, provided with a copy of the revised form, and give their consent to 
continue in the study in accordance with the  IRB/EC requirements.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_738314]/  Ethics  Committees (IRB/EC) 
This protocol and any modifications as well as appropriate consent procedures, any 
accompanying material provided to the subject, such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent, and advertisements or compensation given to the subject, will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_561856]/ECs.  
 
Before initiation of the trial at each investigational site, approval from the appropriate IRB/EC  
must be obtained. Written approval must be obtained before a trial site is initiated or the  
investigational product is released to the Investigator. 
 
Any extensions or renewals  of IRB/EC approval must be obtained during the course of the study. 
If required, approvals must also be obtained for any changes to the protocol, the Informed Consent form, the written information provided to  subjects, and/or other procedures. 
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738315] of the 
study will be reported promptly to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_11219]/or the Sponsor, in accordance with applicable local requirements.  Written summaries of the study status will be  
submitted  to the IRB/EC annually, or more  frequently if required  by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB.  On completion  
of the study, the IRB/EC will be notified that the study has ended. 
 
13.4 Protocol Adherence  
Investigators will ensure that due diligence is applied in order to avoid protocol deviations or violations as defined  below. All significant protocol deviations and  violations  will be reported  to 
the IRB/EC in accordance with IRB/EC requirements.  All sign ificant protocol deviations and 
violations will be  recorded and reported in the CSR.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_738316] be submitted to the appropriate IRB/EC for information and 
approval  in accordance with local  requirements,  and to regulatory  agencies  if required. Approval  
must be obtained before any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to  
eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to trial subjects,  or when  the change(s)  involves only logistical or 
administrative  aspects  of the trial (e.g. change in monitor[s],  chang e of telephone number[s]).  
 
15. CONDITIONS  FOR  TERMINATING  THE  STUDY 
Mesoblast reserves the right to terminate the study at any time under the conditions specified in the Clinical Trial  Agreement. In the event  the trial is terminated  before  the planned  completion

MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738317] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
16.1 Investigator's Files  / Retention  of Documents  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into two different separate categories, consisting o f: 1) An Investigator's Study File 
and 2) subject clinical source documents. 
 
The Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments and schedule of assessments, IRB/EC and  governmental approval with  correspondence,  sample  Informed  Consent, drug 
records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization forms, and other appropriate documents/correspondence. In addition, at the end of the study the Investigator will receive the subject data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data, query resolution correspondence, and reasons for changes, in a readable format on CD that must be kept with the  Investigator’s Study File. 
 
Subject clinical source documents may include subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, special assessment reports, signed informed consent forms, and consultant letters. The Investigator must keep the Investigator’s Study File and subject clinical source documents (including the archival CD) on file for at least [ADDRESS_738318] be made between  
the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these documents in a sealed container(s) outside of the site in order to ensure that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in the event of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for continued care of subjects, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_561802].  
 
16.[ADDRESS_738319], any required background data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important in cases where errors in  
data transcription are suspected.  In cases of special problems and/or governmental queries or 
requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary for the Sponsor to have direct access to the complete  study records,  provided that subject confidentiality  is protected.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_738320] be made available by [CONTACT_561857]’s (or designee's) Quality  Assurance  Unit or its  designees  or 
to health authority inspectors, upon appropriate notification. Verification of the CRF data must  
be by [CONTACT_85349]. 
 
16.4 Electronic Case  Report  Forms  
Data for this study will be captured via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system by [CONTACT_561858].  The data will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_561859]. An audit trail will maintain  a record of  initial entries and  changes  made,  
reasons  for change, time and  date of  entry, and user name [CONTACT_561870].  
 
An eCRF must be completed for each enrolled subject.  For each screen -failed subject, the 
reason for screen failure will be collected in the Completion eCRF along with the corresponding screen failure reason.  The entire subject casebook of data must be reviewed and electronically  
signed by [CONTACT_561860]. This also applies to  
records for those enrolled subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws early  
from  the study, the reason  must be noted at  the end of the study eCRF.  If a subject is  withdrawn  
MSB -GVHD001  Version  7.[ADDRESS_738321]   
  
from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, attempts should be made to clearly document 
the outcome. 
 
The Investigator  should ensure the accuracy,  completeness, and  timeliness  of the data reported to 
the Sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required  repo rts. 
 
17. MONITORING  OF STUDY  
The Sponsor’s responsible monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_561861], upon request, to inspect the trial records, including CRFs and other pertinent data, provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
 
It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the C RFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to ensure protocol adherence and that the data entered on the CRFs are complete, consistent, and accurate.  The monitor must verify that the subject received the study drug. The  
monitor will also have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records as applicable needed  to verify  entries  on the CRFs.  The Investigator (or deputy) must agree to cooperate with  
the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
 
18. CONFIDENTIALITY OF TRIAL  DOCUMENTS  AND SUBJECT  RECORDS  
The Investigator must ensure that subject anonymity is maintained and that subject identity is protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor, subjects should be referenced by [CONTACT_532472]. The  
Investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, names, and addresses.  The 
Investigator should maintain  documents that will not  be submitted  to the Sponsor (e.g., subjects’  
written  consent forms) in  strict confidence.

Appendix  6: Childbearing  Potential, Pregnancy Testing,  and Contraception  
All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a 
serum pregnancy test at Screening. Post-screening, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at Day 56, Day 100, and at any unscheduled visits under protocol MSB- GVHD001.  On protocol 
MSB -GVHD002, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at End of Study/Day [ADDRESS_738331] (conducted by [CONTACT_401351]). 
1 
 
All female  patients  are considered to  be of  childbearing potential unless they  meet  one of the 
following criteria:  
• The patient  has been  post-menopausal (amenorrheic)  for at least 1 year 
• The patient  had a surgical bilateral  oophorectomy (with  or without hysterectomy) more  
than 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
• The patient  had a hysterectomy. 
 
Female  patients  of reproductive or childbearing potential who  are unwilling  to use a 
highly effective method of contraception for the duration of the study will be excluded  from  
study participation.  2 
 
Examples  of highly effective contraception include the following: 
• Abstinence  
• Contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_561803]  
• Single barrier  plus spermicide 
• Intrauterine device  
• Implants  for contraception  
• Injections for contraception  (with  prolonged release)  
• Hormonal vaginal device  
• Sterilization,  surgical  tubal ligation  
• Sole sexual  partner  consisting of surgically  sterilized  male  partner  with appropriate post- 
surgical  verification  of the absence of  spermatozoa in  the ejaculate.  
Patients may provide verbal confirmation that the partner completed appropriate follow-up after vasectomy.  Sites  are not required to obtain partner medical  records.

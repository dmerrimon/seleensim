2. INTRODUCTION  
The Brevera Breast Biopsy System integrates tissue acquisition, real time imaging, and post biopsy 
handling all during the same procedure.  This device has receive d FDA 510k Clearance  (K163052) . All 
commercial breast biopsy device s will be utilized according to the product’s Instructions for Use.  
2.1 Summary of Animal Testing Data  
In July 2016, Hologic conducted an animal study titled, “ GLP Acute Evaluation of the Brevera Vacuum -
Assisted Breast Biopsy System in the Porcine Model .” 
 
The objective of th at study was to support, using attribute data, t hat the Gen 2 system adequately 
performs the following functions using tissue in an animal model:  
1. Acquire core tissue samples from the biopsy site.  
2. Transport tissue samples into the filte r wheel.  
3. Capture X -ray images of transported tissue cores in the tissue filter.  
 
The results of th e above referenced study demonstrate d that the device perform ed to the intended  
specifications and passed validation  for procedures in humans.  
2.[ADDRESS_40332] with tissues and/or body fluids.  
 
The Brevera biopsy needle is single -use and is disposabl e. The user connects the biopsy needle to a 
reusable device driver and connects the biopsy device components to the console. The biopsy needle 
primarily consists of a hollow needle with a side aperture and a sharpened inner cannula that, when 
connected to the Brevera breast biopsy system, rotates and extends across the aperture to acquire 
targeted tissue. The Brevera device driver contains mechanical and electrical components  that drive 
needle rotation and advancement. During the biopsy process, vacuum crea ted inside the biopsy device 
pulls  tissue into the aperture. The cannula translates and rotates to cut the tissue. The tissue  sample is 
then aspi[INVESTIGATOR_38466] a tubing line to a tissue filter. Saline is supplied through  the biopsy device to 
lavage the cavi ty and deliver tissue to the tissue filter.  
Hologic – Brevera Protocol #16-05B - Version 2.[ADDRESS_40333] and allows for 
deployment of a biopsy site marker. The introducer is used to control the variable aperture function of 
the device.  The introducer also prohibits the user from administering medication through the Y -site in 
the tubing while the device is in the armed (pre -fire) position. The Brevera breast biopsy system with 
CorLumina imaging technology acquires and displays the radiog raphic images of core specimens 
contained in the tissue filter. A tissue filter, specifically designed for use with the Brevera breast biopsy 
system, is provided with the biopsy needle.  
 
The Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging technology a lso has the capability to display 
images as well as to transfer these images to external devices. The images acquired with this system are 
intended to confirm removal of tissue from a suspected lesion or pathology. The system is not intended 
for diagnostic  purposes.  
 
Radiology technologists, surgical personnel, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists can use the 
specimen radiography equipment in the Brevera breast biopsy system with CorLumina imaging 
technology.

commercial Brevera system .  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_38467] , and use of the devices . 
2.4 Intended Use/Current Indication for Use  
See product specific I nstructions for Use . 
2.5 Device Procedure(s)/ Training  
Prior to use in clinical procedures  and the implementation in the standard practice , technologists and 
clinicians  will be trained by a Hologic  representative on the use of the new Brevera device  (according to 
Instructions for Use)  and the features . This training will cover quality control  procedures as well as  
didactic training on the equipment . The investigators selected for this trial have previous experience  
with breast biopsy core sampling.  
3. TRIAL JUSTIFICATION  
This trial will be performed to o btain clinical/ operational data and  feedback on the Brevera Breast 
Biopsy System  as compared to the  current standard -of-care  breast biopsy procedures  
4. POTENTIAL RISK/BENEFIT  
4.[ADDRESS_40335](s)  
Common r isks associated with the use of  any commercial  biopsy system  are limited to the re gion 
surrounding the biopsy site and  include : 
 
 Bruising and swelling of the breast  
 Infection  or bleeding at the biopsy site  
 Altered breast appearance, depending on how much tissue is re moved and how your breast 
heals  
Hologic – Brevera Protocol #16-05B - Version 2.0  Page 9 of 25 Clinical Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL   23 JUN 2017  Excessive pain following the procedure at the biopsy site  
 
All of the incidents listed above are related to  biopsy procedure s and not necessarily the devices 
themselves.  
4.3 Risk Benefit Rationale  
This clinical trial is justified because Hologic  and clinical investigators believe the potential ben efits 
outweigh the potential risks of trial participation.  There are no additional risks known for the 
commercially available device s. 
5. TRIAL DESIGN  
5.1 Trial Objective (s) 
The objective of this trial is to obtain clinical/ operational data and feedback on the Brevera Breast 
Biopsy System  relative to  current standard -of-care breast biopsy  systems ; and to evaluate potential 
clinical advantages conferred by [CONTACT_38483], such as reduced 
procedure time . 
5.[ADDRESS_40336] -of-care  biopsy system  at each clinical site .  
5.3 Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Secondary endpoints to be evaluated in this trial include differences in post -biopsy complication rates, 
total tissue acquisition by [CONTACT_38484], total tissue used by [CONTACT_38485], and the number of discordant biopsies.  
5.[ADDRESS_40337] imagin g exams  (both screening and diagnostic work up) leading up to the breast biopsy 
procedure , which  may include mammograms, ultrasound or MRI images as applicable . 
The trial procedure will roll out in two phases : 1) a run -in phase consisting of five (5) procedures aimed 
at familiarizing participating radiologists with the Brevera Breast Biopsy System ; and 2) an analysis 
phase consisting of a block -randomized acquisition of twenty  (20) sequential acquisitions utilizing both 
standard -of-care biopsy system at each  site and the Brevera Breast Biopsy System.  
5.4.1 Phase 1  (Run -in Phase)   
After obtaining subject in formed consent, each radiologist participating in the study will initially use the 
Brevera Breast Biopsy system for enrollment of his or her  first five (5) cases. The run -phase will allow 
Hologic – Brevera Protocol #16-05B - Version 2.0  Page 10 of 25 Clinical Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL   23 JUN 2017 each participating radiologists to become familiar with the use of a  new device .  The five (5)  cases per 
radiologist completed will be compared  to the Brevera cases completed in Phase [ADDRESS_40338] Biopsy System.  
 
Once a clinician has completed his or her initial five (5) run -in cases , they may begin phase [ADDRESS_40339] complete the ir initial five (5) 
cases prior  to beginning Phase 2; however , each individual participant may complete the initial five (5) 
cases at different times. Example: it may be expected  that the first  participating radiologist at a  given  
site may begin in  phase 2 while the second and/or third  participating radiologist at the same site in the 
study are still completing their five run -in cases .   
 
5.4.2 Phase 2 (Block Stratification Phase) –  
Each individual radiologist will enroll a maximum of twenty ( 20) subjects , and a  maximum of three ( 3) 
radiologi sts may   participate in this study from each  representative study site.  After a radiologist 
completes his or her five ( 5) cases with Brevera  in Phase (1) , each site will be gin to sequentially enroll 
subjects based on a block -stratified randomiz ation.  Subjects  will either be  enroll ed to have their biopsy 
procedure performed using  current standard -of-care  breast biopsy procedures at the site or Brevera 
Breast Biopsy procedures  based on the block diagram given in Figure .  
 
Randomization of enrollment will  be determined prior to study start -up and provided to each site.   Each 
radiologist will enroll 20 total subjects as part of the block stratification phase  as defined in Figure 2 . 
 
Figure 2 : Study Design Outline  
 
 
Case Report Forms related to procedural d ata and surveys have been created in order to obtain 
inform ation related to feedback from the clinician (s), patient , and technologist(s) .  The surveys include 
questions that relate to the overall feel and aesthetic of the product as well at the overall per formance 
of the  breast  biopsy system . The questionnaires will be given to the clinician (s), patient , and the 
technologist (s) at the conclusion of the procedure and will be focused for each target group. Once a 
patient has completed the breast biopsy  procedure,  her direct participat ion in the trial is concluded. 
There are no follow -up visits required for participation in this trial. .

6.1 Safety /Device  Assessment  
6.1.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward m edical occurrence , unintended disease or injury or any 
untoward clinical signs (including an abnormal laboratory finding) in subjects, users or other persons 
whether or not related to the trial medical device. Each AE is considered either  anticipated or 
unanticipated as described below.  The site is required to report all  device and procedur e related AEs 
that occur in the trial following treatment  to the study sponsor , Hologic, Inc.  See Figure 3 below for the 
AE reporting flowchart.

The time -period for the a ssessment of the occurrence of an AE will  begin at the time of consent until the 
subject has been discha rged and will  be based on changes in the subject’s physical examination, 
laboratory results and/or signs and symptoms.  AEs are to be monitored  until they are resolved or 
clearly determined to be a stable or chronic condition or due to an undercurrent illness.  Medical care 
will be provided, as defined in the informed consent, for any AE related to trial participation.  
 
There are two types of AEs: anticipated or unanticipated.  Subjects who experience any untoward after -
effects are instructed to contact [CONTACT_38486]. The Investigator must 
determine both the intensity of the AE and the event’s relationsh ip to the breast biopsy system . 
 
AE Severity Classification :  Severity will be defined according to the following criteria:  
 Mild  - Awareness of event, but easily tolerated  
 Moderate  - Discomfort enough to cause some interference with activities of daily liv ing (ADL)  
 Severe  - Incapacitating, with an inability to perform activities of daily living (ADL)  
 
Life threatening events, events where the subject was at risk of death, are serious AEs and must be 
reported in accordance with the procedures and timelines in this protocol.  Did subject 
experience an 
AE? No No reporting 
required  
Yes 
Was the AE 
related to the 
procedure or 
device?  No No reporting

Hologic – Brevera Protocol #16-05B - Version 2.0  Page 15 of 25 Clinical Protocol  
CONFIDENTIAL   23 JUN 2017 AE Relationship Classification :  Relationship to trial product use will be determined as follows:  
 Not Related - relationship to the device  or procedures can be excluded when:   
o The event  is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures  
o The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures   
o The serious event does not follow a known response pattern to  the medical device ( if 
the response pattern is p reviously known) and is biologically implausible  
o The discontinuation of the medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible - and reintroduction of its use (or increase 
of the level of activation/ex posure), does not impact the serious event  
o the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by [CONTACT_10398]   
o the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent 
illness/ clinical condition , an effect or another device, drug, treatment or other risk 
factors)  
o the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_38487]  
o harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error  
o in order to establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met 
at the same time, depending on the type of device/ procedures and the serious event.   
 Unlikely  - The relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained . 
 Possible  - The relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled out 
completely. Alternative causes are also possible ( e.g. an underlying or concurrent ill ness/ clinical 
condition/ or and an effect of another device, drug or treatment), Cases where relatedness 
cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
 Probable  - the relationship with the use of the trial device seems relevant and/or the event 
cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained  
 Causal Relationship - the serious event is associated with the device or with the procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when:  
o The event is a known side effect of the product  category the device belongs to or of 
similar devices and procedures  
o The event has a temporal relationship with the device application/use or procedures  
o the event involves a body -site or organ that:  
  the device or procedures are applied to  
 the device or procedures have an effect on  
 the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response 
pattern is previously known)  
 the discontinuation of the medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation /exposure) , impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible)

Hologic – Brevera Protocol #16-05B - Version 2.[ADDRESS_40347]  (UADE) is a serious adverse dev ice effect, which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified,  in the current version of the risk analysis report.  
6.2 Reporting Procedures  
6.2.1 Investigator Reporting  
The Investigator at each participating center is ultimately responsible for reporting  applicable AE s to 
Hologic . The information to be reported on the AE CRF and  should include the  start date of the AE , 
treatment, resolution, and assessment of both the seriousness and the relationship to the de vice and 
should be captured on the AE CRF . The Investigator should  report all AE s to the IRB, as  required . 
 
If there is a device malfunction or other observation  (deficiency) , the Investigator  should  notify Hologic  
immediately  via the normal complaint procedure for commercially available devices , indicate if the 
observation resulted in an AE, and indicate if complications are related to the device, procedure or 
underlying disease.    
 
In the event of a suspected observation or d evice problem,  a field technician will be dispatched to the 
site to resolve the problem. If the field engineer cannot resolve the problem , the device may  be 
returne d to Hologic /Plexus  for analysis.

of the current trial (e.g., Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations and Warning Letters).  Hologic  may 
provide needed assistance in responding to regulatory audits.  
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
7 clinical trial  sites each with 3 radiologists performing 20 biopsies ([ADDRESS_40349] Biopsy System, as per randomization procedure) results in a total of 420 
subjects enrolled in phase 2. This sample s ize achieves approximately 80% power to detect a difference 
in mean procedure time of [ADDRESS_40350] significance level of alpha=0.05. Mixed effects regression will be utilized to assess the impact 
of the biopsy device (e.g., Brevera or local standard -of-care) on total procedure time, post -biopsy 
complication rates and differences in discordant  biopsies. For these analyses, biopsy device type, subject 
physical habitus and lesion location (i.e., “near the chest wall or axilla?” yes/no) will be considered fixed 
effects, and site and radiologist will be considered random effects. Total tissue acqui sition by [CONTACT_38489], total acquired sample mass, and total tissue utilized by [CONTACT_38490] -of-care using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) testing. 
Lastly, sub -analyses will be perf ormed to look at specific comparisons between the Brevera system and 
other biopsy systems if multiple sites utilize the same biopsy system as their standard -of-care device.

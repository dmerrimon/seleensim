Study Number:  INN-CB-022 
Methodology/Study Design:  This is a multicenter randomized, single -blind, controlled s tudy.  Prior to 
surgery on Day 1, [ADDRESS_947101] prior to 
surgery in a 2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740] -matrix implants 
(total bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697742] 300 m g) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]  175 mg ) infiltration.  Subjects 
will then undergo open hernioplasty according to standard procedure.  If the surgeon encounters a significant surgical complication or other clinically significant medical condition duri ng surgery, the test 
article may not be administered at the investigator’s discretion, and the subject will be considered 
randomized but not enrolled or treated.  
Following surgery, subjects will be transferred to a post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) and/or o ther 
postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive parenteral morphine as needed 
(rescue medication for breakthrough pain).  Once subjects can tolerate oral medication, they will be 
started on a standardized oral analgesic regimen of acetaminophen 650 mg 3 times daily for as long as 
clinically required  and will be prescribed immediate- release morphine (15 mg) to manage breakthrough 
pain only when it occur s.  Subjects will remain in the PACU until they are stable and can be discharged to  
the clinic.   
Subjects will remain housed in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been collected for pharmacokinetic ( PK) analysis on Day 4.  Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be 
instructed to return to the clin ic to complete the 96 hour PK blood draw on Day 5.  Follow -up safety 
assessments will include clinic visit s on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from subjects before surgery and at predetermined time 
points up to 96 hours after administration of study drug. Safety assessments will include frequent 
assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 
24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and adverse events (AEs) reporting  with particular emphasis on the 
signs and symptoms of CNS and cardiovascular bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697743] 5.12.6.  The 
surgical wound will be assessed frequently for adverse events associated wi th altered or delayed wound 
healing .  
Number of Subjects Planned :  48 subjects  
INL-001 Implant :  Lyophilized bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740] -matrix implant (approximately 5 × 5  cm).

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Postsurgical Pain  
Posts urgical pain is a form of acute pain from surgical trauma that causes an inflammatory 
reaction and initiation of an afferent neuronal barrage  (Gupta et al., 2010) . Pain after surgery is a 
combined constellation of unpleasant sensory, emotional and mental e xperiences precipi[INVESTIGATOR_697756], endocrine -metabolic, physiological and 
behavioral responses  (Gupta et al., 2010) .  Tissue trauma stimulates hypersensitivity of the 
central nervous system, resulting in pain within the immediate surgical field and in other areas 
directly affected by [CONTACT_84764] (eg, the incision site).  
Evidence suggests that surgery suppresses the immune system and that this suppression is 
proportionate to the invasiveness of the surge ry (Ramsey, 2000 ). Effective postsurgical analgesia 
can reduce this deleterious effect and is an essential component in the care of the surgical patient. 
Inadequate pain control, apart from being inhumane, can result in increased patient morbidity or 
morta lity (Gupta et al., 2010) .    
Optimal management of postsurgical pain requires an understanding of the pathophysiology of 
pain, the methods available to reduce pain, the invasiveness of the surgical procedure, and 
inherent patient factors, such as anxiety and depression, which are often associated with increased pain  (Lovich -Sapola et al., 2015) . Postsurgical pain management must be an integral 
part of perioperative care and should be based on sound physiologic and pharmacologic principles  (Jain and Datta, 1997) .  
From 1992 to 2012, the total number of surgeries at community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5535] 
(US) increased by 17 percent to about 26.8 million surgeries  (Surgeries in Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -Owned 
Outpatient Facilities, 2012 ),
 and approximately 1 million hernia repair surgeries are performed 
each year in the US  (Co-Factor analysis, 2016) . Although significant improvement has been made 
in the treatment of postsurgical pain, surveys still show that many patients still receive inadequate postsurgical analgesia  (Rawal, 2001) .
   Inadequate pain management can lead to 
poorer outcomes in the immediate postsurgical period and can also result in increased risk for 
chronic postsurgical pain (ie, pain that lasts beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_697757] 1 to 2 months). 
Chronic postsurgical pain is now recognized as a significant issue after surgery and may occur in 
over 30% of patients after some operations, particularly amputations, thoracotomy, mastectomy, 
and inguinal hernia repairs  (Lovich- Sapola et al., 2015) .  
The standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_697758]. However, adverse reactions related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_697759], nausea, vomiting, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and addiction make their use unfavorable  (Ramsey, 2000;  Jain and Datta, 
1997) . There are data that suggest opi[INVESTIGATOR_697760], because 
perioperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_697761] -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942], with its attendant risks  (Chou et al., 2016) .  
Acute postoperative pain and its treatment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_697762]  (Clarke et al., 2014 ).  A retrospective analysis 
Protocol INN -CB-[ADDRESS_947119] 50% of these 
patients were discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567073], and that 1 in 30 of these 
patients continued to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_283146] 3 months  (Clarke et al., 2014) .  Similarly, in 
391,139 opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve patients who underwent short -stay surgery, 7.1% were newly prescribed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_39863] 7 days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5514] 7.7% were prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_192845] 1 year after surgery.  During this time period, oxycodone use increased from 5.4% within 7 days of surgery to 15.9% at 1 year (Alam et al., 2012) .  
The use of procedure -specific, multimodal perioperative pain management provides the basis for 
enhanced postsurgical pain control, optimization of analgesia  while decreasing the requirement 
for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , decrease in adverse effect s, and improved patient satisfaction ( Lovich -Sapola et al, 
2015) .  Preventive  analgesia plays an important role in postsurgical pain management  (Vadivelu 
et al., 2014),  and av ailable data indicate that afferent neural blockade with local anesthetics, such 
as bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], is the most effective analgesic technique ( Ramsey, 2000) .
    
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], introduced in 1963, is a widely used amide local anesthetic with a prolonged duration of action. Amides are relatively stable in solution and are slowly metabolized b y hepatic 
amidases. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697763] a rapid onset and longer duration of action. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697764]. Bupi [INVESTIGATOR_697765] a local anesthetic (Section 1.2.1) .  
The advantages of effective pain management during and after surgery include patient comfort 
and satisfaction, earlier mobilization, fewer pulmonary and cardiac complications, a reduced risk 
of deep vein thrombosis, faster recovery with less likelihood of the development of neuropathic 
pain, and reduced cost of care  (Ramsey, 2000) .

1.2. INL-001 Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697767] -Matrix Implant  
INL-001 ( also known as XARACOLL®) , is a sterile, resorbable and biodegradable Type  1 
purified bovine collagen matrix implant comprised of 75 mg of Type  1 collagen purified from 
bovine Achilles tendons.   
Each implant contains 100 mg bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (equivalent to 88.8 mg of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) that is 
homogeneously dispersed ( Summary Report RPD -SYN136 ) in an approximately 5 x 5 cm matrix 
of 5 mm thickness.  Because bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697768], it 
can be cut before placement into t he surgical site using sterile technique.  INL-001 is a drug  
(bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]) -device (Type I collagen) combination  product . 
1.2.1. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697769], an amide local anest hetic with a prolonged duration of action, was introduced in 
the [LOCATION_002] in 1963, and is currently indicated for the production of local anesthesia by 
[CONTACT_697807], peripheral nerve block, and central neural block (caudal or epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]).  It 
Protocol INN -CB-[ADDRESS_947121] made it a popular drug for providing prolonged analgesia during labor or during the postoperative 
period.  Amides are relatively stable in solution and are slowly metabolized by [CONTACT_697808].  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697763] a rapid onset and long duration of action.   
Adverse reactions to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697770] -type 
local anesthetics.  A major cause of adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma 
concentrations, which may be due to overdosage, slow metabolic degradation or unintentional intravascular i njection.  Toxicity related to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697771], light-headedness, dizziness and tremors, potentially followed by [CONTACT_697809].  
 
From the published literature, it can be concluded that signs of central nervous system toxicity 
are usually evident before the appearance of cardiovascular toxicity with central nervous system 
and cardiovascular toxicities generally not seen until bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697772] ≥2000 ng/mL and ≥4000 ng/mL, respectively  (Scott, 1975; Tucker and Mather, 1979) .
  
1.2.2. Type I Collagen 
Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is used as a naturally safe and effective biomaterial in a wide variety of medical devices and delivery systems for bioactive agents  (Ramshaw  et al., 2001; Lee et al, 2001) .  Collagen implants are enzymatically degraded 
into constituent amino acids, with most reutilized for protein synthesis and the remainder excreted as urea ( Bailey, 2000).  
Collagen products have been approved as devices in the US and other parts of the world to aid in 
the management of wound healing, for cosmetic reconstruction and as absorbable hemostatic 
agents. The histological and biochemical fate of implanted collagen have been well studied. The collagen matrix is biocompatible, and collagen implants show minimal inflammatory and 
immunogenic responses  (Cooperman and Michaeli, 1985; Delustro et al., 1987; DeLustro et al., 
1986) and are progressively degraded and replaced in the wound with native collagen ( Anselme 
et al., 1 990).  
The INL -001 collagen implant utilizes a proprietary collagen matrix technology known as 
COLLARX ®.  The COLLARX technology uses purified bovine-derived coll agen for the 
manufacture of INL -001. The INL-[ADDRESS_947122] been certified as transmissible 
spongiform e ncephalopathy (TSE) free and negligible for the risk of bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy ( BSE) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001.   
In the INL -001 56- day nonclinical toxicology study in rats (WIL134502) utilizing drug product 
made for Phase [ADDRESS_947123] 
identical amino acid sequencing between animal Type 1 collagen (eg, bovine) and human 
collagen and to the positioning of antigenic determinates outside of the triple helix ( Serano, 
1992) . Because nearly all current collagen -containing implants are composed of Type [ADDRESS_947124] been used for hemostasis include 
hematoma, potentiation of infection, wound dehiscence, inflammation and edema.  Across the 10 
Phase 1/2/[ADDRESS_947125] time point (0.5 hours) after implantation .  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697773]-001  
Results from the adult pharmacokinetic study (Leiman et al., 2016) that investigated the 
pharma cokinetics, relative bioavailability and safety of INL -001 200 mg and INL-001 300 mg 
compared to infiltration of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 150 mg with epi[INVESTIGATOR_697774] (INN-CB-013) using drug product material for Phase 2 studies showed that: 
• Mean bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697775]- 001 300 mg group 
compared with the INL-001 200 mg and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 150 mg with epi[INVESTIGATOR_697776] 96-hour observation period.  Mean bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697777] -001 300 mg group peaked 3 hours after implantation of the 
matrices.   
• Areas under the plasma concentration time curve were dose proportional for INL-001 200 
mg and INL-001 300 mg groups relative to the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_301537] 150 mg with epi[INVESTIGATOR_697778].   
• The relative maximum concentrations (Cmax) for INL -001 200 mg and INL-001 300 mg 
were approximately 80% of the Cmax for the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 150 mg with epi[INVESTIGATOR_697779].  The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) of the INL -[ADDRESS_947126] plasm a concentration (777 ng/mL) after implantation of 3 
INL-001 matrices (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 300 mg) was well below the threshold concentration (ie, ≥2000 
ng/mL) that has been associated with signs and symptoms of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697780] 
(CNS) toxicity.   
1.3.2. Phase 3 Clinical Studies in Adults  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy  
To demonstrate the efficacy of INL -001 for postsurgical analgesia, the sponsor examined the 
data from 2 identical, large, well- controlled, Phase 3 studies that were conducted in the United 
States  (INN-CB-014 and INN-CB-016).  
Findings from the [ADDRESS_947127] 24 hours compared with subjects treated with placebo (SPI24; p≤0.0004; 
primary endpoint) .  The treatment effect of INL -[ADDRESS_947128] hour after local placement of study drug compared with subjects who received placebo (p<0.0001).  These reductions in pain intensity were coupled  with less total opi[INVESTIGATOR_697781] -[ADDRESS_947129] of 
INL-001 subjects did not require any opi[INVESTIGATOR_697782] 72 -hour postoperative 
period compared with 17%  of subjects who received placebo.    
Subjects in the INL -001 group combined used statistically significantly (p≤0.0004) less opi[INVESTIGATOR_697783] (p=0.0007) less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related TEAEs (ie, 
nausea, vomiting, and co nstipation) over the post implantation period compared to subjects in the 
placebo group.  This statistically significant reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related TEAEs after treatment 
with INL -001 is a clinically meaningful finding.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety  
Safety findings from [ADDRESS_947130] commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) were characteristic of those associated with general anesthesia, the surgical procedure, 
and/or rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_250084].  Most TEAEs were not considered related to the study drug.   
One death from an acute myocardial infarction occurred in the placebo group.  This death was not considered related to study drug  and was the only death that occurred across the entire INL -
[ADDRESS_947131] reports of incision site swelling and incision site pain were mild or moderate, and none 
were attributed to the study drug.  All TEAEs related to wound healing were typi[INVESTIGATOR_697784].   Across the Phase 1/2/3 studies, 2.9% 
(17/578) subjects in the INL -001 group and 2.5% 7/280) subjects in the placebo group had 
wound dehiscence and/or wound infection events.  None of these events were deemed related to study drug .       
In a review of  1440 p atients with a primary unilateral inguinal or femoral hernia repair who 
responded to a questionnaire about postoperative complications, infection was reported by 7.4%  
(105/1414) of patients and wound rupture was reported by 4.1% (49/1431) ( Fränneby, 2008) .  
Another systematic review of open inguinal hernia repair found rates of infection ranging from 3% to 5%  (Sanchez -Manuel , 2003) .   Among the 578 subjects who received INL -001 in the 
Phase 1/2/3 studies , there were no safety signals suggestive of systemic or local tissue toxicity.   
Subjects in the INL -001 300 mg group used statistically significantly less opi[INVESTIGATOR_697785], which correlated with statistically significantly (p=0.0004) less opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related 
TEAEs over the post implantation period compa red to subjects in the placebo group.  This 
statistically significant reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related TEAEs is considered a clinically meaningful 
finding.  
Unlike other currently marketed local anesthetics, which are injected directly into the soft tissue, 
the INL-001 collagen matrix is placed at multiple layers in the soft tissue (eg, between the fascia, 
muscle, and skin) during the surgical procedure.  Because INL -001 is implanted into the surgical 
site, unintended intravascular injection that often leads to t he drug’s most serious potential 
central nervous system and cardiovascular systemic toxicities is prevented.  Placement of the 
INL-[ADDRESS_947132]

The purpose of this additional  pharmacokinetic study is to further char acterize  the 
pharmacokinetics of the  INL-001 to -be-marketed formulation relative to  the reference listed drug 
(Marcaine
TM 0.25%)  and to collect additional INL -001 safety data , with particular emphasis on 
signs and symptoms of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338348] .

 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective s of this study are to estimate the: 
• Pharmacokinetic profile of the INL-001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740] -matrix implant 300 
mg during and after open hernioplasty.  
• Relative bioavailability of the INL-001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740] -matrix implant 
compared to Marcaine ™ 0.25%  infiltration.  
The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerab ility of the INL -001 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740]- matrix implant after placement in the surgical site during open 
hernioplasty, with particular emphasis on signs and symptoms of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338348] .   
The study objectives of this s tudy are  similar to those fr om the previous adult pharmacokinetic 
study (INN -CB-013).  This study however will utilize clinical trial material manufactured 
identically to that used in the Phase [ADDRESS_947133] prior to surgery in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either 3 x 100 mg INL-001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740]- matrix implants (total 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697742] 300 mg) or Marcaine 0.25% (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] ) [ADDRESS_947134] article may not be administered at the investigator’s discretion, and the subject will be considered randomized but not enrolled or treated.  
Following surgery, subjects will be transferred to a post -anesthesia care unit (PACU) and/or 
other postoperative recovery area for observation where they may receive parenteral morphine as 
needed (rescue medication for breakthrough pain).  Once subjects can tolerate oral medication, 
they will be started o n a standardized oral analgesic regimen of acetaminophen 650 mg 3 times 
daily and will be prescribed immediate -release morphine (15 mg) to manage breakthrough pain 
only when it occur s.  Subjects will remain in the PACU until they are stable and can be 
discharged to the clinic.   
Subjects will remain housed in the clinic at least until after the 72 hour blood sample has been 
collected for PK analysis  on Day 4.  Subjects discharged after the 72 hour blood draw will be 
instructed to return to the clinic to com plete the 96 hour PK blood draw  on Day 5.  Follow -up 
safety assessments will include clinic visits on Day 7, Day 15 and Day 30.  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will b e collected from subjects before surgery and at 
predetermined time points up to 96 hours aft er administration of study drug. Safety assessments 
will include frequent assessment of vital signs through 72 hours, continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring for at least 24 hours, oxygen saturation levels, and adverse event s (AE s) 
reporting with par ticular emphasis on the signs and symptoms of CNS and cardiovascular 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697743] 5.12.6.  The surgical wound will be assessed 
frequently for adverse events associated with altered wound healing .

Blood samples will be collected for the determination of pharmacokine tics at the following time 
points :  before Time 0 and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 96 hours after 
Time 0.   (There is a +/ - 5 minute time window for the PK time  points up to and including 5 hours 
after time 0 and a +/ - 15 m inute time window for the remaining time points) . Time [ADDRESS_947156] INL -001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697740] -matrix is implanted or the time of the 
Marcaine 0.25%  injection.   Approximately [ADDRESS_947157] completes the Day 30  end of study  visit.   
5.16. Discussion and Justification of Study Design  
This study is designed to compare the pharmacokinetics of INL -001 to the reference drug, 
Marcaine 0.25% .  This study will also evaluate the safety o f INL -001, particularly with respect to 
any potential cardiac and  neurological effects  of INL -001 in subjects undergoing hernioplasty.   
Both components of the INL -001 implant (collagen and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) have been in clinical use 
worldwide for several decad es. The INL-001 implant is a Type  I collagen matrix (25 cm2) with 
homogeneously dispersed bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] [ADDRESS_947158] 
been associated with local nerve block or incisional infiltration.  
The purpose of this  additional  pharmacokinetic study is to further characterize the 
pharmacokinetics of the INL -001 to- be-marketed formulation relative to the reference listed drug  
(Marcaine 0.25%) and to collect additional INL -[ADDRESS_947159] for evidence of investigational 
drug intolerance and for the development of clinical and/or laborat ory evidence of an AE.  An 
AE assessment will be made by [CONTACT_30036] a routine basis throughout the study.   
All AEs that occur during the course of the study must be reported in detail on the subject’s chart 
(source document), appropriate e CRFs, a nd on any other report form required by [CONTACT_17657].   
Protocol INN -CB-[ADDRESS_947160] a causal 
relationship with the drug .  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a n investigational drug , whether or not the event is cons idered causally related to the use 
of the drug .  Such an event can result from use of the investigational drug  as stipulated in the 
protocol or labeling  of the investigational drug.   Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or 
illness is considered an AE.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered 
to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical 
intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be clinically significant AEs.  
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as any AE with onset or worsening reported by a subject 
from the time the investigational drug is implanted  until completion of or discharge from the 
study (see Section 4.3 fo r details regarding premature discontinuation).  
6.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
Any AE that results in 1 or more of the following is considered a serious adverse event (SAE):  
1. Death - Includes death of a fetus due to miscarriage/spontaneous abortion and elective 
abortion in the subject . 
2. Life Threatening Situation -  The subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event.  It does not refer to the hypothetical risk of death if the AE was more severe or was 
to progress.  
3. Inpatient  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - This inclu des any new hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697798].  The following are not considered serious due to inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: 
a. Trips to the ER that do not include a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
b. Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_356755] (eg, cosmetic 
surgery)  
c. Admission for treatment of a pre -existing condition that has not worsened or had 
an increase in severity or frequency (eg, cataract surgery)  
d. Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures noted i n the baseline source 
documentation 
4. Persistent or Significant Disability/Incapacity -  Any AE having an outcome that is 
associated with a substantial disruption of the ability to carry out normal life functions.  This includes the inability to work.  This is not intended to include transient, interruptions of daily activities.  
5. Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect in a child of the subject . 
6. Other Medically Important Events -  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
Protocol INN -CB-[ADDRESS_947161] and/or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in [ADDRESS_947162] notify Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 
hours by [CONTACT_697817]/or telephone, facsimile, email (see Section 
6.5). 
6.2. Adverse Event Severity  
The severity of the adverse event will be graded using the following definitions: 
• Mild - The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
• Moderate - The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's 
usual activities.  
• Severe - The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
6.3. Relationship to Investigational Drug 
The investigator must record t he causal relationship of each adverse event in the eCRF, and on 
the serious adverse reporting form (if applicable).  An investigator's causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or contributed to an adverse event.  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event.  
• Not related: An adverse event is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of 
another drug or event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not suggest a causal relationship).  
6.4. Adverse Event Collection Period  
All (serious and non-serious) adverse events, whether elicited during study visits or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423], that occur from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent form until completion of or discharge from the study will be collected. 
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution until it becomes stable or until it can be 
explained by [CONTACT_17648] (ie, concurrent condition or medication) or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], further evaluation is not warranted.  All findings relevant to the final outcome of 
an AE will be reported in the subject’s medical record.   
6.5. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
In the event of an SAE, whether related to the investigational drug  or not, the investigator will 
notify Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 hours of being made aware of the SAE:

All serious adverse events that the investigator considers related to study drug 
occurring after the study closes must be reported to the s ponsor.  
6.6. Sponsor Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
Adverse event reporting, including reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse drug 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 
6.7. Exposure During Pregnancy  
An exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in- utero [EIU]) occurs if:  
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly exposed to the investigational drug  (maternal exposure).  
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental, to the investigational drug prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure). 
If any study subject is found to be pregnant during the study the investigator must submit EIU information to Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy, 
irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred.  
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero reports with an unknown outcome. Innocoll Pharmaceuticals  will follow the pregnancy until 
complet ion or until pregnancy termination (eg, induced abortion).

Individual plasma concentration- time pr ofiles of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697800] a semi -
logarithmic and a linear scale. The mean plasma concentration -time profile and SD will also be 
presented graphically.  
Actual blood sampling times for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697801] a time from Time 0 
(elapsed time). Individual elapsed times will be used in the PK analysis.  
Pharm acokinetic parameters of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697752]. A descriptive 
summary for each parameter will include arithmetic mean, SD, CV (%), geometric mean, 
median, m inimum and maximum.  
Data permitting, the tlag , Cmax , Tmax , t1/2z , λz, AUC0 -last,  and AUC0-∞  will be assessed.  
The Cmax  and Tmax  will be obtained directly from the concentration- time data.  Where there 
are multiple identical maximum concentrations in a single profile, the Cmax  value  is defined 
as the first temporal occurr ence. The tlag  will be taken as the time of occurrence of the first 
quantifiable plasma bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697802].  
AUC0 -last will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule from predose to the last 
quantifiable plasma concentration. 
AUC0 -∞ will be calculated according to the following equation:  
Where Clast  is the last quantifiable concentration.  
For the purpose of calculating AUC 0-last, when 2 consecutive plasma concentrations below  
the LOQ are encountered after T max, all subsequent values will be exc luded from the 
analysis. When embedded missing values occur, they will be excluded from the analysis.  
Quantifiable concentrations at predose, if any will be set to zero.  
The proportion of AUC0 -∞ due to extrapolation (AUCextr) will also be calculated, expressed 
as a percentage.  
The terminal phase rate constant ( λz) will be estimated by [CONTACT_697821] -time profile. The number of data points include d in the 
regression will be determined by [CONTACT_31519]. A minimum of 3 data points in the 
terminal phase, excluding Cmax will be required to estimate λ z. 
The t1/2z will be calculated as:

 The relative bioavailability (AUC0 -last, AUC0 -∞ and Cmax) of th e INL-001 bupi[INVESTIGATOR_697747] -matrix implant (300 mg) will be calculated with respect to the Marcaine 0.25% 
(175 mg ) infiltration using an ANOVA model with  a term for treatment. The analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA)  model will be run on the dose -normalized nat ural log  transformed  values. 
The least squares means and the standard error values from the analyses will  be used to 
construct the 90% confidence intervals for the relative bioavailability evaluations.   The 
relative bioavailability will be calculated as:  
 
Test=INL -001; standard=Marcaine 0.25%  
These analyses will be performed on the Per Protocol PK Population.  
8.2.3. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy will not be not assessed in this study.  
8.2.4. Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study. Howe ver, it is expected  that 
48 subjects (32 in the INL -001 group and 16 in the Marcaine group) will be sufficient to evaluate 
PK, estimate relative bioavailability, and adequately assess safety with respect to bu pi[INVESTIGATOR_697746] .

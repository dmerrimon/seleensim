SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA009002
Protocol Title:  A Phase 1/2a Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study for Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
BMS-986156 Administered Alone and in Combination with Nivolumab  (BMS-936558, anti PD-1 Monoclonal 
Antibody) in Advanced Solid Tumors.
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):  
BMS-986156 (anti-GITR antibody) is supplied as a sterile 10 mg/m L formulation to be administered as an intravenous 
(IV) infusion. Nivolumab (BMS-936558, an anti-PD-1 antibody) is available as a sterile 10 mg/mL formulation to be 
administered as an IV infusion.
Each subject will be administered IV doses of BMS-986156 per the cohort assignment as follows:
In Part A (monotherapy dose escalation), the planned dose level s for BMS-986156 are 10, 30 , 100, 240, a nd 800 mg 
once every 2 weeks (Q2W), in 8-week cycles, for up to [ADDRESS_745619] ered at a dose of 240 mg Q2W, in 8-week cycles, 
for up to 3 cycles of study therapy. The Sponsor chose 30 mg BMS-9 [ZIP_CODE] in combination with 240 mg nivolumab 
as the starting dose in Part B, based on the safety profile of P art A (monotherapy dose escalation). No DLT nor any 
AE (greater than Grade 1), for which no other cause than the investigational drug could be identified, had occurred.
Starting dose level of BMS-986156 was determined based on safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
and is one dose level lower than the dose already tolerated Part A (ongoing monotherapy dose escalation).
In Part C, a monotherapy tumor-specific cohort expansion will b e carried out at the BMS-986156 monotherapy dose 
selected from Part A (monotherapy dose escalation), which may r epresent the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), 
maximum administered dose (MAD), or an alternate dose(s). Study  therapy will be administered Q2W, in 8-week 
cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
In Part D, a combination therapy cohort expansion will be carri ed out using the combination dose of BMS-986156
selected from Part B, 240 mg BMS 986156 in combination with 240 mg nivolumab, Q2W dosing, and may represent 
the MTD, MAD, or an alternate dose(s) for the combination. Study  therapy will be administered Q2W, in 8-week 
cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
In Part E, a combination therapy cohort expansion, exploring Q4W  dosing, will be carried our using the combination
dose of  480 mg BMS 986156 with 480 mg nivolumab, in cervical can cer (cohort 9) and othe r tumor types (Cohort 
10). Each cohort in Part E will consist of approximately 40 sub jects each. Study therapy will be administered Q4W, 
in 8-week cycles, for up to 3 cycles.
Study Phase:  Phase 1/2a
Research Hypothesis:  It is anticipated that anti-GITR antibody (BMS-986156), administered as a single agent or in 
combination with nivolumab, will demonstrate adequate safety and  tolerability, as well as a favorable risk/benefit 
profile, to support further clinical testing. No prospective hypotheses are being formally evaluated.
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and 
MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 administered alone and i n combination with nivolumab in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.

Secondary Objectives:
•To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BMS-[ZIP_CODE] 6 administered alone and in combination with 
nivolumab in subjects with advanced solid tumors 
•To characterize the PK of BMS-986156 administered alone and in combination with nivolumab
•To characterize th e immunogenicity of BMS- 986156 administered a lone and in combination with nivolumab, and 
the immunogenicity of nivolumab administered with BMS-986156.
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS-[ADDRESS_745620] of dose escalation with BMS-986156 administered 
as a single agent (Part A) or in combination with nivolumab (Part B) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Starting 
dose selection of BMS-986156 for Part B was determined using all available safety (clinical and laboratory), PK  
 data and will be one dose level lower than the already tolerat ed dose in the ongoing monotherapy dose escalation 
in Part A (See Section 1.1.4  for details). Subsequently, escalation in the Parts A and B will proceed in parallel. 
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 240 mg administered Q2W for all combination dose cohorts (Parts B and 
D).
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks for combination dose cohorts Part ECohort expansions were evaluated with BMS-986156 monotherapy (P art C) and combination therapy (Part D). 
Part C consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 monotherapy in 2 disease-restricted populations, NSCLC with 
progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior 
platinum doublet-based chemotherapy, and persistent, recurrent,  or metastatic cervical cancer, of approximately 25 
subjects each. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with nivolumab in disease-
restricted populations as follows (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma head and 
neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) hepatocellular carcinoma of approximately 40 subjects each.
Part E consists of cohort expansion with BMS 986156 administered in combination with nivolumab in cervical cancer 
(cohort 9) and other solid tumor types (Cohort 10). Each cohort will contain approximately 40 subjects each.
In an e ffort to limit confounding factors, for all cohorts where  applicable, no more than 5 subjects pre viously found 
to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-[ADDRESS_745621] response assessment while on prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (if 
applicable).
Treatment in Parts C and D will be initiated when the MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) for monotherapy and combination 
with nivolumab have each been determined. The doses selected for Parts C and D will not exceed the MTD or MAD

Subjects will complete up to 3 periods of the study:  Screening, Treatment, and Safety follow-up, as described below:
Screening (up to 28 days): Subjects will sign consent and be evaluated for study eligibility
Treatment Period consists of up to three, 8-week treatment cycles. In Parts A and C, each treatment cycle will 
comprise 4 doses of BMS-986156 administered Q2W on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43 of the treatment cycle. In Parts B and 
D, each treatment cycle will comprise 4 doses of BMS- 986156 (administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43) in combina tion 
with 4 doses of nivolumab administered on Days 1, 15, 29, and 43  of the treatment cycle. In Part E, each treatment 
cycle will comprise 2 doses of BMS-986156 (administered on Days  1 and 29) in combination with [ADDRESS_745622] v1.1-defined progressive disease 
(PD) after discussion and agreement with the BMS Medical Monitor that the benefit/risk assessment favors continued 
administration of study therapy (e.g., subjects are continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_3786], tolerating treatment, absence of signs or symptom s indicating disease progression, and do not meet 
treatment discontinuation criteria as specified in Section 3.12.1 ).
Treatment with Additional Cycles beyond 24 weeks: Subjects completing approximately 24 weeks of treatment 
with ongoing disease control (complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR) or stable disease (SD) or unconfirmed 
progressive disease (PD) may be eligible for an additional 3 cy cles of study therapy in both monotherapy (Parts A and 
C) and combination therapy (Parts B and D) beyond the initial 2 4 weeks, on a case-by-case basis, after careful 
evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio supports administration of further study therapy. All subjects completing  approximately 48 weeks of treatment with ongoing 
disease control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed PD, may be eligib le for an additional 7 cycles of study therapy in

recommendation of next dose level to be investigated. The BLRM ( -Copula) with an overdose control principle 
(escalation with overdose control)1 will be employed to ensure t hat safety is not compromised during dose escalation.
The initial dose level of BMS-986156 in Part A will be 10 mg fla t dose administered as an IV infusion over 60 minutes 
every 2 weeks (See Section 1.1.2 ). Expected dose levels for dose escalation (determined by [CONTACT_567709])1are provided in Table -1.
Starting dose selection of BMS-986156 for Part B (combination w ith nivolumab) will be determined using data 
available from all doses evaluated in Part A, including clinica l and safety laboratory, PK,  and modeling 
recommendation within Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework by [CONTACT_567710]-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209-003, a Phase 1 ni volumab monotherapy data in advanced solid 
tumors) and will be one dose level lower than a dose already test ed and shown to be tolerated in ongoing monotherapy 
dose escalation in Part A (see Section 1.1.4 for details). 
Dose levels considered for the next cohort were be based on evaluating three potential recommendations by [CONTACT_540833] (-
Copula): escalate, de-escalate, or stay at same dose level. Fin al dose selection for next cohort/dose level will be made 
in conjunction with all data available from all dosed subjects, i ncluding clinical and laboratory safety assessments, 
PK  data, will not allow escalation by [CONTACT_567711]. Accord ingly, intermediate or lower doses, or less 
frequent dosing of BMS-986156 may be tested if none of the plan ned doses/schedules are found to be tolerated as 
monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab.
Cohort tolerability assessment and subsequent dose recommendati on will occur according to BLRM (-Copula) 
recommendation and after completion the 4 week DLT observation period. Continuous re-assessment of dose 
recommendation by [CONTACT_540833] (-Copula) will be carried out at each dose level. 
Approximately 30 subjects each will be treated in dose escalatio n phases in monotherapy (Part A) and combination 
therapy (Part B). No intra-subject dose escalation or reduction is allowed.  Sentinel Subject (Parts A and B only): During dose escalation, a staggered dosing (sentinel subject) approach will 
be used for the first subject in the first dose level of both mo notherapy and combination cohorts. The first subject in 
both Part A and Part B will receive Cycle 1 Day 1 dose of study drug/s, and be observed for [ADDRESS_745624] subjects to be dosed in subsequent cohorts 
will not be required to observe the 5-day interval between trea tment start dates.

Cohort Expansion (Parts C, D, and E):   The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, 
preliminary efficacy, PK information regarding BMS-986156 as monot herapy or in combination with 
nivolumab. 
Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment in the 
expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment-related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% 
across all subjects treated in the Part C cohort expansions, the findings will be discussed and further enrollment may 
be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxici ty and after assessing the risk: benefit ratio, a new 
dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.
Part C consists of cohort expansions with BMS-986156 monotherapy in 2 disease-restricted populations: (i) NSCLC 
subjects with progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1 ) during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy 
following prior platinum doublet-based chemotherapy and (ii) persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.  
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with nivolumab in 
disease-restricted populations as follows: (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma 
head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) hepatocellular carcinoma.
In an e ffort to limit confounding factors, for all cohorts where  applicable, no more than 5 subjects pre viously found 
to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-[ADDRESS_745625] response assessment while on prior 
PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (if applicable).Parts E includes two cohorts with one as cervical and another for other solid tumors for signal seeking and exploration 
of Q4W dosing respectively. Due to the purpose of signal confirming in cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response 
rates of the other solid tumors cohort (I-O experienced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, SCCHN, and HCC), 
approximately 40 subjects are planned for each cohort in part E . For initial safety evaluation of 480 mg BMS-
986156/480 mg nivolumab Q4W 6 subjects for a safety  lead-in will  be enrolled and followed for a minimum of two 
weeks (refer to Section 3.7  for the rationale for two week period) prior to opening full enrollment of Part E.

Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLTs):   For the purpose of guiding dose es calation, DLTs w ill be defined based on the 
incidence and grade of adverse events (AEs) for which no alternate cause can be identified ( Section 4.3.1). The 
incidence of DLTs which occur within 4 weeks following the star t of study therapy will guide dose escalation 
decisions. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
AEs version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). For the purposes of subject management, drug-related AEs occurring at any time 
which meet the DLT definition will lead to dose interruption an d or permanent discontinuation of study drug as defined 
in Sections 3.[ADDRESS_745626] of an initial safety lead in period of up t o 12 subjects. Six subjects need to complete the 14-day 
observation period before the full expansion cohorts, of up to 40 subjects, are opened. Patients who discontinue for 
reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-related toxicity may be replaced. An observation period of 
14 days has been chosen based on pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation for BMS-986156, based on PK 
parameters derived from preclinical studies ( Section 1.1.5 ).

Study Assessments:  
•Safety Outcome Measures :  Safety assessments will be based on comprehensive medical re view of adverse 
event reports, vital sign measurements, ECGs, physical examinat ions, and results of laboratory tests. AEs will be 
coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the
incidence of observed adverse events will be tabulated and revi ewed for potential significance and clinical 
importance. Adverse events will be assessed continuously during the study and for [ADDRESS_745628]
treatment. Both AEs and laboratory tests will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
•Efficacy Measures : Disease assessment with computed tomography (CT) and/or magnet ic resonance imaging
(MRI), as appropriate, w ill be performed at baseline and every [ADDRESS_745629] v1.1 based on recorded tumor measurements (see 
Appendix 3 ).
•Pharmacokinetic Measures : Serial serum samples will be collected from all subjects at specified time points to 
evaluate concentrations of BMS-986156. PK parameters such as Cma x, Ctrough, Tmax, T-HALF, AUC (TAU), 
CLT, and accumulation index (AI) will be derived, if feasible, fro m serum concentration versus time data.  
•Immunogenicity Measures : Serum samples to evaluate development of anti-drug antibody (A DA) response to 
BMS-986156 alone, and in combination with nivolumab will be collec ted at specified time points.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:  
Dose Escalation :
As a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial, the sample size at each dos e in these arms depends on observed toxicity and 
posterior inference. Approximately 60 subjects are expected to b e treated during the dose- escalation phase (around 30 
subjects for BMS-986156 monotherapy and around 30 subjects for B MS-986156 in combination with nivolumab). 
Initially up to 3 subjects will be tr eated at the starting dose levels of BMS-986156 or BMS-986156 i n combination 
with nivolumab. Additional cohorts of approximately 3 evaluable  subjects will be treated in recommended dose levels
per BLRM (-Copula) during the dose-escalation phase. At most 12 D LT-evaluable subjects will be treated at each 
dose level.

Cohort Expansion: 
Part E includes two cohorts with one as Cervical and another on e as the mixed tumors for signal seeking and 
exploration of Q4W dosing. Due to the purpose of signal confirming in cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response 
rates of the mixed tumors cohort, approximately 40 subjects are  planned for each cohort in part E. For initial safety 
evaluation of 480 mg BMS-986156/480 mg nivolumab Q4W in Part E, 6 subjects will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 weeks (please refer to Section 3.7 for the r ationale for 2 week period) prior to opening Part E to full 
enrollment.
The planned sample size for each of the expansion cohorts serve  as a guidance. Final decision will be made by [CONTACT_567712].If in a cohort of 40 subjects 10, or 15 responses are observed,  then the lower limit of the one-sided 90% exact binomial 
CI for the ORR is 16%, and 27% respectively. These calculations are made using the Clopper-Pearson method for 
exact confidence intervals. If the true ORR in a tumor type is 40%, then with 40 subjects in a tumor type, there is 93% 
chance of observing at least 12 responses, and 87% chance of observing at least 13 responses, and there is 7% chance
of observing 11 or fewer responses (false negative rate).
Primary Endpoints:   
•The primary objective of the study is to establish MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s). The assessment of safety will be 
based on the incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to discontinuation, and deaths. In addition clinical laboratory test abnormalities will be examined.
Secondary endpoints:
•The ORR, duration of response, and progression free survival ra te (PFSR) at [ADDRESS_745630] v1.1 criteria. The above will be determined based on tum or measurements occurring every 8 weeks 
during the Treatment Period.
•Pharmacokinetics: Selected BMS-986156 parameters, such as Cmax,  Ctrough, Tmax, T-HALF, AUC-(TAU),
CLT and AI, will be assessed, if feasible, from concentration-time data during Cycle 1 and Cycle 3.
•Immunogenicity: Incidence of specific ADA to BMS-986156 and or nivolumab. Samples will be collected at 
multiple time points.

Revised Protocol No.: 05Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_745638] successful and important strategies for treating patients w ith hematological malignancies and 
solid tumors.1Aside from targeting antigens that are involved in cancer cell proliferation and 
survival, antibodies can also function to either activate or an tagonize immunological pathways that 
are important in cancer immune surveillance. It is now clear th at an antigen-specific anti-cancer 
immune response is the result of a complex dynamic interplay between antigen-presenting cells
(APC), T lymphocyte (T) cells, and the target cancer cells.2The critical balance of T-cell activity 
that dictates whether endogenous anti-tumor immune responses wil l be effective, are largely 
understood to be controlled by [CONTACT_488]-specific stimuli sensed by [CONTACT_941] T-cell receptor and by [CONTACT_567718] (co-stimulatory) and negativ e (co-inhibitory) T-cell surface 
molecules.3Within the past decade, antibodies against these key receptors have been designed and 
evaluated in the clinic with impressive results, heralding the onset of immunotherapy as a key 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_567677].[ADDRESS_745639] extensively studied immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_567678], 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and programmed death-1 (PD-1).[ADDRESS_745640] clinical  evidence of improvement in 
overall survival with immune modulatory anticancer therapy in pa tients with metastatic 
melanoma.6,7Following that, Topalian et al. showed that anti-PD-1 antibody produced objective 
responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma, and renal-cell cancer 
(RCC).[ADDRESS_745641]-targete d agents, the field of tumor 
immunotherapy is beginning to expand rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. In addition to blo cking co-inhibitory pathways, 
activating co-stimulatory pathways to potentiate antitumor immu ne responses is being considered 
as a promising approach.9Members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFR sf) 
include several co-stimulatory proteins with key roles in B and T cell development, survival, immune activation, and antitumor immune responses.
10Preclinical data have provided the basis 
for the trial of agonist antibodies to TNFRsf co-stimulatory re ceptors 4-1BB,11,12OX40,13,14
glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-(GITR)-related gene,15,16and CD2717,18as potential therapi[INVESTIGATOR_567679]. Overall, enhancement of the magnitude and  potency of tumor antigen-
specific adaptive cellular responses by [CONTACT_398]8 and CD4 T cells is now considered a major goal in 
cancer immunotherapy. 
With these recent emerging clinical lines of evidence of signif icant activity of single agent 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is possible that combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_567680] d potentially lead to greater depth 
of response and overall survival as has been noted with the com bination of anti-PD-1 and anti-
CTLA4 in advanced melanoma patients.19 20This raises the possibility that combining strategies

CA009002 is a Phase 1/2a, first-in-human (FIH), ascending multip le-dose study of BMS-986156, 
an anti-GITR agonistic antibody, in humans with advanced/metastatic solid tumors as
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. This study will e valuate the safety profile, 
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, of intravenous (IV) dose s of BMS-986156 
administered every 2 weeks as monotherapy and in combination wit h nivolumab in advanced solid 
tumors and is expected to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) or an alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 to be used in fu ture monotherapy and 
combination with nivolumab therapy trials. In addition, the stu dy will evaluate  BMS-986156 as 
monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab in the following d isease-restricted populations, 
as follows: NSCLC with progressive disease during, or recurrent disease, during or after anti-PD-1 or anti-programmed death-ligand (PD-L1), and persistent, recu rrent, or metastatic cervical 
cancer. Additional tumor types are bladder cancer, head and nec k squamous cell cancer , ovarian 
cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (see Section 3.9.1 ).
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Non-small cell lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer- related mortality worldwide, 
accounting for approximately 18% of all cancer deaths.
23Lung cancer is also the leading cause of 
cancer death in the US. In 2014, an estimated 224,210 new cases were expected to be diagnosed, 
and 159,260 deaths are estimated to occur because of the disease, accounting for 27% of all deaths 
due to cancer.[ADDRESS_745643] lung cancers ( ׽80%) are NSCLC.25Of these patients, more than 65% present with locally 
advanced or metastatic disease.26Despi[INVESTIGATOR_69086]-based chemotherapy, the 
standard of care for first-line therapy, patients with metastatic NSCLC have a median survival of approximately 10 months and a 5-year survival r ate of less than 5%,
27and treatment options for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) wild-type 
NSCLC are particularly limited after failure of front-line chem otherapy. Overall, this group of 
patients only has an OS of about 8 months after progression fro m platinum agents. Once resistance 
to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) occurs, the patients who h ave EGFR mutations or ALK 
translocations often hav e a rapid dis ease progression.

Recentl y, nivolumab was a pproved for the management of advanced squamous and non-squamou s

the possibility that combining anti-PD-1 antibody with other ag ents could potentially lead to 
deeper and more durable long term responses in high PD-L1 expressing tumors and possibly even 
cures in this high unmet medical n eed population of patients wi th NSCLC provides additional 
rationale for evaluating novel combinations in this disease. 
Carcinoma of the Cervix
Cervical cancer remains a considerable problem worldwide with 5 00,000 new cases and 250,000 
deaths annually.29In 2014, in the US, an estimated 12,360 new cases were expected  t o  b e  
diagnosed, and 4,020 deaths are estimated to occur because of t he disease.30Treatment for cervical 
cancer is typi[INVESTIGATOR_567681]1 and concurrent chemoradiation for Stages IB2 to 
IVA. The 5-year survival rate for cervical cancer depends on stage and ranges from 93% for early
stage disease (IA) to around 15% for Stages IVA and B.31Treatment of recurrent disease is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_567682] p lus bevacizumab, which improved 
objective response rate (ORR), (48% vs. 36%) and mOS (17 vs. 13. 3 months) compared to 
chemotherapy alone.32After first line chemotherapy, there is no standard of care tha t has 
demonstrated improved benefit over best supportive care.
Bladder Cancer
Bladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world, wi th 430,000 newly diagnosed in 
2012.33In the [LOCATION_002] (US), approximately 77,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths occur each 
year due to bladder cancer.34In Europe, there were an estimated 118,000 cases and 52,000 deaths 
in 2012.35In developed regions such as North America and Europe, the histological phenotype is 
predominantly urothelial carcinoma.
From 1985 to 2005, the number of bladder cancers diagnosed in the US increased by [CONTACT_726] 
50%, while from 1975 to 1996, the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with bladder cancer 
increased from 75% t o 81%.36Mortality rates in several western European countries have show n

well as ethnic and genetic differences among populations.
Revised Protocol No.: 05

increasing in females as more women use tobacco, and in young non-smokers as human 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) plays an increasingly prominent role as an  e t i o l o g i c  f a c t o r  i n  t h e  
development of oropharyngeal head and neck cancer. 
Tobacco (smoked and smokeless) is the most important known risk factor for the development of 
head and neck cancer. There is some evidence for a genetic predi sposition to the carcinogenic 
effects of tobacco. In addition, tobacco and alcohol consumptio n appear to have a synergistic 
effect. The repeated exposure of the mucosa of the upper aerodi gestive tract to the carcinogenic 
effects of tobacco, alcohol, or both appears to cause multiple primary and secondary tumors in this 
“condemned mucosa,” a phenomenon described as “field cancerizat ion.”
HPV infection is a causative agent for head and neck cancer. HPV-associated head and neck 
cancers occur primarily in the oropharynx (tonsils and base of tongue), account for the younger 
age of patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and  define a subset of patients with 
improved treatment outcome. However, the use of HPV status in clinical decision making remains 
investigational at this time, and treatment is the same as for patients without an HPV-associated
tumor.38,39,40,41,42,43,44
Ovarian Cancer
The term ovarian cancer (OC) includes not only epi[INVESTIGATOR_567683]. The latter two are less common neoplasms,  which, however, are managed 
in a similar manner to epi[INVESTIGATOR_567684]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_567685]’s fifth most common cause o f cancer mortality in women. 
Nearly 75% of the patients present with advanced-stage OC.45According to the International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, 5-year survival rates are approximately 46.7% for Stage 
IIIa, 41.5% for Stage IIIb, 32.5% for Stage IIIc, and 18.6% for Stage IV. Patients with platinum
sensitive OC treated with platinum-based frontline therapy have  high response rates of up to 81% 
and median progression free survival (mPFS) and mOS of 19.[ADDRESS_745646] a 
significantly worse prognosis with mPFS between 10.2 and 4.1 months and mOS between 17.6 
and 5.0 months, respectively,47Immunotherapy with weekly int raperitoneal IL 2 produced  a ~17% 
complete pathologic response rate in patients with platinum-res istant OC.48A threefold 
prolongation of PFS was observed in patients treated with recom binant human IFN- Ȗ combined 
with MTD cisplatin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy, with minimal added toxicity.49,50The 
presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in advanced-stage OC correlates with an 
improved outcome. Patients with Stage III and IV OC and the pre sence of TILs within the tumor 
had better disease free survival and OS (P < 0.001) than did pat ients with similar staged OC and 
absence of TILs.51
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_745647] mortality-to-incidence rate ratio of 0.98, f ollowed by [CONTACT_198233] (0.85) and 
esophageal (0.83) cancers.52The number of deaths is close to the number of new cases because 
most HCCs are detected at an advanced stage and occur in patien ts with underlying liver 
dysfunction, making HCC a highly lethal cancer. The prognosis i s also poor because of the low 
effectiveness of available tr eatments. The 5-year HCC survival rate is approximately 5% to 6% 
compared with 72% and 22% for breast cancer stages III and IV, respectively.53,54,55Treatment of 
HCC is challenging because the disease is highly heterogeneous with different etiologies and 
because of varying approaches to diagnosis and treatment and var iations in responses to therapy.56
Relatively few patients are eligible for curative treatment bec ause of the late appearance of 
symptoms.57The majority of patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages of the disease when 
the disease is beyond resection and locoregional treatments are ineffective. The prognosis for these 
patients is poor.58
GITR: Immune Activation by T cell Costimulation and Regulatory T cell Suppression
GITR protein (also known as TNFRsf18) was first identified as a dexamethasone-inducible 
molecule on a murine  T cell hybr idoma.59GITR is a type I transmembrane protein belonging to 
the TNFRSF including OX40, CD27, and CD137. These receptors are costimulators of T cell 
activity a nd with T cell receptor engagement result in T cell activation.
GITR is expressed on naive murine T cells but shows little expression on naive human T cells.60
GITR is expressed upon activation of CD8 and CD4 effector T (Te ff) cells, but is constitutively 
expressed on regulatory T (Treg) cells. In normal human periphe ral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs), GITR expression on Treg cells is higher than on conventional T cells, and while 
expression on resting CD4+ T cells was low it markedly increase d after activation.61It is also 
expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and at low levels on B c ells, eosinophils, basophils, 
macrophages and dendritic cells, and can be upregulated by [CONTACT_567719].62,63,64,65,66,67,68GITR

While Treg cells a ntagonize effector T cells, thereby [CONTACT_567721], engag ement of 
GITR on Teff cells promotes increased T cell function by l imiting t he sensitivity of these cells to 
Treg suppression. Stephans et al mixed irradiated T-cell depleted splenocytes and anti-CD3, and 
Teff and Treg cells isolated from WT or GITR-deficient (GITR-/-) mice, showing that GITR
agonism renders Teff cells resistant to Treg suppression.76In addition, in certain circumstances 
engagement of GITR on intratumoral Treg cell may result in dimi nished suppressor activity. NK 
cells also express low levels of GITR, which can be up regulate d by [CONTACT_13204] (IL)-[ADDRESS_745649] antibody of the IgG1 isotype that binds with high affinity

1.5.5 Nivolumab Clinical Safety and Activity
Overall, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is managea ble and generally consistent
across completed and ongoing clinical trials with no MTD reached at any dose tested up to
10 mg/kg. There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or ca usality of AEs to nivolumab dose
level. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1-2) with relatively few drug-related high-grade (Grade3-4) AEs. The safety profile of nivolumab combination therapy v aries with the agent combined
with nivolumab, but is generally consistent with the safety pro files observed with either agent

alone and, in some cases, both frequency and severity of AEs we re greater than that observed with 
either agent alone. The safety profile of nivolumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b combination therapy was
consistent with the mechanisms of action of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134]. A dose of 3 mg/kg
nivolumab/3 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_302235], and both 1 mg/kg nivolumab/3 mg/kg
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164] 3 mg/kg nivolumab/1 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_567687]. For
nivolumab monotherapy and combination therapy, most high-grade events were manageable with use of corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (HRT; endo crinopathies).
In several ongoing clinical trials, the safety of nivolumab in combination with other therapeutics
such as ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-angiogenics, a nd targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_567688]. Most studies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of nivolumab combinationscontinues to evolve. Management algorithms including the use of  immunosuppressive agents, such 
as corticosteroids, infliximab, etc., are provided in Appendix 4 . Nivolumab should not be used in 
subjects with active autoimmune disease given the mechanism of action of the antibody. Updated 
overall clinical experience for nivolumab is available in the c urrent version of the IB.

BMS-986156 Starting Dose for Part A (Monotherapy)
The FIH dose for this study has been carefully selected based on  a thorough review of all available 
nonclinical data . Since BMS-[ADDRESS_745657] ivates the 
T-cell mediated immune response, MABEL and HNSTD were considered  in selecting the FIH 
starting dose.
To balance the potential for pharmacologic activity and need fo r reasonable safety in a cancer 
patient population vs. normal healthy vol unteers, a dose of 10 mg w as selected as the FIH safe 
starting dose. This dose is approximately 100-fold lower than the MRSD (992 mg) projected from 
the 1-month repeat-dose toxicity study in monkeys, is approximately 5-fold lower than the 
projected human efficacious dose (56 mg), and is within the derived MABEL dose range).127Thus 
the selected FIH starting dose of BMS-[ADDRESS_745658] for patient safety 
with the potential of exposing a higher number of patients with advanced cancer to 
non-pharmacologically active doses. Monotherapy dose escalation has cleared 800 mg wit hout the 
MTD being reached.
BMS-986156 Starting Dose for Part B (Combination with Nivolumab )
The Sponsor decided to choose the 30 mg BMS-986156 in combinatio n with 240 mg nivolumab 
based on the safety profile of the monotherapy dose escalation, Part A, of BMS-986156. No DLT 
nor any AE (greater than Grade 1) for which no other cause than the investigational drug could be 
identified had occurred. Starting dose of BMS-986156 in Part B (combination with nivolumab) is 
one dose level lower than a dose already tested and shown to be tolerated in ongoing monotherapy dose escalation in Part A . At no point will the dose of BMS-[ADDRESS_745659] 
been demonstrated previously to be safe in the monotherapy dose  escalation arm (Part A), nor at 
any point during Part B escalation will the BMS-[ADDRESS_745660] dose determined 
to be tolerated in Part A. Combination dose escalation has clea red 240 mg BMS-986156/240 mg 
nivolumab and has been initiated at 800 mg/240 mg without the MTD being reached.
Dose Escalation in Parts A and B
BLRM with overdose control (EWOC) principle
144will be employed to ensure that safety is not 
compromised during dose escalation. In addition, following the completion of one dose level, dose 
selection for next cohort/dose level will be made in conjunctio n with the data available on all

Safety Monitoring on Study Therapy (Parts A-F)
In the absence of a pre-clinically defined safety signal, safet y monitoring, by [CONTACT_567722] (incl uding liver enzyme) tests will be carried out prior to 
administration of study therapy, on a weekly basis for the firs t cycle and bi-weekly thereafter. In

provided in the protocol and the administrati on of BMS-986156 a s monotherapy or in combination 
with nivolumab will occur at sites with medical monitoring and capability to manage infusion 
reaction or anaphylaxis.
Due to the potential risk of amplification of antigen-specific T-cell responses and exaggerated 
inflammatory response, subjects with auto-immune disorders who are at risk for flare of 
auto-immunity, as well as those with viral inf ection (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 
Hepatitis B or C) at risk for exaggerated anti-viral inflammato ry response will be excluded (see

Safety assessments will also be carried out by [CONTACT_1034]/Medic al Monitor and Investigators 
throughout the study to determine whether dose modification, ad ditional safety measures, or 
termination of the study, as pertaining to administration of BMS -986156 as monotherapy or in 
combination with nivolumab, is required at any t ime. In addition, AEs and SAEs will be reviewed 
regularly by [CONTACT_1689]/Study Director and the Pharmac ovigilance group to look for 
trends and potential safety signals. Treatment of AEs will foll ow Institutional guidelines and

BMS-986156 Monotherapy (Part A)
As of [ADDRESS_745662] been treated with BMS-[ZIP_CODE] 6 as monotherapy. 
BMS-986156 monotherapy was evaluated during dose escalation phases at 10 mg (4 subjects), 
30 mg (6 subjects), 100 mg (4 subjects), 240 mg (9 subjects), an d 800 mg (11 subjects) of 
BMS-986156. Overall, the safety profile of BMS-986156 monotherapy is manageable with the MTD not being reached at 800 mg.
There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs across the BMS-986156 dose 
levels studied. AEs were experienced by 97.1% (33/34) of subjects on monotherapy, with the most 
frequently reported AEs being nausea, vomiting, pyrexia, fatigu e, abdominal pain, constipation, 
back pain, and headache. There were no DLTs and all SAEs were a ttributed to causes other than 
the study drug with the exception of a SAE of Grade [ADDRESS_745663] at the 
800 mg dose level. All AEs leading to discontinuation are attrib uted to causes other than study 
drug. AEs for which no alternative cause besides BMS-986156 can be identified, including IRRs, 
were reported in 58.8% (20/34) of subjects with the most frequently reported AEs being nausea, pyrexia, and chills, all of which were Grade 1 or Grade 2. The 12 subjects for which no alternative cause besides BMS-986156 can be identified include:
•9 subjects at the 240 mg dose level: 3 of these subjects experien ced pyrexia
•11 subjects at the 800 mg dose level: pain, paresthesia, cough and pneumonitis in [ADDRESS_745664]; 
chills, fever, nausea and vomiting in [ADDRESS_745665]; and cases of h eadache, fever, malaise, flu like

mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab. Overall, the safety profile of BMS-986156 combination 
therapy is manageable with no MTD reached.
There was no pattern in the incidence, severity, or causality o f AEs to BMS-986156 across these 
dose levels. Adverse events were experienced by 78% (39/50) of subjects: 2 of 3 subjects on 30 mg 
BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 7 of 9 subjects at 100 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab, 20

In all 10 patients who experienced these AEs for which no alternative cause other than study drug could be identifie d, the nature of the AEs were as follows:
•2 subjects on 30 mg BMS-986156/240 mg nivolumab: pyrexia and pr uritus in [ADDRESS_745669], all Grade 1. 
•6 subjects on 100 mg BMS-986156 /nivolumab 240 mg: Grade [ADDRESS_745670] experienced a Grade 3 lung

Overall Risk/Benefit for Combination with Nivolumab 
Nivolumab has demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with a dvanced NSCLC, RCC, melanoma 
and lymphomas among other tumors and has been recently approved in the treatment of second 
line melanoma following Yervoy and BRAF inhibitors for BRAFV600  mutant positive tumors, 
and second line squamous NSCLC.[ADDRESS_745677] of these 
events resolved with immunomodulating medication (e.g. < 1% subjec ts who developed 
pneumonitis (5/ 691) treated subjects have died.121To mitigate risk from serious immune-
mediated AEs, subject management algorithms for nivolumab-relate d AEs from prior collective 
nivolumab experience have been included ( Appendix 4 ). For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety 
profile is similar across tumor types. The only exception is pu lmonary inflammation AE), which 
may be numerically greater in subjects with NSCLC, because in s ome cases, it can be difficult to 
distinguish between nivolumab-related and unrelated causes of p ulmonary symptoms and 
radiographic changes. The nonclinical findings of increased late -stage pregnancy loss and early 
infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab-exposed pregnant monkeys  
 suggest a potential risk to human pregnancy if there is contin ued treatment with nivolumab 
during pregnancy. However, nivolumab exposure during human pregnancy has not been permitted in clinical trials, and is not permitted in this protocol.
The combinatio n of nivolumab and BMS- [ADDRESS_745678] studies are ongoing and, as such, the safety profile of 
nivolumab combinations continues to evolve. Thus far, the combi nation of both agents results in 
a safety profile with similar types of AEs as either agent alon e, but in some cases with a greater 
frequency.

agent as well as combination activity with mouse s urrogates of anti-GTIR and anti-PD-1 antibodies 
has been noted in a variety of mouse tumor models (See Section 1 ). These pre-clinical results taken 
together with the emerging role of combination immunomodulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_567690]-designed clinical trials,146the lack of a safety signal in pre-clinical 
toxicology studies in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, the careful consideration for safety in study 
design, and clinical data observed to date, support the expecta tion of fa vorable benefit to risk for

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label study of BMS-[ADDRESS_745681] of dose escalation with BMS-
986156 administered as a single agent (Part A) or in combinatio n  wi th  n i v ol u m a b  (Part B )  i n  
subjects with advanced solid tumors. Starting dose selection of  BMS-986156 for Part B 
(combination with nivolumab) was determined using all available safety (clinical and laboratory), PK, and modeling recommendations within Bayesian hierarchical modeling 
framework by [CONTACT_567724]-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (data from CA209003 study, a phase 1 nivolumab monotherapy data in advanced solid tumors) and will be one dose level lower than a dose already tes ted and shown to be tolerated in 
ongoing monotherapy dose escalation in Part A
.  Subsequently, 
escalation in the 2 parts will proceed in parallel. 
A dose -1 cohort of 3 mg has also been included and will only be explored in the event 10 mg dose 
of BMS-986156 is determined to exceed the MTD in monotherapy or  in combination with 
nivolumab ( Table 3.4.1-1 ).
At no point will the dose of BMS-[ADDRESS_745682] been demonstrated previous l y  t o  b e  s a f e  i n  t h e  
monotherapy dose escalation arm (Part A), nor at any point during Part B escalation will the BMS-[ADDRESS_745683] dose determined to be tolerated in Part A. 
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks for combination dose cohorts 
(Parts B and D).  
Nivolumab will be administered as a dose of 480 mg every 4 week s for combination dose cohorts 
Part E
Part C consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 monotherapy  in 2 disease-restricted 
populations, NSCLC with progressive  or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during or after anti-
PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior platinum doublet-bas ed chemotherapy, and persistent, 
recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer , of a pproximately 40 subjects each. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in disease-restricted populations as follow:  (i) NSCLC, (ii) cervical, (iii) bladder 
cancer, (iv) squamous cell carcinoma head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (vi) HCC, of 
approximately 40 subjects each.
Part E consists of cohort expansion with BMS 986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in cervical cancer (cohort 9) and other tumor types ( Cohort 10). Each cohort will 
contain approximately 40 subjects each.  Patients who discontinu e for reasons other than disease

Subjects will complete up to 3 phases of the study:  Screening,  Treatment, and Safety follow-up,
as described below:
Screening
The screening phase will last for up to [ADDRESS_745685]’s initial eligibility and signing of the ICF. Subjects will be enrolled using the Interactive 
Voice Response System (IVRS).
Treatment Phase
The treatment phase consists of up to three 8-week treatment cycles.  In Parts A and C, each 
treatment cycle comprises 4 doses of BMS-986156 administered eve ry 2 weeks on Days 1, 15, 29, 
and 43 of the treatment cycle. In Parts B and D, each treatment  cycle comprises 4 doses of 
BMS-986156 (administered on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43) in combination with [ADDRESS_745686] 30 minutes 
after completion of the  infusion of nivolumab. In Part E, the co hort of 480 mg/480 mg each 
treatment cycle comprises 2 doses of BMS-986156 (administered o n Days 1 and 29) in 
combination with [ADDRESS_745687]  with additional cycles of study 
therapy, up to a maximum  of 13 treatment cycles, w ill be based on tumor assessment (evaluation 
performed between Days [ADDRESS_745688] dose in the next cycle). Tumor progression or response endpoints w ill be assesse d using Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) v1.1 criteria for solid tumors (Appendix 3 ). 
Treatment beyond progression may be allowed in select subjects with initial RECIST v1.1-defined 
progressive disease (PD) after discussion and agreement with th e BMS Medical Monitor that the 
benefit/risk assessment favors continued administration of stud y therapy (e.g., subjects are 
continuing to experience clinical benefit as assessed by [CONTACT_108899], tolerating treatment, and 
meeting other criteria specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Subjects with a response of unc onfirmed PD, SD, partial respons e (PR), or complete response 
(CR) at the end of a given cycle  will continue to the next treat ment cycle. Subjects will generally 
be allowed to continue study therapy until the first occurrence of either: 1) completion of the maximum number of cycles, 2) confir med PD, 3) clinical d eterioration suggesting that no further 
benefit from tr eatment is likely, 4) intolerability to therapy; or 5) the subj ect meets criteria for 
discontinuation of study therapy as outlined in protocol Section 3.11.  Individual subjects with 
confirmed CR will be given the option to discontinue study therapy on a case by [CONTACT_567725]/risk justify discontinuation of study therapy. 
3.2 Treatment with Additional Cycles Beyond 24 Weeks
All subjects  will be tr eated for 24 weeks (up to 3 cycles) of monotherapy (Parts A or C) or 
combination therapy (Parts B or D) unless criteria for st udy drug discontinuation are met earlier 
(Section 3.11). All sub jects completing approximately 24 weeks of treatment with ongoi ng disease

therapy in both monotherapy (Parts A and C) and combination the rapy (Parts B D and E) beyond 
the initial 24 weeks, on a case-by-case basis, after careful ev aluation and discussion with the BMS 
Medical Monitor to determine whether the risk/benefit ratio sup ports administration of further 
study therapy. All subjects completing approximately 48 weeks o f treatment with ongoing disease 
control (CR, PR or SD) or unconfirmed PD, may be eligible for a n additional 7 cycles of study 
therapy in combination therapy (Parts D and E) beyond the initial 48 weeks, on a case-by-case 
basis, after careful evaluation and discussion with the BMS Medical Monitor to determine whether 
the risk/benefit ratio supports administration of further study  therapy. For patients who present 
with PD for the first time at the end of cycle 6, please contact [CONTACT_225967].  Upon completion of 3 cycles of study therapy (or up to a maximu m of 13 cycles if applicable), all 
subjects will enter safety follow-up period.
3.3 Follow-up
3.3.1 Safety Follow-up
Upon completion  of 3 cycles  of study therapy (or up to a maximu m of 6 cycles if applicable), all 
subjects will enter safety follow-up period once the decision i s made to discontinue the subject 
from treatment (e.g., at end of treatment [EOT]).
For subjects that complete all scheduled cy cles of therapy, EOT visit will be the same as the last 
scheduled and completed on-treatment visit, and the start of we ek [ADDRESS_745689] recent 
on-treatment visit (with all available safety and response data)  and does not need to be repeated, 
and will be considered the start of week [ADDRESS_745690] dose of therapy. Follow-up visits should occur at Days 30, 60 and 100 ( ±7 days) after the last 
dose or coinciding with the date of discontinuation ( ±7 days) if date of discontinuation is greater 
than [ADDRESS_745691] dose to monitor for AEs. All subjects will be required to complete the 3 
clinical safety follow up visits regardless of whether they sta rt new anti-cancer therapy, except 
those subjects who withdraw consent for study participation.

3.4 Dose Escalation
3.4.1 Parts A and B
The dose-escalation phase of the study will evaluate the MTD/MA D/alternate dose(s) of 
BMS-986156 alone or in combination with nivolumab based on DLTs  using a BLRM-Copula 
model, where the BLRM is designed to guide BMS-986156 monothera py dose escalation and 
BLRM-Copula is for the dose esca lation of BMS-986156 in combination with nivolumab. The 
Bayesian model will be used for recommendation of next dose level to be investigated. BLRM

The initial dose level of BMS-986156 in Part A will be a flat dose of 10 mg as an IV infusion over 
60 minutes every 2 weeks. Expected dose levels for dose escalat ion (determined by [CONTACT_567726])147are provided in Table 3.4.1-[ADDRESS_745692] ion of BMS-986156 for Part B will be determined using data available from all 
doses evaluated in Part A, including clinical and safety laborat ory, PK,  and modeling 
recommendations within Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework by [CONTACT_567727]-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209003, a Phase 1 nivolumab monotherapy data in advanced solid tumors ); starting dose will  be one dose level lower than a 
dose already tested and shown t o be tolerated in ongoing monothe rapy dose escalation in Part A 
. A dose -1 cohort of 3 mg has been included and will only be e xplored 
in the event 10 mg dose of B MS-986156 is determined to exceed t he MTD in monotherapy or in 
combination with nivolumab (Table 3.4.1-1).
Dose levels to be considered for the next cohort will be based on evaluating three potential 
recommendations by [CONTACT_540833] (-Copula): escalate, de-escalate, or stay at same dose level. Final dose 
selectio n for next c ohort/dose level will be made in conjunction with the data avai lable on all dosed 
subjects, including clinical and laboratory safety assessments, PK,  data, w ill not allow 
escalation by [CONTACT_350498] n one dose level and will be made after d iscussion and agreement between 
Investigators and Medical Monitor. Accordingly, intermediate or  lower doses, or less frequent 
dosing of BMS-986156 may be tested if none of the planned doses /schedules is found to be 
tolerated as monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab.  Up to an additional [ADDRESS_745693] additio nal PK, and safety data to b etter 
understand any dose response relationship. Approximately 30 subjects each will be treated in each dose esc alation phases in monotherapy 
(Part A) and combination therapy (Part B).  During dose escalation phase, once a dose level has been decide d, a set of approximately 3 subjects 
will be treated a t that specified dose level. Cohort tolerab ility assessment and subsequent dose 
recommendation will occur according to BLRM (-Copula) recommendation and after at least 
[ADDRESS_745694] regarding the specific dose level does not influence the dose recommendation 
by [CONTACT_540833] (-Copula), the BLRM (-Copula) recommended next dose level may proceed without 
waiting for the 3rd subject to complete the corresponding DLT o bservation period, after discussion 
and agreement between Sponsor and Investigators.  
Subjects must be observed for a total of [ADDRESS_745695] therapy dose to be considered 
evaluable for DLT. Subjects discontinued during DLT observation period due to DLT are also 
considered as evaluable for DLT. Continuous re-assessment of dose recommendation by [CONTACT_540833] (-Copula) will also be carried out at each dose levels.
The MTD/MAD/alternate dose(s) of BMS-986156 selected for cohort expansion in Parts C and D 
will be based on evaluating the recommendation from BLRM and a synthesis of all available data, 
including clinical and laboratory safety assessments, PK,  and efficacy data, from all treated 
patients at each dose level up to the MTD/MAD.

The purpose of cohort expansion is t o gather add itional safety, tolerab ility, preliminar y efficacy, 
PK,  information regarding BMS-986156 as monotherapy or in comb ination with 
nivolumab. 
Part C consists of cohort expansions with BMS-986156 monotherap y in 2 disease-restricted 
populations: (i) NSCLC subjects with progressive or recurrent disease (per RECIST v1.1) during 
or after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy following prior platin um doublet-based chemotherapy 
and (ii) persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. 
Part D consists of cohort expansion with BMS-986156 administere d in combination with 
nivolumab in disease-restricted populations: (i) NSCLC, (ii) cer vical, (iii) bladder cancer, (iv) 
squamous cell carcinoma head and neck, (v) ovarian cancer, and (v i) HCC.

No more than 5 subjects previously found to be “rapid progressors” on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
therapy will be enrolled per cohort (see definition of “rapid pr ogressors” in Section 3.1).
Each of the cohort in cohort expansion phase will contain appro ximately 40 subjects. (Please refer 
to more details in Section 8.1.2 ).
Parts E includes two cohorts with one as cervical and another for other solid tumors for signal 
seeking and exploration of Q4W dosing respectively. Due to the pu rpose of signal confirming in 
cervical cancer and heterogeneity of response rates of the othe r solid tumors cohort (I-O 
experienced NSCLC, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, SCCHN, and H CC), approximately 40 
subjects are planned for each c ohort in part E. For in itial safety evaluation of 480 mg BMS-
986156/480 mg nivolumab Q4W 6 subjects for a safety lead-in will  be enrolled and followed for 
a minimum of two weeks (refer to Section 3.6 for the rationale for two week period) prior to 
opening full enrollment of Part E.

Continuous evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansio ns will be performed throughout 
enrollment in the expansion cohorts. If at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment-related toxicit ies 
meeting DLT criteria exceeds 33% across all subjects treated ac ross all cohorts treated within 
monotherapy and combination therapy phases at the same dose, th e findings will be discussed and 
further enrollment may be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity and after

assessing the risk/benefit ratio, a new dose(s) for all cohorts may be initiated at a previously tested 
lower dose level or at a dose level intermediate to previously tested lower dose levels.
3.6 Dose-limiting Toxicities
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be define d based on the incidence and grade 
of AEs for which no alternate cause can be identified ( Section 4.3.1 ).  The incidence of DLTs 
which occur within 4 weeks following the start of study therapy  will guide dose escalation 
decisions. AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer I nstitute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). For the purposes of subject 
management, drug-related AEs occurring at any time which meet t he DLT definition will lead to 
dose interruption a nd/or permanen t discontinuation of study drug as defined in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_745697] cycle in both Parts A and B. Subjects discontinued during DLT 
observation period due to DLT are also considered as DLT evaluable. Based on the predicted human T-HALF of BMS-986156 of 2 weeks, this interval is expected to cover the anticipated time frame for the occurrence of clinically significant immediate an d early onset AEs related to (i) 
single dose BMS-[ADDRESS_745698] combination dose wi th nivolumab and, (ii) repeat 
dosing of monotherapy BMS-[ADDRESS_745699] of an initial safety lead in period of up to 12 subjects. Six subjects need to 
complete the 14 day observation period before the full expansion cohorts, of up to 40 subjects, are
opened. Patients who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-
related toxicity may be replaced.  An observation period of 14 da y s has been chosen based on 
pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and simulation for BMS-986156, ba sed on PK parameters derived 
from preclinical studies.
In part E, BMS-986156 w ill be evalu ated at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) with 
nivolumab 480 mg Q4W.  The BMS-986156 480 mg Q4W dose is much l ower than the already 
assessed safe dose of 800 mg Q2W dose (given as monotherapy and combination with nivolumab 
240 mg Q2W). Additionally, PK predictions indicate that BMS-[ADDRESS_745700] safety monitoring in patients will continue throughout
the study.

Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate o f < 1% when used consistently and 
correctly. WOCBP and female partners of male subjects who are WOCBP are expected to use one 
of the highly effective methods of contraception (listed below) .  Local laws and regulations may 
require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods. Male subjects must inform their 
female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requirements  of the protocol and are 
expected to adhere to using contraception with their partner. Male subjects are e xpected to use a 
condom, in addition to a highly effective method as noted in the list below
1) Progestogen only hormonal contraception associated with inhib ition of ovulation
2) Hormonal methods of contraception including oral contraceptiv e pi[INVESTIGATOR_567695], vaginal ring, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs),
such as Mirena ®
4) Nonhormonal IUDs, such as ParaGard ®
5) Bilateral tubal occlusion
6) Vasectomized partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure
•Vasectomy is a highly effective birth control method provided t hat the partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the WOCBP study participant and that the vase ctomized partner has 
received medical assessment of the surgical success.
7) Intrauterine hormone-releasing system8) Complete abstinence
•Complete abstinence is defined as the complete avoidance of heterosexual intercourse (refer 
to Glossary of Terms, Section 10 )
•Complete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all st udy drugs and must be 
used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus 5 hal f-lives of the study drug(s) plus 
30 days).
•It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.
•Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified 
in Section 5.1 .
•Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event 
that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
•The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the sub ject.
9) Use a condom in male subjects with female partners.
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION 
1) Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and/or post-ovu lation methods) 
2) Withdrawal (coitus interruptus)

3.9.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as any femal e who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as  12 months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_745724] a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone, 
(FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with HRT are likely to have artificially suppre ssed FSH levels and may require a 
washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level. The duration of the washout period is 
a function of the type of HRT used. The duration of the washout period below are suggested 
guidelines and the Investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be 
considered postmenopausal. 
•1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels)
•4 week minimum for transdermal products
•8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months.

mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of  active autoimmune 
disease.
d) Herbal remedies which are not approved in writing by [CONTACT_978] 
3.10.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
It is the local imaging facility’s responsibility to determine, based on subject attributes 
(e.g., allergy history, diabetic history and renal status), the appropriate imaging modality and 
contrast regimen for each subject.  Imaging contraindications a nd contrast risks should be 
considered in this assessment.  Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether 
or not they should receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast should not be given to  subjects with severe renal 
insufficiency (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m
2) because of 
increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in this subject  population. In these patients, 
alternative imaging tests, or MRI without gadolinium should be considered. In addition, subjects 
are excluded from MRI if they have tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, etc.   
The ultimate decision to perform MRI in an individual subject i n this study rests with the site 
radiologist, the Investigator and the standard set by [CONTACT_61857].

[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation Due to Further Progression (Confirmed Progression)
Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined 
as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of init ial progression 
(including all target lesions and new measurable lesions). 
The tumor burden volume from time of initial progression should be used as the reference baseline 
for comparison with the post-progression assessment.
Any new lesion considered non-measurable at the time of initial  progression may become 
measurable and therefore must be included in the tumor burden measurement as follows:
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial pr ogression if the longest diameter is 
at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must  have a short axis of at least 
15 mm). 
For statistical analyses that include the investigator-assessed  progression date, subjects who 
continue treatment be yond initial i nvestigator-assessed, RECIST v1.1-defined progression will be 
considered to have investigator-assessed progressive disease at  the time of the initial progression

from AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab and BMS -[ADDRESS_745746] Investigators in assessing and managing the following groups 
of AEs:
•Gastrointestinal
•Renal

•Hepatic
•Endocrinopathies
•Skin
•Neurological
•The clinical nature of AEs noted with BMS-[ADDRESS_745747] study drug held. Subjec ts who are required to 
permanently discontinue both study drugs are listed in Section 4.3.6 . In addition, all 
Grade 2 hepatic, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, and neurolog ical AEs should be evaluated and 
managed per the toxicity management algorithms (Appendix 4). Su bjects not meeting guidelines 
for permanent discontinuation w ill be permitted to resume therapy based on the criteria sp ecified 
below in Section 4.3.[ADDRESS_745748] received study medication dose.
In Parts A and C, if there is a delay in dosing of BMS- 986156 of between 1 -12 days, the procedures 
at the original scheduled visit should be performed as soon as possible. If the delay is more than

4.3.5 Criteria to Resume Treatment
Subsequent dosing with study therapy may resume once drug-relat ed non -DLT A Es resolve to 
Grade 1 or baseline. 
Subjects experiencing AEs not meeting criteria for permanent di scontinuation as outlined in 
Section 4.3.6 may resume treatment with study medication under the following criteria:
•Subjects may resume treatment with study drug when the drug-rel ated AE(s) resolve to Grade 
d1 or baseline value with the following exceptions:
Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigu e;
Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatment 
in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity;
Subjects with Grade 2 uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision not  meeting DLT criteria 
(Section 4.3.1 ) must resolve to baseline prior to resuming study therapy;
Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline before treatment is resumed;
Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only p hysiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment.
If the cr iteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next scheduled 
time point per protocol.
The consideration to re-init iate study therapy under these exceptions will be made on a cas e by

4.3.6 Guidelines for Permanent Discontinuation
Subjects will be required to permanently discontinue both study drugs for the following AEs:
•Any drug related AE occurring at any time that meets DLT criteria as outlined in Sectio n 4.3.1
will require permanent discontinuation with the following exceptions :
a) Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain that re turns to grade 1 or baseline 
within 3 days with med ical intervention;
b) Grade 3 pruritus or rash that r eturns to grade 1 or baseline within 7 days or baseline with 
medical intervention;
c) Grade 4 electrolyte abnormalities that d72 hours in duration;
d) Grade 4 neutropenia d5 days in duration;
e) Grade 4 increase in amylase or lipase that is not associated with clinical or radiographic 
evidence of pancreatitis;
f) Grade 4 lymphopenia d5 days in duration.
•Any dosing delay lasting > 6 weeks will be cause for permanent discontinuation. Extensions 
to the period of dose delays may be granted for individual subj ects on a case by [CONTACT_567734] d BMS Medical Monitor in 
settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study therapy  (e.g., subject deriving clinical 
benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper for management of n on-DLT irAEs, or
experiences delays for management of a non-drug-related AE). 
•Accordingly, dosing delays to allow for prolonged steroid tapers  to manage drug-related AEs 
are allowed. Additionally, dosing delays > 6 weeks that occur f or non-drug-related reasons 
may be allowed if approved by [CONTACT_102440]. 
•Prior to re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing del ay lasting > [ADDRESS_745751] be consulted. 
•Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosin g is delayed.
All subjects who discontinue IP should comply with protocol specified follow-up procedures as 
outlined in Section 3.3. The only exception to this requirement is when a subject with draws consent 
for all study proce dures including post-treatment study follow-up or loses the abi lity to consent

premedications are recommended for future infus ions: diphenhydr amine 50 mg (or equivalent) 
and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol [ADDRESS_745753] 30 minutes before a dditional study 
drug administrations.For Grade 2 symptoms: Moderate reaction requires ther apy or infusion interruption but responds 
promptly to symptomatic treatmen t [e.g., antihistamines, non-st eroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic medications indicated for d24 
hours.
•Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusi on of norm al saline, and treat the subject with 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325  to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); monitor subject until resolution of symptoms.
•Bronchodilator or corticosteroid therapy may also be administer ed as appropriate.
•The infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original i nfusion r ate when symptoms resolve; if 
no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% of the 
original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely.
•The amount of study drug infused must be recorded on the CRF.
•If symptoms recur, then no further nivolumab, as the case may be,  will be administered at that 
visit.
•The following prophylactic premedications are recommended for f uture infusions: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. If 
necessary, corticosteroids (up to 25 mg of Solu Cortef or equiva lent) may be used.
Late-occurring symptoms: In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms 
(e.g., appearance of a localized or generalized pruritus within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic 
treatment may be given (eg, oral antihistamine, or corticostero ids).

unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), sympt om, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considere d related to the study drug.
The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physic ian and should be used to assess all 
AE. The causal relationship can be one of the following:
•Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between stud y drug administration and the 
AE.
•Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship betw een study drug administration 
and the AE. 
The term “reasonable causal relationship” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended  questioning, examination, or 
evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent r eporting bias, subjects should not be questioned 
regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.[ADDRESS_745791] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
•results in death
•is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
•requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see NOTE

•results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
•is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately 
life-threatening or may not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate 
medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention

above; examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Potential drug-induced liver injury (pDILI) is also considered 
an important medical event (see Section 6.6 for the definition of potential pDILI).
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic o r nonpathogenic) via the study d rug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and pDILI are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], 
these events must be handled as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
8.1.1 Dose Escalation
As a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial, the sample size at each dose in these arms depends on observed 
toxicity and posterior inference. A pproximately 60 subjects are expected to be treated during the 
dose-escalation phase (around 30 subjects for BMS-986156 monotherapy and around 30 subjects for BMS-986156 in combination with nivolumab). Initially approx imately 3 subjects will be 
treated at the starting dose levels of BMS-986156 or BMS-986156  in combination with nivolumab. 
Additional subjects will be treated in recommended dose levels per BLRM (-Copula) during the 
dose-escalation phase. At most 12 DLT-evaluable subjects will be  treated at each dose level.
Additional subjects may be treated at any dose level at or belo w the MTD or MAD (if no MTD is 
identified) for further evaluation of safety, PK parameters as r equired. At most 12 
DLT-evaluable subjects will be treated at each dose level.
8.1.2 Cohort Expansion
Part C contains 2 cohorts of 25 subjects each in monotherapy cohort expansion,. Each cohort in 
the combination cohort expansion phase (parts D and E) will con tain approximately 40 subjects. 
Forty subjects in parts D and E are planned with the goal of ac hieving a width of approximately 
20% in the 95% confidence interval for ORR, and to provide addi tional information on safety. 
Patients in any cohort who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression, death, or treatment-related toxicit y may be replaced.  
For initial safety evaluation of 480 mg BMS-986156/480 mg nivol umab Q4W in Part E, 6 subjects 
will be enrolled and followed for a minimum of 2 weeks (please refer to Section 3.6 for the 
rationale for 2 week period) prior to opening Part E to full enrollment. 
If in a cohort of 40 subjects, 10 or 15 responses are observed, then the lower limit of the one-sided 
90% CI for the ORR would be 16%, and 27% respectively. These calculations are made using the 
Clopper-Pearson method for exact confidence intervals. If the t rue ORR in a tumor type is 40%, 
then with 40 subjects there is 93% chance of observing at least 12 responses, and 87% chance of observing at least 13 responses, and there is 7% chance of observing 11 or fewer responses.

Continuous interim evaluations and monitoring of safety and efficacy based on the totality of data 
will be carried out throughout the expansion phase. Decisions r egarding continuing enrollment 
based on these evaluations will be made through discussion between the Sponsor and investigators based on totality of data and overall clinical activity (such as  but not limited to duration of 
response, quality of response, clinical assessment of response a nd/or SD and safety). The number 
of subjects receiving treatment of t he planned sample size is ap proximate and may exceed the 
specified numbers due to unknown time to response and true recr uitment rate (i.e additional
participants may be enrolled to compensate the 25%-35% of the screening failure rate in 
combination with the non response evaluable rate to account for par ticipants who may drop out
of the study without being evaluable for response and/or true recruitment rate is much higher 
than anticipated and thus, Sponsor will examine on the totality  of data to determine the benefit/risk 
ratio as well as overall clinical activity when making the final Go/no Go decision.

The BLRM will be fitted on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) data  collected within the 28-day DLT

1.2 Prior Specification for BMS-986156 Monotherapy
The Bayesian approach requires the specification of prior distr ibutions for model parameters which 
include parameters ( ߙଵ, ߚଵ) for BMS-986156. The prior distributions for this single agent  activity 
were derived using the meta-analytic-predictive (MAP)3approach based on CD137 agonist 
(BMS-663513) dose- DLT data.
Derivation of prior distribution of these parameters is provide d in the following subsections.
1.2.1 Prior Derivation for BMS-986156 Parameters ( ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢻ૚ሻ,ࢍ࢕࢒ሺࢼ ૚ሻ)
A mixture prior will be used for param eters (ߙଵ, ߚଵ) for BMS-986156. There are two bivariate 
normal components in generating this mixture prior:
•MAP component: Obtained from the dose-DLT data from CD137 agoni st (st udy CA 186001 
and study CA186006) using the MAP approach. 
•Weakly informative component: Reflecting the potential of differ ent toxicity of BMS-986156 
and allowing for considerable prior uncertainty.

2.1 Methodology Description for Combination therapy
Toxicity profiles of both BMS-986156 monotherapy and nivolumab m onotherapy will be 
incorporated to develop the combination model framework. A copu la-type model will be used to 
cover all general combination cases, including additive and syn ergistic effects. The combination 
of the 2 treatments w ill be explored using a Bayesian hierarchic al model by [CONTACT_567756]-986156 (Part A) and nivolumab (CA209-003, Ph ase 1 nivolumab

The joint toxicity framework models the toxicity rates of both agents as well as their interaction 
effects in a 7-parameter hierarchical model, where each monother apy dose-toxicity relationship 
will be characterized by a 2-param eter BLRM model (see Section 1.1 ). There are 3 additional 
parameters for the copula-type model, one for each agent ( mand n) as well as one for the 
interaction term ( ߛଵ). A dose-toxicity surface will be characterized for different dose combinations 
of these 2 agents. 
As there are currently neither historical data nor prior knowled ge to indicate how much 
information is to be borrowed for each of the single agents, pa rameters mand nare both set to be 
1, meaning borrowing 100% of the information from the 2 agents.  The above formula is then 
simplified into a 5-parameter model as follows:

.
Since only a fixed nivolumab dose (240 mg) will be used in the BMS-986156 and nivolumab 
combination arm, this surface will be simplified into a 2-dimen sional dose-toxicity curve. 
Posteriors for the corresponding 5 parameters (2 logistic regression parameters [ ߙଵ,ߚଵ] for BMS-
986156 and 2 logistic regression parameters [ ߙଶ,ߚଶ] for nivolumab, as well as 1 interaction

described theoretical setup.2.2 Prior Specification for Combination Studies

Posterior information on log(

Although no PK drug-drug interaction is expected, the possibili ty of a significant positive 
interaction between BMS-986156 and nivolumab cannot be totally e xcluded. The interaction 
parameter ɀଵwas chosen accordingly but with a degree of uncertainty in orde r to allow for the 
possibility that the interaction may be positive or negative. T herefore, the following assumptions 
are made for the interaction parameter:
•ɀଵfollows a gamma distribution and with a mean centered at 1.1, w hich means the combination 
of [ADDRESS_745833].
•The standard deviation of Ȗ1is 0.8, such that there is a 45% prior probability that ߛis larger

This model assigns the highest probability to there being small  synergistic interaction and also 
allows for the potential of larger synergism of the toxic profiles. It also does not completely ignore

3 DECISION RULE FOR DOSE ESCALATION AND SIMULATION
3.1 Parameters for Dose Recommendation Decision for the Monotherapy  
and Combination Therapy
In Parts A and B, the BLRM and BLRM-Copula models w ill be utilized for dose recommendations 
after DLT information becomes available for each dose cohort an d each dose level. Final dose 
selection for the next dose cohort w ill be based on BLRM (- Copula) dose recommendations in 
combination with the totality of d ata available on all dosed subjects , after discussion and agree ment 
between investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor.
The Bayesian Logistic Regression Method (BLRM) with an overdose  control principle (escalation 
with overdose control [EWOC]) was selected as an appropriate de sign for the dose escalation parts 
of this study for the monotherapy setting. For the combination s etting, the BLRM-Copula model, 
which is an extension of the BLRM design, will be utilized.  BL RM (-Copula) is similar to the 
rule-based method (ie, 3 + 3 des ign) in that th e cohort size is  approximately [ADDRESS_745834] cohort and the toxicity boundaries are set at a minimum  16% (~ 1 in 6) dose- limiting 
toxicity (DLT) rate and a maximum 33% (~ 1 in 3) DLT rate. These  boundaries were chosen in 
order to target a dose that has meaningful activity but not unacceptably high toxicity. A minimum 
16% DLT rate ensures that the model does not guide to use of too low a dose and sacrifice 
opportunity for benefit without meaningful improvement in safet y. The 33% maximum is chosen 
as this would be the maximum DLT rate where a positive benefit/ r i s k  r a t i o  i s  l i k e l y  t o  b e  
demonstrated.
Compared with the rule-based method, when recommending the next dose level, BLRM offers 
more accuracy and efficiency in determining the true MTD by [CONTACT_567757]-study DLT data. The BLRM model also quantifies the benefit and risk during the dose 
level decision making process. When DLT data are incorporated i nto the model, the distribution 
of predicted DLT rates (based on posterior estimation) for a sp ecific dose level will be updated 
accordingly. The predicted DLT rates will be categorized according to the following 3 categories: 
•“under-dosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between 0% and up to 16%
•“target dosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between over 16 % and up to 33%
•“overdosing” defined as a predicted DLT rate between over 33% a nd 100% 
Following the principle of EWOC, after DLT information is obtai ned from each cohort, the 
candidate doses are those with less than 25% chance of excessiv e toxicity for monotherapy and
with less than 35% chance of excessive toxicity for combination th e r a p i es . T h e s e  t w o  E W O C  
cutoffs are selected after examining various cutoffs in simulation studies by [CONTACT_567758]. Only th e candidate dos es will be 
considered for dose decision by [CONTACT_567759].

For dose expansion, the final recommended maximum tolerated dose  (MTD)/recommended Phase 
2 dose (RP2D) of BMS-986156 alone and in combination with nivolu mab will be based on the 
recommendation from the BLRM (-Copula) model and a synthesis of all the data available on all 
dosed subjects, including clinical and laboratory safety assess ments, PK  
data, and efficacy data from all  treated patients at each dose level MTD/RP2D.
To examine the operating characteristics of BLRM (-Copula) method , simulations for 
BMS-986156 alone and in combination with nivolumab were conducted. Simulation details are shown in the following sections.
3.2 BLRM (-Copula) Dose Escalation Recommendation Rules and Tool s
Recommendations for the next dose level will be provided by [CONTACT_540833] (-Copula) models 
(considering available DLT information) together with the follo wing dose escalation rules for 
BMS-986156 alone and in combi nation wit h nivolumab:
•Dose levels for the next cohort w ill be based on evaluating 4 potential recommendations: 
escalate, de-escalate, stay at same dose level, or stop and sel ect a new dose other than pre-
specified doses.
•Escalation by [CONTACT_726] 1 dose level (dose skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) is not per mitted in real trial conduction. 
•Based on model suggestions and a review of the available safety , PK, and PD data in 
combination with clinical recommendation, lower doses of BMS-98 6156 may be tested if none 
of the planned doses are found to be tolerated as monotherapy o r in combination with 
nivolumab. Such decisions will be made after discussion and agr eement between the 
investigators and the BMS Medical Monitor.
•No intra-subject dose escalation of BMS-986156 is allowed at an y dose level.
•Dose de-escalation can be recommended by [CONTACT_10994], and the fin al decision will be made 
based on clinical recommendation.
BLRM Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_567706] 
•If all of the c urrent pre-specified doses are considered intolerable according  to the pre-specified 
cutoff, then the model will recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_567707] a new dose level 
lower than the current lowest dose level will need to be identi fied (EWOC stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). 
•The maximum number of subjects in a dose level will be 12. This  limit is set to avoid instances 
in which the model could recommend adding subjects indefinitely  to a specific dose level due 
to uncertainty in the tolerability profile. 
•If, for a specific dose level, [ADDRESS_745835] been treated and  the chance of determining that 
dose level to be the “target” dose is > 50%, then the model wil l suggest to stop the arm and 
declare the current dose level to be MTD.

4 INTERIM MONITORING CASE STUDY TO ILLUSTRATE BLRM (-COPULA)
PROVISION OF RECOMMENDATIONS DURING DOSE ESCALATION
In order to provide a comprehensive view of the dynamics of the  models, different hypothetical 
scenarios exploring all possibilities are examined. For the sim plicity of illustration purposes, a 
static cohort size of 3 subjects is applied for dose levels 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg and 240 mg in the 
BMS-986156 monotherapy and for the dose level 30 mg in the combination setting. This cohort 
size could vary during the actual clinical trial, and the BLRM (-Copula) models are designed t o fit 
various different cohort sizes, adaptively. In general, there are 4 possible scenarios for a specific dose level, which are 0 DLT observed in 3 total subjects in that cohort (denoted as 0/3), 1 DLT 
observed in 3 subjects (1/3), 2 DLTs observed in 3 subjects (2/ 3), and 3 DLTs observed in 3 
subjects (3/3).
During interim monitoring, posterior probabilities will be updated when there is new DLT 
information available. The following three visualization plots will be produced to reflect the real 
time dose-DLT relationship, to quantify benefit (in the form of  target dosing) and risk (in the form

of overdosing and underdosing) during model’s recommendation process, and to facilitate clinical 
team’s interpretation of the model recommendations for the fina l decision making:
•Dose-DLT profile for the doses ranging between 0 mg and 1000 mg (Figure 1).
•Stacking histograms displaying predictive probabilities on DLT rates classified into 3 different 
categories (Underdosing, Target dosing and Overdosing) ( Figure 2).
•Box plots summarizing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sample s of predicted DLT 
rates for the 5 pre-specified dose levels ( Figure 3).
Figure 1: Updated dose-DLT profile after incorporating prior information and 
all previous DLT information up to 30 mg (in cluding all monotherapy 
DLT data for BMS-986156 up to 100 mg)
Interpretation and usage of Figure 1:
Figure 1 is a snapshot of an updated dose-DLT profile with DLT information available at dose 
level 30 mg for combination studies. The dose-DLT profile is capt ured with a continuous dose 
spectrum ranging from 0 mg to 1000 mg, which is a slice of the do se-DLT surface of the 
combination of two drugs with Nivolumab fixed at 240mg. For eac h dose within the range, there 
is a corresponding distribution of the predicted DLT rates calculated from the posterior samples of 
the model parameters. This figure will be updated each time new DLT information becomes 
available from the combination studies. Similar graphs will also be produced for the BMS-986156 
monotherapy.
In Figure 1, there are 3 different quantiles (2.5%, 50%, and 97 .5%) plotted to characterize the 
current trend of the toxicity profile (as shown by [CONTACT_941] 50% quan tile), as well as the variation of the 
dose-DLT profile (as shown by [CONTACT_941] 2.5% percentile and the 97.5%  percentile), according to the 
accumulation of DLT data from all previous and c urrent dose levels. The toxicity boundaries 
(0.16 and 0.33) are illustrated in two dotted horizontal lines t o benchmark the way in which the 
dose-DLT profile is trending. 
Intermediate dose levels can be identified using different boundary cutoffs. For example, using the 
50% percentile curve (green highlight), which represents the ne arly average DLT distribution for 
each dose level, the 50 mg could be a potential intermediate dose level corresponding to the lower

pre-specified DLT rate boundary of  0.16, and the 375 mg could be  a fitted MTD dose level 
associated with the upper boundary of 0.33. 
Moreover, if all of the current pre-specified doses are conside red intolerable (overdosing 
probabilities > 0.35 for combination therapy, a case not shown o n the current Figure 1), the model 
will recommend to stop the current dose level, and the clinical  team can leverage the current 
updated dose-DLT curve to pi[INVESTIGATOR_263097] a new dose, which is lower t han pre-specified lowest dose 
(10 mg) by [CONTACT_499872].
Figure 2: Updated stacking histogram after incorporating prior information 
and all previous DLT information up to 30 mg (including all 
monotherapy DLT data up to 100 mg for BMS-986156) to classify 
predicted DLT rates into 3 categories (Underdosing, Target Dosing 
and Overdosing)
Interpretation and usage of Figure 2:
Figure [ADDRESS_745836] exc lude doses that are intolerable 
(with overdosing probabilities > 35%, the rate that has been spe cified for BMS-986156 in 
combination with nivolumab). Among those qualified candidate do ses that are considered 
“tolerable”, the model will select the dose that maximizes the probability of being within the target 
toxicity range (DLT rate of 16% up to 33%). 
As illustrated in Figure 2, when there is [ADDRESS_745837], dose levels of 240 mg and 800 mg for BMS-986156 are excluded 
according to the higher-than-cutoff (0.35 for combination thera py) overdosing probabilities (0.384
for 240mg and 0.595 for 800mg). Among the remainder of tolerable dose levels (10 mg, 30 mg, and 100 mg), the BLRM-C opula model recommends the dose that maxi mizes the probability of 
being within the target dosing interval. Therefore, the model’s  recommendation would be to

compared with that of 30 mg (0.295) and 10 mg (0.263).
Similarly (although not shown on Figure 2 ), according to the rules specified above, the model 
could possibly recommend to de-escalate to a lower dose level t han current treated dose level, 
extend the current dose level, or even recommend to stop and id entify a new dose level lower than 
10mg, the lowest pre-specified dose level. Please refer to description of Figure 1 for details on 
how to specify the new dose levels.

previous DLT information up to 30 mg in combination setting

Interpretation and usage of Figure 3:
Figure 3 is a snapshot with DLT information available at dose l evel 30 mg for the combination 
setting. The dose-DLT distributions calculated from the posterior samples of the model parameters 
are characterized in the format of boxplots for the pre-sp ecified dose levels. This figure will be 
updated each time there is new DLT information available.  Simi lar graphs will also be produced 
for the BMS-986156 monotherapy.
This plot supplements the information provided in Figure 1. It allows for a more in-depth and 
focused visualization of general trend of dose-DLT relationship , a s  w e l l  a s  th e  m a gn i tu d e  and 
variability in the DLT rates for each pre-specified dose level.

lymph node must be t15 mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline a nd in follow-up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.
1.2 Non-measurable lesions
•All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with t10 to < 15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesi ons.  
•Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningea l disease, ascites, pleural 
or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangi tic involvement of skin or 
lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_567761].  
1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.

•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components , 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_567762] h as CT or MRI can be 
considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of 
measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic lesions
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined sim ple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-mea surable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described  above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in a n area subjected to other 
loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable un less there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion. 
1.4 Specifications by [CONTACT_12009]
1.4.1 Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). Al l baseline evaluations should 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and ne ver more than 30 days before the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used  to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up . Imaging based evaluation should 
always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesi on(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
[IP_ADDRESS] CT/MRI scan 
CT/MRI is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability of lesions on CT/MRI scan is  based on the assumption that 
CT/MRI slice thickness is [ADDRESS_745845] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the sl ice thickness.
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest X-ray 
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly when progr ession is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly in identify ing new lesions. However, lesions 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_745846] X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly  defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776].
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and t10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesio ns, documentation by [CONTACT_30575] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_51752] , imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Ultrasound 
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a  method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_567763], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluat ion is not advised.
2 BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF ‘TARGET’ AND ‘NON-TARGET’ 
LESIONS
2.1 Target lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline all  lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be recorded and measured at baseline. 
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselv es to reproducible repeated
measurements .
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) f or all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters .If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize  any objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
2.1.[ADDRESS_745847] a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathologi cal and should not be 
recorded or followed.

2.2 Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) includi ng pathological lymph nodes s hould be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not r equired and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesio ns involving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple e nlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20% , the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm . (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify f or PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
3.1.1 Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomic al structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathological n odes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
tt15 mm by [CONTACT_3610] . Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathologi cal and should not be 
recorded or followed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’  
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should h ave their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e g, 2 mm). If the radi ol ogist i s 
able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded,  even if it is below [ADDRESS_745848] measure to then:
•If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_567708], the measurement 
should be recorded as 0 mm.

Date: 08-Mar-2019 178
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
•If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but  too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case of a lymph node believed to be present and 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm s hould be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_745849] slice thickness 
(but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
•When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the  fragmented portions 
should be added together to calculate the target lesion sum. 
•As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained tha t would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the  lesions have truly 
coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of  the longest diameter in this 
instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’.
3.2 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
While some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points  specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesion s. All lymph nodes must be 
non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s)  above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. ( Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special notes on assessment of non-target lesions
The concept of progression of non-target disease requires addit ional explanation as follows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject also has measurable disease
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-ta rget disease, there must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease  such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to 
quality for unequivocal progression status. 
[IP_ADDRESS] When the subject has only non-measurable disease 
•To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non-ta rget disease, there must be 
an overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. 
•A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is usually not sufficient to 
qualify for unequivocal progression status. 
•Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quanti fied (by [CONTACT_108]: if all 
lesions are non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied w hen assessing subjects for 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-2019 179
Approved 8.0 v Approved 1.0 v
Clinical Protocol CA009002
BMS-986156 anti-gitr
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measura ble disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in 
a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural  effusion from ‘trace’ to 
‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in th erapy’. 
•If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the subject should be con sidered to have had overall 
PD at that point. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor responses. If markers a re initially 
above the upper normal limit, howev er, they mus t normalize in o rder for a subject to be 
considered as having attained a complete response. 
3.3 New lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progres sion. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differenc es in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modality or findings thought to represent something oth er than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-ex isting lesions). This is 
particularly important when the subject’s baseline lesions show  partial or complete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, 
which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical lo cation that was notscanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease p rogression. An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain scan 
ordered which reveals metastases. The subject’s brain metastase s are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new di sease. If repeat scans confirm there 
is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
3.3.[ADDRESS_745850] 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘n ew’ disease). New lesions on the 
basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the fol lowing algorithm: 
•Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion. 
•No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:

If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up c orresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by 
[CONTACT_4654], this is PD. 
If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial positive 
FDG-PET scan).
If the positive FDG-PET at follo w-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.

assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can 
be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion( s) would not have changed the 
assigned time point response.
4.1.1 Confirmation Scans 
• Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required at least [ADDRESS_745852] overall response: All timepoints
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is  the best 
response recorded from the start of the study tr eatment until the date of  objectively documented 
progression based on RECIST v1.1, taking into account any requi rement for confirmation, or the 
date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first i n the study. The subject’s best 
overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both  target and non-target disease and 
will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions . 
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criter ia for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally 4  weeks later). 
In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpre ted as specified in Table 4.2-1.
When SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the proto col specified  minimum time 
from baseline. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at le ast once after study entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6–8 weeks) that is defined in the study protocol.

Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomizatio n) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum  on 
study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).
CR (Complete Remission)
The designation of CR requires the following:
1. Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of  disease and disease-related 
symptoms, if present before therapy.
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lympho ma: in p atients with no 
pretreatment positron emission tomography (PET) scan or when the PET scan was 
Revised Protocol No.: 05
Date: 08-Mar-[ADDRESS_745854]-treatment residual mass of any size is permitted as long as 
it is PET negative.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph  nodes and nodal masses 
must have regressed on computed tomography (CT) scan to normal size ( d1.[ADDRESS_745855] transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 cm before therapy).  Previously involved 
nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.[ADDRESS_745856] decreased to d1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
2. The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therap y on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical exam ination and should be 
considered normal size by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related t o lymphoma should 
disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not  always reliable because a 
spleen considered normal in s ize may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged s pleen 
may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hem atopoietic growth factors, or 
causes other than lymphoma.
3. If the bone marrow was involv ed by [CONTACT_22679],  the infiltrate must have 
cleared on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on whic h this determination is 
made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core).  If the sample is 
indeterminate by  [CONTACT_5293], it s hould be negative by [CONTACT_127889]. A sample that 
is negative by [CONTACT_567764] a small pop ulation of clonal 
lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a CR until dat a become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designation of PR requires all of the following:
1. At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diame ters (SPD) of up to [ADDRESS_745857] dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses s hould be selected according 
to all of the following: they s hould be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular 
dimensions; if possible they s hould be from disparate regi ons of the body; and they s hould 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved.
2. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3. Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by t50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the 
greatest transverse diameter.
4. With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually 
assessable and no measurable disease should be present.
5. Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a P R, if the sample was positive 
before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large-cell 
lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a C R by [CONTACT_20525]. 
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical  CR was achieved but with 
no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be c onsidered partial responders.
6. No new sites of disease should be observed.

7. FDG:
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20357]-avid lymphoma: for patients with no pretreatmen t PET scan or if the PET 
scan was positive before thera py, the post-treatment PET should  be positive in at least 
1 previously involved site.
b) Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients  without a 
pretreatment PET scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be 
used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or mantle-cell lymph oma, a PET scan is only 
indicated wit h [ADDRESS_745858] regressed by > 50% on CT; those

considered partial responders.
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the following:
1. A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to at tain the criteria needed for a CR 
or PR but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see R elapsed Disease 
[after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_20358]-avid lymphomas: the PET should be positive at p rior sites of disease with no 
new areas of involvement on the post-treatment CT or PET scan.
3. Variably FDG-avid lymphomas/FDG-avidity unknown: for patients without a pretreatment 
PET scan or if the pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the 
previous lesions on the post-treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
Lymph nodes s hould be considered abnormal if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it shou ld only be considered abnormal if 
its short axis is > 1.0. Lymph nodes d1.0 x d1.0 cm will not be considered abnormal for relapse 
or progressive disease.
1. Appearance of any new lesion > 1.[ADDRESS_745859] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (eg, splenic  or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered PD, a lymph node wit h a diameter of the short axis o f < 1.[ADDRESS_745860] increase by 
t50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.[ADDRESS_745861] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single  previously identified node 
> 1 cm in its short axis.

4. Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_20359]-avid lymphoma or the lesion 
was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current 
PET systems (< 1.[ADDRESS_745862]).
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner si milar to that for nodal disease. 
For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disea se. Disease that is only 
assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, 
while an a bnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_567765], it is found to be 
histologically negative.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majorit y of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary or appropriate for use (eg, a trial in pat ients with MALT lymphoma), 
response should be assessed as above, but only using CT scans. H owever, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

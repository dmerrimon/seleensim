MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691326] disease (GVHD) is a progressive and lethal complication of hematopoietic 
stromal cell transplantation (HSCT) and donor leukocyte infusion.  Two clinically distinct forms 
of GVHD have been described; acute GVHD, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306]
y occurs within [ADDRESS_691327],1 
and chronic GVHD, which is characterized by [CONTACT_532448].2  However, this arbitrary temporal 
distinction between the acute and chronic forms of GVHD has been largely discarded with the 
recognition of these forms as discrete pathophysiologic conditions defin ed by [CONTACT_532449] .3,4 
 
Occurrence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) after allogeneic transplantation is fairly common, with 
Grades II to IV aGVHD reported in approximately 39% of cases involving sibling donors and 
59% of cases with unrelated donors.5  Overall, an estimated 20% to 80% of patients who receive 
a
llogeneic HSCT develop acute GVHD, even after prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents.6  
 
W
hile aGVHD is common among patients with allogeneic transplantation, overall, it is a rare 
disease, affecting about 10,000 individuals per year worldwide, with an estimated 2,000 cases 
found in children (Table 1 ).  Approximately 5,500 of worldwide aGVHD cases are refractory to 
ster
oid,1 of which 1,000-1,200 are pediatric cases.

In aGvHD, alloreactive T cells present in the donor cell transplant recognize the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
tissues as foreign and mount an immunological attack, causing inflammation and tissue damage 
primarily affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, skin, and liver .7  Human leukocyte antigen 
(H
LA) disparity between HSC donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_532429], causing donor 
T cells to recognize recipi[INVESTIGATOR_532430] .7.  The severity of the disease is associated with 
the de
gree of HLA mismatch between the donor and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], and a greater mismatch will 
result in more aggressive alloreactivity. [ADDRESS_691328] 
c
onditioning regimen (irradiation or chemo-ablation) creates a cellular
 and molecular 
environment that is conducive to GVHD. The tissue damage leads to the increased secretion of 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691329]  
 proinflammatory cytokines, which promote donor T cell proliferation and differentiation and 
interaction with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_175616]. Alloreactive donor T c
ells traffic to target 
tissues (skin, gut, liver) and release soluble mediators that mediate cytotoxicity and end organ 
damage. Other donor immune cells, including natural killer cells, neutrophils and monocytes, 
are 
also activated and recruited to target organs and contribute to host tissue destruction .9  This 
adverse immune reaction increases over time as the expanding tissue damage mediated by 
[CONTACT_532450].  A vicious cycle ensues: 
amplification of cytokine expression supports further proliferation and activa
tion of alloreactive 
immune cells, which in turn leads to further tissue damage .7. Consequently, aGVHD potentially 
invol
ves multiple organ systems, with varying degrees of clinical severity. 
 
Acute GVHD primarily affects the skin, the liver, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, though the 
GVHD reaction targets a number of different host cells, including those of the skin epi[INVESTIGATOR_532431], hair follicles, intestinal crypts, liver bile ducts, bone marrow, and immune system.1,[ADDRESS_691330] commonly affected organ after skin; symptoms of liver involvement include jaundice and 
increased alkaline phosphatase levels that indicate damage to the bile canaliculi and portend 
cholestasis.  The GI tract is the third organ among the tissues most commonly affected in acute 
GVHD, frequently presenting as nausea, vomiting, intestinal bleeding, cra
mpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and diarrhea. 
GI involvement is often the most severe of the organs affected and can be the most difficult to 
treat.  The large volumes of watery diarrhea common to intestinal involvement in acute GVHD 
often transitions into bloody diarrhea that prompt the need for frequent transfusions.[ADDRESS_691331]-line corticosteroid treatment, 
steroids achieve complete response rates in only approximately 50% of cases.13  Many aGVHD 
patients display inadequate response to corticosteroid, with approximately 10% to 30% of 
aGVHD
 patients progressing to the more severe Glucksberg Grades III or IV GVHD.[ADDRESS_691332] severe forms of 
aGVHD (IBMTR Grades C and D) is dismal, primarily because of 
greater risk for infectious 
complications, immunosuppression- mediated toxicity, and often incomplete GVHD remission.[ADDRESS_691333] 5% 
to 30%.6,8,15-19  A wide  variety of second-line immunosuppressive agents are commonly used to 
treat steroid-refractory aGVHD (SR-aGVHD), though there is little evidence to support the 
efficacy of these drugs as secondary therapy for aGVHD .6

MSCs have
 bee
n shown to attenuate inflammatory and immunological processes relevant t
o 
GVHD. MSCs demonstrate immunosuppressive activity in T cell-driven immune responses in 
animal models of allogenic skin graft rejection and GVHD .33,34,35  In vitro , MSCs suppress T-cell 
proliferation in response to allo-antigenic and mitogenic stimulation, and stimulate an increase in 
the regulatory T cell (Treg) population. 36,37,[ADDRESS_691335] that Tregs play an important role in 
inhi
biting allogeneic T cell response and aGVHD.6,7  In co-cult
ure systems, MSCs alter the 
cytokine secretion prof
ile of immune cells (dendritic cells, naïve and e
ffector T cells, natural 
killer cells), decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IFNγ, TNFα) and 
increasing secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-4, IL-10) .[ADDRESS_691336] of adverse events (AEs) possibly or probably related to remestemcel-L use is found in the 
Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) and in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 Section 1.7.8.   All AEs were 
events commonly expected in the treated population, independent of the infusions of hMSCs.  
The
 most common adverse events observed for remestemcel-L in clinical trials of pediatric 
GVHD were infections, gastrointestinal disorders, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders. 
 
Due to the known immune modulating effects of hMSCs, there is a risk of immune suppression 
and increased infection risk.  Subjects undergoing treatment for GVHD are typi[INVESTIGATOR_532432].  Treatment with remestemcel-L may lead to further immunosuppression.  
Therefore, the potential exists for an increased risk of infectious complications.  Careful subject 
moni
toring and appropriate anti-infective prophylaxis is recommended. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
In theory, cells grown and expanded outside the body have the potential to be contaminated, and 
infection could be introduced to the subject at the time of infusion.  This risk is made negligible

6. S TUDY PROCEDURE 
6.1 Visit Schedule and Assessments 
Table 6 lists all planned assessments, which are marked with an “X” when the visits are 
performed.  Subjects should be
 seen for a
ll visits on the designated day or at a time that is as 
close as possible to the designated day.  The study assessment schedule in Table 6 outlines all 
procedures to be performe
d on subjects at the scheduled visits.   
 
In order to minimize variability in evaluations, ideally, the same individuals should perform the 
same tests on all the subjects at a
 given trial site. 
The following assessments and procedures will
 be performed at study visits: 
 I nformed consent.  Subject may be consented on MSB-GVHD002 simultaneously when 
being provided with the MSB-GVHD001 consent, or at any visit up through Day 180 (± 
7 days). If the IRB/EC
 has not yet approved the consent for MSB-GVHD002 at Day 100 
(MSB-GVHD001), the Investigator should make all efforts to have the IRB/EC approved 
consent for MSB-GVHD002 presented to the subject no later than Day 180 (± 7 days).  
See Section 6.3 for additional information about handling of visits from Day 100 through 
Da
y 160 when an IRB/EC approved consent is not available. 
 R eview of inclusion / exclusion criteria 
 P hysical examination 
 He ight and weight 
 Vital signs (heart rate [HR], blood pressure [BP], temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] [RR]) 
 GV HD assessment (skin, lower GI, upper GI, liver) using the same method as that of 
MSB-GVHD001 
 O2 saturation by [CONTACT_406] (SaO 2/SAT) 
 Adve rse event (AE) assessment  
 I ncidence of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (Appendix 8)  
 S urvival status  
 Information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30070] (namely the date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
 Steroid dose(s)  
 Prior and concomitant medications 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691357]  
  Laboratory assessments 
o Hematology (including CMV, please see  Table 6 for details) 
o S erum chemistry 
o Urinalysis 
  
 Optional CT scan or MRI of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at the discretion of the 
investigator. Scans may contribute information with regard to baseline disease burden 
a
nd may also provide baseline for evaluation of future possible ectopic tissue formation. 
F
or CT, use intravenous (IV) contrast; if IV is contraindicated for any reason, oral is 
acceptable even in the presence of GI GVHD. 
 12-Lead ECG 
  
 
 
 
  
 S erum pregnancy test for female subjects ≥10 years of age (see  Appendix 7 for guidance 
on childbearing potential and pregnancy testing) 
 Tr ansfusion (if applicable).  Type of transfusion and the number of units will be recorded 
in the eCRF. 
 
Measurement of all clinical parameters should be performed as described in  Table 6. Standard 
instructions for determining these parameters are provide
d in the following sections. 
 
6.1.1 S afety Assessments 
Many of the study assessments scheduled for Day 100 will be completed during the MSB-
GVHD001 protocol and, therefore, will not be completed at the Day 100 visit for this protocol. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including
 but not limited to, examination for evidence of adverse 
events, will be performed at Day 120, Day 140, Day 
160, the end of study/Day 180, and at 
unscheduled visits as needed.     
 
I
nformation about physical examinations must be available
 in the source documentation at the 
study site.  Significant new findings made after the Day [ADDRESS_691358]  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements should be performed at Days 120, 140, 160, End Of Study/Day 180, 
and at unscheduled visits as needed. 
 
Mea
surements of vital signs will include sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood 
pr
essure (DBP), heart rate (HR), temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR).   
 
Vital si
gns will be measured after approximately [ADDRESS_691359] s during the trial.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Oxygen Saturation 
Concurrent with vital sign measurements, Oxygen saturation (SaO 2/SAT) will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_406].  Supplemental oxygen may be administered as needed but should be noted in the 
sourc
e documents 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Height and Weight 
Height and weight measurements should be performed at End of Study/Day [ADDRESS_691360]’s shoes 
removed, the knees straightened, and head held upright.  For infants, height should be measured 
lying down, a
nd measurements should be recorded as recumbent length.  
 
Mea
surement of weight should be performed without shoes or extra layers of clothing (e.g., 
swe
ater or jacket) during the measurement.  Subjects should be weighed on the same scales at all 
visi
ts. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at End of Study/Day [ADDRESS_691361] 5 minutes prior to the recording.  The same recording position (supi[INVESTIGATOR_532434]-supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) and the same equipment should be used for each subject throughout the study.   
 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691362] be (1) reviewed by a medically qualified member of the study team, (2) 
annotated to indicate any cli
nical finding, (3) signed and dated by [CONTACT_532456], and (4) filed with the notes for the subjects.  ECG parameters will be entered into the 
CRF , a
nd if any ECG abnorma
lity is associated with an (S) AE, it must be entered in the (S)AE 
CRF. 
 
Heart rate (HR), pulse rate ( PR), QRS and QT durations should also be noted on the CRF along 
with t
he ECG parameters. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] (Ser
ious) Adverse Events 
All (S)AEs, including those considered to have a causal relationship to the IMP, will be collected 
at each assessment time point.  (S)AEs collected will consist of both solicited and events 
voluntarily reported by
 [CONTACT_748]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Tests 
A serum pregnancy test may be performed by [CONTACT_532457] (subjects ≥10 years of age) Study/Day 180 and at unscheduled visits and at the 
I
nvestigator’s discretion, as needed.  Details on pregnancy testing requirements are located in 
Appendix 7.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laborator
y Evaluat
ions  
A designated laboratory
 (or laboratories) will perform the analyses of all specimens collected. 
Collection, shipment of samples, and reporting of results by [CONTACT_532458] (if needed) 
laboratory (or laboratories) will be detailed in the laboratory manual provided to the 
Investigators. If age/weight of the patient does not allow for this additional blood volume, then 
values from local labs will serve as the Day [ADDRESS_691363] those results in the CRF.  The diagnosis associated with 
any clinically
 significant laboratory abnormalities should be recorded as an (S)AE on the CRF.  
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691364]  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Ectopic Tissue Formation 
To detect any ectopic tissue formation, a radiologist and an Investigator at each study site may 
compare the optional CT scan or MRI performed during screening for MSB-GVHD001with the 
optional CT scan or MRI performed at end of study/Day 180 or  at an unscheduled visit to 
determine if there is ectopic tissue formation.  If applicable, the same method of radiologic scan 
shoul
d be used for both evaluations.  If the formation of ectopic tissue is suspected, further 
evaluation may
 include MRI or positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning, and possibly 
biopsy.

6.5.4 E scalating Therapy 
Protocol guidelines for escalating therapy of aGVHD for worsening disease include: 
1. Worsening of symptoms for at least [ADDRESS_691368]  
 6.5.5 Supportive Care 
In addition to prescribed investigational agent plus corticosteroids and prophylactic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], all subjects m ay receive  the following:  
 Tr ansfusion  support per institutional  practice. Type of transfusion and the number of units 
will be recorded in the eCRF. 
 Anti -infective prophylaxis directed towards: CMV,  gram positiv e (encapsulated) bacteria, 
pneumocystis carin ii and  fungal infections per institutional practice. 
 
7. S AFETY GUIDANCE 
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adver se Event 
An AE is defined by [CONTACT_532459] (ICH) guideline for Good 
C
linical Practice as  any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
 
An A
E can therefore be any of the following: 
 An y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product 
 An y new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
 R ecurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline  
 An y deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug. 
 
Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening procedures such as biopsies etc.) are to be 
reported.  
 
Collection of all AEs will begin upon signing of the informed consent form (ICF).  Pre-existing 
conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. 
  
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691369] been caused by [CONTACT_2203].  In general, a causal relationship will be 
assigned when evidence exists to support the causal relationship.  As there is no prescribed 
treatment inter
vention in this study, relationship would be extrapolated backwards to dosing in 
protocol MSB-GVHD001. 
 
When assessing a pote
ntial relationship between the IMP and an AE, the following parameters 
should be considered:
 
 T emporal relationship between IMP and/or protocol-specified procedures and the AE. 
 The  biological plausibility that the IMP caused the event 
 An y underlying/concurrent illness in the subject 
 C oncomitant medications the subject may have received  
 How  commonly the event occurs in the study population, independent of treatment. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_691370] be recorded as either 
related (there is re
asonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study 
procedure) or n
ot related (there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
e
vent and the study proc
edure). 
 
8. REP ORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Any adverse
 event (AE) occurring after a subject has signed the informed consent (or 
randomization, as app
ropriate) should be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. 
 
Any SAE (as described in S ection 7.1.2)  occurring after a subj ect has signed the informed 
c
onsent should be immediately reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.  All subjects with an SAE must be followed up and the 
outcomes reported until t
he event is resolved or has stabilized.  
 
Upon occurrence of an SAE, the investigator must:  
 I mmediately notify the sponsor’s designee, Quintiles Lifecycle Safety. SAE reporting 
will originate in the e
lectronic data capture (EDC) system and an email will be sent to 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691371] as a 
back -up in the rare event that EDC is not accessible to the reporter of the SAE:  
o  
 P rovide copy of all relevant source documents, including concomitant medications, as 
appropriate.     
 
All SAEs that are considered unexpected and related to the study product will be reported by [CONTACT_532460] a [ADDRESS_691372] notify the IRB/EC responsible for reviewing the study at their site of all 
15-day or 7-day safety reports required by [CONTACT_168086]/EC requirements and shall 
pr
ovide the Sponsor or its desig
nee with written confirmation of said IRB/EC notification. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_691373] should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  If the 
pregnancy is a
ssociated with an SAE (e.g. hemorrhage, spontaneous abortion), then in addition 
to the Pregn
ancy Form, a separate SAE form must be provided as described in Section 8. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_691374]  
 Any abnormal laboratory result that is clinically significant should be recorded as a single 
diag
nosis in the CRF.  An abnormal laboratory result is considered to be clinically significant if 
it
 meets one or more of the following conditions: 
 I s accompanied by [CONTACT_4659].  
 R equir es change in concomitant therapy (e.g. addition of, interruption of, discontinuation 
of
, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment). 
 
These conditions will apply to any protocol- and non-protocol - specified safety laboratory results 
fr
om tests performed after ICF signature [CONTACT_532481] 
c
onsidered clinically significant.  These conditions will not apply to any abnormal laboratory 
re
sults that are outside the laboratory reference range, yet does not meet the criteria for clinical 
sig
nificance; these latter results will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities. 
I
n the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be repeated 
and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or the abnormality is 
adequately explained or accounted for.  If an acceptable explanation is established, it should be 
rec
orded on the CRF.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_691375] experience to 
quickly identify and communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, IECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the following reference documents: 
 IMP IB 
 I MP Development Core Safety Information (DCSI) Document, if applicable.  
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency 
reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference 
document. 
 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality and 
seriousness, with a provision for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691376]  
 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan 
Since this is an extension trial of MSB-GVHD001, data presented for MSB-GVHD002 will be 
presented in two ways:  
1. For the extension period only. This will include assessments beyond Day 100. 
2. F or the entire period spanning both MSB -GVHD001 and MSB-GVHD002 trials.  
In particular, this includes time- to- event data (flares and therapy escalation), survival 
data, incidence of cGVHD, and frequency of flares. 
 
Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
media
n, minimum, and maximum). Confidence intervals, if presented, will have a two-sided 
95% 
confidence level. For time- to-event variables, Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented as 
appropriate.   
 
In general, the baseline value for a variable is defined as the last non-missing observation prior to 
or equal to the first dose date of study treatment in MSB-GVHD001.  Baseline for analyses of 
the e
ntire period of MSB-GVHD001 and MSB-GVHD002 will be the same as baseline defined 
for Protocol MSB-GVHD001.  The baseline for the extension period beyond Day 100 will be the 
sa
me values at the end of study/Day [ADDRESS_691377] dose date in 
Protocol MSB-GVHD001, which will be considered ‘Study Day 0’.  Study day will be calculated 
fr
om the first infusion date in Protocol MSB-GVHD001.  A detailed statistical analysis plan 
(SAP
) will be finalized prior to the database lock.

statistics [e.g., number of subjects, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum] will be calculated for continuous variables [e.g. age and weight] and frequency 
counts will be tabulated for categorical demographic variables [e.g. gender, ethnicity, race, 
underlying malignancy or leukemic disease at transplant, donor type, donor compatibility, HSCT 
sourc
e, grade of aGVHD at onset, grade of aGVHD at baseline].  Time from HSCT to onset of 
a
GVHD and onset of aGVHD to initiation of study drug will be summarized. Involvement of the

All (serious) adverse events in this study will be collected from the time the subject signs the 
ICF.  All (S)AEs will be collected in this study and summarized by [CONTACT_3148], dose, and severity.  
Numbers and rates of TEAEs and other safety variables will be tabulated by [CONTACT_532461]. 
 
At each time point, vital signs and safety laboratory parameters will be tabulated.  The 
c
ontinuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_532462] – mean, standard deviation,

Disposition table.  For subjects who d ied, the time to event will be calculated from date of 
transplant, date of aGVHD onset, and date of treatment initiation.  All other subjects will be 
c
ensored and survival time will be calculated from the date of transplant, date of aGVHD onset, 
or date of treatment initiation to the date of last contact.

method of radiologic scan should be used for both evaluations. If formation of ectopic tissue is 
suspected, further evaluation may include MRI or positron-emission tomography (PET) 
scanning, and possibly biopsy. 
 
As noted above, (S)AEs which represent ectopic tissue foci will be summarized by [CONTACT_532463].

9.5 S econdary Endpoints Analysis 
9.5.1 Asse ssment of Survival at Day 180 
Survival will be assessed from initial remestemcel-L treatment to the end of study/Day 180. The 
numbers with percentages for survival, non-survival, or missing, including lost to follow-up, will 
be summarized at Day 180.  For tabulating responders at Day [ADDRESS_691382], the

12. L AWS, REGULATIONS, AND ETHICS 
12.1 Local Regulations/Declaration of Helsinki 
This clinical study shall be conducted in full compliance with current material and relevant laws 
and regulations and investigators will use best efforts to ensure such compliance.  This clinical 
study will also be conducted in 
compliance with principles outlined in the “Guideline for Good 
Clinical Prac
tices” ICH tripartite Guideline55 and with the ethical principles of the “Declaration 
of
 Helsinki”[ADDRESS_691391]’s 
participation in this study after a
dequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, 
and potential hazards of the study.  For subjects who are not qualified to or are incapable of 
giving legal consent, writ
ten consent must be obtained from a legally acceptable representative.  
In cases where both the subject and his/her legal representative are unable to read, an impartial 
witness must be present during the entire
 informed consent discussion.  After the subject and 
representative have orally c
onsented to participation in the trial, the witness’ signature [CONTACT_532482].  The investigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are free to refuse to 
enter or withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason that a copy of the consent would 
be provided to the subject, and that the proc
ess b
y which consent is obtained is described in the 

MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691392] be completed appropriately.  If new safety information results in 
significant changes in the benefit/risk assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and 
updated if necessary.  All subjects, including those already being treated, should be informed of 
the ne
w information, provided with a copy of the revised form, and give their consent to continue 
in t
he study in accordance with the IRB/EC requirements. 
 
S
ubjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent 
process in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements (e.g., HIPAA, local Regulatory 
Agency).  Subject s who de ny permission to use and disclose protected health information w ill 
not be eligible to participate in the study.  The Investigator will ensure that study documents 
for
warded to Mesoblast and any other documents contain no mention of subject names. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_691393]/ Ethics Committees (IRB/EC) 
This protocol an d any modifications, appropriate consent procedures, or accompanying material 
pr
ovided to the subject, such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the study used to 
obtain infor
med consent and advertisements or compensation given to the subject, will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_532467]/ECs.  
 
Before initiation of the trial at each investigational site, approval from the appropriate IRB/EC 
must be obtained.  Written approval must be obtained before a trial site is initiated or the 
investi
gational product is released to the investigator.  
 
Any extensions or renewals of IRB/EC approval must be obtained during the course of the study.  
I
f required, approvals must also be obtained for any changes to the protocol, the informed 
consent form, the written information provided to subjects and/or other procedures. 
 
Any new information that may adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the 
study will be reported promptly to the IRB/EC by [CONTACT_11219]/or the Sponsor, in 
a
ccordance with applicable local requirements.  Written summaries of the study status will be 
subm
itted to the IRB/EC annually, or more frequently if required by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB. On completion 
of the study, the IRB/EC will be notified that the study has ended. 
 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691394]  
 12.4 Protocol Adherence 
Investigators will ensure that due diligence is applied in order to avoid protocol deviations. All 
significant protocol deviati
ons will be reported to the IRB/EC in accordance with IRB/EC 
requirements.  All significant protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the CSR. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_691395] be submitted to the appropriate IRB/EC for information and 
approval in accordance with local requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required.  Approval 
must be obtained before any changes can be implemented, with the exception of changes necessary 
to elim
inate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or change(s) involving only logistical or 
administrative aspects of the trial (e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]). 
 
14. COND ITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY 
Mesoblast reserves the right to terminate the study at any time under the conditions specified in 
the Clinical Trial Agreement.  In the event the trial is terminated before the planned completion 
date, action will be taken to assure the protection of the subjects’ interests. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_691396] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645] 
15.1 In vestigator's Files / Retention of Documents 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into two different separate categories, consisting of: 1) An Investigator's Study File 
and 2) subject clinical source documents. 
 
The
 Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments and schedule of assessments, 
IRB/EC and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug 
re
cords, staff curriculum vitae, authorization forms,  and other appropriate 
documents/correspondence.  In addition, at the end of the study the Investigator will receive the 
subj
ect data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to data, query 
re
solution correspondence,  and reasons for changes, in a readable format on CD that must be 
ke
pt with the Investigator’s Study File. 
 
Subject clinical source documents may include subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician's and 
nurse
's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, special assessment reports, 
signed informed consent forms, and consultant letters.  The Investigator must keep the 
I
nvestigator’s Study File and subject clinical source documents (including the archival CD) on 
file for at least [ADDRESS_691397] be made between 
the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these documents in a sealed container(s) outside of the 
sit
e in order to ensure that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in the event of a 
regulatory audit.  Where source documents are required for continued care of subjects, 
appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654]. 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691398], any required background data from 
the stud
y documentation or clinic records.  This is particularly important in cases where errors in 
data transcription are suspected.  In cases of special problems and/or governmental queries or 
re
quests for audit inspections, it is also necessary for the Sponsor to have direct access to the 
complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected. 
 
15.[ADDRESS_691399] be made available by [CONTACT_532468]’s (or designee's) Quality Assurance Unit or its designees or 
to hea
lth authority inspectors, upon appropriate notification.  Verification of the CRF data must 
be by [CONTACT_85349]. 
 
15.4 E lectronic Case Report Forms  
Data for this study will be captured via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system using eCRFs.  
The data will be entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_532469].  An audit trail will maintain a record of initial entries and changes made; reasons for 
change; time and date of entry; and user name [CONTACT_66374].   
 
An eCRF must be completed for each subject. For each screen-failed subject, the reason for 
sc
reen failure will be collected in the termination eCRF along with the corresponding screen 
failure reason.  The entire subject casebook of data must be reviewed and electronically signed 
b
y the PI [INVESTIGATOR_532436].  This also applies to records for those 
randomized subjects who fail to complete the study.  If a subject withdraws early from the study, 
the reason must be noted in the termination eCRF.  If a subject is withdrawn from the study 
be
cause of a treatment-limiting AE, attempts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 
 
The
 Investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported to 
the sponsor
 in the eCRFs and in all required reports.  
 
16. M ONITORING OF STUDY 
The Sponsor’s responsible monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_532470] 
a
nd will be permitted, upon request, to inspect the trial records, including CRFs and other 
pe
rtinent data,  provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordance with local 
re
quirements. 
MSB -GVHD002  Version  4.[ADDRESS_691400]  
 It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the 
study to ensure protocol a
dherence and that the data entered on the CRFs are complete, 
consistent, and accurate.  The monitor must verify that the subject received the study drug 
assigned by [CONTACT_941] r
andomization center (by [CONTACT_532471]).  The monitor will also have access to 
laboratory test reports and other subject records as applicable needed to verify entries on the 
CRF s.  The Investigator 
(or deputy) must agree to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these
 monitoring visits are resolved. 
 
17. CONF IDENTIALITY OF TRIAL DOCUMENTS AND SUBJECT RECORDS 
The Investigator must 
ensure that subject anonymity is maintained and that subject identity is 
pr
otected from unauthorized parties.  O
n CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor, 
subjects should be referenced by  [CONTACT_532472].  The 
Investigator should keep a 
subject enrollment log showing codes, names and addresses.  The 
Investigator should mainta
in documents that will not be submitted to the Sponsor (e.g., subjects’ 
written consent forms) in strict c
onfidence.

 Appendix 7:  Childbearing Potential, Pregnancy Testing, and Contraception 
All
 women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a 
se
rum pre
gnancy
 test at Screening.  Post-screening, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at 
Da
y 56, Day 100, and at any unscheduled visits under protocol MSB-GVHD001.  On protocol 
MSB-GVHD002, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at End of Study/Day [ADDRESS_691413] ( conducted by [CONTACT_532478]).1 
 
All
 female patients are consider ed to be of childbearing potenti al u nless they m eet one of th e 
followi ng  criteria: 
 T he p atien t has been post-menopausal (amenorrhei c ) for  at least 1 year 
 T he p atien t had a surgical bilater al oophorectomy (with or wit hout hysterectomy) mor e 
than 6 weeks prior to enrollment 
 The patient had a hysterectomy.  
 
F
emale patients of reproductive or childbearing potenti al who are u nwilling to use a 
highl y e ffectiv e method of contraception fo r the duration of the study will be excluded fro m 
study participation.2 
 
Examples of highly effec tiv e con traception include the following: 
 Abstinence  
 Contraceptive pil l or transdermal patch  
 Single barrier plus spe rmicide  
 I ntrau terine d evice 
 Implants for co nt r aception  
 Injectio ns for co ntrace ption (with prolo nged release)  
 Hormonal vaginal devi ce 
 Sterilization, sur g ical tubal ligatio n 
 S o le sexual partner consisting of surgically sterilized male pa rtner with appropriate post- 
sur
gical verification o f t he absence o f spermatozoa in the eja culate. 
Patients may
 provide verbal confirmation that the pa rtner comp leted appropriate follow-up aft er

b Pulmonary scoring should be performed using both the symptom and pulmonary function testing (PFT) scale 
whenever possible.  When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT scores, the higher value should 
be used for final scoring.  Scoring using the lung function score (LFS) is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, 
grading using FEV 1 should be used.  The LFS is a global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of 
bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established.  The percent predicted FEV 1 and DLCO (adjusted for 
hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: ≥80%=1; 70-79%=2; 60-
69%=3; 50-59%=4; 40-49%=5; <40%=6.  The LFS= FEV 1 score+DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12.   
 
ADL=activities of daily living; ALT=alanine aminotransferase; AP=alkaline phosphatase; AST=aspartate 
aminotransferase; BSA=body surface area; DLCO=diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide;

Performance Scale; LFS =lung function score; LFTs=liver function  tests; LPS=Lansky Performance Scale;

 None 
 
 Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung: see Note), with no 
clinically significant functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites).   
 
 Moderate chronic GVHD involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no 
major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or 
sit
es with no clinically significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all affected 
organs or sites).  A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate chronic GVHD.   
 
 Severe chronic GVHD indicates major disability caused by [CONTACT_190963] (score of 3 in any 
organ or site).  A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.

Trauma Patients  
 
Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
7/26/18    
Study Design  
ADAPT was a single -center randomized controlled trial that compared safety of low molecular 
weight heparin (LMWH) versus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_466068] [ADDRESS_597673] and informed consent was obtained for all 
enrolled patients.  
 
Eligibility Criteria  
All adult trauma patients (age >18 years) with operative extremity fracture proximal t o the 
carpals/metatarsals or any hip or acetabular fracture requiring VTE prophylaxis were included in 
the study. We excluded prisoners, pregnant patients, non -English speaking patients, patients with 
an indication for therapeutic anticoagulation or high d ose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (greater than 81mg daily) and 
patients receiving pre -existing confounding prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation prior to 
admission or greater than two doses of prophylaxis in our hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466069]. Patients with 
recent VTE within t he last 6 months, impaired creatinine clearance, history of heparin -induced 
thrombocytopenia or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_855] -steroidal anti -inflammatory allergy or another 
contraindication to receiving one of the study medications were also excluded.  
 
Randomization and masking  
Patients were randomly assigned venous thromboembolism prophylaxis by [CONTACT_466073][INVESTIGATOR_466070] (6 per block) with the assistance of the trial’s REDCap system by 
[CONTACT_466074]. Surgeons and patien ts were not masked to the 
treatment groups.  
 
Intervention and Procedures  
Patients allocated to the LMWH group received two 30mg BID doses daily with allowance for 
dose adjustment based on BMI or Xa levels. Patients allocated to the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_466071] 
81mg doses, twice daily. The duration of prophylaxis was at the treating surgeon’s discretion, 
with no minimum or maximum duration. Mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic 
compression devices is also ordered as part of clinical protocol for all i npatients. Study follow -up 
was conducted at [ADDRESS_597674] -fracture either at the patient’s clinic appointment or over the 
phone. A chart review was also conducted at this time.  
 
All prophylaxis doses were monitored daily during the index admission by [CONTACT_1758]’s research 
staff. Additionally, outpatient adherence was assessed at all clinical follow -up visits. Any 
contamination or unplanned crossover was closely monitored.  
 
Outcomes  
The primary endpoint was bleeding complications within 90 -days from the dat e of injury. 
Bleeding complications included a 2g/dL or greater drop in hemoglobin, blood transfusion, 
gastro -intestinal (GI) bleeding, surgical site hematoma requiring reoperation, or other bleeding 
events requiring intervention or resulting in death. Sec ondary exploratory outcomes included 
wound complications defined as a deep surgical site infections (SSI) based on the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention criteria that required operation, and VTE (including massive, 
sub-massive, or clinically signi ficant pulmonary embolism and clinically significant deep vein 
thrombosis (either distal or proximal)). No screening of asymptomatic patients for VTE events 
was done. All adverse events were reported to the IRB as per local requirements. Two medical 
monito rs reviewed the safety of the trial and all serious adverse events.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
The study’s sample size calculations were based on a retrospective review of the study centers 
database, which determined a 1 -year historic bleeding complication rat e of 15% in the study 
population. Based on arthroplasty literature, we hypothesized that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_466072] a 5% absolute reduction bleeding complications. Using a one -sided Fisher’s Exact sample 
size calculation, an alpha of 0.05, and an all ocation ratio of 1:1, a sample of 1150 patients would 
provide 80% power. This target sample was inflated to 1380 to allow for up to 20% loss to 
follow up. Within a year of starting the trial, funding was obtained to commence a large 
pragmatic trial compari ng these two interventions with a primary endpoint of pulmonary 
embolism -related death. This trial was subsequently stopped after the enrollment of 329 
participants, for which the safety of these two interventions was assessed  
 
Analysis followed the intent ion-to-treat principle and included all patients in the groups to which 
they were randomly assigned.  Bivariable analysis and  multivariable logistic regression model  
were  used to assess the association between type of VTE prophylaxis and the primary and 
secondary endpoints. The treatment effects were reported as odds ratios (OR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI). The analyses adjust for the time each patient is at risk of the analyzed 
study event, to a maximum of [ADDRESS_597675] documented follow -up. Kaplan -
Meier curves were used to plot the time to study events by [CONTACT_2939].  
 
Patient crossover and contamination was assessed at several thresholds  including ≥5%, ≥10%, 
≥25%, ≥50% of the patient’s total study doses being the non -allocated prophylaxis medication. 
All thresholds were assessed in a secondary as -treated analysis. A threshold of more than 50% of 
the patient’s total study doses being the n on-allocated prophylaxis medication is presented for 
the as -treated analysis in the results. Factors associated with patient crossover in this study 
sample were also  assessed . 
 
At the completion of the trial, we investigated possible effect measure modific ation by [CONTACT_466075], history of VTE, mechanism of injury (high energy versus low energy), fracture 
location (upper extremity versus lower extremity), fracture severity (open fracture versus closed 
fracture), and non -orthopaedic injury (abdomen,  head, or chest) determined by [CONTACT_466076] ≥2. Each variable was added into the primary analysis as an interaction 
term. Statistically significant interactions were then analyzed stratifying by [CONTACT_466077]. The trea tment effects in the stratified analysis were reported as odds ratios (OR) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for time at risk.  
 
All analyses were performed using JMP Pro Version 13 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). This study 
was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).

 Synopsis 
 
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to  determine the safety and efficacy of buparlisib 
(BKM120) plus capecitabine in breast cancer patient s with brain metastases.  [ADDRESS_285738] either ER+/HER2-, HER2+ or tripl e negative breast cancer.    
The primary objective will be to determine the clin ical benefit rate (CBR) defined as the 
proportion of patients with the best overall respon se of complete response (CR) or of partial 
response (PR) or of stable disease (SD) lasting at least 24 weeks.  The Graded Prognostic 
Assessment (GPA) is a recently developed, validated  prognostic score for patients with brain 
metastases (Sperduto 2008, Sperduto 2012b).  The Gr aded Prognostic Assessment will be 
utilized to evaluate efficacy in this clinical stud y.  Secondary objectives include an assessment of 
objective response rate (ORR) in the CNS, the media n time to progression (TTP) and the median 
overall survival (OS) as well as the usual requirem ent to characterize the safety and tolerability 
of the combined buparlisib plus capecitabine therap y.   
Capecitabine is a prodrug which is enzymatically co nverted to 5-fluorourocil in its tumor target 
where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor gro wth.  It is currently FDA approved for both 
colorectal and breast cancer.  Buparlisib is a pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor being 
developed under IND# 102,823 by [CONTACT_236014] n.  As of September 2012 over 600 
patients had been enrolled in fourteen separate Nov artis sponsored monotherapy or combination 
therapy clinical studies of buparlisib which are su mmarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.   
Phosphatdyinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regula tes diverse cellular functions including cell 
proliferation, survival, translational regulation o f protein synthesis, glucose metabolism, cell 
migration, and angiogenesis (Katso, et. al., 2001).   PI3K signaling also serves a central role in 
the pathogenesis of numerous cancers.  Constitutive  activation of PI3K signaling is known to be 
a critical step in mediating the transforming poten tial of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in 
many tumor types (Liu 2009).  Resistance to a varie ty of therapeutic interventions, including 
hormonal therapyanti-HER2 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235951] y can also be linked to constitutive 
activation of the PI3K pathway (McCubrey 2006).   
Preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3 K pathway is a predictor of a poor prognostic 
outcome in many cancer types.  Thus, as a pan-PI3K inhibitor, buparlisib may provide a 
therapeutic benefit to patients with MBC.  Both cap ecitabine and buparlisib have previously 
shown activity in patients with MBC.  Like capecita bine, buparlisib is also effective in crossing 
the blood brain barrier making it a preferred candi date for its evaluation in patients with MBC. 
Current clinical experience with buparlisib has sho wn that its most frequent adverse events 
(AEs) include fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea , hyperglycemia, nausea, rash and mood 
alteration disorders.  Therefore patients will be c losely monitored for fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG) HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide.  Patients will also be frequently and routinely evaluated 
for mood disorders and disturbances.  The remaining  most frequent AEs will be detected by 
[CONTACT_236015], frequent monitoring with symptomatic treat ment to be provided as required.

[ADDRESS_285739] cancer (BC) is the most common form of malig nant tumor in women worldwide, and 
incidence rates are as high as 99.4 per 100,000 wom en (World Health Organization 2011). 
Subtypes of BC are distinguished by [CONTACT_189095] e strogen receptors (ER), progesterone 
receptors (PgR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] r eceptor-2 (HER2), as well as by [CONTACT_236016] (Perou 2000; Sotiriou and Pusztai 2009). 
Patients with metastatic ER-negative breast cancer have a high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_235952]. In one retrospective cohort study, 46% of patients with metastatic triple negative 
breast cancer (TNBC) were found to have central ner vous system (CNS) metastases at some 
point before death, and 14% had a CNS metastasis at  first metastatic presentation (Lin 2008). A 
second retrospective study reported a 25% incidence  of CNS metastases in patients with TNBC 
(Kennecke 2010). Outside of surgery and radiation t herapy there are no proven therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235953] (OS) of patients with brai n metastases. In patients with HER2+ MBC, 
retrospective studies have documented an incidence of CNS metastases of approximately 25% - 
40%, and this frequently occurs while systemic dise ase is still well controlled by [CONTACT_236017]2-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Lin 2007). A study of brea st cancer patients in the British Columbia 
Cancer Agency reported a 15 year incidence rate of CNS metastases of 5% and 2% in estrogen 
receptor-positive Luminal B and Luminal A subtypes,  respectively (Kennecke 2010).   However, 
patients with ER+ breast cancer brain metastases ar e more prevalent than patients with TNBC or 
HER2+ brain metastases because the majority of meta static disease is ER+ HER2-negative 
(Sperduto 2012)  
The American Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncol ogy (ASTRO)’s guidelines regarding 
radiation therapy for breast cancer brain metastase s have changed, in recent years now de-
emphasizing the role of whole brain radiation (WBRT ) and expanding the role of stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) (Tsao M, et al.,2012)    
In this new guideline, any number of brain metastas es are appropriate for SRS provided they are 
not over 3cm in size and provided they can be treat ed in one radiation therapy session.   WBRT 
is administered only for the development of new met astases following SRS, and only if there are 
more than [ADDRESS_285740] systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235954]/brain barrier, the 
intrinsic resistance of CNS metastases, and express ion of the P-glycoprotein efflux pump. In the 
published natural history studies, the median OS ti me for patients with triple negative (TN) brain 
metastases is approximately 4 months (Lin 2008; And ers 2007; Adamo 2007, Nam 2008; Eichler 
2008). Another retrospective study of outcomes in p atients with breast cancer-associated CNS 
metastases by [CONTACT_236018] 61. 2 and 39.0 months for luminal A and 
luminal B estrogen receptor-positive cancers, respe ctively, and a mean OS of 20.3 months for

 HER2+ cancers (Wiens 2014).   The Sperduto Graded P rognostic Assessment Tool further 
refines OS estimates based on age and performance s tatus.  ER+ brain metastases in woman with 
symptoms and/or over age 60 is associated with OS r ates less than 2 years (Sperduto 2008 and 
Appendix 1). 
The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) is a recentl y developed, validated prognostic score 
for patients with brain metastases (Sperduto 2008).  The GPA has been further refined and 
updated to create diagnosis-specific indices, inclu ding a breast cancer-specific GPA (Sperduto 
2012a; Sperduto 2012b; Barnholtz-Sloan 2012). GPA s cores range from 4.0 (best prognosis) to 
0.0 (worst prognosis), based on weighted significan t prognostic factors, and can be used to 
estimate survival for individual patients. The comp onents for the breast cancer GPA are tumor 
subtype, Karnofsky performance score, and age.  A r ecent study that utilized the GPA showed 
that patients with TNBC and brain metastases had a median survival time of 6.4 months 
(Sperduto 2012b).  
Brain metastases in patients with TNBC are life-lim iting metastases. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235955]. 
1.[ADDRESS_285741] and Mechanism of Action 
The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions, 
including cell proliferation, survival, translation al regulation of protein synthesis, glucose 
metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis (Katso , et al 2001). PI3K signaling also serves a 
central role in the pathogenesis of numerous forms of neoplasia. At the structural level, the 
enzyme PI3K is composed of a 110-kDa catalytic subu nit and an 85-kDa adaptor subunit. The 
PI3K signaling is modulated by [CONTACT_236019],  including growth factors (such as EGF, IGF-
1, and FGF), hormones (such as estrogen and thyroid  hormone), integrins, intracellular calcium 
levels, and RAS signaling. PI3K signaling is negati vely regulated at the level of PIP3 clearance 
by [CONTACT_236020], such as the phosphata se and tensin homologue (PTEN) protein 
and the inositol 5-phosphatase-2 (SHIP2) protein.   
Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the 
transforming potential of oncogenes and tumor suppr essors and in many tumor types (Liu 2009). 
Resistance to a variety of therapeutic intervention s, including chemotherapy, hormonal therapy 
and anti-HER2 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], can also be linked to cons titutive activation of the PI3K pathway 
(McCubrey 2006). Moreover, preliminary data suggest  that activation of the PI3K pathway may 
be a predictor of poor prognostic outcome in many c ancers.  
Molecular changes leading to constitutive activatio n of the PI3K pathway are diverse and 
include, but are not limited to: 
a. Gain-of-function mutations of PI3K subunits ( P I K 3 C A  encoding the PI3K catalytic 
subunit p110 α; genes encoding the p85 regulatory subunit) or onc ogenes encoding 
positive regulators of PI3K (e.g., HER2, EGFR, RAS,  Src-family proteins) or  
b. Loss-of-function mutations or epi[INVESTIGATOR_235956] s affecting negative regulators of PI3K 
signaling (e.g., loss of PTEN expression or functio n) (Chow 2006, Cully 2006).  
Together, these observations suggest that PI3K path way could be a critical therapeutic target for 
the treatment of patients with advanced solid malig nancies who often have limited therapeutic

[ADDRESS_285742] of care. Henc e, treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor  
buparlisib (BKM120) potentially addresses an unmet medical need in such patients.  
A schematic representation of these PI3K components  is shown in Figure 1-1. 
Figure 1-[ADDRESS_285743] leads to a 
higher level of Akt phosphorylation in TNBC cell li nes (Umemura 2007; Marty 2008; reviewed 
by [CONTACT_236021] 2010). Interestingly, TNBC cell lines ha ve also been associated with lower 
expression of PTEN, which correlates with increased  activation of Akt and portends a favorable 
response to PI3K inhibition. Indeed, cell lines whi ch are wild type for PIK3CA, but have lost 
PTEN expression can be sensitive to a PI3K inhibito r (O’Brien 2010). These agents, therefore, 
present an intriguing class of targeted anti-cancer  therapy for patients with TNBC. The

 Gardner unpublished; Lopez-Knowles 2010; Hernandez- Aya and Gonzalez-Angulo 2011) (Table 
1.1), however, based on these numbers, approximatel y 48% of triple negative breast cancers 
should be PI3K pathway activated (either P I K 3 C A  mutated or PTEN loss).   
Up to 40% of HR+/HER2- cancers also exhibit activat ion of PI3K pathway, via PIK3CA 
mutation or PTEN loss (Stemke-Hale 2008; Humphrey G ardner unpublished; Lopez-Knowles 
2010; Hernandez-Aya and Gonzalez-Angulo 2011). Bidi rectional crosstalk between the ER/PR 
and PI3K pathways has been shown to influence ER/PR  levels and activity, including 
phosphorylation and genomic activation of the ER, w hile membrane ER signaling can activate 
PI3K/Akt (Hernandez-Aya and Gonzalez-Angulo 2011). Experimentally, PI3K pathway 
activation has been associated with de novo and acq uired resistance to endocrine therapy 
(Campbell 2001) including AI resistance ( Shoman 2005 ; Crowder, 2009 ; Miller, 2011 ). 
A substantial fraction of HER2-amplified breast can cers also demonstrate activation of the PI3K 
pathway, primarily through loss of PTEN (Table 1-1) . Activation of this pathway, either by 
[CONTACT_23587]3CA mutation or PTEN loss, has been associated w ith resistance to trastuzumab, and cell 
line research suggests that inhibition of the PI3K pathway is an important mechanism of action 
for trastuzumab (Hernandez-Aya and Gonzalez-Angulo 2011). Further, synergistic activity has 
been observed with combinations of trastuzumab and PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer cell line 
studies (Hernandez-Aya and Gonzalez-Angulo 2011). 
Genomic and phosphoproteomic analysis of human prim ary breast cancers in the TCGA showed 
strong activation of PI3K pathway signaling in the majority of basal breast cancers, as well as 
PIK3CA mutations in 45% of Luminal A cancers, 29% o f luminal B cancers, and 39% of HER2-
enriched cancers (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012) .

A study of the PI3K pathway specifically in breast cancer brain metastases found activation of 
this pathway in the majority of cases, regardless o f breast cancer subtype, although PTEN loss 
was most common in the TNBC subtype (37%, vs 17% in  HR_/HER2- and 25% in HER2+) 
(Adamo 2011).

 In addition to mutation of P I K 3 C A , and loss or mutation of P T E N , loss of the tumor suppressor 
I N P P 4 B  (inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase-II) is emerg ing as an important activator of PI3K 
signaling in triple-negative or basal-like breast c ancers. Preclinical studies in breast cancer cell 
lines showed that inactivation of INPP4B leads to A kt activation, cell proliferation, and growth 
of tumor xenografts (Fedele 2010). Investigation of  INPP4B protein expression in primary breast 
cancers found loss of expression most frequently in  basal-like primary breast cancers (84%); 
INPP4B loss was also associated with high clinical grade and tumor size (Fedele 2010). The 
Cancer Genome Atlas study, which used a variety of genomic and proteomic methods of 
analysis, found that P I K 3 C A  mutations occurred in 7% of basal-like breast canc er, P T E N  
mutation or loss occurred in 35%, and loss of I N P P 4 B  occurred in 30% (Cancer Genome Atlas 
Network). In another study, DNA copy number aberrat ion analysis combined with breast cancer 
intrinsic subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_235958] I N P P 4 B  in 40% - 47.5% of basal-like breast cancers, and l oss of 
P T E N  in 22.5% - 34%, using two different datasets conta ining 40 and 61 patient samples, 
respectively (Weigman 2012). Finally, a recent stud y that used whole genome and transcriptome 
sequencing to analyze 14 metastatic TNBCs revealed that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was 
activated due to genomic changes in [ADDRESS_285745] f requently through loss of P T E N  or I N P P 4 B , 
as well as at the transcription level with decrease d INPP4B or PTEN mRNA levels in nearly all 
patients (Craig 2013).  
Another pathway that has been associated with metas tatic colonization of the central nervous 
system (CNS) in breast cancer is the HER3/neureguli n [ADDRESS_285746]. Neuregulin 1 (heregulin), a ligand for HER 3, is abundant in brain tissue, and one study 
reported overexpression and activation of HER3 in b rain metastases compared with matched 
primary breast cancer samples (Da Silva 2010). With in the HER family of receptors, activation 
of PI3K signaling is driven primarily through trans phosphorylation of the kinase-inactive HER3 
receptor, which has also been implicated in resista nce to HER2-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44980]2+ 
breast cancers (Hsieh 2007). HER3 expression has al so been associated with a poorer prognosis 
in both TNBC and HER2+ breast cancers (Bae 2013). I n addition, signaling through HER3 has 
been implicated in resistance to the estrogen recep tor downregulator fulvestrant in an ER+ breast 
cancer xenograft model system (Osipo 2007). 
These studies suggest that through a variety of mec hanisms, activation of the PI3K signaling 
pathway is likely to occur in the vast majority of metastatic breast cancers, and thus rendering 
PI3K a promising therapeutic target.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Preclinical Safety 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for add itional information on the preclinical testing of 
buparlisib. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Pharmacodynamics 
Buparlisib inhibits wild-type PI3K a (IC 50 : 35 nM), with at least 50-fold selectivity towards  this 
compared to activity against other protein kinases outside the PI3K family.  The compound is 
equipotent against somatic PI3K a mutants (H1047R-, E542K-, and E545K-p110 a), and is active 
against the other three PI3K paralogs (PI3K β, - γ, - δ; IC50 108 to 348 nM range). Buparlisib does 
not significantly inhibit the related kinases mTOR or Vps34, nor does it inhibit (IC 50  >10 µM) 
other receptors and ion channels profiled. 
Buparlisib reduces the phosphorylation of the direc t downstream effector Akt in relevant tumor 
cell lines (e.g., IC 50  93 nM for S473P-Akt in Rat1-p110 a cells). This biological activity 
correlates with inhibition of various other downstr eam signaling components and with 
antiproliferative activity in a variety of tumor ce ll lines. 
Buparlisib demonstrates significant tumor growth in hibition in relevant tumor xenografts in mice 
and rats when administered orally, including models  of breast cancer, lung cancer (A549, NCI-
H1975), colorectal cancer (HCT116, HCT-15), gliobla stoma multiforme (U87MG), melanoma 
(A2058, A375), ovarian cancer (A2780), pancreatic c ancer, prostate cancer (PC3M),  and renal 
cell cancer (RENCA, 786-0, Caki-1). I n  v i v o  PK/PD analyses of tumor tissues shows a good 
correlation between exposure, PI3K pathway blockade  (S473P-Akt levels), and anti-tumor 
activity. 
Antitumor activity of buparlisib in breast cancer 
Preclinical data in models of breast cancer are eme rging that support buparlisib evaluation in 
clinical studies. In a series of [ADDRESS_285749] ca ncer cell lines, 4 lines carrying a loss of a 
phosphatase related to PTEN, INPP4B, displayed sens itivity to buparlisib (between 17 and 30% 
cell death) (Gerwinner 2009). The sensitivity to bu parlisib has been confirmed in xenograft 
models where stasis and regressions have been obser ved in models mostly driven by [CONTACT_236023].  Treatment of TNBC cell lines and patient-der ived TNBC xenografts with buparlisib has 
also been shown to increase DNA damage, downregulat e BRCA1/2, and increase poly-ADP-
ribosylation (Ibrahim 2012). Likewise, in a BRCA1-r elated breast cancer mouse model, 
buparlisib delayed tumor doubling time, and reduced  AKT phosphorylation, tumor proliferation, 
and angiogenesis (Juvekar 2012). 
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo models suggest tha t buparlisib has an inhibitory effect in breast 
cancer models (Maira et al 2012).. In a panel of [ADDRESS_285750] cancer lines (12/18) as well as 4/20 basal-type cell lines. This was 
confirmed in xenograft models, where HER2+ and ER+ models displayed tumor control for up 
to 120 days (O’Brien et al 2011), and triple-negati ve primary tumor models displayed stasis or 
occasional regression. 
Delta Clinical Research, LLC  Study No. 11-025/CBKM 120ZUS39T  
BKM120 for MBC with Brain Metastases  [24JUN2016] 
 
[ADDRESS_285751] (Crowder 2009, 
Miller 2011) and i n  v i t r o  response to buparlisib was also observed in ER-pos itives cell lines 
before and after long-term estrogen deprivation (Sa nchez 2011). These cell lines included 
various mechanisms of PI3K pathway activation (i.e. , PIK3CA mutation, HER2 amplification, or 
PTEN mutation. 
Finally, buparlisib was also shown to be efficaciou s in controlling brain metastasis in a 
preclinical model of human HER2 ⁺ breast cancer in Rag2 ⁻/ ⁻;Il2rg ⁻/ ⁻ mice (Nanni 2012). 
This activity of buparlisib observed in pre-clinica l models provides strong molecular evidence 
for the role of PI3K signaling in MBC and supports the exploration of buparlisib in this disease 
setting. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Nonclinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism 
Buparlisib showed favorable pharmacokinetic propert ies in all animal species tested. The 
absorption of [14 C]-buparlisib -related radioactivity was >84% in th e rat. Oral bioavailability was 
moderate to high in rats, dogs, monkeys (42-100%). The estimated steady state plasma volume 
of distribution (Vss) was moderate in all species ( 3.0-3.5 L/kg). Buparlisib penetrates the blood 
brain barrier in rats with a tissue-to-plasma ratio  about 2. Buparlisib is moderately bound to 
plasma protein across all species examined (free fr action ~15% and independent of concentration 
in humans). 
Oxidative metabolism of buparlisib is predominantly  mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (estimated fraction 
metabolized >0.9). Direct phase II metabolism (gluc uronidation) via UGT1A4 is also observed 
in human liver microsomes supplemented with UDPGA. All phase I metabolites identified in 
human hepatocytes and microsomes were also detected  in animals. Buparlisib and identified 
metabolites have a low potential for covalent bindi ng to protein.  
Buparlisib is weak reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4 ( Ki = 13.6 µM) and it also weakly inhibits the 
CYP2C family (2C8, 2C9 and 2C19) with IC50 values r anging from 35 –[ADDRESS_285752] to transporter-based 
drug-drug interactions, buparlisib is neither a sub strate for MRP-2, OATP1A2, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OATP2B1, P-gp nor an inhibitor for BCRP, M ATE1, MATE2K, MRP2, OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT2, P-gp in the observed range of clinicall y relevant concentrations. It is possible that 
buparlisib activates the pregnane X receptor (PXR) in vivo and induces CYP3A4 at 
concentrations ≥50 µM, however, the absence of any time dependent chang es in the 
pharmacokinetics of buparlisib in the relevant ther apeutic dose range in humans, suggests that 
this may not be relevant in vivo. Finally, experime nts showed a potential for buparlisib to induce 
UGT1A1 at concentrations between 0.5 and 100 µM. The mean maximum free concentration 
calculated at steady state for the 100 mg qd dose i n the study [CBKM120X2101] was 0.671 µM 
(Cmax,tot=4.20 µM). Therefore a potential induction of UGT1A1 canno t be formally excluded 
however the clinical relevance of observed activati on of UGT1A1 activity is unclear. 
In GLP toxicology studies, buparlisib exposure in t erms of AUC0-24h and Cmax increased in a 
dose proportional manner in rat and dog. There was no noticeable drug accumulation in dog or

 male rats after 13 weeks of daily dosing. There was  a slight accumulation in female rats (<2 
fold). 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Safety pharmacology and toxicology 
Safety pharmacology studies in rats revealed no eff ects on neuronal (behavior) or respi[INVESTIGATOR_235960]. When using a microdialysis technique to investigate the effect of a single or 2-week 
repeated dosing of buparlisib in various brain regi ons of rats, a marked increase in extracellular 
levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were obser ved in the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) 
and median prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both under acu te as well as repeated dosing conditions. In 
the same brain regions, smaller increases in levels  of dopamine, serotonine and noradrenaline 
were observed in the vHPC, with a trend to decrease d corticosterone. Cardiac safety studies, 
conducted i n  v i t r o  and i n  v i v o  did not indicate a prominent electrophysiological risk. The only 
effect considered relevant was a trend towards an i ncrease in systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure, which was observed in two dog telemetry s tudies, in the absence of an 
electrophysiological effect.  
Repeated-dose studies (up to 13 weeks of duration) were performed in rats and dogs. In rats, 
clinical pathology and histopathology findings show ed a decrease in lymphocyte counts in the 
peripheral blood, decreases in germinal center deve lopment in different lymph nodes, and 
lymphocytolysis in the thymus. In dogs, similar fin dings were made. In both species, 
erythropoiesis was affected, as evidenced by [CONTACT_236024] d erythrocyte counts accompanied by [CONTACT_236025]. 
The pancreas was affected by [CONTACT_236026], particularly in dogs, where acinar cell 
toxicity was seen in the exocrine part of this orga n. At higher doses in the 2-week dose-range-
finding study in rats, there were histopathological  findings in both the endocrine and in the 
exocrine pancreas. 
Male reproductive organs and associated tissues wer e found to be targets of toxicity in both rats 
and dogs. Changes included minimal to slight germ c ell depletion, formation of spermatic giant 
cells and abnormal spermatids, plus cellular debris  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_235961]. Testicular toxicity did 
not fully reverse after the 4-week treatment-free p eriod in rats, although a clear trend towards 
recovery was seen. In individual female rats, minim al to slight cyst formation occurred in the 
Graafian follicles. In dogs, there was no effect on  female reproductive organs.  
Glucose homeostasis was affected in various species  (mice, rats, dogs), as expected from the 
mode of action of buparlisib. However, these effect s were minimal in both rats and dogs at the 
doses used in the 4-week studies. 
Buparlisib does not have sensitizing or irritative potential in the skin. 
No evidence for a direct DNA interaction was found in an Ames test and two chromosome 
aberration tests in vitro with buparlisib. However,  a potential for genotoxicity was identified 
based on the observation of an aneugenic potential and was confirmed by [CONTACT_236027]. In line with this result, bup arlisib treatment resulted in an elevated 
frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocy tes in the bone marrow of rats. In

[ADDRESS_285753] needs to b e further evaluated. Overall, these findings are 
compatible with the treatment of advanced cancer an d do not preclude the use in the foreseen 
indications. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Pharmacodynamic biomarkers 
The preclinical i n  v i v o  studies with xenograft tumors in mice indicate tha t detectable inhibition 
of AKT phosphorylation, which is an accurate readou t of PI3K activity, and further suppression 
of downstream signaling (e.g., phosphorylation of S 6) was obtained soon after buparlisib 
administration. PI3K is known to serve a pi[INVESTIGATOR_235962], 
and preclinical studies in which oral glucose and i ntraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were 
performed suggested post-treatment induction of ins ulin insensitivity/resistance. Therefore, 
throughout the trial the circulating levels of seve ral markers for glucose metabolism (e.g., 
glucose, insulin, C-peptide) will be assessed as an  additional measure of PI3K signaling 
modulation.

Recruitment in study [CBKM120X2101] has been comple ted with forty (40) patients included in 
the dose escalation phase at 6 dose levels (all onc e daily) (12.5 mg (1 patient); 25 mg (2), 50 mg 
(5), 80 mg (11), 100 mg (17), 150 mg (4)). Dose lim iting toxicities were hyperglycemia, skin

Although transaminase increases are relatively comm on, only a few of the patients with LFT 
alterations had simultaneous observations indicativ e of impaired liver function (e.g. bilirubin

Liver toxicity has been analyzed based on a search of multiple MedDRA event terms and is 
presented in Table 1-6. Liver function test (LFT) a lterations observed during ongoing and 
completed studies have been mostly transaminase enz yme increases (ALT and/or AST). Data 
suggest a higher rate of grade 3/4 liver enzyme ele vations in Japanese patients (44.4%) in the 
[CBKM120X1101] study, however, the number of patien ts (9 patients) treated at 100mg in this 
study was limited.

relationship, by [CONTACT_236030] – occ urred at 100 mg/day in 
ongoing buparlisib studies          
 
 
 
 
Although transaminase increases are relatively comm on, only a few of the patients with LFT 
alterations had other simultaneous observations rel ated to impaired liver function (e.g., bilirubin 
increase or clinical symptoms). Based on these find ings, conservative inclusion criteria and 
guidelines to monitor and to follow patients with L FT alterations (including dose and schedule 
modifications) are currently implemented in study p rotocols investigating buparlisib. 
 
Please refer to the respective inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Mood disorders 
Recently, a number of publications demonstrated tha t the modulation of AKT/[COMPANY_004]3 signaling 
pathway by [CONTACT_236031] r egulation of behavior (Beaulieu 2009). 
Preclinical studies conducted in rats to investigat e the effect of buparlisib on different 
neurotransmitters have shown that repeated administ ration of buparlisib resulted in an enhanced

[ADDRESS_285774] range of AEs including (but not limited to)  depression, anxiety, mood alteration, 
confusion, affective disorders, insomnia, hallucina tion, panic disorders, irritability or difficulties  
to concentrate have been reported. 
Considering the initial symptoms reported during th e first-in-man [CBKM120X2101] study, 
mood disorders have been analyzed based on HLGT 'Mo od disorders and disturbances NEC' or 
HLGT 'Personality disorders disturbances in behavio r' or HLGT “Psychiatric and behavioral 
symptoms NEC” or HLGT “suicidal and behaviors NEC”.  The frequency of mood disorders thus 
defined, regardless of study drug relationship, ran ged from 6.3% in [CBKM120B2101] study to 
50.0% in dose escalation part of [CBKM120X2107] stu dy, however, the majority of events were 
of grade 1 or 2 severity (Table 1-7). 
 
Table 1-7  Number (%) of patients with Mood disorde rs, regardless of study drug 
relationship, by [CONTACT_236032] 100 mg/day in

Therefore, patients must be regularly and closely m onitored for signs and symptoms of 
neuropsychiatric disorders with particular attentio n to changes in mood and personality. To 
support the identification and the assessment of ps ychiatric disorders, two self-assessment 
questionnaires, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 
(GAD-7), are part of the protocol. Any AEs (symptom /diagnosis) should be accurately reported 
using CTCAE toxicity/grading. A consultation with a  psychiatrist is strongly recommended for 
any psychiatric adverse event grade ≥ 1. Protocol guidelines further disqualify patients  with an

 active and/or history of major psychiatric disorder .  Please refer to the respective 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Lung Toxicity/ Pneumonitis 
Lung changes compatible with pneumonitis have not b een observed in the preclinical setting.  
Among the current studies, pneumonitis was reported  in five cases and interstitial lung disease in 
one further case. One case of pneumonitis had a fat al outcome in a complex clinical context, 
combining progression of lung metastases and possib le infection with pneumocystis carinii or 
cytomegalovirus. Apart from this fatal case, the co nditions were resolved or improving at the 
latest report (except one non-suspected SAE which w as unchanged). 
The currently available data still do not enable a clear assessment about the causal relationship of 
pneumonitis with buparlisib treatment. Newly appear ing or significant changes in pulmonary 
symptoms (which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_236033]), should be carefully followed 
with appropriate management as per institutional gu idelines and the guidelines provided in the 
protocol. 
Please refer to Table 4-5 for a more detailed guide line on the diagnosis and management of 
Pneumonitis.   
Hyperglycemia events 
The PI3K/AKT pathway plays a significant role in re gulating glucose metabolism, particularly 
by [CONTACT_236034]. Therefore, hyperglycemia is 
considered as an “on target” effect of buparlisib. Regular monitoring of FPG, HbA1c, and insulin 
C-peptide is implemented in buparlisib protocols to  evaluate this pharmacodynamics effect. 
Transient increases of plasma glucose levels have b een reported commonly in patients treated 
with buparlisib. Hyperglycemia observed at 100 mg/d ay, regardless of study drug relationship, in 
ongoing buparlisib studies are summarized in Table 1-8.

The highest rate of hyperglycemia (57.1%) was repor ted in [CBKM120C2201], a Phase II study 
conducted in patients with advanced endometrial car cinoma, as this was the only study among 
those listed allowing the enrollment of patients wi th controlled diabetes mellitus. However, so 
far, there were only two patients that experienced a grade [ADDRESS_285775] dose level (150mg/day) in [C BKM120X2101] study. In order to mitigate 
the potential risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_235966], only patients with normal 
glycaemia defined as fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤ 120 mg/dL are eligible for study entry. 
Patients who have a poorly controlled diabetes mell itus defined as (HbA1c >8%) are excluded. 
In addition, detailed guidelines to monitor patient s are recommended including: regular 
monitoring of FPG to early identify hyperglycemia a nd prevent acute/sub-acute complications, 
caution warranted for patients with history of DM, or taking corticosteroids, or with other severe 
medical conditions (e.g., infections). Hyperglycemi a management guidance also includes: 
dietetic measures and appropriate anti-diabetic med ications as per investigator’s decision and/or 
local guidelines, consider oral anti-diabetics such  as metformin as first-line treatment for 
sustained and more severe hyperglycemia (other drug s as appropriate), if sulfonylurea or insulin 
are initiated, patients should be instructed on how  to recognize (and treat) hypoglycemia, for 
patients with history of DM, management should be b ased on prior anti-DM treatment. 
Detailed guidelines to monitor and manage patients who develop hyperglycemia are provided in 
Table 4-1.  
Skin rash and hypersensitivity 
Skin rash is commonly observed in patients treated with buparlisib. The rate of skin rash and 
other related event terms ranged from 18.4% to 41.4 % in single agent studies with a

 representative number of patients treated with 100m g of buparlisib. In one study with nine 
evaluable patients, seven patients (77.8%) reported  such events (Table 1-9). 
Studies of buparlisib in combination with other age nts tended to report slightly higher 
frequencies (e.g. combination with MEK inhibitor). The skin rashes seen have no typi[INVESTIGATOR_235967], are mainly papulo-macular (only a minority are acneiform) and are 
frequently associated with pruritus. Events have be en reversible after treatment interruption and/ 
or dose reduction. Effective medications have inclu ded antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_12870]/or low-dose systemic corticosteroids (the latte r should be used with caution due to the 
increased risk of hyperglycemia). There have been f ew cases reported of allergic reactions and 
DRESS (drug rash with eosinophilia and system sympt oms), but these have not been of acute 
onset or of a severe nature. 
 
Complementary information collected suggests that s un exposure may exacerbate the condition 
and should be avoided; however, genuine photosensit ivity reaction has not been confirmed and 
no phototoxic potential has been seen pre-clinicall y. Patients are advised (e.g., in the written 
patient information) to avoid sun exposure, or take  measures to protect themselves from intense 
sunlight, during study treatment.

Guidelines for the treatment of buparlisib induced hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia is a common site effect of PI3K and a lso mTOR inhibitors. Hyperglycemia often 
occurs during the first weeks after treatment start  and is dose-dependent. Transient increase of 
glucose levels have been observed in some patients.  Regular monitoring of FPG to early identify 
hyperglycemia and prevent acute/sub-acute complicat ions is important. Caution is warranted for

 patients with history of DM, or taking corticostero ids, or with other severe medical conditions 
(e.g. infections), or patients who show potential a cute signs such as poly-noctiuria, polidypsia, 
confusion, etc.  Hyperglycemia management guidance includes patient education and dietetic 
measures/life-style changes as well as appropriate anti-diabetic medications as per investigator’s 
decision and/or local guidelines.  
Oral anti-diabetics such as metformin should be con sidered as first-line treatment for sustained 
and more severe hyperglycemia (other drugs as appro priate). Provided hyperglycemia is 
asymptomatic and there are no acute complications, sufficient time should be given to install 
optimal management (e.g. uptitrate metformin, addit ion of a second oral anti-diabetic agent to be 
considered as needed, etc.). Patients initiated on sulfonylurea or insulin should be instructed on 
how to recognize (and treat) hypoglycemia. Patients  with history of DM, management should 
take prior anti-DM treatments into account. Note th at some oral anti-diabetic drugs are CYP2C9 
substrates and should be used with caution; others are CYP3A inducers or inhibitors and may be 
prohibited (see Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for more details). Patients who develop Grade [ADDRESS_285776] clinical practice, 
with the goal of stabilizing glycemic control withi n 24 hours. More guidance on dose reductions 
and interruptions is provided in Table 3 above.  
Guidelines for the treatment of study drug induced stomatitis/oral mucositis 
General guidance and management include patient awa reness and early intervention. Evaluation 
for herpes virus or fungal infection should be cons idered. 
Patients should be informed about the possibility o f developi[INVESTIGATOR_235968]/ oral mucositis and 
instructed to report promptly any signs or symptoms  to their physician, Patients should be 
educated about good oral hygiene, instructed to avo id spi[INVESTIGATOR_70329]/acidic/salty foods, and should follow 
the following guidelines:  
• For mild toxicity (grade 1), use conservative measu res such as non-alcoholic mouth wash 
or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day  until resolution. 
• For more severe toxicity (grade [ADDRESS_285777] pain but are able to 
maintain adequate oral alimentation, or grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain 
adequate oral alimentation), the suggested treatmen ts are topi[INVESTIGATOR_53295] (i.e., local anesthetics such as benzoca ine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase ®), or as per local practice. 
• Agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodin e, and thyme derivatives may tend to 
worsen mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid thes e agents. 
Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal  infection is diagnosed as they may interfere 
with buparlisib metabolism. 
Guidelines for the treatment of buparlisib induced diarrhea 
The investigator should consider/investigate potent ial concomitant medication, food or 
comorbidity driven causes of diarrhea (including in fectious causes) and remedy these causes if 
possible (e.g. discontinuation of concomitant medic ation, dietary modification, treatment of 
comorbidity). 
Delta Clinical Research, LLC  Study No. 11-025/CBKM 120ZUS39T  
BKM120 for MBC with Brain Metastases  [24JUN2016] 
 
[ADDRESS_285778] investigator’s judgment 
and may consist for example, as per “the recommende d guidelines for the treatment of cancer 
treatment-induced diarrhea” (Benson 2004), of loper amide given at a standard dose (e.g. initial 
administration of 4mg, then 2mg every 4 hours, maxi mum of 16 mg/day), along with oral 
hydration and dietetic measures could be considered  for Grade 1-2 diarrhea. More severe 
diarrhea should be treated appropriately according to investigator discretion, including for 
example IV fluids. 
Dose adaptations of buparlisib in case of treatment  related diarrhea should follow the guidelines 
presented above for other non-hematological adverse  events. 
Guidelines for the treatment of buparlisib induced psychiatric disorders 
Psychiatric adverse events will be closely monitore d and evaluated at each planned visit until 
recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline status. The grading of psychiatric a dverse events/mood 
alterations must be based on the clinical interpret ation of severity according to the NCI- CTCAE 
(v 4.03) guidelines. 
For patients who experience new or worsening of exi sting psychiatric AEs of Grade ≥1, 
psychiatric consultation should be considered as de scribed in Table 3. 
Patient self-reported mood questionnaires (GAD-7 an d PHQ-9) will be used for screening and 
during the study treatment phase to aid the investi gator in identifying new or worsening of 
events. For additional information regarding safety  assessments based on patient self-reported 
mood questionnaires, please refer to Section Patien t self-rating mood questionnaires. 
If question 9 in the PHQ-9 has a positive response (as indicated by [CONTACT_20683] "1", "2", or "3"), 
omit treatment with buparlisib and refer the patien t for psychiatric consultation for optimal 
management regardless of the total questionnaire sc ore or CTCAE grading to confirm if study 
drug should be interrupted or permanently discontin ued. In this specific case, the psychiatric 
advice can overrule the patient’s PHQ-9 self-assess ment. During the study, subjects will be 
monitored at regular scheduled visits (e.g., Day 15  of Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycles 2, 
Day 1 of each subsequent cycle, and at the End of T reatment visit) by [CONTACT_093]/site staff 
through personal interaction and the two self-repor ted questionnaires. Additional assessments 
may be done according to the clinical judgment of t he investigator if desired. 
Guidelines for the treatment of study drug induced skin toxicity 
Skin toxicity is a class-effect observed with PI3Ki /mTORi agents. Close monitoring of potential 
skin reactions will be performed at each planned vi sit and will be reported as adverse event. The 
most frequent skin adverse events reported are: mac ulopapular rash (only a minority present 
acneiform rash) (refer to Table 3 for clinical mana gement); pruritus and dry skin. The onset is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_104383] [ADDRESS_285779] art and is reversible with adequate comedication 
and treatment interruption if needed. Photographs o f a skin rash event as well as skin biopsy are 
recommended, if possible. According to the investig ators discretion, a paired skin biopsy could 
be obtained (from both an affected and an unaffecte d skin area for local histopathology 
assessment) to further assess rash if clinical appr opriate.

 Recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235969] (ref er to Table 3 for specific guidance according 
to the type of skin toxicity): 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_235970] (face and fold s): triamcinolone 0.025%;

effects observed with GABA agonists such as: somnol ence, dizziness (both drugs) and 
peripheral edema (Gabapentin) among others AEs. 
 
Dry skin has been reported, it is recommended that patients with dry skin use mild and fragrance 
free soaps and detergents. According to the severit y and BSA extension patients may apply mild 
moisturizers, ammonium lactate cream 12% or salicyl ic acid cream 6% b.i.d.  
Photosensitivity has been described in patients alt hough preclinical experiments demonstrated 
that buparlisib has no potential phototoxic effect.  Patients should be advised to take measures to 
protect themselves from direct exposure to sunlight , including regular use of sunscreen (factor [ADDRESS_285780]), wearing of sunglasses, using of hats, an d protective clothes when outdoors. 
Guidelines for the management of Posterior Reversib le Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
There have been rare reports of PRES occurring unde r treatment with buparlisib. Signs and 
symptoms may include severe headache, confusion or seizures, altered consciousness, visual 
disturbances, with or without associated high blood  pressure. Patients are instructed in the 
written patient information to inform their treatin g physician if they suspect such an event. Take 
appropriate measures in such cases to assess the si gns and symptoms. If PRES is suspected based 
on the signs and symptoms, buparlisib should be int errupted and a brain MRI should be 
performed to confirm the diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.[ADDRESS_285781]-in-human trial [CBKM120X21 01]. Buparlisib was administered as a

 capsule (doses ranging between 12.5 and 150 mg) and  full pharmacokinetic profiles were 
collected on Day 1, Day 8 and Day 28 of Cycle 1.  
Buparlisib was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584], with the median ti me to reach the peak plasma concentration 
(Tmax) ranging from 1.0 to 1.75 hours after adminis tration. Tmax was independent of dose and 
was not altered after multiple oral doses. Variabil ity in systemic drug exposure was moderate at 
all dose levels. At 100 mg the variability in syste mic drug exposure and Cmax (CV %) at steady-
state was moderate, about 36% and 25%, respectively . 
During once daily dosing, plasma buparlisib concent rations were found to accumulate in 
reaching steady-state. After one week of oral daily  dosing (day 8), both Cmax and AUC0-24h 
were approximately 3-fold higher than after a singl e dose (day 1). The mean accumulation ratio 
(Racc) of buparlisib at 100 mg was 2.7 and 3.3 on d ays 8 and 28, respectively, indicating the 
absence of significant drug accumulation after day 8.  
The decay in buparlisib plasma concentration over t ime was bi-exponential, with an apparent 
long terminal half-life. The mean T1/2,acc (effecti ve half-life, obtained from drug accumulation) 
calculated from exposure data at day 28 ranged betw een 38 and 49 hours across all dose levels. 
T1/2,acc was found to be independent of dose. Based  on the effective half-life, steady state 
buparlisib plasma levels can be expected to be reac hed after 1 week of daily dosing. 
Furthermore, the preliminary PK data within the Jap anese population [CBKM120X1101] show 
no significant differences in Cmax or AUC0-24h comp ared with the PK data for the Caucasian 
population [CBKM120X2101]. A preliminary population  PK analysis, including data from 
studies [CBKM120X2101] and [CBKM120X1101] confirmed  these findings ([COMPANY_001] internal 
data). 
In study [CBKM120X2107] a daily dosing regimen of b uparlisib was tested in combination with 
weekly infusions of trastuzumab in patients with re lapsed HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic data indicated that the  systemic drug exposure (Cmax and AUC) of 
oral buparlisib in combination with trastuzumab was  similar to that for the single agent data. 
Trastuzumab trough levels were consistent with thos e previously reported to be therapeutic (i.e., 
generally greater than 20 µg/ml). 
In the current study, corticosteroids and other CYP 3A4 inducers will be prohibited in order to 
maintain buparlisib exposure in the expected range.  In addition, anti-acids will be dosed at least 
one hour after buparlisib administration to avoid a  decrease of pH during the absorption phase of 
buparlisib and thus avoid any possible solubility l imitations.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3  Clinical efficacy data 
Sixty six patients were evaluable for response in s tudy [CBKM120X2101] where all patients in 
the expansion cohort were required to have mutated and/or amplified PIK3CA and/or mutated 
PTEN or null/low PTEN protein expression: partial t umor responses (PR) were observed in [ADDRESS_285782] 
cancer and the other 2 patients’ responses were not  confirmed ([ADDRESS_285783] 
cancer and 1 patient with parotid carcinoma) (Graña  2011). 
The first patient was a [ADDRESS_285784] 
cancer assessed as triple negative (ER-, PgR-, HER2 -), PI3KCA wild type, PTEN IHC positive. 
Since 2006 she received many previous anticancer ag ents (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,

 gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, ca pecitabine, etoposide, anastrozole). As 
progressive disease developed (bulky lymph node inv olvement and local breast relapse), she was 
enrolled (April 2009) in the Phase I study of bupar lisib in the 100 mg/day cohort. A metabolic 
response (61% decrease in SUV) was observed after [ADDRESS_285785] partial 
response (66% tumor shrinkage) after [ADDRESS_285786] cancer, assessed as ER positive, HER2 negati ve, PI3KCA mutated (E545K & H1047Y), 
PTEN IHC positive. She had been previously treated with several antineoplastic agents. When 
she received buparlisib at 100 mg/day (January 2010 ), she had measurable metastases in the 
brain, lung and liver. At the second radiological a ssessment after receiving 4 cycles of buparlisib 
treatment, a 45% reduction of the sum of the lesion s was recorded. The TTP for this patient was 
[ADDRESS_285787] patient was a 45 year-old man with grade 4 parotid gland ductal carcinoma, PI3KCA 
wild type, PTEN IHC positive. He had been previousl y treated with doxorubicin and adriamycin. 
After disease progression was observed on this regi men he was enrolled in the 100mg/day cohort 
(July 2010) in the [CBKM120X2101] study. At the fir st radiological assessment after receiving 2 
cycles of buparlisib treatment, a 33% reduction of the sum of the lesions was recorded. The TTP 
for this patient was 16 weeks. 
As of the data cut-off 04July2011, preliminary anal ysis shows forty-five percent of patients (30 
of 66 evaluable) had stable disease as their best r esponse, with 20 patients (30%) having a 
disease stabilization of 3 months or longer. A tren d towards better activity (long-term 
stabilizations) has been observed at the higher dos e cohorts, also expressed in metabolic FDG-
PET response. However, considering the impact of a PI3K inhibitor on glucose metabolism, 
further data are needed to understand whether the c urrent FDG-PET assessment data can be used 
as a predictive factor for efficacy. 
With regard to pharmacodynamic markers observed in study [CBKM120X2101], down 
regulation of pS6 in skin by 30-80% was demonstrate d in 28 out of the 38 evaluable patients at 
100 and 150 mg/d with more than a 25% FDG-PET signa l decrease in patients at doses greater 
than the MTD.  
With regards to the PI3K pathway activation, two of  the three responders described above had a 
cancer with a PIK3CA mutation. Moreover, [ADDRESS_285788] is warranted.  
More specifically, in [CBKM120X2101], 25.3% (21/83)  of patients had metastatic breast cancer. 
At the cut-off date of July 4th , 2011, twenty breast cancer patients were evaluabl e for objective 
tumor response by [CONTACT_393] 1.0. Two breast cancer pat ients (11%), described above exhibited 
partial responses. For these 2 patients, the treatm ent duration was 27+ (ongoing) and [ADDRESS_285789] cancer patient s (40%) had stable disease. Median 
progression-free survival was 60 days and the 6-mon th PFS rate was 33% (Rodon 2011). 
Other than [CBKM120X2101], two trials are ongoing i n breast cancer patients with preliminary 
data available:

 • In [CBKM120X2107], buparlisib is combined with tras tuzumab in metastatic breast 
cancer patients with trastuzumab resistance. As of September 30, 2011, out of 17 
patients enrolled, 2 PR and 8 SD were observed in t he dose escalation portion of this 
study, with a disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) of 59 %. (Saura 2011). 
• Buparlisib has been combined with letrozole in ER+ post-menopausal breast cancer 
patients (Mayer 2011). Out of the 20 patients enrol led, 12 were evaluable for 
efficacy; 1 PR, and 7 SD were observed. Over 50% of  patients had >25% reduction in 
their peak SUV at the 2-week FDG-PET scan. 
 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for add itional information on the available 
clinical experience with buparlisib. 
1.3.2  Capecitabine 
Capecitabine is a prodrug that is enzymatically con verted to 5-fluorouracil in the tumor where it 
inhibits DNA synthesis and slows growth of tumor ti ssue (Xeloda package insert). Capecitabine 
is approved in both colorectal and breast cancer. C apecitabine demonstrated single-agent activity 
in subjects with MBC with an ORR of about 20% in su bjects whose disease had progressed 
during or following anthracycline and taxane-based therapy (Xeloda package insert).  
Capecitabine is also indicated as a combination tre atment with docetaxel in early-line treatment 
for MBC and in combination with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_235973]-line treatment after failure 
of prior anthracycline and taxane-containing chemot herapy (Xeloda package insert). 
The recommended, approved dose of capecitabine is 1 250 mg/m 2 daily BID for 14 days, 
followed by 7 days without treatment (Xeloda packag e insert). This dose/schedule necessitates 
dose interruptions or reductions in approximately 3 0% of patients, and in clinical trials, 
approximately 17% of patients discontinued the drug  due to toxicities (primarily hand-foot 
syndrome, diarrhea and stomatitis) (Mackean 1998; O ’Shaughnessy 2001).  
There have been isolated case reports of responses to single agent capecitabine in patients with 
breast cancer-related CNS metastases (Ekenel 2007; Hikino 2006; Rogers 2004; Wang 2001; 
Fabi 2006; Tham 2006).  In addition, in a phase II trial of patients with HER2+ MBC with CNS 
metastases, the combination of capecitabine plus la patinib was associated with a higher objective 
response rate (20%) compared with 6% observed with lapatinib alone (Lin 2009). Further, this 
combination produced a 66% partial CNS response rat e in patients with previously untreated 
HER2+ CNS metastases in the phase II LANDSCAPE tria l (Bachelot 2013). 
1.3.[ADDRESS_285790] been enrolled as of January 3, 2013.  Based on assessment of toxicities in cycle 
1, the investigators believe that the recommended p hase II dose from this study will likely be 
capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 PO BID 14 days on and 7 days off plus buparlisib 1 00 mg PO 
QD. Additional patients are being enrolled to this dose level presently.   Dose limiting toxicities 
(DLT) to date have included one patient each with p sychosis, photosensitivity "sunburned" rash, 
fatigue, and mucositis.  Several patients who did n ot have a cycle 1 DLT, and whose disease had 
not progressed, withdrew from study therapy due to capecitabine-related toxicities including

BKM120 for MBC with Brain Metastases  [24JUN2016] 
 
40 
 diarrhea and hand foot syndrome, which occurred aft er cycle 1.  Several patients needed a dose 
reduction of capecitabine in cycles 2-5, and dose r eductions of buparlisib to 80 mg PO QD were 
required in some patients due to grade 2 psychiatri c or cognitive side effects. Evidence of 
antitumor activity has been observed in triple nega tive and ER+ MBC patients.  Overall, 
administration of the combination of capecitabine a nd buparlisib is feasible with doses of the two 
agents that are their single agent MTDs. Toxicities  observed to date have been generally 
manageable with dose reduction although some patien ts have withdrawn from study therapy due 
to cumulative toxicity (Claire Dees, MD. personal c ommunication).  
1.3.4  Buparlisib in combination with trastuzumab 
 
A phase Ib/II trial by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_235974] 2012 com bining trastuzumab plus buparlisib (100mg 
QD) showed acceptable safety in 52+ pts with basica lly no overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_235975] 2012).  
Of note, [ADDRESS_285791]; [ADDRESS_285792] been shown to improve OS for pa tients with MBC with brain metastases. (see 
Section 1.1.1) Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for more effective treatments for this patient 
population.  
Dysregulation of the PI3K signaling pathway occurs in the majority of MBCs, through a variety 
of mechanisms including mutation of PIK3CA or PTEN,  or loss of PTEN or INPP4B, as well as 
through activation by [CONTACT_236036].  PTEN loss and activation of PI3K signaling 
has also been documented specifically in MBC brain metastases, making inhibition of this 
pathway an attractive therapeutic strategy for inve stigation. (see section 1.2.1) 
Capecitabine and buparlisib have both individually demonstrated the ability to penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier, and have shown activity in MBC , making this a rational combination to 
evaluate for the treatment of MBC brain metastases.  In addition, this combination is currently 
being evaluated in a phase I study in MBC, includin g patients with MBC, with  evidence of 
activity as well as tolerability. (see Section 1.3. 3) 
Given this background, we have decided to proceed w ith a phase II study to test the combination 
of capecitabine plus buparlisib in metastatic breas t cancer with HER2+ or ER+/HER2- or triple 
negative brain metastases. The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the effect of buparlisib plus 
capecitabine on clinical benefit rate in this patie nt population. 
1.4.1  Rationale for dose selection 
 
Buparlisib will be administered at a dose of 100 mg  orally (PO) daily, the MTD/RP2D 
determined in single agent ([CBKM120X2101] and [CBM K120X1101]) and combination 
([CBKM120X2107], [CBEZ235A2118] and [CBKM120XUS13T] ) studies (Buparlisib 
Investigator Brochure). This dose has also shown pr eliminary tolerability in combination with 
capecitabine in the ongoing phase I study in MBC. C apecitabine will be administered at a dose

 of 1000 mg/m 2 PO BID (rounded down to the nearest 500 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 1 4 days on and 7 days off, 
based on the recommended phase II dose determined i n the phase I study of capecitabine plus 
buparlisib in MBC (Claire Dees, MD. personal commun ication). 
2 Study objectives 
Primary Objectives 
• To determine the clinical benefit rate (CBR) based on local investigator assessment 
associated with buparlisib once daily plus capecita bine (1000 mg/m 2 PO BID 14 days 
on/7 days off) in patients with metastatic breast c ancer with a  brain metastasis at 
least 5mm in size following whole brain radiation t herapy (WBRT)  or stereotactic 
radiosurgery (SRS) or both. The target lesion that is at least 5mm in size must not 
have undergone treatment with SRS and may represent  residual disease following 
SRS or WBRT, or may represent progression of diseas e following SRS or WBRT.  
Clinical benefit rate is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response 
of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) in the CNS 
lasting at least 24 weeks based on local investigat or assessment.  
Secondary Objectives 
• To assess ORR in the CNS based on local investigato r assessment associated with 
buparlisib plus capecitabine. 
• To assess median time to progression (TTP) associat ed with buparlisib plus 
capecitabine. 
• To determine median overall survival (OS) associate d with buparlisib plus 
capecitabine. 
• To determine if buparlisib plus capecitabine prolon gs OS compared with expected 
survival of patients with brain metastases, estimat ed using the breast-GPA (See 
Appendix 1). 
• To characterize the safety and tolerability of bupa rlisib plus capecitabine, with or 
without trastuzumab. 
• To assess median time to deterioration of neurologi c function. 
• To monitor changes in symptom occurrence using the M.D. Anderson Symptom 
Inventory-Brain Tumor Module (MDASI-BT), and to pro vide results of PHQ-9 
Depression Scale. 
• To investigate whether there is a correlation betwe en PI3K pathway-related 
biomarkers and clinical response.

[ADDRESS_285794] of 2 phases: a Screening Ph ase where the informed consent will be 
collected and eligibility criteria will be assessed  followed by a Treatment Phase that includes 
end-of-treatment follow-up assessments. The Screeni ng Phase will include assessments before 
the first dose of study drugs (Cycle 1/Day 1) to es tablish eligibility and baseline values. The 
Treatment Phase will commence for each subject with  the first dose of buparlisib plus 
capecitabine, with or without trastuzumab, and cont inue through the end of treatment. After 
discontinuing all study treatment, the patient will  be followed for a mandatory 30-day safety 
follow-up, efficacy (tumor assessments, if applicab le) follow-up and survival follow-up.  
During the treatment phase:  
• Patients with HER2- MBC will receive buparlisib ora lly (PO) at a dose of 100 mg 
daily continuously in combination with capecitabine  1000 mg/m 2 PO BID 14 days 
on/7 days off.   
• For patients with HER2+ MBC, standard every 3-weekl y trastuzumab (6 mg/kg IV) 
will be added to the capecitabine/buparlisib.   
Patients will receive treatment until disease progr ession, unacceptable toxicity, death, or 
discontinuation from the study treatment for any ot her reason. Patients will be followed for 
survival regardless of treatment discontinuation fo r any reason for up 2 years from date of 
registration (except if consent is withdrawn or pat ient is lost to follow-up).  
Note: Information from procedures that may have bee n previously performed as part of the 
patient’s routine disease care (prior to enrolling in the trial) is allowed to be used to satisfy 
inclusion criteria as long as the procedures were p erformed within [ADDRESS_285795] be performed during the screening 
period (day −28 to day −1). Receptor status may be obtained anytime before enrollment on 
study. Collection and shipment of tumor sample (new  biopsy or archived tissue) to designated 
lab (check the CTI) should occur as soon as possibl e and no later than Day −1. Check Table 4-12 
for details of tests to be done at screening. 
Screening procedures are to be performed within 28 days of the start of study treatment. 
Receptor status may be obtained any time before enr ollment on study. Baseline values for those 
assessments (e.g., physical examination, ECOG perfo rmance status, weight, vital signs, 
hematology, biochemistry and fasting plasma glucose ) may be used for Cycle [ADDRESS_285796] dose of the of 
study drug.

initiated. Patients will receive buparlisib orally (PO) at a dose of 100 mg daily continuously in 
combination with capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 PO BID 14 days on/7 days off, then repeat the cycl e. 
Patients with HER2+ MBC will also receive trastuzum ab by [CONTACT_193401] 3 weeks.   
Capecitabine needs to be rounded down to the neares t 500 mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  Buparlisib and capecitabine 
dose modifications will be allowed (see Section 4-1 ). Safety will be monitored as outlined in 
Section 4-3. 
Cycle treatment and evaluations will be performed d uring therapy at the start of each cycle, 
unless otherwise specified. Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, has a window of +/-3 business days 
(after the scheduled time) for treatment administra tion and cycle assessments (e.g., the physical 
examination, performance status (ECOG), weight, vit al signs, and labs) during the study 
treatment. Any delay within this window is NOT a de viation. 
Patients will receive treatment until disease progr ession (assessed by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), unacceptable 
toxicity, death or discontinuation from treatment f or any other reasons. Efficacy and safety 
monitoring will continue as per the visit schedule (Table 4-12). Tumor assessments will be 
performed every 8 weeks after treatment initiation date until clinical or radiological progression. 
Disease progression in the brain and other sites sh ould always be documented radiologically, 
adding an earlier than planned imaging time point f or tumor assessments as clinically indicated. 
Note: Cycle 1 only, the baseline values for those a ssessments (e.g., the physical examination, 
performance status (ECOG), weight, vital signs hema tology, biochemistry, and fasting plasma 
glucose,) that are to be done for screening may be used for Cycle [ADDRESS_285798] dose of study treatment (buparlisib plus c apecitabine).  There is window of +/- 7 business 
days for end of treatment assessments.  Any delay w ithin this window is NOT a deviation.  End 
of treatment will continue as per the visit schedul e (Table 4-12). 
Follow up phase 
After the end of the treatment visits, all patients  will be followed up for safety up to [ADDRESS_285799] dose of study treatment (buparlisib plus c apecitabine).   
All patients who discontinue from study treatment d ue to disease progression must have their 
progression clearly documented according to the cri teria specified in RECIST 1.1.

used across all sites. A  UPN will be assigned to the patient at that time. E ntering a patient into 
CTMS does not signify that you have registered the patient in the study. If you have any 
difficulty with CTMS please contact [CONTACT_236038]. 
Once the patient has an UPN number, the coordinator  can go to their Patient Report and select 
the patient that they want to register.  Located to  the left of the patient’s UPN will be the letters 
“Reg” in blue.  The coordinator will click on the b lue “Reg” to open up that patient’s 
information.  Each page that needs to be completed will be in yellow.  The site will answer the 
questions on the Inclusions and Exclusions.  Once a ll questions on each page are answered, that 
page will turn green.  Once all the pages turn gree n, click on the “verify data” tab, then click the 
“register” tab.  The register page will open, “clic k to register”.  An ID number will be directly 
assigned. For any difficulties with entering the da ta, please contact [CONTACT_236039]. 
 
Treatment must begin within 5 working days after th e patient’s registration on the study,

Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may  be affected by [CONTACT_9058] 
P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered  effective for this study. Women 
of child-bearing potential, defined as sexually mat ure women who have not 
undergone a hysterectomy or who have not been natur ally postmenopausal for at 
least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had mens es any time in the preceding 12 
consecutive months), must have a negative serum pre gnancy test ≤ 72 hours prior

contraception is defined as either: 
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the pref erred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, o vulation, symptothermal, post-
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptabl e methods of 
contraception. 
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophore ctomy (with or without 
hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.  In case of oophorectomy 
alone, only when the reproductive status of the wom an has been confirmed by 
[CONTACT_104].

b) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusi ve cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film /cream/vaginal 
suppository 
• Note: Oral contraception, injected or implanted hor monal methods are not 
allowed as buparlisib potentially decreases the eff ectiveness of hormonal 
contraceptives.

26. Patient has history of another malignancy within [ADDRESS_285816] be interrupted because of unacceptable toxicit y, drug dosing will be interrupted or modified 
according to rules described in Table 4-0 and Table  4-1. Toxicity will be assessed using the NIH-
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,  version 4.0. (CTCAEv4.0), 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-0 6-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf ). The 
dose of buparlisib does not need to be reduced for toxicities that the physician believes are due to 
capecitabine.  
 
Capecitabine dose modification guidelines are descr ibed in Section 4.1.3. Please refer to the local 
approved prescribing information. Any planned varia nce from these guidelines in the view of 
patient safety must be previously discussed with th e sponsor unless there is an urgent need for 
action. All dose modifications, interruptions or di scontinuations must be based on the worst 
preceding toxicity as graded by [CONTACT_236045] (NCI-CTCAE version 4.03). 
Once a dose has been reduced during a treatment cyc le, re-escalation will not be permitted 
during any subsequent cycle. The dose of capecitabi ne does not need to be reduced for toxicities 
that the physician believes are due to buparlisib.

 Trastuzumab dose modifications will be per physicia n’s discretion and standard of care..  
 
If the administration of buparlisib or capecitabine  is interrupted for reasons other than toxicity, 
then treatment with the respective study drug may b e resumed at the same dose. The same 
applies if the patient experiences an unacceptable toxicity not specifically described, provided 
this toxicity resolved to ≤ CTCAE grade 1, unless otherwise specified. 
 
If one or both study drugs are being withheld due t o toxicity, scheduled visits and all assessments 
should continue to be performed (with the exception  of the dosing of the held study drug), as 
described in Table 4-12. If administration of bupar lisib or capecitabine dosing is held for more 
than 21 days, then this withheld study drug should be permanently discontinued. Patients who 
permanently discontinue one of the withheld study d rugs for any reason other than disease 
progression may continue the other study drug as pa rt of the trial therapy at the investigator’s 
discretion.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring of buparlisib suspected toxicities   
Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanen tly discontinued due to an adverse event 
or clinically significant laboratory value, must be  followed as outlined in Table 3-1, at least 
once a week for [ADDRESS_285849]. If a patient requires a dose delay of > 21 
days from the intended day of the next scheduled do se, then the patient should be 
discontinued from the study. If the patient require s more than 2 dose reductions, the patient 
should be discontinued from the study (i.e., patien ts cannot be treated below dose level -2). 
All patients must be followed for adverse events an d serious adverse events for [ADDRESS_285850] dose of buparlisib. All SAEs mus t be reported to Delta as detailed in 
Section 4.3.7. 
 
4.1.2  Known Undesirable Side Effects of Buparlisib 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neuropsychiatric events  
 
In an ongoing Phase Ia study of buparlisib in patie nts with solid tumors (CBKM120X2101), 
neuro-psychiatric adverse events, including reversi ble and generally mild to moderate mood 
alterations, described as anxiety, agitation with c rying epi[INVESTIGATOR_235983]. (Bupa rlisib Investigators Brochure) In this study, 
three out of five patients with moderate to severe mood alterations had a history of depression 
and/or anxiety. All patients with a documented medi cal history of depression/anxiety also 
developed mood alterations while treated with bupar lisib at the 100 mg dose level, thus 
reflecting a potential risk group of patients.  
 
In order to lower the risk of experiencing signific ant mood alterations within the proposed 
study, cancer patients with an active or history of  major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], bipolar disorder, 
obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, a his tory of suicide attempt or ideation, or 
homicide/homicidal ideation as judged by [CONTACT_41409]/or based on recent psychiatric 
assessment will not qualify for study participation . Patients with corresponding symptoms 
CTCAE Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_285851]  and closely followed 
medically. Medical treatment with mood stabilizers (2nd generation antipsychotics) such as 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_235984]’s discretion and following 
consultation with a psychiatrist.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Management of mood alteration 
Patient self-rating mood questionnaires PHQ-9 (depr ession) and GAD-7 (anxiety) will be 
administered by [CONTACT_236048]: 
• to support assessment of eligibility at Screening 
• to monitor for newly occurring or worsening mood al terations during the study. 
 
The following grading system will be used for this study (Table 4-2):

positive response of ‘1, 2, or 3’ to question numbe r 9 regarding suicidal thoughts or ideation 
will be excluded from the study.  
 
During the study, patients who meet the cut-off sco re of ≥ 10 ( ≥ CTCAE grade 2 mood 
alteration) in either questionnaire or who indicate  a positive response by [CONTACT_20683] ‘1, 2, or 3’ 
to question number 9 on the PHQ-9 (Table 4-4) must see a psychiatrist for diagnosis and 
determination of most appropriate medical treatment . For anxiety, this applies only if status 
has worsened from baseline. Patients who experience  ≥ grade [ADDRESS_285852] until resolved ≤ grade 1 or baseline (for anxiety). Questionnaire r esponses will be 
checked at weekly visits until resolution to Grade 1 or baseline (for anxiety).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Hyperglycemia 
In preclinical studies, insulin/glucose homeostasis  was impacted in various species (mice, rats, 
dogs), as expected from the mode of action of bupar lisib (Buparlisib Investigators Brochure). 
In both rats and dogs, at the doses used in the 4-w eek studies, these effects were minimal. 
However, in mice treated at high doses (30 or 60 mg /kg/day) a clear induction of insulin 
resistance/insensitivity was observed, without clea r influence of the dose or the time point of 
testing. Histopathologic changes were seen in anima l pancreas and liver samples which are in 
concordance with this activity.  
Grade 4 Hyperglycemia was also observed in an ongoi ng Phase Ia study of buparlisib in 
patients with solid tumors (CBKM120X2101). Therefor e, no patients with uncontrolled 
diabetes mellitus will be enrolled in this study. I n all patients, fasting plasma glucose will 
obtained at screening and will be monitored through out the trial. For the treatment of glucose 
disturbances occurring under buparlisib treatment i nvestigators are advised to adhere to the 
protocol guidelines outlined in Table 4-1. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Management of Hyperglycemia 
In addition to the dose modification and hyperglyce mia treatment guidelines in Table 4-1:

 • Under the supervision of an endocrinologist, an ins ulin regimen should be initiated 
according to institutional standard of care or the Treat-To-Target Algorithm for 
Lantus®(Riddle, Rosenstock, and Gerich 2003).   
• For any hyperglycemia ≥ grade 1, the patient should continue to follow die tary 
guidelines provided by [CONTACT_236050] (American Diabetes 
Association 2004). 
• For each patient, a maximum of [ADDRESS_285853] discontinue 
treatment with buparlisib, if after treatment is re sumed at a lower dose, hyperglycemia 
recurs at a worse severity. 
• For each patient, once a dose level reduction has o ccurred, the dose level may not be 
re-escalated in that patient during future treatmen t cycles with buparlisib. 
• Based upon the results of preliminary clinical data  and actual laboratory values (e.g., 
glucose, insulin) generated, the treatment recommen dations for study drug induced 
hyperglycemia may be modified as needed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiac events 
Cardiac safety studies, conducted in vitro and in v ivo, did not indicate a prominent 
electrophysiological risk. The only effect consider ed relevant was a trend towards an increase 
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, observed in two dog telemetry studies. As a 
precaution in the first-in-man study with buparlisi b no patients with a severe or unstable 
cardiac disease or cardiac disease requiring contin uous treatment, and no patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension will be enrolled in early  clinical studies. In addition, HER2 positive 
patients will be assessed for cardiac diseases befo re start of treatment, while HER2 positive 
patients enrolled in the trial will undergo regular  cardiac monitoring throughout the conduct 
of the trial. For the treatment of acute cardiac ev ents occurring under buparlisib treatment 
investigators are advised to adhere to the protocol  guidelines. Vital signs, including pulse rate 
and blood pressure, will be closely followed during  the early clinical studies. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Management of Cardiac events  
At the screening visit a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), will be performed to assess 
eligibility. Repeat ECGs will be performed at scree ning and as clinically indicated.  
At the screening visit an echocardiogram or MUGA (E CHO/MUGA) for HER2 positive 
patients only will be performed to assess eligibili ty. Cardiac imaging will be repeated at 4 
months and then every 4 months thereafter for HER2 positive patients only.  End of 
Treatment ECHO/MUGA not required.  There is window of +/- 7 business days for an 
ECHO/MUGA.  Any delay within this window is NOT a d eviation as per the visit schedule 
(Table 4-12).

 [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_285854] scan reveals a new ground glass or alveola r infiltrate.  
 
In ongoing clinical trials with buparlisib in the s ingle agent setting two cases of Pneumonitis 
occurred. In the study BKM120X2101 one patient expe rienced Pneumonitis (grade 2) eight 
weeks after the first dose of buparlisib at 100mg w hich resolved in 7 days after antibiotic 
therapy and discontinuation of the study treatment due to fatigue. In the Japanese study 
BKM120X1101 one case of Pneumonitis occurred in a p atient (given 100 mg) one month 
after the start of study medication with buparlisib . The patient experienced Pneumonitis with 
fatal outcome which was concomitant to progression of underlying malignancy including the 
progression of existing and the appearance of new l esions in combination with increasing 
pleural effusion (please see current Buparlisib Inv estigators Brochure for more details). 
 
All patients participating in clinical trials admin istering buparlisib will be routinely asked 
about the occurrence of adverse events which could include new or changed pulmonary 
symptoms (consistent with lung abnormalities). CT s cans and pulmonary function test should 
be done, as clinically indicated, or if there are s ymptoms that indicate that the patient has 
developed Pneumonitis. In case of a documented Pneu monitis, the guidelines (including the 
dose modifications) in Table 4-[ADDRESS_285855] is 
highly recommended for any Pneumonitis case identif ied during the study.

clinically indicated until the end of treatment with study medication. 
Patients who discontinued study treatment should be  monitored weekly, including LFTs or 
more frequently if clinically indicated until resolved to ≤ grade 1 or stabilization  (no 
CTCAE grade change over 4 weeks). 
4.1.3  Criteria for capecitabine dose modification 
A capecitabine dose reduction will be administered as described in Table 4-6 . For grade ≥2 
capecitabine-related toxicities (hand/foot syndrome , mucositis, diarrhea), capecitabine 
treatment should be delayed until resolution to gra de 0 or 1, then resumed at the next lower 
dose level. For each patient, a maximum of 2 dose r eductions will be allowed after which the 
patient will be discontinued from treatment with ca pecitabine. The dose of capecitabine does 
not need to be reduced for toxicities that the phys ician believes are due to buparlisib.  Initial 
dosing, as well as delays and/or dose reductions wi ll be recorded on the patient diary and the 
EDC.

 4.1.4  Trastuzumab – Cardiac Monitoring and Cardiomyopathy  Management 
Guidelines 
 
Trastuzumab dose modifications will be per physicia n’s discretion and standard of care. 
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be  assessed prior to initiation of trastuzumab 
and at regular intervals during treatment. Withhold  trastuzumab and capecitabine/buparlisib 
dosing for at least 4 weeks for either of the follo wing: 
 
• ≥ 16% absolute decrease in LVEF from pre-treatment v alues 
• LVEF below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from 
pretreatment values. 
 
Trastuzumab plus capecitabine/buparlisib may be res umed if, within 4−8 weeks, the LVEF 
returns to normal limits and the absolute decrease from baseline is ≤ 15%. Permanently 
discontinue trastuzumab and capecitabine/buparlisib  for a persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF 
decline or for suspension of trastuzumab dosing on more than 3 occasions for 
cardiomyopathy. If trastuzumab is stopped for toxic ity other than cardiac toxicity, 
capecitabine/buparlisib may be continued until PD o r intolerable toxicity. 
 
4.1.5  Reasons off treatment 
Patients will be taken off treatment if any of the following occur: 
1. Disease progression  
2. Intolerable toxicity  
Note: If any patient goes off study treatment due t o any adverse event, regardless 
of grade, the reason for off treatment will be docu mented as an “Adverse event” 
in eDC; the toxicity (regardless of grade) must be documented in the toxicity 
section of eDC with the action code entered that is  appropriate for discontinuation 
of study treatment. 
3. Physician decision. An intercurrent illness, which would in the judgment of the 
Investigator affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree or require 
discontinuation of study treatment, non protocol th erapy, or non-compliance. 
4. Becomes pregnant 
5. Patient refuses to continue treatment (patient will  continue to be followed for survival) 
6. Normal completion of treatment portion of the proto col 
 
The date of and reason for discontinuation must be noted on the Change of Status page of the 
eCRF. Every effort should be made to complete the a ppropriate assessments.

 4.1.6  Reasons for taking patients “off study” 
Patients will be considered “off study” if any of t he following occur:  
1. Termination of the study by [CONTACT_236051]/or the Sponso r decision 
2. Withdrawal of consent (patient will not be contacte d and no further information will 
be collected)  
Note: If the patient withdraws consent, then no addition al data will be collected 
without his/her explicit consent; all data collecte d prior to withdrawal of consent may 
be used in the data analysis. The only exception to  the collection of data after 
withdrawal of consent is collection of date of death  and cause of death (if available) 
when the endpoint of the study is mortality. 
3. Lost to follow-up (3 attempts should be documented in the patient’s source document 
before the site considers the patient as LFU.) 
4. Death 
5. Discontinuation of the patient when determined by t he Study Investigator that 
continuation of the patient on study is no longer i n the best medical interest of the 
patient.   
The appropriate information must be completed on th e Change of Status page of the eCRF. 
4.2  Treatments 
4.2.1  Study treatment administration 
Buparlisib 
The study drug buparlisib will be self-administered  (by [CONTACT_36129]). The

[IP_ADDRESS]  Drugs that are prohibited 
• Other investigational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_235987]. 
• Anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, biologic or radia tion therapy, and surgery) 
other than the study treatments must not be given t o patients while the patient is 
on the study. If such agents are required for a pat ient then the patient must be 
discontinued from the study. 
• In v i t r o  metabolism studies suggest that oxidative metaboli sm of buparlisib is 
predominantly mediated by [CONTACT_097]3A4 (fm>0.9), with onl y minor contributions of 
CYP1A1. As buparlisib is a sensitive CYP3A4 substra te, co-administration of 
buparlisib with any strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhi bitors and CYP3A4 
inducers is prohibited.  Refer to Table 4-[ADDRESS_285872] may not be comprehensive. 
• Based on in vitro studies, co-administration of bup arlisib with CYP3A4 inducers 
is predicted to decrease the systemic exposure to b uparlisib, thereby [CONTACT_236053].  Refer to Table 4-[ADDRESS_285873] may not be 
comprehensive. Therapeutic doses of warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) or  any 
other coumadin-derivative anticoagulants are not pe rmitted. 
• If a patient requires the concomitant use of any me dication included in Table 4-9 
entitled “List of Prohibited QT prolonging drugs” ( i.e., drugs that are generally 
accepted by [CONTACT_236054].org Advisory Board of the A rizona CERT to have a risk 
of causing Torsades des de Pointes), study treatmen t administration must be 
interrupted as long as the patient requires therapy  with the QT prolonging agent. 
• Herbal preparations/medications are not allowed thr oughout the study.  These 
herbal medications include, but are not limited to St. John’s wort, Kava, ephedra

Sensitive substrates: Drugs whose plasma AUC values  have been shown to increase 5-fold or higher when co-
administered with a potent inhibitor of the respect ive enzyme. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drugs to be used with caution 
Preliminary in vitro metabolism studies suggest tha t buparlisib is a weak, reversible inhibitor 
of CYP3A4/5 (Ki=13.6 µM, [I]/Ki= 0.4 where [I] is the average C max  at steady-state following 
100 mg daily dose) and a weak reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8/2C9/2C19 (IC 50 =34 µM, 
[I]/IC 50 =0.15). Note: that with the data available, we are not able to confirm whether such 
interactions will occur in patients. Therefore, inv estigators, at their discretion, may administer 
concomitant medications known to be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Patients receiving such medications must b e carefully monitored for potentiation 
of toxicity due to any individual concomitant medic ations, and may require dose titration or 
reduction of the drug substrate. Please refer to Ta ble 4-[ADDRESS_285877] of CYP450 substrates and 
carefully consider their co-administration with bup arlisib. 
Particular caution is advised when buparlisib is co -administered with: 
• Drugs which are substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2 C9 or CYP2C19 and which 
have a narrow therapeutic index. 
• Oral anti-diabetic drugs which are metabolized by C YP2C8 or CYP2C9 can possibly 
result in hypoglycemia. Patients who develop diabet es mellitus during the study 
should be treated according to the American Diabete s Association guidance. It is 
recommended that treatment start with metformin.  
• If a patient, after study enrollment, requires the concomitant use of any QT prolonging 
medication with a possible or conditional risk for Torsade de Pointes then the 
investigators, at their discretion, may co-administ er such medications. Patients 
receiving such medications must be monitored.  Refe r to Table 4-[ADDRESS_285878] of QT 
prolonging medications to be used with caution.  
Note: please refer also to Table 4-[ADDRESS_285879] of prohibited QT prolonging 
medications.  
• Please refer to Table 4-[ADDRESS_285880] of CYP450 sub strates and carefully consider their 
co-administration with buparlisib.  
• Concomitant treatment with corticosteroids and bupa rlisib should be avoided, 
whenever possible, during this study. A short durat ion (< 2 weeks) of systemic 
corticosteroids is allowed (e.g. for chronic obstru ctive pulmonary disease, or as an 
anti-emetic).  Chronic dosing of corticosteroids is  known to induce CYP3A enzymes,

 Neurologic Assessment 
Neurologic assessment should be performed at baseli ne, every 8 weeks following initiation of 
study treatment, and at the end of treatment visit.  Assessment should include cranial nerves 
exam, and motor and sensory exam. In addition, pati ents should be assessed both for ability 
to walk and for balance using the following criteri a: 
• Normal  
• Mildly impaired 
• Moderately impaired 
• Severely impaired (in wheelchair) 
 
Exploratory biomarker analysis – formalin-fixed Par affin-embedded (FFPE) tumor 
samples  
Tumor tissue (formalin fixed new biopsy or archival ) is required, and will be stored for future 
analysis of markers shown to be closely associated with the PI3K pathway, including but not 
limited to PTEN and INPP4B. One tumor block (prefer red) or a minimum of [ADDRESS_285891] cancer may be submitted.  
 
Since the archival samples may not be located at th e institution where the original diagnosis 
was rendered, the investigational sites will be res ponsible for locating them and preparing the 
unstained slides (or having them prepared), if nece ssary. 
 
For all tumor samples, the sample collection inform ation must be captured on the  relevant 
eCRF page(s) and laboratory requisition form(s).  
 
Tumor samples will be sent to designated lab (check  CTI) for analysis. See Collection of 
Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_236006] d etailed instruction on sample 
preparation and submission information. 
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_285892] of the following: m onitoring and recording of all adverse 
events and serious adverse events; the regular moni toring of hematology, blood chemistry, 
urinalysis; regular measurement of vital signs, oxy gen saturation, physical examination, 
including weight; and performance status. 
 
These assessments should be performed periodically throughout the study, except for adverse 
events that will be evaluated continuously. 
 
All patients who receive at least one dose of study  drug will be evaluated for safety. 
Toxicities will be graded and reported according to  the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 (Appendix 3). I ncidence and type of AEs will be 
tabulated and summarized using descriptive statisti cs.

[ADDRESS_285893] or other 
means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. An adverse event is any 
undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occu rring after starting study drug (or 
therapy) even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug (or therapy). Study 
drug (or therapy) includes the drug (or therapy) un der evaluation given during any phase of 
the trial. 
 
 If it is unclear what study treatment includes, li st all drug(s), other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], changes to 
existing therapy, diagnostic procedure, etc. that a re specified by [CONTACT_760]. 
 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting  study treatment are only considered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment (ie, any procedures specified in 
the protocol). Adverse events occurring before star ting study treatment but after signing the 
informed consent form are recorded at baseline. Abn ormal laboratory values or test results 
constitute adverse events only if they induce clini cal signs or symptoms or require therapy, 
and are recorded.

reported to Delta within 24 hours of learning of it s occurrence. A serious adverse event is an 
undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition whi ch : 
 
1. is fatal or life-threatening 
2. required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
3. results in persistent or significant disability/inc apacity  
4. constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect 
5. is medically significant, may jeopardize the subjec t, and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome s listed above. 
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:  
 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indi cation, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition  
• treatment, which was elective or pre-planned, for a  pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen

 • treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given above and not resultin g in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
 
Pregnancy, although not itself a serious adverse ev ent, should also be reported on a serious 
adverse event form or pregnancy form and be followe d up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of bi rth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects or congenital abnormalities. 
 
Any serious adverse event occurring after the patie nt has provided informed consent, has 
started taking the study medication, and until [ADDRESS_285895] medical treatment given to a pati ent (e.g., treatment withdrawal during

Follow-up information should describe whether the e vent has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated, and whether the patient continu ed or discontinued study participation. 
The MedWatch form, Delta SAE coversheet, and fax co nfirmation sheet must be retained.  
  
Pregnancy follow-up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary 
or spontaneous termination, details of the birth, a nd the presence or absence of any 
congenital abnormalities or birth defects.  
  
Adverse events will be recorded for the duration of  a patient’s study treatment. All AEs, 
regardless of causal relationship, are to be record ed in the source documentation. The 
Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis sh ould be documented as the AE/SAE and 
not the individual signs/symptoms. 
  
All AEs will be graded and reported according to th e NCI Common Toxicity Criteria 
(version 4.03). The relationship of each event to t he study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_236059]. Additional i nformation about each event, such as 
treatment required, whether or not the study drug h ad to be discontinued, and eventual 
outcome will also be recorded on the eCRF.  
 
Reporting to [COMPANY_001]

occurring at a different time interval or otherwise  considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separate ly as a new event. 
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorde d on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be c ompleted in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The investigator must assess and r ecord the relationship of each SAE to each

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancies 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment 
must be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of lea rning of its occurrence. The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, includi ng spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence  or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complicat ions. 
 
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pr egnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_236060] a nd Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E). 
Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment 
of the possible relationship of buparlisib  to any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced 
during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report  Form. 
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_285899] ( β-HCG) is required for all women of child-bearing po tential at 
screening, within [ADDRESS_285900] dose of buparlisib. Note: Postmenopausal women 
must have been amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months in order to be considered “of non-childb earing 
potential”. This should be documented appropriately  in the patient’s medical history.  
Additional pregnancy tests should be performed as c linically indicated.  
Hematology 
Hematology includes the following parameters: compl ete blood count (CBC) consisting of 
red blood cell (RBCs), a total white blood cell cou nt (WBC) with differential (total 
neutrophil count including bands, lymphocyte, monoc yte, eosinophil, and basophil counts); 
hemoglobin (Hgb); and platelet count to be obtained  on the first day of each cycle.  Lab 
assessments may be performed within 3 business days  prior to the scheduled visit. 
Coagulation Profile 
The coagulation profile includes prothrombin time o r INR, and activated partial 
thromboplastin time to be drawn within 24 hours of the intended visit.  
Serum chemistry  
Biochemistry includes the K+, Na+, Ca++, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (direct and indirect), 
creatinine, GGT, alkaline phosphatase (fractionated  if alkaline phosphatase is grade 2 or 
higher), bicarbonate, glucose, urea or BUN, albumin , and total protein to be obtained on the 
first day of each cycle.  Lab assessments may be pe rformed within 3 business days prior to 
the scheduled visit.  
Because accurate serum glucose and lipid measuremen ts are required, patients should be 
fasting at the time of the blood sampling.

 4.3.9  Vital signs 
Vital sign assessment consists of height (first vis it), pulse, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], 
temperature and weight. Blood pressure, pulse and r espi[INVESTIGATOR_89394] [ADDRESS_285901] c omprise a total body examination 
(general appearance, skin, neck, including thyroid,  eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities and basic n ervous system). 
Significant findings made after the start of study drug which meet the definition of an 
Adverse Event must be recorded. 
4.3.11  Neuropsychiatric assessments 
Patient self-rating mood questionnaires for anxiety  and depression (PHQ-9, GAD-7) will be 
applied at: 
• Screening 
• Days 1 of Cycle 1 
• Day 1 of Cycle 2 
• Day 1 of Cycle 3 and subsequent cycles (only for pa tients who have not shown 
mood alterations during the first [ADDRESS_285902] mood 
alterations should continue to fill out the questio nnaire on a weekly base). 
• End of Study treatment 
Additional assessments may be done according to the  clinical judgment of the Investigator. 
Symptomatic patients ( ≥ CTCAE grade 1) must continue with questionnaires o n a weekly 
basis while active on the treatment portion of the study. The nurse or the CRC will provide 
the patient with the instruments and the instructio ns on how to complete the questionnaires, 
as well as how to determine the scores. See Appendi ces 5 and 6 for questionnaires. 
4.3.12  ECG/EKG –ECHO/MUGA 
A standard 12 lead ECG is to be performed at screen ing and as clinically indicated.   
An echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA will be performed to assess eligibility for HER2 
positive patients only. ECHO/MUGA will be repeated at 4 month intervals thereafter for 
HER2 positive patients only. There is window of +/-  7 business days for an ECHO/MUGA.  
Any delay within this window is NOT a deviation as per the visit schedule (Table 4-12). 
4.3.13  Performance status 
Performance status will be assessed at screening an d per the visit schedule. The ECOG 
Performance Status Scale will be used. (See Appendi x 2)

6 Statistical methods 
6.1  Populations for analysis 
6.1.1  Analysis populations 
 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Population: Includes all patients registered on the study (elig ible 
and ineligible). This ITT population will be includ ed in overall patient listings, in summary 
tables of patient demographics and baseline disease  characteristics, and also in the list of 
treatment discontinuations after enrollment. This p opulation will also be used for analyses of 
overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) .  
 
Evaluable Population:  Includes all eligible patients who meet the protoc ol-specified 
efficacy analyses requirements and who have receive d at least 1 dose of study drug. This 
population will comprise those with a CR, PR, SD, P D, or NE response.  
 
Safety Population:  Includes all patients (eligible and ineligible) wh o receive at least 1 dose 
of study drug. This safety population will also be used for the summaries and analysis of all 
safety parameters (drug exposure, tables of adverse  events information, including serious 
adverse events, etc).  
 
6.1.2  Patient characteristics 
All patients entered in the study will be accounted  for in the summation. Patient 
demographics and baseline characteristics such as a ge, race, sex, ECOG PS, and 
ER/PR/HER2 status will be described. Disease stage and histology at baseline, medical 
history, and prior treatment, including WBRT and SR S, will also be summarized. Mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum val ues will be presented for continuous

[ADDRESS_285904] been previously treated with WBRT or 
SRS or both.  
 
CBR will be the primary endpoint for this study and  is defined as objective response (CR + 
PR) plus stable disease ≥[ADDRESS_285905]-related biomarkers and clinical response ar e the secondary endpoints and will also 
be followed and described in this study.   
6.3  Sample size and projected study duration 
14 patients will be entered into each of 3 patient cohorts: ER+/HER2-, HER2+, and triple 
negative disease.    If the true CBR is 30% in any of the 3 cohorts, observing 3 of 10 patients 
achieving clinical benefit will yield a 90% confide nce interval for CBR from 6-54%. If the 
true CBR is 15% in any of the 3 cohorts, observing 3 of 10 patients achieving clinical benefit 
will yield a 90% confidence interval for CBR from 1 -34%.    If 3 or more of the 14 patients . 
in any cohort has clinical benefit from the combina tion, we will discuss with [COMPANY_001] the 
potential of expanding that cohort to enroll additi on patients. With an estimated accrual rate 
of 3 patients per month, a follow-up of 12 months, and an additional 6 months for data lock 
and report development, the total time to the initi al release of findings would be around 2.5 
years. 
 
6.4  Statistical methods 
6.4.1  Primary efficacy analysis 
CBR in the patients following WBRT or SRS or both w ill be the primary endpoint and is 
calculated as the total number of responders (CR or  PR) plus stable disease greater than or 
equal to 24 weeks (CR + PR + SD ≥ 24 weeks) divided by [CONTACT_236061].  .

 6.4.2  Secondary efficacy analysis 
The incidence of responses of CR, PR, ORR, SD, PD, and NE (using RECIST 1.1) with 95% 
CI will be tabulated and summarized using descripti ve statistics by [CONTACT_236062]-binomial 
method in the evaluable population. Time to respons e and duration of response will be 
calculated.  
 
OS will be measured from the date of registration t o the date of death for patients who die. If 
a patient is still alive or is lost to follow up, t he patient will be censored at the last contact 
[CONTACT_568]. OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier m ethod  and Breast-GPA-estimated 
method in the ITT population. Number of Patients wh o died, and causes of death will be 
reported. The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) wi ll be calculated by [CONTACT_236063], 
subtype of breast cancer, and age group (Appendix 1 ).  TTP will be calculated from the date 
of registration to the date of the first documented  progression or the date of death due to 
disease progression, whichever comes first. If the patient did not progress or die due to 
disease progression, the patient will be censored a t the date of last contact. TTP will be 
summarized using the Kaplan-Meier method in the ITT  population.  
 
Toxicity profiles will be tabulated in the safety p opulation. Toxicities will be graded 
according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria fo r Adverse Events (version 4.0). 
Subjects enrolled in this study will be carefully m onitored during the entire treatment phase 
and will be followed as is appropriate. Incidence a nd type of adverse events, including 
serious adverse events, will be tabulated. Adverse events that occur >[ADDRESS_285906] clearly identify  the protocol, any amendments, the Patient

implications of participation to potential patients  or to their legal representatives. They will 
be told about the possible risks and benefits, and the possible adverse experiences. They will 
be informed that patients’ participation is volunta ry, and that they may withdraw consent to 
participate at any time. They will also be informed  that if patients choose not to participate in 
the trial, alternative treatments are available; su ch refusal will not prejudice further treatment 
of their disease. Potential patients or their legal  representatives must be given the opportunity 
to ask questions about the trial protocol and the p rocedures involved. 
 
Finally, each patient will be told that his or her records may be accessed by [CONTACT_236065]’s 
confidentiality, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_236066]/or regulations. By [CONTACT_236067], the pati ent or his or her legal representative is 
authorizing such access. Following this explanation  and prior to entry into the trial, the 
written, dated, and signed Patient Informed Consent  Form must be obtained from each 
patient or his or her legal representative; a copy will be given to the person signing the form.

 7.1.3  Confidentiality of records 
The Treating Physician is required to retain, in a confidential manner, sufficient information 
on each patient (i.e., full name, current address, and social security number) so that the 
patient may be contact[CONTACT_236068]. 
7.2  Study Records 
7.2.1  Documentation 
For each patient treated with the study drug(s), th e Research Coordinator is required to 
prepare and maintain case histories that include al l observations and other data pertinent to 
the investigation. This will include all source doc uments needed to verify the accuracy of all 
observations and other data contained in the eCRFs on each study patient. 
 
The Treating Physician or his/her designee is requi red to retain the records related to the trial 
for a period of [ADDRESS_285909] be retained until 2 years after the 
investigation is discontinued and the regulatory ag encies are notified. 
 
The Treating Physician shall retain study drug disp osition records, copi[INVESTIGATOR_1495] (or 
electronic files), and source documents for the max imum period required by [CONTACT_236069], or for the period spec ified by [CONTACT_150938], whichever is longer. The 
Investigator must contact [CONTACT_236070]. 
 
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g.,  relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g ., another investigator, IRB). Prior notice 
of such transfer will be given in writing to Delta.  
 
7.2.2  Electronic case report form procedures 
 
Data will be entered at the site using eCRFs. The T reating Physician or his/her designee is 
responsible for recording all data relating to the trial on the eCRFs. The Treating Physician 
must verify that all data entries on the eCRFs are accurate and correct. eCRFs must be 
completed within 7 calendar days  of the end of each cycle and within 7 calendar days  
following completion of study therapy. 
 
If an item is not available or is not applicable, i t should be documented as such; no blank 
spaces should be left on any eCRF. 
 
For patients removed from study, their eCRFs must t hen be completed within 7 calendar 
days  of the date of removal from the study. Long-term s urvival information will be collected.

 7.3  Monitoring/Site Visits 
Study sites are subject to be monitored by [CONTACT_43038] y sponsor or their designee, and/or by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) or other regulat ory agencies. To ensure accuracy, a 
minimal data set from the eCRFs will be compared wi th a subset of the original patient source 
documents during site visits. The monitor may also review case histories, laboratory 
certifications, IRB records, drug accountability re cords, and other source documentation. At 
all times, patients’ confidentiality will be mainta ined. 
Monitoring will take place at different sites. The monitoring plan will be developed by [CONTACT_236071]. 
7.[ADDRESS_285910] be agreed upon by [CONTACT_236072]. 
 
General administrative changes to the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that 
do not affect the manner in which the study is to b e conducted. Such administrative changes 
will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_236073] d in a memorandum. The applicable IRB 
will be notified of administrative changes accordin g to applicable IRB guidelines.

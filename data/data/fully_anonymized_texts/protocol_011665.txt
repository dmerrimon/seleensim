5  Protocol Summary  
Title:  Impact of Representative Payee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized People Living with 
HIV/AIDS  
 Précis:  This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will test the impact of Client- Centered Representative 
Payee (CCRP) services on marginalized people living with HIV/AIDS. The primary research center is the 
University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467686] , in Philadelphia, PA,  Allies for Health + 
Wellbeing and The Open Door, in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA  and Birmingham AIDS Outreach, in Birmingham, A L 
(referred to going forward as “study sites .”)  
 We hypothesize that by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_467687], housing stability will 
improve  and financial stress will decrease . Financial management will occur via a policy of the Social 
Security Administration referred to as Representative Payee, which enables a person or organization to 
manage bills and entitlements on behalf of an individual with need . By [CONTACT_467764], clients  will be able t o devote 
more time to medical appointments and medication adherence. Ultimately, we believe that this program  
will improve clients’ self -efficacy for health behaviors, retention in care, medication adherence, CD4 
counts, and viral loads.  
 
Participants (n= 160) will be randomized to the intervention or the  standard of care. An additional [ADDRESS_599377] clinical and self- report data for participants in the four  arms and use mixed 
methods to explore underlying mechanisms contributing to changes in adherence and viral suppression 
rates . Self-assessment d ata will be collected at baseline, 3- month, 6-month, and 12 -month time points 
and will incorporate the following primary domains: ART adherence, housing instability, self- efficacy for 
health behaviors, financial stress, and retention in care.  Mini check- ins will occur at 1 - and 9 -month time 
points. Viral load, CD4, and appointment adherence data will be collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 
months, 18 months, and 24 months via abstraction from the study sites’  patient records. Mixed methods 
will be used to test our hypotheses, including a mediation analysis, process measures, survey measures, 
and qualitative interviews  with eligible individuals including those that didn’t want to participate in the 
study . Qualitative interviews  will also be conducted with [ADDRESS_599378] threshold, and costutility  of the CCRP model.  
 Study Period:  May 2017 –April 2022  
 Active Participant Duration:  12 months  plus 12 additional months of clinical monitoring  
 Population:   People living with HIV/AIDS who are 18 years of age and older, English - or Spanish -
speaking, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_467688] (SSI and/ or SSDI), not currently receiving

Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599385] shown the association between financial strain and poor health outcomes including 
impaired functional status (1), serious  health conditions (2), and all-cause mortality (3) . These associations are magnified  
within the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901]. Low socioeconomic resources are associated with poor  engagement in care and failed viral 
suppression (4). Homelessness has been shown to exacerbate both HIV transmission and progression to AIDS (5) . 
Housing instability is also correlated  with lower rates of engagement in care and treatment adherence among PLWH A 
(6). Individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) have higher rates of substance use and mental health issues (7 -11), 
which have reciprocal relationships with low SES, and each of these factors is correlated  with HIV health disparities (12 -
16). Individuals with low SES also have higher rates of housing i nstability. These factors create a syndemic (17)  that 
produces higher rates of HIV infection; poorer engagement, retention, and adherence to  care; and higher  risk of 
nega tive outcomes including death.  
 
Interventions to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence have demonstrated gains, but critical gaps remain as indicated by [CONTACT_467765]. A rec ent systematic 
review of [ADDRESS_599386]-effectiveness , long -term effectiveness, and effectiveness within specific populations 
(18).  
 Further, there is a lack of structural interventions to improve ART adherence, which represents missed opportunities to reduce HIV health disparities. Structural interventions aim  to alter social, political, or economic contexts in order to  
improve public health (19, 20) . Rather than focusing on these fundamental issues, most interventions seeking to 
improve ART adherence and rates of viral suppression work on behavioral levels, placing the burden on the individual to create change. However, behavioral changes are greatly  influenced  by [CONTACT_467766] (18) . Few published studies have examined the impact of structural interventions on ART 
adherence. In the previously cited systematic review, only 10 of 126 interventions focused on structural  approaches, and 
these intervened primarily by [CONTACT_467767] . 
Of those 10 studies, only 1 demonstrated significant effects on both biologic and subjective or objective adherence 
outcomes (18). Because structural interventions seek to change the context in which health is p roduced (19) they 
present the best potential for broader reach and durability of effects.   
 Structural interventions to impr ove HIV outcomes are clearly  needed, and these must seek to improve ART adherence 
by [CONTACT_467768]. Research in this area so far is limited. Some  studies have suggested 
that monetary incentives for HIV testing, retention in care (21), and ART adherence (2 2) may be effective ; however, little 
is known  about the long- term durability and effectiveness of these interventions, which may require incentives to 
continue indefinitely and do not address underlying socioeconomic factors. Research outside of the field of HIV has 
described two pathways between low SES and poor health outcomes: neo -materialism and biopsychosocial pathways  
(3). The former describes the impac t of limited resources, such as food, housing, and access to care, on sub -optimal 
health behaviors and ultimately health outcomes (23), while the latter describes stressors resulting from financial strain, 
which directly impact health outcomes (2). The cumulative load of financial stress has been shown to have a long -term 
effect on health (2) , and poverty has been shown to directly impede cognitive function by [CONTACT_467769] (24). The concept of Competing Neurobehavioral Decision Systems describes the 
process in which long- term, healthy behavioral decision- making is co -opted by [CONTACT_467770], which 
requires a high burden of mental processes to juggle demands a nd make financial tradeoffs (24). Thus, future studies of 
adherence improvement interventions targeted to PLWH A who have low SES should test the degree to which they not 
only help clients stabilize resources but also ease their perceptions of stress associated with chronic financial crises.  
 Client -Centered Rep Payee is a structural intervention that may mitigate the effects of economic disadvantage to 
improve housing and financial stability, enabling self- efficacy for health outcomes and improved  ART adherence. Client -
Centered Rep Payee (CCRP) helps clients to consistently pay their bills including rents and utilities. By [CONTACT_467771], which often cause stress for people with low SES, clients can focus on other aspects of their lives 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599387] the expenditure of participants’ resources to ward improved 
health behaviors. Shifting the focus of material and biopsychosocial resources may change the context in which health 
behaviors are produced, contributing to higher rates of adherence and viral suppression.  
 CCRP modifies the implementation  of a current policy of the Social Security Administration (SSA) to create an 
intervention that is highly replicable. Representative payee services have been shown to decrease homelessness and 
money mismanagement and to improve quality of life among people w ith mental health or substance use disorders (25) . 
In some settings, representative  payee has been provided to individuals with serious  mental illness specifically to 
enforce appointment adherence, with the idea that if clients must visit the provider to gain access to funds, they will also gain access to clinical care (26) . However, this approach has also been associated  with clients’ experiences of 
coercion and reduced autonomy (27) . Our CCRP model modifies implementation  of the traditional representative payee 
approach by [CONTACT_467772] -making and goal-setting while providing financial management service s 
through the long-standing SSA policy. Emphasizing client autonomy is an important  addition to traditional 
representative payee services,  because these approaches engender trust and strengthen the relationship between the 
client and the provider, improving retention in care (28 -30).  
 This intervention is targeted  to vulnerable individuals who receive public entitlements, including Supplemental Security 
Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability In surance  (SSDI), both of which fund basic needs for people with disabilities. 
Eligibility status for SSI includes US citizens who are aged, blind, and/or  disabled, and who have very limited  income and 
financial resources. SSDI has similar eligibility requirements; the main difference be tween the two is that people who 
receive SSDI have worked for a number of  years and have made contributions to the Social Security Trust fund.  
 CCRP can be embedded within existing services in HIV clinical settings  and will include medical case managers and 
financial managers . Medical case managers refer clients to CCRP. Each client completes a request to SSA to appoint the 
Rep Payee  prior to  initiation of financial management services, and SSA authorization typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] 3 months. 
Clients may te rminate the representative payee appointment at any time by [CONTACT_17258] a form to SSA. The medical case 
manager helps the client to create a budget and prioritize expenditures, focusing on housing and utilities in order to  
enhance housing stability. The med ical case manager therefore becomes the point- person for the CCRP service. Money 
management is provided by a representative payee financial manager who sets up a bank account on behalf of the client. Once the SSA authorizes the organizational payee, Social Security entitlements (SSI and/or  SSDI) are sent directly 
to that account. Checks or electronic transfers are paid by [CONTACT_467773], including landlords and utility companies. The financial  manager is not identified to the client, which not only is a safety 
precaution but also helps to ensure that discussions about budgeting and practical needs become part of the ongoing conversation between the client and the case manager.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467692] A who have low SES is feasible, acceptable to the clients, and effective  in 
improving viral suppression. In the past nine years, [ADDRESS_599388] received these 
services through a transitional housing program called The Open Door (TOD). TOD is a nonprofit organization established in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA in 2006, to improve clinical outcomes for homeless people living with HIV/AIDS. The organization uses a housing first model of care to stabilize PLWH A who are chronically homeless and prioritizes services for individuals who 
are likely to be poorly retained in traditional care services, including people with serious  mental illness, substance use 
disor ders, and criminal histories. Housing first prioritizes providing individuals who are homeless with safe and stable 
housing as quickly as possible, without placing any pre -determined expectations on the client, and then providing 
supportive services as nee ded. TOD has been nationally recognized  as a successful and cost -effective program to 
improve HIV outcomes for its marginalized target population. We have published several studies demonstrating the effectiveness of this program, including the first and on ly study to date that uses viral load to measure the impact of the 
housing first model of care on homeless  PLWH A (31, 32) .  
 Though its initial mission was to provide supportive housing to marginalized PLWH A as a means of addressing 
homelessness, through mixed methods research conducted with residents of TOD we determined that clients responded positively to this service, credited it with their improved adherenc e, and in fact maintained TOD as their representative 
payee long af ter leaving the housing program.  These facts suggest that this service can help prevent homelessness and

11 
 stabilize other health outcomes. In 2012, TOD expanded its CCRP services to make it available not only to individuals 
housed in its building but also to other PLWH A at risk for homelessness. In a recent satisfaction survey of 29 participants, 
77% of CCRP clients who were housed  at TOD and 92% of clients not housed at TOD reported being “s atisfied” or “very 
satisfied” with CCRP services (33). Moreover, 90% of CCRP clients have kept the program as their Rep Payee  for [ADDRESS_599389] dropped from the intervention, 5 
of them “graduated” from the program, meaning they had stabilized their housing and financial situations sufficiently to manage budgeting independently. One individual left the program after losing his SSI benefits due to incarceration, and 
only two left because they were unhappy with having someone else manage their money.  
 Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_467693]. Our first study assessed changes in viral load data for 40 clients who received Client -Centered Rep Payee  between December 2012 and January 2014. After 
excluding clients housed at TOD in order to  remove any potential interaction with housing effects as well as clients that 
had no vira l load data available at baseline, our final sample included 18 participants. Seven of the 18 participants 
(38.9%) had viral suppression at baseline (VL<200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml), and 16 (88.9%) of the 18 had achieved viral suppression at the six- month follow up (p=. 004; McNemar’s test for paired data) (34). More recently we determined that of 40 
participants receiving Client -Centered Rep Payee , 82% had suppressed viral loads at both [ADDRESS_599390]  received CCRP services to date were unstably housed , either chronically homeless or at risk 
for homelessness; demonstrated poor retention in care and/or  had not achieved suppressed viral load; and  had histories 
of serious  mental illness and substance use. The results of these pi[INVESTIGATOR_467694],  but limited by [CONTACT_467774].  
 
3.[ADDRESS_599391] of financial management services on ART adherence and viral suppression. 
Given the well -documented associations between financial disadvantage and negative  health outcomes, particularly HIV 
disparities, this approach is not only long overdue,  but also may significantly change ways in which providers engage and 
retain clients  in care. We are proposing multiple models of adherence measures, including those that are subjective 
(self- report via the CASE Adherence Index) , objective (appointment adherence), and clinical (CD4 and viral load tests). 
Use of multiple measures of adherence improves the validity of findings of intervention effectiveness (18). 
 
Including estimates of cost and cost -effectiveness adds critical information about the value of this intervention beyond 
clinical outcomes. In the [LOCATION_002] in 2013, state and federal Medicaid spending on HIV care exceeded $9.6 billion 
(35). Most people who receive Medicaid care qualify because they are disabled, have low income, and receive SSI, and 
therefore represent the target population for this intervention. Improving retention in care can significantly reduce the cost of HIV care in t he US (36). CCRP may require a small investment yet result in significant cost savings to federal 
programs including Medicaid.  
 
CCRP is a feasible approach that may change the clinical trajectory of HIV for the most marginalized PLWH A, whose 
health disparities are the drivers of this disease. This intervention has already been pi[INVESTIGATOR_467695], as well as with individuals with criminal histories, mental health 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599392] a life span  of two years or less (18) . This is problematic because adherence is a life -long 
commitment, and because ART initiation is moving earlier into HIV disease stages.  
 
CCRP requires a relatively low investment of resources, and can , therefore, be provided  as long  as clients receive Social 
Security entitlements. In addition , it is highly replicable. The intervention builds on a Social Security Administration 
policy that has been in effect for more than fifty years, which has often been  used in clinical and communit y-based 
settings. If found to be efficacious as an adherence improvement mechanism, there is already a system in place through the Social Security Administration that would allow for rapid replication. In this sense, this study will test an approach to  
improving ART adherence that has been hiding in plain sight. By [CONTACT_467775], cost -effectiveness, and 
underlying mechanisms that produce ART adherence and viral suppression, we can create a complete blueprint for how to implement a structural interv ention for the most marginalized and resource -challenged PLWH . Using a mixed -
methods approach will further help us define factors that improve client acceptance and retention and prepare the 
intervention  for broad -scale replication. By [CONTACT_467776], we will not only know the impact of CCRP on 
viral load and the costs of providing the intervention,  but will also be able to streamline the intervention , creating a road 
map  for rapid replication.  
 
3.2 Hypotheses  and Aims  
 We hypothesize that by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_467687], housing stability improves and financial stress decreases. By [CONTACT_467777], clients can devote more tim e and attention to medical appointments and medication adherence. Ultimately, we 
believe that this program improves clients’ self- efficacy for health behaviors, retention in care, medication adherence, 
CD4 counts, and viral loads. We propose the following aims to test these hypotheses via a randomized controlled trial of 160 PLWH A and cohort study of 50 PLWHA  (choice arm) .   
 
Aim 1:  Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort study  (choice arm)  to test the effect of Client -
Centered Rep Payee on ART medication adherence and viral load among PLWH A who are economically 
disadvantaged and unstably housed. We will compare clinical adherence through behavioral and biological 
measures including self -repo rted appointment adherence and viral load for clients  receiving the intervention versus 
those receiving standard of care.  
 Aim 2. Test underlying mechanisms associated with Client -Centered Rep Payee that contribute to changes in 
medication adherence and vi ral suppression rates . We will use quantitative (mediation analysis) and qualitative 
(semi -structured interview) methods to test hypothesized mediators of medication adherence and viral suppression 
including financial and housing instability, financial str ess, self- efficacy for health behaviors, and retention in care.  
 Aim 3. Assess the cost and cost- effectiveness of the Client -Centered Rep Payee model. We will conduct  an 
economic analysis to model the impact of the intervention as compared with standard of care on quality -adjusted  
life years as well as new infections averted.  
 3.[ADDRESS_599393], and feasibility. 
Individuals who consent to particip ate will be randomized ( 2:1) to the standard of care plus CCRP intervention group or 
the standard of care control group. This allocation is to ensure more participants are randomized to the intervention arm, increasing the amount of data available to analy ze intervention effects. Given this intervention may have value for 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599394] been 
added to the study. Participants (n=25) who d emonstrate significant need or who are mandated to receive 
representative payee services by [CONTACT_467778]. To determine if immediate assignment to rep payee via the choice intervention arm  is warranted , the following questions will be used to 
guide discussions with clients and their providers:  
 
• Is there risk of housing loss, as evidenced by [CONTACT_467779], eviction notices, and/or utility shut -offs in the 
past year?  
• Is there risk of money mismanagement  because the client is being persuaded to use money in ways they don’t 
want to?  
• Would it be unethical to wait to provide Rep Payee services? ( Given  all participants can get Payee within 12 
months.)   
  Additionally, 25 clients who meet study inclusion criteria will be recruited to the choice control arm. These clients will receive care as usual.  
 
The study population is limited to PLWH A who are  18 years of age and older, English- or Spanish -speaking, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_467696] (SSI and/or S SDI), not currently receiving representative payee services n or hav ing received 
them in the past 12 months, income below 138% of the federal poverty level, and one or more of the following: not virally suppressed  (>200copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml) , unsustained viral suppression over the past [ADDRESS_599395] of care, providers  at study sites  currently use either the CASE Adherence Index (poor adherence is indicated 
by a CASE Index score of  ≤10) or by a single question to assess the per centage of missed dosages in the past week (poor 
adherence is indicated by a score of less than 90%) . When using the CASE Index for screening eligibility the most recent 
CASE score must be used and the score cannot be more than [ADDRESS_599396] historical viral load data but are not suppressed  at baseline or who meet other inclusion criteria (poor 
self- reported adherence) will be eligible for the study .  
 
These inclusion criteria will enable us to provide services to a population that historically struggles with ART adherence 
and low rates of viral suppression. We will also be able to  assess the extent to which CCRP helps stabilize clients  who 
may be virally suppressed at baseline but are not likely to stay that way due to poor adherence history. Including clients  
who have viral suppression at baseline but have poor adherence or have n ot sustained suppression over time is critical; 
a recent study that followed clients  over a three- year period found that of those who had viral suppression at baseline, 
20-25% subsequently had viral failure or were lost to follow up (37). 
 
4.[ADDRESS_599397] of Client- Centered Rep Payee services on ART adherence of people living with HIV/AIDS 
(PLWH ), we will randomize 160  individuals to intervention or control arms  and recruit 50 non-randomized individuals to 
the choice arm s. Inclusion criteria are living with HIV/AIDS, 18 years of age and older, English- or Spanish -speaking, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_467688] (SSI or SSDI), not currently receiving representative payee services n or having

 adherence, p roviders will use the CASE Adherence Index (poor adherence is indicated by a CASE Index score of ≤ 10) or a 
single question to assess the percentage of missed dosages in the past week (poor adherence is indicated  by a score of 
less than 90%). When using the CASE Index for screening eligibility the most recent CASE score must be used and the 
score cannot be more than [ADDRESS_599399] historical viral load data but are not

provide services to a population that historically struggles with ART adherence and low rates of sustained viral suppression.  
 
Action Wellness , The Open Door , and Birmingham AIDS Outreach  (BAO)  will serv e as the intervention sites for this study.  
In addition, Allies for Health + Wellbeing (Allies) will support recruitment, consenting, and data collection efforts in 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA, referring participants to The Open Door for intervention activities.  
 Action Wellness  is a community -based organization that provides comprehensive health services to PLWH A including 
clinical care, adherence support, supportive services, consumer education, research, and advocacy. Action Wellness  
provides clinical care  to 2,100 PLWH A annually.  
 
The Open Door, Inc. is a  grassroots, 501(c)3 non -profit organization located in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467697]. The program has 
been serving chronically homeless PLWAH since 2006 and is the organization that developed the CCRP intervention. The 
Open Door (TOD) has served hundreds of marginalized individuals in the past decade, and provides representative payee 
services to nearly 100 people at any point in time. TOD works to both  solve  the homeless problem for those already on 
the streets with its supportive homes a nd prevent  others from becoming homeless with representative payee services.  
Birmingham AIDS Outreach is a 501(c)3 non -profit organization located in Birmingham, Alabama. The organization works 
in collaboration with the University of Alabama 1917 clinic. They provide free services to HIV positive individuals as well 
as free HIV testing and prevention services in the greater Birmingham and surrounding areas. the organization provides 
case management, counseling, and legal services. The mission of the organization is to provide financial, emotional, and 
home health support to individuals with HIV and AIDS and to provide educational information to the community with 
the goal of reducing the spread of AIDS. Birmingham AIDS Outreach will work in collaboration with the 1917 Clinic at the 
University of Alabama for retrieval of the clinical data of enrolled participants.  
Allies for Health + Wellbeing is a 501(c)3 non -profit organization located in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA. Allies' services include a 
medical clinic, behavioral health services, PrEP services, medical case management, HIV, hepatitis and STI testing and 
counseling, a food pantry, transportation, and emergency financial assistance, housing, and prevention and educational 
outreach. Allies serves approximatel y 1300 unique clients each year and has been in operation since 1985.  The role of 
Allies’ staff on this study is limited to participant recruitment, consenting, and data collection. All representative payee 
intervention activities in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467698], which currently collaborates closely with Allies in 
providing services to clients that are comprehensive but not duplicative.  
Staff from the study sites will recruit and consent participants , implement the intervention, and provide  data for analysis 
to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Study participants will be assigned a unique identifier. The study sites will provide  de-
identified participant data to the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467699]. All materials with identifying information, 
including consent forms, will be kept in double -locked filing cabinets at the study intervention site, or within a password -
prote cted electronic database with no potential access by [CONTACT_467780].  
4.1.1  Sources  of Material s 
 Data collected from study participants will include that which is biological (CD4, viral load); behavioral, captured via self-report (collected electroni cally via use of tablets); and electronic data abstracted from Action Wellness  and Birmingham 
AIDS Outreach ’s electronic health record ( appointment adherence , exposure to services , and retention in care .) 
Birmingham AIDS Outreach will work in collaboration  with the [ADDRESS_599400] of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, 2020

 clinical data of enrolled participants. In Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], client CD4, viral load, and appointment adherence data will be 
abstracted through Allies’ and TOD’s electronic database s. Self-report data will be collected at baseline, 3-month, 6-
month, and 12 -month time points. “Mini check -ins” will be conducted at months [ADDRESS_599401] s using a unique participant ID; only staff at the study sites will be able to link participant IDs with the data 
collected , only will only have access to their own clients’ data; i.e., participant data will not be shared across study sites.  
 In addition , qualitative interviews will be collected with a subset of participants, eligible individuals who did not want to 
participate in the study  and with providers from the study sites . Given that clients served by [CONTACT_467781], providers from external organizations will also be recruited to qualitative interviews to assess their interpretation of their clients’ experiences with the intervention. Se mi-structured interviews with 40 eligible 
individuals ( study participants and non -participants) and 15 providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, medical social 
workers, Client -Centered Rep Payee ( medical case manager and financial manager) will be conducte d by [CONTACT_159543][INVESTIGATOR_467700] (PI , Project  Coordinator,  and doctoral student) to further contextualize findings from the mediation 
analysis. Qualitative interviews with eligible clients who did not want to participate in the study will assist with  eliciting 
issues they had with the study or Representative Payee service. This could assist with identifying procedures or processes to implement to assist with participant recruitment and possibly streamlining the intervention. Interviews will take place  in year [ADDRESS_599402] completed 12 -month follow -up self- reported assess ments.  Members of the  study sites’ 
research team s will inform eligible clients including study participants and non -participants of the opportunity to 
participate in interviews to share feedback on the intervention, and link participants to the qualitative interviewers.   
 Finally, researchers from the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467701] a cost -effectiveness  analysis. These data include those collected via participant self- report (time 
spent by [CONTACT_467782], transportation costs to and from services, and HIV risk behavior) as well as those abstracted from the study site, (number of participants  enrolled, number of client contacts, time spent by 
[CONTACT_467783], wage level for clients, staff personnel costs, materials and consumables, an d viral suppression.)   
 
4.1.2  Potential  Risks 
 
The nature of some of the questions, particularly current sex ual behaviors and/or  current drug use behaviors, has the 
potential to distress some study subjects. The intervention site already has in place on -site supportive services and a 
clinical referral network for any participant who experiences emotional distres s as a result of their assessment.  An 
additional potential risk is that participants may experience feelings of coercion since their financial assets will be managed by a representative payee .  
 4.[ADDRESS_599403] Risks  
 4.2.1  Patient Recru itment  and Informed Consent  
 Participants will be recruited during regularly scheduled visits at the study  sites. In addition, staff from study sites  will 
provide information about the study to other local providers  to support referrals to study activities  at one of our 
participating sites . Flyers announcing the opportunity to participate in the study will also be posted  in the waiting and 
patient rooms  at Action Wellness , TOD, BAO , and Allies for Health + Wellbeing, as well as with external providers wishing 
to promote the study so that individuals may self- refer . In addition , the study team will utilize snowball sampling in 
active study sites  to assist with participant recruitment.  
 
Once individuals are referred to the study sites, the rese arch coordinators and case managers will screen clients  for 
participation per the study inclusion criteria. The research coordinators or case managers will obtain written consent 
from eligible participants and provide them with information about study aims  and approach, voluntary nature of 
participation, assessment and incentives schedule, and right to exit the study at will without penalty. Following 
recruitments , participants will complete  a baseline survey. The research coordinator and medical case manag er will 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599404] that participants will be informed that they can 
withdraw from the study and payee service at any time. Payee services can be terminated by [CONTACT_12550] a form with the Social Security Administration; the medical case manager and research coordinator will keep these forms available and help participants in completing them at the behest of the participant.  
 Another risk could be the loss of privacy of enrolled clients who were referred to the study  due to the provision of a 
referral incentive to the referee. This could lead to their identification as a study participant and their HIV status. To 
minimize this risk, participants receiving the referral incentive would not be informed of the identity of the enrolled 
patient. In addition, referred clients will be informed of the referral incentive to be given to the ir referee.  
 
Because Rep Payee is a policy currently in practice with the Social Security Administration, comprehensive policies and controls are already in place through the SSA and include issues specific to oversight, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_467702], 
preventing identify theft, paper and electronic file securing, and protecting beneficiary bank accounts. Client- Centered 
Representative Payee (CCRP) as currently delivered by [CONTACT_467784], Inc. follows these each of best practices, which 
will be replicated at Action Wellness  and BAO . SSA-sponsored safeguards include the following:  
 
1. Adequate oversight  is maintained and includes the requirement of a second  staff member’s approval 
required when a proposed disbursement exceeds a pre -set limit ($2,000), countersignatures for checks that 
exceed this limit, monthly reconciliation of ledgers and bank records, internal audits, and outside audits.  
 
2. Titling of acco unts established for CCRP beneficiaries show that the representative payee has only a 
fiduciary (not personal) interest in the funds. This approach is used rather than establishing joint accounts, which means that the client cannot access the ac count witho ut the organizational Rep Payee, and that the 
account is specifically used only for beneficiary purposes  
 
3. Checks are kept in locked, access -controlled areas.  
 
4. SSA policies and procedures to protect identity theft are maintained, and include shredding paper work with 
identifying information and storing electronic files are stored in password protected files with no web access.  
5. Beneficiary funds are protected in accordance with SSA policies, which include FDIC protection of up to $250,[ADDRESS_599405] 30% of total Representative Payee accounts for misuse of funds prevention.  
 
8. In addition, SSA reserves the right to randomly select organizational representative payees to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place and that beneficiaries are being appropriately served under this policy. The Open Door was randomly selected for an audit in [ADDRESS_599406] study participants from harm or wrongdoing.  
 Any involvement in human subjects research carries some small risk of loss of confidentiality, which in this case would 
include loss of confidentiality  of stigmatizing behaviors.  This researc h is covered by  a Certificate of Confidentiality  from 
the National Institutes of Health. We will also ensure that participant ID numbers are used to identify study materials. In cases where participants are recruited and choose to participate in qualitativ e interviews with researchers from the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], members of the Action Wellness , TOD , Allies for Health + Wellbeing, and Birmingham AIDS 
Outreach research team s will provide information to the research team from the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467703]’ medical status, including viral load, CD4 counts, and medication and appointment adherence.  Individuals 
who participate in qualitative interviews will be given a HIPAA notice to describe the use of protected health information and will be asked to sign a separate and specific consent form demonstrating their understanding of the use and limits 
of that information.   All materials with identifying information, including consent forms, will be kept  in double -locked filing cabinets at the 
study intervention site s, or within a password- protected electronic database with no potential access by [CONTACT_467785]. (See Appendix A for Data Security Assessment form.) All study procedures will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_467786][INVESTIGATOR_467704].  
 4.3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects  
 The potential benefits of the proposed research to study participants is that they may experience improved ART adherence and related outcomes as described in the research strategy if exposed to the Client- Centered Rep Payee 
intervention. The study has the potential benefit to PLWH A as a whole by [CONTACT_467787], and in turn, reducing HIV health disparities.  
 4.3.[ADDRESS_599407] been studied to date, so this approach may yield effects that are more durable than 
behavioral inter ventions. Client -Centered Rep Payee has already been pi[INVESTIGATOR_467705], as well as with individuals with criminal histories, mental health diagnoses, active substance use disorders, and long histories of being dropped from care as a result of problematic behaviors, with no serious adverse effects noted. In addition, the representative payee practice is one that has been authorized and overseen by [CONTACT_467788]; in this sense, it is a structural adherence improvement intervention that has been hiding in plain sight. For these reasons, possible study benefits far outweigh potential risks.

 5.2 Qualitative Interviews  
 5.2.1 CCRP Participants  
 Qualitative interviews will be conducted in year 3 of the study. Clients  will be recruited from the CCRP study  and from 
eligible individuals who did not participate in the study . Participants recruited from the CCRP trial will include  
randomized and choice intervention and control arm participants.  Since we are interested in exploring factors related to 
adherence success, some  of the interviews (in both arms) will be conducted with participants who have successfully 
achieved viral suppression and the other half will be conducted with participants who are not virally suppressed or who 
have poor medication adherence or retention in care. Our sampling approach will enable us to assess the degree to 
which the intervention contributed to adherence changes, as well as mechanisms underlying change. By [CONTACT_467790]- participants, interviews will also enable us to understand challenges with the study and/or the intervention 
(Representative Payee service).  Members of the Action Wellness , BAO,  Allies, and TOD research team s will link clients to

 Table 1. Enrollment Targets  
 
 
In accordance with NIH Recruit ment  Milestone Report expectations, the enrollment chart includes randomized 
participants (n=160), non -randomized (choice) participants (n=50), and providers who participate in qualitative 
interviews (n=15).  Recruitment and participant inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in sections 3.[ADDRESS_599413] enrolled participants at Action Wellness or clients in Philadelphia.  
5.3.1 Screening 
 Action Wellness , Allies for Health + Wellbeing,  and Birmingham AIDS Outreac h Research Coordinators and medical case 
managers will use the ir EMR system to screen clients  for participation. Birmingham AIDS Outreach will work in 
collaboration with the [ADDRESS_599414] in person. Potential participants, in collaboration with their external providers, will be asked to provide proof of HIV status, age, social security benefits, income, and viral load. The CASE Adherence index may also be used to assess inclusion criteria related to adherence.  
 
5.3.2 Consent  
 Signed informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_467794] . The consent form 
(Appendix B) includes all of the study procedures, information about potential risks and benefits of participation, and information regarding who participants can contact [CONTACT_102954]. Before any other study procedures take plac e, 
each participant will read and review the Informed consent with study staff and allowed time to ask any questions they have before signing the form.  
 
5.3.3 Retention  
 The study sites’ research coordinators will track participant retention, which will b e reviewed bi -weekly by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_467709].  Though loss to follow -up is a concern, this is lessened by [CONTACT_467795] -up assessments in 
the four  study arms as well as by [CONTACT_467796] s tudy. As needed, case managers at the intervention sites will meet with 
participants to address concerns and prevent drop -out.  
 5.4 Incentives  
 Randomized p articipants  will receive up to $240 in incentives, while participants in the choice arms will receive up to

 In addition, individuals who visit the study site to be screened for study participa tion will receive $[ADDRESS_599416] 
incentives.  
 Finally, participants who refer clients to the study can receive additional gift cards each in the amount of $[ADDRESS_599417], the referring participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_599418] that because of the nature of the study, by [CONTACT_467797]’s own 
participation in the study they are also self- disclosing that they meet study inclusion criteria including HIV status.  
 Participan ts randomized to the intervention group and in the choice intervention arm will inform the representative 
payee of their preferred method of receiving expendable funds which includes checks or a visa prepaid card (True Link card). The study will pay for the first procurement ($5) and monthly charges ($4) of the True Link card for participants who select this method for disbursement of funds allocated to them. The study will pay for monthly charges for only the 12-month active study period.

 period and abstracted data will also be collected for all the participants for the 24 -month period.  
 
5.5 Study Participation  
 5.5.1 Study Withdrawal  
 Participants may  withdraw from this research study . Any study data or medical information obtained as part of this 
study prior to the date of consent withdrawal will continue to be used and disclosed by [CONTACT_434430]. To f ormally withdraw from this research study , participants will be asked to provide a written 
and dated notice of this decision to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_467710]. Participants who are unable to provide written consent will provide verbal consent to the study sites resear ch 
coordinators , who will document their desire to withdraw. Participants’ decision s to withdraw from this study will have 
no effect on their current or future relationship s with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109]. Also, the decision to withdraw 
consent for part icipation in this research study will have no effect on their current or future medical care at study sites . 
 Should participants wish to re -enter the study, they may do so within 12 months of their original date of study 
enrollment. Participants will be re- entered into the original arms to which they were randomized, or for non -randomized 
participants, into the original arms they chose. Participants who re -enter the study will continue with their active 12 -
month study period and passive 24 -month study peri od in accordance with their original date of enrollment in the study.  
 5.5.2 Study Termination  
 Participants may be withdrawn from the study if they are also withdrawn  from services at study sites.  In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_467711] , clients  may be terminated from care if they pose an active threat to others; i.e., violently act out 
or place credible threats against other clients  or providers.  In the event that participants are withdrawn , the study team 
will provide active referrals to other local pr oviders to ensure continuity of care and that Rep Payee  services are 
continued (if the participant was in the randomized or choice intervention arm s). 
 
5.5.[ADDRESS_599421] to participate in the study and are randomized to the intervention arm  will be asked to 
complete a form  with their case manager indicating their need  and requesting that SSA appoints Action Wellness ,TOD or 
BAO as their Organizational Rep  Payee  (SSA- 787  “Physician’s/Medical Officer’s Statement of Patient’s Capability To 
Manage Benefits ”). The participants ’ physician will also be asked to sign off on this form, indicating that they agree that 
Rep Payee would benefit the client. At that point, SSA will decide whether or not Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  can be 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599422] to receive Rep Payee services at the end of their 12 -month 
active study period. These participants will be asked to complete a form indicating nee d and requesting that SSA 
appoints Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  as their Organizational Rep  Payee  (SSA-787 “ Physician’s/Medical Officer’s 
Statement o f Patient’s Capability to Manage Benefits” ). The participants ’ physician will also be asked to sign off on this 
form, indicating that they agree Rep Payee would benefit the client. At that point, SSA will decide whether or not Action 
Wellness /TOD /BAO  can be assigned  as Rep Payee.   
 5.5.[ADDRESS_599423] Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  removed as their Rep Payee at any time in the study. If 
participants no longer want Action Wellness /TOD/BAO  to act as their Rep Payee and feel they are able to  pay their bills 
independently, the i ntervention sites  will help participants to have SSA remove Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  as the Rep 
Payee.  This will include asking the participants’ physician to sign off on the paperwork indicating that Rep Payee  is no 
longer needed  (SSA-787 “ Physician’s/Medical Officer’s Statement of Patient’s Capability to Manage Benefits” ). If the 
physician feels the participant still needs help from a Rep Payee and the participant disagrees , their case manager at 
Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will work with the p articipant  to understand why they feel they are ready to pay their bills  
independently . If the participant is able to  demonstrate financial independence , the c ase manager will accompany the 
participant to SSA to provide a signed “third party” statement exp laining that they have direct knowledge of the 
participant ’s ability to pay bills independently. If SSA does not agree to  have Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  removed as 
organizational Rep Payee, the study sites  will help  the participant  appeal this decision.  This will include linking the 
participant to free legal services if needed. Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  can also help the participant identify a different 
Rep Payee if desired by [CONTACT_2299] . 
 
6.[ADDRESS_599424]  to participate  and agree to be randomized  will be assigned to  the intervention or control with a 2:[ADDRESS_599425] of the intervention 
on participants. We will monitor the randomizatio n process throughout the study period to ensure there are no 
systematic differ ences between study arms and no selection  or assignment biases. REDcap forms will be used to return 
randomization. When a member of the study sites’ research team receives consen t to participate from an individual, a 
unique identifier will be generated via REDcaps, which will return the assignment to the study arm.  
 Participants randomized to the control arm will continue to attend visits in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_467712]. Participants randomized to the intervention will receive the same care in addition to 
CCRP. We will assess for exposure to representative payee services throughout the s tudy period to ensure that if control 
group participants elect this service through family  members or other providers we are able to control for this in our 
mediation analysis.  At the conclusion of the study, clients randomized to the control group will be  offered CCRP services,  
ensuring that all clients have the opportunity to benefit from the intervention.

 6.2 Choice (Non -randomized) Arms 
 
Participants who elect to participate in the choice arm can either be in the intervention or control arm.  Once 
participants submit a consent to participate to a member of study sites’ research team, a unique identifier will be 
generated via REDcaps .  
Participants in the non-randomized control arm will continue to attend visits in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_467713] ’ standard of 
care and normal operating procedures. Participants in the choice intervention arm will receive the standard of care in 
addition to CCRP. We will assess for exposure to representative payee services throughout the study period to ensure that if control group participants elect this service through family members or other providers , we are able to control for 
this in our mediation analysis. At the conclusion of the study, clients who chose to be in the control group will be offered 
CCRP services , as they may be interested in the intervention benefits . 
 
6.3 Data Collection   
 Participants in the four arms  will complete the assessment tool at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12 -month time points . Viral load, 
CD4, and appointment adherence data will be monitored at baseline, 6 - and 12 -months, as well as 6- and 12 -months 
after the participant’s active study period. Since many individuals who receive ART often achieve viral suppression within

and HIV risk behavior) as well as those abstracted from the study site (number of participants enrolled, number of client contacts, time spent by [CONTACT_467783], wage level for clients, staff personnel costs, materials and consumables, and viral suppression.)  
 
7.0 CCRP  
CCRP will be embedded within existing services at the study sites (Action Wellness , TOD , Allies, or BAO .) During the 
baseline visit, randomized and choice intervention arm participants will also complete the SSA Request for 
Representative Payee. SSA authorization typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] [ADDRESS_599430] clients who are unable to complete the 
form independently due to literacy issues .  
Case managers at the study sites  will help the client to create a budget and prioritize expenditures, focusing on housing 
and utilities in order to  enhance housing stability. The medical case manager therefore  will become  the poi nt-person for 
the CCRP service. Money management will be  provided  by [CONTACT_467802] a bank account 
on behalf of the client; case managers do not have access to the participants’ accounts nor will be responsible for 
payment of bills.

 Once the SSA authorizes the organizational payee, Social Se curity entitlements (SSI and/or  SSDI) will be sent directly to 
that account. Checks or electronic transfers  will be paid by [CONTACT_467803]. The financial manager  will not be  identifie d to the client, which not only is a safety 
precaution but will also help to ensure that discussions about budgeting and practical needs become part of the ongoing 
conversation between the client and the case manager.  
Rep Payee responsibilities include the  following:  
 
• Case managers will meet with participants on a regular basis to understand their needs and help them develop 
monthly budget s. Participants will work with their case managers to decide ho w they want their bills to be paid, 
how they want extra money to be distributed, and if they want to develop a savings plan.  
 
• Decisions about bill payment occur between the case manager and the client. The financial manager, who is 
responsible for bill payment, will follow the plan set forth by [CONTACT_467804]. 
The financial manager will not make spending decisions that vary from this pre -determined budget.  
 
• Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will ensure that participants’ funds ar e being used in the participants’ best interest.  
 
• Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will keep detailed records of how bills are paid in order to provide an accurate report 
to SSA when they ask for that.  
 
• Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will complete  all accounting forms as required by [CONTACT_467805].  
 
• Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will rep ort events that may affect participants’ benefits, including death or 
incarceration.  
 
• Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  will follow all other rules as set by [CONTACT_467805]. Printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_467714].  
Throughout the course of the study, the research team will follow safeguards including those specified by [CONTACT_467806] . These safeguards are specific to oversight, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_467702], preventing identify  
theft, paper and  electronic file securing, and protecting beneficiary bank accounts and are detailed in section 4.2.[ADDRESS_599431] of Client Centered Represent ative Payee services (CCRP) on 
antiretroviral treatment adherence outcomes for marginalized PLWHA. This will be tested via the following aims:  
 
(1)   Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) and choice cohort study to test the effect of CCRP on anti -
retroviral (ART) medication adherence and viral load among PLWHA who are economically disadvantaged and 
unstably housed. We will compare clinical adherence through behavioral and biological measures including self-reported appointment adherence and viral load for patients receiving the intervention versus those receiving 
standard of care.  
(2)   Test underlying mechanisms associated with CCRP  that contribute to changes in medication adherence and 
viral suppression rates. We will use quantitative (mediation analysis) and qualitative (semi- structured interview) 
methods to test hypothesized mediators of medication adherence and viral suppression including financial and 
housing instability, financial stress, self- efficacy for health behaviors, and retention in care .  
(3)  Assess the cost and cost -effectiveness of the CCRP  model. We will conduct an economic analysis to model 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599432] of care on quality adjusted life years as well as new 
infections averted.  
Participants (n=160) will be randomized to the intervention or to the standard of care. Fifty  participants will be enrolled  
in the choice intervention or choice control arm . The study period is May 2017 –April 202 3. Participant duration in the 
study is 12 months, with viral load and CD4 data monitored for an additional 12 months. Inclusion criteria to be 
screened at the study  include  (a) living with HIV/AIDS, (b) 18 years of age and older, (c) English - or Spanish -speaking, (d) 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_467688] (SSI or SSDI), (e) not currently receiving representative payee (“Rep Payee”) 
services nor having received them in the past 12 months, (f) income below 138% of the federal poverty level, and (g) one 
or more of the following: not virally suppressed, unsustained viral suppression over the past 12 months, or poor ART 
adherence.   
 
Viral load, CD4, and appointment adherence data will be collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months via  abstraction from study sites’   patient records. Birmingham AIDS Outreach will work in collaboration with the 
1917 clinic at the University of Alabama to retrieve the clinical data of enrolled participants. Staff at the study sites will 
recruit, screen, and consent participants, and a full -time Rep Payee employed by [CONTACT_467807] /TOD /BAO will provide 
financial management to participants.  Study sites’  staff members will also maintain responsibility for data collection via 
client records data abstraction and by [CONTACT_467808] -report data on electronic tablets. All 
participant interaction will take place at study sites in Philadelphia, PA , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA  or Birmingham, AL, although when 
risk-mitigation related to the COVID -[ADDRESS_599433] on medication adherence , factors perceived to contribute to ART adherence, specifically examining the effects of our hypothesized 
mediators.  
 8.2  Roles and Responsibilities  
 
The PI (Hawk) will appoint an external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which will minimally consist of a 
biostatistician, an HIV physician engaged in research, and a community advocate with a strong understanding of health -
related research. This committee will monitor the study, advise the NIH Program  Office, and provide input to [CONTACT_376600], 
[CONTACT_421210], and the research team. The DSMB will approve the study protocol before patient recruitment is initiated.  
The Epi[INVESTIGATOR_96466] (EDC) statisticians will provide a summary report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a weekly basis to enable 
monitoring of study recruitment and will establish a monitoring plan for study outcomes . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467715], which will monitor accruing data, protocol deviations, and Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467716] e the 
board at least once a year to confirm that the clients in the trial are being cared for safely.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_467717], including reporting responsibilities. We have created a 
system in which the study site will use an Event/Problem form to report events to the PI, who will then review to determine if the criteria have been met for Adverse Event, Serious Adverse Event, or Unanticipated Problem.

 and/or current substance use  behaviors, has the potential to distress some study subjects. The study site s already ha ve 
in place on -site supportive services and a clinical referral network for any participant who experiences emotional 
distress as a result of their assessment.  This risk is low because all data are reported confidentially or anonymously, 
because participants will submit self- report data on a computerized tablet, and because participants can choose to drop 
out of the study at any time.  
 
An additional potential risk is th at some participants may experience feelings of coercion because their money will be 
managed by a  Rep Payee . This risk is minimized because participants will decide with their case managers how funds will 
be distributed. In addition, participants can withd raw from the study and/or from Rep Payee  service at any time. If 
participant elects to terminate Rep Payee services, the study sites    will help participants complete the necessary 
paperwork to do so.  This paperwork may include asking the physician to sign  off on a form indicating that Rep Payee  is 
no longer needed (Physician’s/Medical Officer’s Statement of Patient’s Capability to Manage Benefits). If the physician declines to sign off, staff from the study sites   will provide a signed “third party” statement explaining that participants 
are able to self- manage their benefits . SSA has no formal policy preventing the removal of individuals from Rep Payee. In 
the unlikely event that SSA does not agree to have Action Wellness /TOD /BAO  removed as the Rep Payee,  the study sites  
will help the participant to appeal this decision or to appoint a different Rep Payee if preferred by [CONTACT_2299].       
 Another risk could be the loss of privacy of enrolled clients who were referred into the study due to the provisio n of a 
referral incentive to the participant that referred them. This could lead to their identification as a study participant and their HIV status. To minimize this risk,  we have created a referral card process using non -identifiable numbers so that 
participants  receiving the referral incentive would not be informed of the identity of the newly enrolled (referred) 
participants . (See section 5.4.)  
                             
Any involvement in human subjects research carries some small risk of loss of confidentiality, which in this case would include loss of confidentiality of stigmatizing behaviors. To minimize loss of confidentiality, we are using anonymous participant ID numbers to identify study data. Only those people who participate in qualitative in terviews will have their 
names and contact [CONTACT_467809][INVESTIGATOR_467718].  These will be removed from all records at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467719]. All 
materials with identifying information, including consent forms, will be kept in double -locked filing cabinets at the study 
intervention sites, or within a password- protected electronic database with no potential access by [CONTACT_467810].  
 8.4   Adverse Events , Serious Adverse Events, and Unanticipated Problems  
 Adverse Events: By [CONTACT_108], an adverse event is an untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease, temporally associated with a person’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to a 
person’s participation in the research.  
Serious Adverse E vent  (SAE) :  The US Department of Health and Hum an Services Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP) defines SAEs as a ny adverse event temporally associated with the subject’s participation in research that meets 
any of t he following criteria:  
1. Results in death;  
2. Is life -threatening (places the subjec t at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
4. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
5. Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
6. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition 
(examples of such events include aller gic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or 
at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of

30 
 substance dependency or substance use disorder ). (Modified from the definition of serious adverse drug 
experience in FDA regulations at 21 CFR 312.32(a).)  
Unanticipated Problems: OHRP considers unanticipated problems, in general, to include any incident, experience, or 
outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Unexpect ed (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in 
the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_164532] s involv ed in the research); and,  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
This trial is designed to test the effect of CCRP  on viral load and other clinical markers among persons with HIV. The risks 
in this study are minimal, and we do not expect any adverse events to occur as a consequence of participation in this research stud y. This study, however, involves a high -risk patient population, and the natural progression of HIV/AIDS 
does include a large number of expected adverse events unrelated to participating in this research study. Given these circumstances, the trial investigators propose to limit the tracking and submission of adverse events to those that are:  
 
1. Related to the attendance of a study visit, or,  
2. Related to the study intervention.  
 
Below is a description of the expected adverse events and other expected incidents, experiences and outcomes that are related to this trial.    Expected Adverse Events:  None. The risks in this study are minimal and adverse events related to participating in this 
research study are not expected to occur.  
 Expected Incidents, Experi ences or Outcomes: Based on prior experience with the Social Security Administration and 
Rep Payee  services, the following issues may occur. These do not meet the definition of an adverse event (i.e., are not 
untoward or unf avorable medical occurrences). If such issues occur during this study, they will be evaluated to 
determine if they meet the criteria for unanticipated problems.  
 
• Social Security Administration fails to deposit participant’s Social Security entitlements.  
• Social Security Administration de posits a lower -than -expected amount of Social Security entitlements.  
• Checks or electronic transfers for rent/utilities/other expenses are delayed or not received . 
• Expendable funds are delayed or not transferred to the participant.  
 8.5 Reporting Policy and  Timeframe

8.6 Data Management  
 Data that is abstracted from patient records at the study site s will be collected by [CONTACT_467811] a scheduled transfer using Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467723] a temporary transfer vehicle.  Data will be deleted from 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467724] 24 hours of scheduled transfer then uploaded to a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467725].  Client self-report 
data and tracking forms (off protocol, events) collected through computerized tablets will be stored on Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467726]. To minimize loss of confidentiality, we will ensure that participant ID numbers are used to identify study materials. All materials with identifying information, including consent forms, will be maintained separately from the study materials and will be secured per the study site's security policy and approved per the local IRB. Additional information regarding protection against risk is discussed in section 4.[ADDRESS_599436] t he semi -structured interviews (n=40 eligible 
clients  and 15 providers). The audio recording will be transferred to a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467727], transcribed, and imported into 
qualitative analysis software. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467728]. The audio recording will be permanently 
erased from the portable recorder. The study site will link abstracted and self- report data to participants recruited to the 
qualitative interviews so that that these data can inform the interview questions.  
 The data analysis plan for this study is described in section 9.[ADDRESS_599437] of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, 2020

Page 33 of 60 
 
    9.0 Statistical and Analytical Plan  
9.1 Approach  
 We will use mixed methods to explore underlying mechanisms contributing to changes in adherence and viral suppression rates (Aim 2). These methods include a mediation analysis, proc ess measures, survey measures, and 
qualitative interviews. The mediation analysis will test the causal chain in which we hypothesize that adherence is improved, as shown in Figure 2. It will also enable us to explain any variance in study outcomes. If adhe rence is not 
improved for all intervention participants we will be able to detect why and what additional supports may be needed. Process measures include number of contacts with providers, which will be extracted from the study sites’  electronic 
health records. The number of months in which CCRP was provided will reported by [CONTACT_467812].  
 Statistical analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_18121] -funded Epi[INVESTIGATOR_467729]. For each of the specific aims and hypotheses of interest, an initial descriptive analysis of all available data will involve summary statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. These strategies will be used to: 1) describe the individual and combined distributions of observed variables of interest; 2) ascertain the 
correlation structure among t he variables; and 3) examine the necessary assumptions for subsequent statistical 
techniques. If the assumptions for any proposed statistical test are not met, the data will be transformed or a 
nonparametric alternative will be used.  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_467730], we expect to encounter this problem. The 
intention -to-treat principle will be used for all primary analyses designed to compare outcomes between the assigned 
intervention groups. Missing data patterns  will be examined prior to analyses. Our strategies will include utilizing data 
collected after participant dropout when possible, adjustment for covariates related to missing data in maximum likelihood models, the application of multiple imputation algorithms, adjustment for an independent variable reflecting actual time in the intervention, and the use of pattern mixture models incorporating completion status of each patient.  
 9.2 Objectives and Primary Comparisons  
 Primary outcome variables (Aim 1) inclu de HIV medication adherence measured via viral load, appointment 
adherence/retention in care, and self- report using the CASE adherence index. Patients’ CD4 and viral load counts are 
currently tracked as standard of care for study sites    on a quarterly basis, and these values will be provided to the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467731].  Birmingham AIDS Outreach will work in 
collaboration with the 1917 clinic at the University of Alabama to retrieve the clinical data of enrolled participants. 
Appointment adherence/retention in care will be calculated via three previously validated and common ways: (a) the proportion of missed or rescheduled visits versus total scheduled visits every six months, (b) verification of at least one 
primary care visit per quarter, and; (c) two appointments in the past [ADDRESS_599438] 90 days apart (H ealth 
Resources and S ervices Administration ) All data sharing will be fully Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA ) compliant. Additional detail regarding study variables is provided in Table 2.  
 
Some primary outcome variables will be measured via survey data, as described in Table 2 and Appendix C. Combining biological, electronic, and self- report data on adherence p rovides the opportunity to triangulate results and obtain a 
more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_467732]. Survey data will be collected  at baseline, 3-, 6- and 12 -
month time points.  
 
The primary comparisons of the randomized and choice int ervention groups for the viral load outcome will be 
conducted with an alpha level of 0.05; an alpha- level of 0.[ADDRESS_599439] one outcome value will be included in the models since 
linear mixed models account appropriately for data missing at random (MAR). We will compare both baseline 
characteristics as well as intermediate outcome values between clients  with missing outcome data and those with 
complete outcome data. We anticipate that some patient factors will be significantly associated with missing data, and thus, that the data will not be missing comp letely at random (MCAR). It is difficult to distinguish whether outcome data 
are missing at random ( i.e., missing at random conditional on known and observed factors, MAR), or the data are 
missing not at random (MNAR). 
We will conduct a propensity analysis  to control for confounding variables in 
estimating our intervention effect . Also, w e will take precautions to adjust for the observed factors associated with the 
missing data patterns in the primary analyses and will use models that appropriately account for data missing at random. If concerns about missing data remain, pattern mixture m odels will be used to account for the various observed 
missing data patterns.  
 Non -linear mixed models using a binomial link will be used  for binary outcome measures. The significance of the 
coefficient of the intervention term is the primary test of the i ntervention main  effect. Adjustment for the baseline level 
of the measure  effectively  means that we are comparing the “changes” from baseline. An interaction ( i.e., the product 
term) between follow- up time and intervention group will be added to test whether the effect of the intervention differs 
over the follow -up course. Mixed models accounting for confounding factors and moderating factors will be conducted  
as secondary analyses based on the initial exploratory data analyses.  
 9.2.[ADDRESS_599440] on viral load and CD4 cell counts (53). Since the 
control group will also have access to treatment, we conservatively estimate that the observed between -group 
standardized  effect size in this trial will be between 0.33 and 0.50 [i .e. Platten, et. al. showed that treatment with ART 
increased CD4 cell counts from 210 /µL to 410 /µL, a 95% increase, and viral load was reduced (to under 50  copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] /mL) 
in 91% of clients .] Based on the data presented in that paper, an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_599441] size of 0.5 is generally  considered medium (61), and we designed our trial to have 
power to detect modest effects for this intervention. Using a two -sided inequality hypothesis test and a two- sample t -
test with alpha=0.05, we determined the samples sizes required to provide 80% and 90% power to detect varying effect size differences  between the two as signed treatment groups (T able 3 ). 
 
Table 3. Sample Size Required to Detect Specified Effects   
      
Based on these estimates, we plan to enroll a sample of 160 participants  in the randomized study arm . If greater  than 
80% of participants contribute at least some follow -up data, the trial would have [ADDRESS_599442] 80% power to detect a difference between the intervention and control groups of  0.5 
SDs. For other outcomes where analyses are based  on an alpha=0.01, the study would have 80% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.608. Since 0.[ADDRESS_599443] Size  Sample Size for

    9.3 Semi- Structured Qualitative Interviews  
 
Semi -structured interviews with 40 eligible clients (study participants and non -participants) and 15 providers  (physicians, 
nurse practitioners, medical social workers, CCRP  (case manager and  financial manager) will be conducted by [CONTACT_32935][INVESTIGATOR_467700] (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_467733] , Project  Coordinator  and doctoral student) to further contextualize findings from 
the mediation analysis. Interviews will take place in year [ADDRESS_599445] completed 12 -month 
follow -up assessments. Information regarding recruitment methods and confidential nature of data are described  in 
sections 5.2 and 4.2.2.  
 Semi -structured interview guides will be developed  for providers and eligible clie nts using the theoretical framework 
described above. D rafts of the interview guide s are attached as Appendix C. Theinterviews with providers and study 
participants will explore factors perceived to contribute to ART adherence, specifically examining for th e effects of our 
hypothesized mediators as shown in Figure 1 (housing stability, retention in care, perception of social support, decreased financial stress, etc.). In addition, interviews with eligible clients who did not want to participate in the study will elicit their perception of the study and the intervention. W e will purposively sample study participants for interviews 
based on their success or lack of success in improving ART adherence as well as improved biological measures. In addition , we will interview control arm participants to gain contrasting information regarding our hypothesized 
mediators. We al so seek to understand participants’ acceptance of and satisfaction with CCRP and the degree to which 
these change over time, given that it is likely that the intervention will become easier for clients after an adjustment 
period is over.  Additional information regarding recruitment for qualitative interviews and confidentiality of qualitative 
data is documented in sections 5.[ADDRESS_599446] 60 -90 minutes, and will be audio recorded and professionally transcribed. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_599447] -utility  of the CCRP model (Aim 3). This will be accomplished  by 
[CONTACT_467813] -
effectiveness  and cost savings. We will also determine if the intervention is cost -effective. The cost- effectiveness 
analysis will use de -identified data from the study site s including those collected via participant self- report (time spent  
by [CONTACT_467782], transportation costs to and from services, and HIV risk behavior) as well as those abstracted from  the study site, (number of participants enrolled, number of client contacts, time spent by [CONTACT_467814], wage level for clients, staff personnel costs, materials and consumables, and viral suppression.)  
 The cost analyses will estimate the cost of d elivering the program locally and will be conducted from both the payer 
perspective (the cost to the party implementing the program; i.e., study sties), and the societal perspective (the cost to the party implementing the program + the cost to the particip ant for participating in the program).  The cost analysis will 
calculate the overall cost of implementing the program, the cost per client, and the cost per contact. The threshold 
analysis will assess two things: 1) the number of quality -adjusted  life years  (QALY) that would need to be averted to 
  
 
Impact of Representative P ayee Services on ART Adherence among Marginalized PLWHA       April 19, [ADDRESS_599448]-effectiveness , and 2) the number of HIV transmissions that would need to be averted  to make a 
claim of cost savings. The cost -utility analysis will use outcomes data on viral suppression to mode l whether the 
programs are cost effective. As part of sensitivity analyses, we will also conduct the cost -utility analyses  using data on 
adherence to ART.  
 
We will employ standard methods of cost analyses, as recommended by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Panel on Cost -effective ness in Health 
and Medicine and as adapted to HIV/AIDS programs by [CONTACT_467815] (80). As such, we will conduct our analyses from the societal perspective as well as the payer perspective. Including the societal perspective accounts for costs to all parties, 
acknowledges the value of competing uses for societies’ resources, and maximizes comparability with other cost -
effectiveness analyses.  
 
To conduct the cost analysis and the cost threshold analyses, data will be collected in the following five areas: Step 1 : 
The time period for the analysis; Step 2: A description of the services delivered by [CONTACT_78311]; Step 3: Summary participant data including number of PLWH A served, number of participant contacts, and costs to the individual for 
participating in the program; Step 4: Implementation cost including, staff, materials and other consumables; and Step 5: The overhead rate. Step [ADDRESS_599449] to transportation to 
and from program services, participants’ time, and costs incurred by [CONTACT_467816]. Data will be 
entered into a standardized excel spreadsheet which will be organized by [CONTACT_467817]. The investigators have used this methodo logy for economic analyses for a variety of HIV 
prevention interventions including a housing intervention for PLWH A. 
 Data will be collected using three methods: extraction from accounting records, budget records, and dosage forms; interviews with program implementers; and self- report from participants. Participants will self- report data collected in 
Step [ADDRESS_599450] of the program will be calculated  from 
data collected in Steps 3, 4, and 5 described above. Specifically, the total costs to the participant will be added  to the 
sum of the implementation costs times one plus the overhead rate (C=total participant cost + (implementation costs*(1+overhead rate))). To calculate the cost- saving threshold , we will use the following formula: C/T where T is the  
medical costs averted each time a HIV  transmission is averted . T will come from the most recent literature. The cost-
effectiveness threshold will be calculated using the formula C/(T+(W*Q) where W is the price that society is willing to pay to “buy” a QALY and Q is the number of quality - adjusted  life years saved for each HIV transmission averted. Like T, 
W and Q will be obtained  from the most recent literature at the time the analysis is completed. Currently, T is estimated 
to be $330,000 (85) W is estimated  to be $100,000, (86 -88) and Q is estimated  to be about 5.83.  
 For the cost -utility analysis  we will assess whether the program is cost-effective  by [CONTACT_467818]-utility  ratio, or 
“r”. The formula for the cost -utility ratio is R=(C/A -T)/Q. C , T, and Q are the same parameters as described above. “A” is 
the number o f HIV infections averted by [CONTACT_78311]. “A” will be estimated  by [CONTACT_467819]: 
a) the difference between those who were and were not exposed  to the program in the possibility  of HIV transmission b) 
the average number of sexual behavior partners per year for participants and c) the literature -based average probability 
of HIV transmission per partnership. The first of these three parameters will be estimated using data on viral suppression (and adherence) for individuals enrolled in  the study. The second parameter will estimated  based on self -
report data on sexual behavior from participants. The third parameter will be based  on the HIV transmission literature. 
For the sensitivity analyses, we will use an estimate of the number of person -years of adherence among program

Provider Interviews  
 
Script for Participation  
 The purpose of this research project is to assess the impact of Client- Centered Representative Payee (CCRP) services on 
marginalized people living with HIV/AIDS. Qualitative interviews with providers are being conducted to understand their perceptions of the impact of CCRP on their clients , to qualitatively assess their experiences with this service, and to 
contextualize findings from the quantitative analysis of this study. You are being invited to participate in this interview because you p rovide care or services to participants of the CCRP study, and may have some knowledge regarding how 
the intervention has affected your clients. Participation in this interview is entirely voluntary, and should you choose not to participate it will not aff ect your relationship with the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] , Action Wellness , TOD , Allies for Helath 
+ Wellbeing, or BAO . 
 Risks associated with this study are minimal. Any study with human subjects has some small risk of loss of confidentiality. Your confidentiality will be protected in this study  as I will not be attaching your name [CONTACT_467829]. I want to assure you that only I will be aware of your responses and only I will know who said what. None of your responses will be shared with other staff at Action Wellness, TOD, Allies for Health + 
Wellbeing or BAO  and your name [CONTACT_467830].  However, a ny information that is shared about 
child abuse or intent to harm self or others will be reported to authorities, as required by [CONTACT_2371].  Participation in this 
interview is voluntary and if you should change your mind at any time during the interview please let me know and we will stop.   
 If you are interested in participating our interview should take about an hour, depending on how the conversation goes, and it will be recorded on this tape recorder. Later we will transfer this recording to a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467727], transcribe, and import it into qualitative analysis software.  All identifying information will be removed from the transcript prior to 
coding and analysis.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_467728]. The audio recording will be permanently erased from 
the portable recorder.  
   
There are also no foreseeable benefits for you to participate in this interview . People living with HIV/AIDS may benefit 
from the study if we identify a new way of offering services to people that help to improve their treatment adherence.  
Do you have any questions or comments before we proceed?   
Again, I would like to thank you for  taking the time to talk with me today.

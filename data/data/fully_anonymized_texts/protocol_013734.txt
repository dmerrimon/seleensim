2. RATIONALE  
2.1 Acute Myelogenous Leukemia  
Acute myelo genous leukemia (AML) is the most common acute leukemia in adults. It is 
estimated that 13,780 men and women will be diagnosed with and 10,200 men and women will die of acute myeloid leukemia in the year 2012.
1 AML is a disease with a poor prognosis with a 
5-year survival of only around 30%.2,[ADDRESS_948472] a particularly worse 
Page 2 of 34 
 outcome such as patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML and AML arising f rom antecedent 
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  or myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).  
Although most patients with AML will achieve remission with induction chemotherapy; many 
patients will relapse, despi[INVESTIGATOR_698534]-remission therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. R elapses may occur 
weeks to many years later. Up to 10% of patients will be refractory to induction chemotherapy. Both of these groups of patients (relapsed/refractory) constitute a particularly poor risk group. Although an allogeneic stem cell transplant w ould be considered a recommended approach for 
most of these patients, it is feasible only in a small number of patients. Many novel drugs and approaches are being investigated for this group of patients. However, the CR rates have been, in general, less th an 30%.
4-6 The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a 
randomized 3- arm phase II trial where relapsed/refractory AML patients received either 
intermediate -dose cytarabine/gemtuzumab oz ogamicin, or intermediate -dose 
cytarabine/liposomal daunorubicin, or intermediate- dose cytarabine/  cyclophosphamide/ 
topotecan.4 The CR/CRp (CR with incomplete platelet count recovery) rates achieved were low, 
ranging from 4% to 12%, depending on the study arm. Cortes et al. performed an exploratory study in relapsed/refractory AML patients combining p53 antisense oligonucleotide Cenersen 
with idarubicin either alone or with cytarabine.
5 Ten of the 53 (19%) patients achieved CR/CRp. 
These data highlight the need for development of better treatment strategies for this group of 
patients.  
AML arising from antecedent MDS/MPN: In a recent study by [CONTACT_698542], outcomes 
of patients who progressed from MDS were studied.7 In the subgroup of patients who had failed 
hypomethylating agents (the current FDA approved standard therapy for MDS), the median 
overall survival (OS) was only 3.7 months from the time of AML diagnosis. Those with poor 
Page 3 of 34 
 risk cytogenetics (very common for this group of patients) had median OS of only 2.8 months. In 
our experience, the outcomes of these p atients remains dismal with CR rate in <20% range 
(Jabbour et al. MDACC, unpublished data). Given these poor outcomes with the conventional 
treatment approaches, we plan to include these patients for frontline treatment of the AML.       
2.2 Combination chemotherapy for AML: Emerging role of purine analogs  
Anthracyclines have been traditionally combined with cytarabine in AML. Two recent 
publications highlighted higher response rates and better disease -free survival in both younger 
and older patients with frontline AML when high-dose daunorubicin (90 mg/m2/dose) was used in a “7+3” induction combination highlighting the activity of this class of agents for AML therapy.
8,9 Pautas et al randomized 468 AML patients ages 50 to 70 years to 3 induction 
anthracycline regimens: idarubicin 12 mg/m2 daily for 3 days, idarubicin 12 mg/m2 daily for 4 days, and high-dose daunorubicin 80 mg/m2 daily for 3 day s.
10 The CR rate with idarubicin daily 
for 3 days was higher than with high-dose daunorubicin (83% vs. 70%). A recent report from the Polish Acute Leukemia Group provides evidence for adding purine analog cladribine to the standard daunorubicin plus cytarabine regimen.
11 In a phase III study, 652 untreated patients 
(ages 18 to 60 years) with AML were randomized to receive either daunorubicin plus cytarabine (DA), or DA plus fludarabine, or DA plus cladribine. The CR rate was significantly higher in the cladribine arm compared to the DA arm (67.5% vs. 56%; p=0.01). The OS was also better in the cladribine arm compared t o DA arm (3 -year OS: 45% vs. 33%, p=0.02). The survival advantage 
of the cladribine arm over the DA arm was observed among patients age 50 years or older (p=0.005), those with initial leukocyte count above 50 x 10
9/L (p=0.03), and those with 
unfavorable karyotype (p=0.03).   
Page 4 of 34 
 2.3 Clofarabine in AML 
Clofarabine (2 -chloro-20- fluoro -deoxy-9-b-D-arabinofuranosyladenosine) is a second-generation 
nucleoside analog, which was developed as a hybrid molecule to combine the most favorable 
pharmacokinetic properties of both fludarabine and cladribine and has better stability with higher affinity to deoxycytidine kinase, the rate-limiting step in phosphorylation of nucleosides.
12 
Clofarabine acts as an inhibitor of both DNA synthesis and the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Its structural characteristics render it resistant to deamination by [CONTACT_698543].
13-16 Single agent 
clofarabine has demonstrated activity in phase I -II studies in AML.17,18 As a  potent inhibitor of 
ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and by [CONTACT_698544], clofarabine is more 
ideally suited to be incorporated into combinations such as have been tested and validated with cytarabine in AML.
[ADDRESS_948473] previously conducted a study combining cytarabine with 
clofarabine in patients  with relapsed/refractory AML.20 At doses of 1 g/m2 daily x 5 days  for 
cytarabine and 40 mg/m2 daily x 5 days for clofarabine, we reported a response rate of 40% 
(28% complete remission) in 29 patients with a median age of 59 years (18 to 84 years). Responses extended to patients with primary refractory disease and those with abnormal cytogenetics. Other groups have since followed this lead and published comparable results.
[ADDRESS_948474] also reported adaptively randomized study of lower- dose clofarabi ne (30mg/m2 IV daily 
for 5 days) with or without low-dose cytarabine (20mg/m2 SQ daily for 14 days)  in previously untreated older (≥60 years) with AML. CR rate was significantly higher with the combination therapy (63% vs. 31%; p=0.025). The combination arm also had improved event free survival (7.1 months vs. 1.7 months; p=0.04), but not overall survival (11.4 months vs. 5.8 months; p=0.1). No excess toxicity was observed in the combination arm. We have previously explored 
Page 5 of 34 
 the combination of clofarabine with cytarabine and anthracycline (CIA regimen). In a phase I 
study for patients with relapsed/refractory AML , the following doses were established for further 
evaluation: clofarabine 22.5 mg/m2 daily x 5 days , idarubicin 6 mg/m2 daily x 3  days , and 
cytarabine 0.75 mg/m2 daily x 5 days .22 In a recent update of a phase II study  of 63 patients 
treated with CIA  regimen ,23 the overall response rate was 38% including 21% CR. Median 
overall survival was 34 weeks for all patients and 66 weeks  for those patients who achieved 
CR/CRp. Twenty -four patients (38%) were able to proceed with a stem cell transplant. Induction 
mortality was at 8%. Toxicities were  manageable.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_948475] 
demonstrated single- agent activity in AML patients.26-29  
Kantarjian et al. performed a multicenter, randomized, open- label, phase III trial comparing the 
efficacy and safety of decitabine with treatment choice (TC, supportive care or cytarabine 20 mg/m2 per day subcutaneously for 10 consecutive days every 4 weeks) in older patients (age ≥65 years) with newly diagnosed AML and poor- or intermediate -risk cytogenetics.
26 Patients 
(n=485) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive decitabine 20 mg/m2 per day as a 1-hour intravenous infusion for five consecutive days every 4 weeks or TC. The primary analysis 
Page 6 of 34 
 showed a nonsignificant increase in median OS with decitabine (7.7 months; 95% CI, 6.2 to 9.2) 
versus TC (5.0 months; 95% CI, 4.3 to 6.3; p=0.108). Based on this trial results, on September 
28, 2012, the European Commission approved decitabine for the treatment of adult patients (age 65 years and above) with newly diagnosed AML, who are not candidates for standard induction chemotherapy.  
 
2.5 Combination of hypomethylating agents and chemotherapy in AML 
There is preclinical evidence that DNA hypomethylating agents can sensitize tumor cells to 
cytotoxic chemotherapy.
30-34 Studies in the late 1970’s showed that combination of 5- azacytidine 
and cytarabine was synergistic both in vitro and in vivo, when used sequentially whereas concurrent administ ration was antagonistic.
35 There studies were, however, done using higher 
doses of 5- azacytidine (600 -1500 mg/m2 per course), which led to significant non- hematologic 
toxicities  in these earlier clinical trials.36 It is now known that the effects of 5- azacytidine and 
decitabine on DNA hypomethylation occur at a significantly lower dose range; and the standard dose of decitabine is 20mg/m2  daily for 5 days.
37-40 Qin et al. reported the synergism of 
decitabine at clinically relevant doses with cytarabine in the HL -60 AML cell line.34 The authors 
showed that hypomethylated cells following treatment with decitabine were more likely to undergo apoptosis when treated with cytarabine. Scandura et al. recently reported outcomes of 30 untreated younger (≤60 years old) patients with intermediate/poor risk AML who received decitabine as a ‘priming’ agent prior to the conventional ‘7+3’ chemotherapy.
41 Overall CR rate 
of 83% was noted (57% with first induction). No excess toxicity was noted with the decitabine priming approach and the toxicity profile was similar to the standard induction. Though there was a prior concern for potential prolonged myelosuppression with this approach, the authors, on 
Page 7 of 34 
 the contrary found faster platelet recovery (median 22 days) with the decitabine ‘priming’ 
compared to their prior experience with cytarabine-containing induction regimens.41 The German 
group has reported preliminary results of a dose-finding study in which 5- azacytidine was used at 
2 different dosing regimen (75mg/m2 and 37.5mg/m2) immediately prior to standard induction 
with ‘7+3’.[ADDRESS_948476] selected 75mg/m2 dose (the standard dosing for 5- azacytidine) as the phase II d ose.  
 
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that addition of decitabine to our current standard 
chemotherapy regimen (clofarabine, idarubicin, cytarabine), the DAC- CIA regimen, would be 
synergistic and would ultimately lead to an improvement in CR rates  and patient outcomes . We 
propose a phase I -II study. The primary endpoint of the phase I study is to determine the 
maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of clofarabine to be used in the phase II portion of the study. The 
primary endpoint of the phase II study is to determine the response rate of DAC -CIA regimen.  
 2.6 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) 
Patients with relapsed/Refractory ALL constitute a poor risk group with dismal long- term 
outcomes. Fielding and colleagues analyzed the outcomes of 609 relapsed  adult ALL patients 
who were treated on the MRC trial.
43 The median OS was only 5.5 months with the 5- year OS of 
only 7%. Similar poor outcomes of relapsed patients with ALL have been reported by [CONTACT_698545].44,[ADDRESS_948477] been shown 
Page 8 of 34 
 to be an independent prognostic marker for poor survival in ALL patients.47-49 Preclinical 
evidence supports use of hypomethylating agents such as decitabine in ALL patients.46,50 In the 
proposed clinical trial, all the chemotherapy drugs (clofarabine, idarubicin, cytarabine) have been 
shown to have independent anti- leukemic activity in ALL.17,51,52 Therefore, the proposed 
regimen (decitabine followed by [CONTACT_698546]) deserves evaluation as a treatment strategy for relapsed/refractory ALL patients. We plan to enroll ALL patients only in the phase II part of the study.  
 
3. BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION  
3.1. Idarubicin:  
Idarubicin is commercially available.  
Mechanism of action:  
Similar to doxorubicin and daunorubicin; inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis by [CONTACT_698547]:  
o Cardiovascular: Transient EKG abnormalities (supraventricular tachycardia, S -T wave 
changes, atrial or ventricular extrasystoles); generally asymptomatic and self-limiting.  
Congestive heart failure, dose- related. The relative cardiotoxicity of  idarubicin compared to 
doxorubicin is unclear. Some investigators report no increase in cardiac toxicity at cumulative oral idarubicin doses up to 540 mg/m2; other reports suggest a maximum cumulative intravenous dose of 150 mg/m2. 
o Central nervous system: Headache  
o Dermatologic: Alopecia (25% to 30%), radiation recall, skin rash (11%), urticaria 
Page 9 of 34 
 o Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting (30% to 60%); diarrhea (9% to 22%); stomatitis  (11%); 
GI hemorrhage (30%)  
o Genitourinary: Discoloration of urine (darker yellow) 
 
3.2. Cytarabine 
Cytarabine is commercially available.  
Mechanism of action:  
Cytarabine is an antimetabolite. Cytarabine is cell cycle –specific  for the S phase of cell  division. 
Activity occurs as the result of activation to cytarabine triphosphate in the tissues and includes 
inhibition of DNA polymerase and incorporation of cytarabine into DNA and RNA.  
Adverse effects:  
COMMON  
•  Cardiovascular: Thrombophlebitis 
•  Dermatologic: Rash, conjunctivitis  
•  Endocrine metabolic: Hyperuricemia  
•  Gastrointestinal: Anal inflammation, Diarrhea, Loss of appetite, Nausea, Stomatitis,  
  Ulcer of anus, Ulcer of mouth, Vomiting •  Hematologic: Decreased reticul ocyte count, Megaloblastic anemia 
•  Hepatic: Decreased liver function  
•  Other: Fever  
SERIOUS  
•  Hematologic: Anemia, Bleeding, Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia  
•  Immunologic: Anaphylaxis  
Page 10 of 34 
 •  Neurologic: Neuropathy  
•  Renal: Kidney disease  
•  Other: Infectious disease, Sepsis  
 
3.3. Clofarabine 
Clofarabine is commercially available.  
Mechanism of action:  
Clofarabine potently inhibits DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_54887]. Clofarabine demonstrated the ability to disrupt mitochondrial integrity that results in the release of pro -apoptotic proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor. 
Adverse effects:  
• Hematologic: Myelosuppression, infections 
• Hepato and Gastrointestinal: Nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, stomatitis/ 
pharyngitis, hyperbilirubinemia, increase of SGPT and/or SGOT, abdominal pain or 
crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], peritonitis, pancreatitis, liver failure

• Cardiology: Congestive heart failure 
• Nephrology: Kidney failure 
• Autoimmune reactions: antiplatelet antibodies, erythema nodosum 
Page 11 of 34 
  
3.4. Decitabine  
Decitabine is commercially available.  
Mechanism of action:  
Decitabine is a nucleoside analog. It is metabolized intracellularly  by [CONTACT_698548]. It is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects by [CONTACT_698549]. Hypomethylation may restore normal function to genes that are critical for differentiation and inhibition of proliferation.  
Adverse effects:  
Myelosuppression, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, skin rash, fatigue, mental status 
changes/coma, allergic reactions (including fever, muscle aches, edema, dyspnea), congestive 
heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure, infections, lethargy, malaise, asthenia, alopecia, peritonitis, anorexia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, hyperbilirubinemia, increase of SGPT and/or SGOT, abdominal pain or crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

5. TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1. Study design 
The study will include a phase I portion to determine MTD dose of clofarabine to be used in the 
subsequent phase II portion. Starting with Dose level 1, the patient will be enrolled by [CONTACT_535713] 
3. Once the DLT assessment for the 3 patients is completed, a sequential of another cohort of 3 
patients will be enrolled. If at any time, we see more than 30% patients experiencing DLT, we 
will de -escalate to dose level ( -1).  The same above monitoring rule will also be applied to dose 
level -1. A total of 18 patients will be enrolled. Once the phase II dose of clofarabine is 
established, additional patients will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study.  
 
5.2. Induction 
Page 14 of 34 
 5.2.1 Phase I (fixed dose of decitabine 20mg/m2 days 1-5, idarubicin 10 mg/m2 days 6-8 and 
cytarabine 1 g/m2 days 6-10) 
Clofarabine 15 mg /m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily.  
Dose levels and  dose escalation schema are described below.  
Dose level  Clofarabine 15 mg /m2/day IV daily  
-1 Clofarabine daily for 3 days (days 6 -8) 
1 Clofarabine daily for 4 days (days 6 -9) 
 
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily for 5 days (days 1-5) 
Idarubicin  10 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 minutes daily for 3 days (days 6-8) 
Cytarabine 1 g/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for 5 days (days 6-10) 
 
Idarubicin will follow clofarabine by [ADDRESS_948481] course on study that meets any of the following criteria: 
• CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_948482] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) for > 7 days 
• CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_948483] (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT) of any duration  
Page 15 of 34 
 • All other clinically significant NCI common terminology criteria that are CTCAE  Grade 
[ADDRESS_948484] be clinically significant to define DLT e.g. alopecia, study drug- related  fever,  
electrolyte abnormalities (including K, Na, Cl, HCO3, Mg, Ca) that are < Grade 3 will not define 
the DLT. Prolonged myelosuppression, as defined by [CONTACT_54889], i.e. 
marrow  cellularity <5% on day 42 or later from start of therapy without evidence of leukemia, 
will be  considered as DLT. All other prolonged myelosuppressions will also be monitored 
closely . Note: As the patients receive [ADDRESS_948485] of the patient by [CONTACT_1963]. If the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy(s) performed after the re- induction cycle reveals a remission marrow (CR/CRp/CRi), then the patient may 
proceed with consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician. In addition, any clinically significant drug -related, non-hematologic toxicity experienced by a patient should return to ≤ 
grade [ADDRESS_948486] 
achieved a remission (CR/CRp/CRi) after the reinduction course, he will be taken off study for 
Page 16 of 34 
 failure to respond, unless the patient has achieved clinical benefit or partial remission, at which 
time further therap y on protocol may be permitted with approval from the PI. 
 
5.2.2 Phase II 
In the Phase II portion, patients will receive  the following treatments  
Clofarabine 15 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily (number of days selected based on 
Phase I portion).  
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily for 5 days (days 1-5) 
Idarubicin  10 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 minutes daily for 3 days (days 6-8) 
Cytarabine 1 g/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for 5 days (days 6-10) 
 
Idarubicin will follow clofarabine by [ADDRESS_948487] of 
the patient by [CONTACT_1963]. If the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy(s) performed 
after the re-induction cycle reve als a remission marrow  (CR/CRp/CRi ), then the patient may 
proceed with consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician . In addition, any clinically 
significant drug -related, non-hematologic toxicity experienced by a patient should return to ≤ 
grade [ADDRESS_948488] 
Page 17 of 34 
 achieved a remission  (CR/CRp/CRi ) after  the reinduction course, he will be taken off study for 
failure to respond, unless the patient has achieved clinical benef it or partial remission, at which 
time further therapy  on protocol may be permitted with approval from the PI. 
 
5.3 Consolidation (for both phase I and phase II portion)  
Patients in CR or CRp  or CRi  can continue with up to 6 consolidation cycles. 
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily for 5 days (days 1-5) 
Clofarabine 15 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily for 3 days (days 6-8) 
Idarubicin  8 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 minutes daily for 2 days (days 6-7) 
Cytarabine 1 g/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for 3 days (days 6-8) 
 Cycles may be repeated every 3 to 10 weeks based on leukemia response and  resolution of drug-
related toxicities. Prior to each consolidation cycle, the ANC should be > 1.0 x 10
9/L, and the 
platelet count should be > 60 x 109/L (except for patients who  are considered to have achieved a 
CRp or CRi  following induction/reinduction and in whom the platelet count may be lower). 
Patients with borderline values for ANC and platelet count (value up to 10% lower than recommended) can still proceed with the next consolidation cycle if this is judged to be in the best interest of the patients and after discussion with  the principal investigator. In addition, any 
drug- related non -hematologic toxicity  experienced by [CONTACT_54890] ≤ grade [ADDRESS_948489] 
severe toxicity and based on the drug causing the toxicity.  
Page 18 of 34 
  
5.4 Dose modifications:  
Drug doses in subsequent consolidation cycles may be modified for drug- related > grade [ADDRESS_948490] for the patient and after discussion with the principal investigator. The following table is a suggestion for dose modifications in subsequent treatment courses:  
 
Dose level  Decitabine 
(mg/m2)  Clofarabine 
(mg/m2)  Idarubicin 
(mg/m2)  Cytarabine

10. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
All adverse and serious adverse events will be recorded and reported according to the 
Page 24 of 34 
 Department of Leukemia guidelines (appendix A) 
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
Phase I  
First, phase I study is performed to assess the safety of different dosing schedules for clofarabine 
combined with fixed dosage of decitabine, idarubicin, and cytarabine. Two dose schedules are 
defined in table 1, and the starting dose schedule is dose level 1. A maximum of 18 AML patients will enroll in the phase I study.  
Table 1: dose schedule 
Dose 
level  Clofarabine 15 mg/m2/day IV daily 
-1 Clofarabine daily for 3 days (days 6 -8) 
1 Clofarabine daily for 4 days (days 6 -9) 
 
Decitabine 20 mg/m2 IV over approximately 1 hour daily for 5 days (days 1-5) 
Idarubicin  10 mg/m2 IV over approximately 30 minutes daily for 3 days (days 6-8) 
Cytarabine 1 g/m2 IV over approximately 2 hours daily for 5 days (days 6-10) 
Page 25 of 34 
 Dose Escalation Procedures  
Starting with Dose level 1, the patient will be enrolled by [CONTACT_535713] 3. Once the DLT assessment 
for the 3 patients is completed, a sequential of another cohort of 3 patients will be enrolled.  If at 
any time, we see more than 30% patients experiencing DLT, we will deescalate to dose level ( -
1). If no dose de- escalation occurs, with a total of 18 patients treated at dose level 1 , dose level 1 
will be considered as  the MTD for the phase II part. If there is dose de-escalation, a cohort of 3 
patients will be treated, Dose level -1 will be declared as MTD if there are ≤[ADDRESS_948495] response (either CR, 
CRp, or CRi) within [ADDRESS_948496] 
treatment is 25%. The target response rate is 40%.  The trial will be continuously monitored. The 
study will be stopped early if the data suggest that: 
                                      Pr ( π> 0.25|data) < 0.3 
Here π is the overall response (OR) rate. That is, if at any time during the study we determine 
that there is a less than 30% chance that the average OR rate is greater than 25%, we will 
terminate the study.  The OR rate is assumed to follow a non -informative pr ior of Beta (0.5, 1.5). 
The study will be stopped early if (The number of overall responses)/ (The number of patients 
evaluated) ≤1/8, 2/11, 3/15, 4/20, 5/24, 6/29, 7/33, 8/37, 9/42, 10/46, 11/50, 12/54, 13/59.

Here π is the overall response (OR) rate. That is, if at any time during the study we determine 
that there is a less than 40% chance that the average OR rate is greater than 20%, we will 
terminate the study.  The OR rate is assumed to follow a non -informative prior of Beta (0.4, 1.6). 
The study will be stopped early if (The number of overall responses)/ (The number of patients 
evaluated) ≤1/8, 2/11, 3/17.

Monitoring of non -hematological ≥grade 3 toxicities 
Page 28 of 34 
 With the concern of treatment related toxicity, the non- hematological toxicity ( ≥grade 3)  
throughout all the cycles of treatment will also be closely monitored during the study for AML 
and ALL together .   
Denote the probability of toxicity by P E. We assume P E ~ beta (0.6, 1.4).  Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_62626]: Pr(P E > 0.3 | data)  > 0.9 . That is, we will stop the 
trial if, at any time during the study, we determine that there is more than 90% chance that the 
toxicity rate is more than 30%. The study will be stopped early if (The number of non -
hematological toxicities being grade 3 or higher)/ (The number of patients evaluated) ≥ 7/13, 
8/15, 9/18, 10/21, 11/23, 12/26, 13/29, 14/32, 15/35, 16/38, 17/41, 18/43, 19/46, 20/49, 21/52, 22/55, 23/58, 24/61, 25/64, 26/67, 27/70, 28/73, 29/76, 30/79.  The operating characteristics are 
summarized in table 4.

Analysis method 
Page 29 of 34 
 Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-plus, as appropriate. The proportion of patients 
having overall response, the mortality rate, and the proportion of patients having grade 3 or 
higher non- hematological toxicities will be estimated by [CONTACT_698551] 
90% posterior credible interval.

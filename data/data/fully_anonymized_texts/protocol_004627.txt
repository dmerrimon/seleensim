Title of Protocol: A Phase 1 Study to Evaluate the Effects 
of Rifampin on Pharmacokinetics of Pevonedistat in 
Patients with Advanced Solid TumorsIND No.: 78,[ADDRESS_248009] No.:
Not applicable
Study Number: Pevonedistat -1015 Phase: 1
Study Design:
Part A: Assessment of the effect of rifampin on pevonedistat pharmacokinetics (PK)
Eligible patients will receive a single dose of 50 mg/m2pevonedistat via a 1 -hour intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1. 
Plasma PK samples will be collected at a series of predetermined time points up to 48 hours (Day 3) following the 
single dose of pevonedistat. Patients will then receive an oral dose of 6 00 mg rifampin once daily (QD) starting from 
Day 3 (after collecting the 48 -hour PK sample) through Day 11. There will be no pevonedistat doses from Day 2 
through Day 9. On Day 10, a single dose of 50 mg/m2pevonedistat will be administered, and plasma sam ples will be 
collected at predetermined time points up to 48 hours (Day 12) following the second single dose of pevonedistat. 
Study drug will be discontinued early if a patient experiences study drug ‒related toxicities.
Both doses of pevonedistat (Days 1 a nd 10) will be administered in the clinic, followed by [CONTACT_207592]. 
Serial blood plasma samples for determination of the plasma concentration of pevonedistat will be obtained during 
Part A at prespecified time points. The first dose of rifampi n will be given orally in the clinic on the morning of Day 3 
after collection of the 48 -hour PK sample. Patients will self -administer rifampin (oral capsules) QD on Days 4, 5, 6, 7, 
8, and 9 at home. Patients are encouraged to take rifampin at approximatel y the same time each day (±2hours from the 
time of first rifampin dose). On Days [ADDRESS_248010] PK sampling is on Day 12 ([ADDRESS_248011] pevonedistat infusion on Day 10). There will be no 
pevonedistat dosing on Days 11 and 12. There will be no rifampin dosing on Day 12.
All doses of rifampin will be administered on an empty stomach with patients taking nothing by [CONTACT_1966] (NPO) except 
for water and prescribed medications for [ADDRESS_248012] 1 week to allow reversal of metabolic enzyme induction before the start of Part B of t he study.
Part B (OPTIONAL): Continued Treatment with Pevonedistat in Combination with Standard of Care (SOC)
After completion of Part A of this study, patients will have the option of participating in Part B. Any patient who 
decides to participate in Part B will need to meet the continuation criteria of the study before treatment in Part B can 
begin. Patients will receive pevonedistat in combination with either docetaxel or carboplatin+paclitaxel, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_093]. As in Part A, safety assessments will also be conducted in Part B of the study. In 
addition, Part B will conduct disease assessments using radiological evaluations (computed tomography scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging).

Protocol Incorporating Amendment 02 04 September 2018
Sample Size Justification: The sample size calculation is based on the expected two -sided 90% CI for the difference 
in the paired, log -transformed area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) (or C max) means of pevonedistat 
co-administered with rifampin and pevonedistat adm inistered alone. Based on the preliminary data obtained from 
Study C15011, the within -subject coefficient of variation was estimated to be 13% for AUC and 58% for C max, 
respectively. Assuming the AUC (or C max) ratio is 1.0, with a sample size of 12 evaluab le patients, the 90% CI of the 
ratio of geometric means is expected to be (0.907, 1.102) for AUC and (0.671, 1.49) for C maxbased on the previousl y 
discussed variance assumptions. If the ratio is X, the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means is expected to be within 
(0.907X, 1.102X) and (0.671X, 1.49X), respectively. Patients who are not PK evaluable will be replaced to ensure 
availability  of approximately 12 PK-evaluable patients for the final analysis.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Pevonedistat is a cy totoxic agent and cannot be administered to healthy subjects. Pevonedistat is 
currently in phase 2/[ADDRESS_248025] acute myelo id leukemia (AML). The recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pevonedistat administered as a single agent in pat ients with advanced 
hematol ogic malignancy  is 50 mg/m2on Days 1, 3, and 5 in 21 -day cycles. In solid tumors, the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and RP2D of pevonedistat in combinat ion with docetaxel is 
25mg/m2pevonedistat dosed on Days 1, 3, and 5, and do cetaxel 75 mg/m2on Day 1 in 21- day 
cycles. The MTD and RP2D of pevonedistat in combinat ion with pacli taxel+carbopl atin is 
20mg/m2pevonedistat dosed on Days 1, 3, and 5 and 175 mg/m2pacli taxel+carboplatin (AUC5) 
on Day 1 in 21- day cycles.
4.1.1 Study Drug
Pevonedistat (TAK -924/MLN4924) is a first -in-class, small mo lecule inhibitor of neural precursor 
cell expressed, developmentally down -regul ated 8 (NEDD8) -activat ing enzyme (NAE) under 
development for the treatment of malignancies. NAE, an E1 ligase, is an ess ential component of 
the NEDD8 conjugat ion pathway  that controls the activit y of a subset of ubiquit in E3 ligases, 
multiprotein co mplexes that transfer ubiquit in molecules to protein substrates that are then 
targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Culli n-dependent ubiquit in E3 ligases (CDLs) require 
conjugation to NEDD8 to be activated. CDLs control the timely ubiquit ination and consequent 
proteasomal degradat ion of proteins wit h important roles in cell cycle progression and signal 
transduction, cellular processes that are integral to tumor cell growth, proliferat ion, and survival. 
Inhibitors of NAE activit y may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of various cancers, such as 
solid tumors, by  [CONTACT_207595]  a subset of proteins that are
regulated by  [CONTACT_137482]. Pevonedistat treatment results in tumor growth inhibit ion in mouse tum or xenografts 
models.
4.1.2 Nonclinical Background Information
Pevonedistat is a potent and selective inhibitor of NAE activit y. Pevonedistat also inhibits human 
carbonic anhydrase II, which may  explain the extensive part itioning of pevonedistat in red blood 
cells (RBCs) that has been observed in animal species and humans (see the current Invest igator’s 
Brochure [IB]).
Pevonedistat demonstrated antitumor activit y in xenograft m odels when administered to 
immunocom promised mice by  [CONTACT_51211] (SC) route. The degree of the pharmacodynamic 
effect in HCT -116 xenograft tumors was dose dependent and correlated with dose -dependent 
antitumor activit y after 21 consecut ive days of twice -daily  treatm ent. Pevonedistat also 
demonstrated a dose -dependent pharmacodynamic response in addit ional xenograft models (AML 
model HL-60, the Cal u-6 lung tum or model, and 2 xenograft models o f diffuse large B cell 
lympho ma: OCI -Ly10 and OC I
-Ly19). Pevonedistat demonstrated antitumor activit y in these

activit y.
Pevonedistat showed medium permeabilit y in Caco -2 cells.
Plasma clearance ranged fro m relatively low in chimpanzees, to moderate in dogs and monkeys, to 
relatively high in rats. The plasma terminal disposition phase half -life (t 1/2z), calculated as ln(2)/λz, 
varied fro m <[ADDRESS_248026]  of pevonedistat in animals is through the hepat ic route. Urinary 
excret ion of unchanged pevonedistat was negligible in rats, monkeys, and chimpanzees. After an 
intravenous (IV) dose of [14C]-pevonedistat, radioactivit y was primarily  excreted in the feces in 
intact rats and in the bile in bile duct cannulated rats; excret ion was almo st com plete by  24 hours 
postdose. No plasma metabo lite accounted for more than 10% of the total plasma radioactivit y, 
suggest ing potentially low systemic exposure to metabolites.

4.1.3 Clinical Background Information
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics
Popul ation pharmacokinet ic (PK) analysis was conducted using data fro m pevonedistat 
single- agent studi es (C15001, C15002, C15003, and C15005) and pevonedistat in combinat ion 
with standard- of-care chemotherapy  (C15009 and C15010) in pat ients with solid tum or or 
hematol ogical malignancies. The database contained 335 subjects contribut ing 3768 PK 
observat ions. Pevonedistat plasma concentration -time profiles were well described by a 
2-compartment m odel with linear eliminat ion. Body surface area (BSA) was an important 
predi ctor of total  clearance after intravenous a dministrati on (CL), distribut ional clearance, and 
both central and peripheral vo lumes. For a typi[INVESTIGATOR_207570] a BSA of 1.73 m2, an alpha half -life 
of 1.27 hours and a beta (eliminat ion) half -
life of 7.85 hours are estimated. Concurrent 
administration o f carboplatin and paclitaxel decreased the CL of pevonedistat by  [CONTACT_3450]  
44%, translat ing to an approximately 80% higher pevonedistat exposure (area under the plasma 
concentration -time curve [AUC]) during coadministration with carboplat in and paclita xel, 
consistent with pevonedistat concentration data observed in C15010. Coadministration with 
azacit idine, gemcitabine, or docetaxel did not appear to affect the CL of pevonedistat. Race, sex, 
age, tumor ty pe (hematol ogic vs solid), mild or moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
[CrCl ] ≥30 mL/minute), or mildly impaired liver funct ion, to the extent represented in this dataset, 
had no impact on pevonedistat PK.
In a drug-drug interaction (DDI) study  (C15011), preliminary data from 26 evaluable pat ients 
(13from the itraconazole arm and 13 from the fluconazole arm) demo nstrate that steady -state 
exposures to fluconazo le had a minimal effect on the single -dose IV pevonedistat PK at 8 mg/m2, 
while mean systemic exposure to pevonedistat increased by [CONTACT_207596]  23% in the presence o f 
itraconazo le.

On the basis of these observat ions, addi tional patients were enrolled to evaluate the effects of 
itraconazo le on pevonedistat PK at the clinical dose of 20 mg/m2. Preliminary  data f rom 
11patients who complet ed protocol -specified dosing and PK evaluat ions indicated that 
pevonedistat sy stemic exposures fo llowing IV administration at 20 mg/m2in the presence of 
itraconazo le were similar to those in the absence of itraconazo le (geo metric mean rati o of 0.996 
with an associ ated 90% CI of 0.913 and 1.09). These findings with established moderate and 
strong cy tochrom e P-450 (CYP)3A inhibitor probes indicate a minor contribut ion of CYP3A to 
pevonedistat metabo lism in humans. On the basis of these results, moderate and strong CYP3A 
inhibitors and P-glycoprotein ( Pgp) inhibitors can be used in pat ients receiving pevonedistat. For 
individual studies in the pevonedistat clinical program, reference should be made to the respective 
protocol s for specific information relating to excluded and permitted medicat ions.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Experience
As of 22 January  2017, the clinical development program includes 9 clinical studies in pat ients 
with advanced malignancies. Four of the 9 clinical studies are completed phase 1 monotherapy  
studi es (C15001, C15002, C15003, and C15005) and 5 are ongoing phase 1/1b/2 studi es (Studi es 
C15009, C15010, C15011, Pevonedistat -1012, and Pevonedistat -2001). Pevonedistat is under 
development as a component of regimens with azacit idine (Study C15009, Pevonedistat- 1012, and 
Pevonedistat -2001) and with docetaxel or in co mbinat ion with carbopl atin and paclitaxel 
(Study C15010), and DDIs of pevonedistat with fluconazole or itraconazole (Study  C15011). Per 
the data available as of [ADDRESS_248027] 
1dose of pevonedistat in the overall clinical development program.
4.1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits
Pevonedistat will be administered in Part A of this study as a single 1 -hour IV infusio n at 50 mg/m2
on Day s 1 and 10. Pati ents will also receive rifampin (Days 3 through 11), a strong CYP3A 
inducer. In vitro, pevonedistat is predominant ly metabolized by [CONTACT_207597] 3A4; however, 
the in vivo contribut ion of CYP3A to overall clearance is inferred to be minimal, based on the lack 
of clinically meaningful effect of the strong CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole on pevonedistat PK. 
Because this is an induct ion DDI evaluat ion, it is hypothesized that the exposures of pevonedistat 
may be decreased upon co -administration with rifampin. T he safet y profile of this combination 
(pevonedistat+rifampin) is not known at this t ime.
It is anticipated that the chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_161735] B of this study may provide clinical benefit to 
patients. Study  C15010 was an open -label, phase 1b study  whose pri mary  objective was to 
establish the MTD and assess the safet y and tol erabili ty of pevonedistat in co mbinat ion with 
docetaxel, carboplat in, paclitaxel+carboplat in, or gemcitabine in patients with solid tumors. As of 
22 January 2017, enrollment was complet e. As of October 2017, 2 patients in complete response 
(CR) (still act ive in cycles 43+) remain on the study.
Data are available for [ADDRESS_248028] of care (SOC) (data cutoff: 15 Februa ry 2016). The safet y profile of pevonedistat in 
combinat ion with docetaxel (75 mg/m2), in pat ients with solid tumors was favorable, and the study

objective to establish the MTD for pevonedistat (25 mg/m2on Days 1, 3, and 5 of a 21 -day 
treatm ent cycle) was achieved. The safet y profile of pevonedistat in combinat ion with pacli taxel  
(175 m g/m2) and carbopl atin (AUC5) in patients wit h solid tumors was favorable. No new safet y 
signals were observed for pevonedistat in this study  com pared to an earlier so lid tum or study of 
pevonedistat as a single agent.
The most commo n (any grade) adverse event (AE) for patients in Arm 1 (pevonedistat+docetaxel) 
and Arm 2 (pevonedistat+carboplat in+paclitaxel) were fat igue (55%, 65%), nausea (36%, 54%), 
diarrhea (41%, 42%), anemi a (32%, 46%), const ipation (18%, 42%), increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) (27%, 35%), vomit ing (18%, 42%), and alopecia (23%, 38%), 
respectively . For patients who had an AE ≥Grade [ADDRESS_248029] commo n events 
were decreased neutrop hil count (27% each arm) and increased AST (18% and 23%), respectively.
Of the 54 response -evaluable pat ients diagnosed wit h a solid tumor, responses o f stable disease 
(SD) or better were observed in [ADDRESS_248030] response of CR or 
partial response (PR); 15.8% in response -evaluable pati ents in Arm 1 (pevonedistat+docetaxel) 
and 34.8% in Arm 2 (pevonedistat+paclitaxel+carboplat in). For patients treated in Arm 2 
(pevonedistat+paclitaxel+carboplat in), the median duration of re sponse (CR and PR) was 
7.375 months or 10 cy cles (8 pati ents); and for Arm 1 (pevonedistat+docetaxel), the median 
durati on of  response (PR) was 3.060 months or 5 cycles (3 patients). For the [ADDRESS_248031] response of CR that, at the time of data cutoff (15 February 2016), 
had durations of 6.57 (9 cycles) and 8.48 months (11 cycles), respectively , indicating that with

for potenti al DDIs wi th conco mitant use of strong metabo lic enzyme inducers during the clinical 
development of pevonedistat.
4.2.1 Rationale for Dose and Duration of PK Assessments in Part A
The pevonedistat dose of 50 mg/m2selected to be evaluated in this study  is based on the 
consideration of 50 mg/m2as the RP2D of pevonedistat in the monotherapy setting and dose -linear 
PK of pevonedistat that should permit translat ion of the results of this study  (ie, est imated 
magnitude of DDI) to lower doses such as those used in combinat ion settings (eg, 20 mg/m2in 
combinat ion with azaci tidine). Approximately  12evaluable pat ients will be required to provide 
the protocol -specified dosing and PK data in order to permit adequate assessment of the effects of 
rifampin on single -dose pevonedistat P K.
The eliminat ion half -life o f pevonedistat is approximately 9 hours. Serial PK sampling up to 
48hours fo llowing pevonedistat single dosing on Day 1 and Day 10 permits characterizat ion of 
PK profiles of pevonedistat in the absence (Day 1) and in the presence (Day 10) of  rifampin. 
Patients will  begin to receive once daily  (QD) doses of oral  capsules of [ADDRESS_248038] ion. The duration of PK 
assessment in Part A is approximately 12 days.

chemotherapy regimens, docetaxel and carboplatin+paclitaxel, which have been previously 
studi ed as combinat ion partners with pevonedistat, will be used in this study . On the basis of the 
MTDs determined in Stu dyC15010, pati ents will receive pevonedistat 25 mg/m2in combinat ion 
with docetaxel  75mg/m2or pevonedistat 20 mg/m2in co mbination wit h carboplat in 
AUC5+paclitaxel 175 mg/m2.
Docetaxel is indicated as a single agent for locally advanced or metastatic br east cancer and for 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after plat inum therapy failure. 
Paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer after failure of co mbinat ion chemotherap y 
for metastati c disease or rel apse wit hin 6 mo nths of adjuvant che motherapy . Pacli taxel is also 
indicated for the second -line treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome –related Kaposi’s 
sarcoma. In addit ion, paclitaxel in co mbinat ion with cisplat in is indicated for the first -line 
treatm ent of NSCLC in patients who a re not candidates for potentially curative surgery and/or 
radiation therapy .
Carbopl atin is indicated for the init ial treatment of advanced ovarian carcino ma in co
mbinat ion 
with other approved chemotherapeut ic agents ([ADDRESS_248040] atin and cyclophosphamide). Carboplat in is also indicated for the palliat ive treatment of 
patients wi th ovari an carcino ma recurrent after prior chemotherapy , including pat ients who have 
been previously treated with cisplat in.
Docetaxel and pacli taxel+carbopl atin are also approved in combinat ion with other 
chemotherapeut ic agents to treat other indicat ions; refer the applicable USPIs.
In addit ion to the approved indicat ions outlined above, these agents are widely used to treat a 
variet y of malignancies in patients for whom prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_161733]. Paclitaxel+carboplat in is 
also wi dely used to treat patients with newly  diagnosed NSCLC.
For a detailed description o f each of these medicat ions, see Section 8.9. The cho ice o f the above 
chemotherapy agents in combinat ion with pevonedistat in this study  is based on the following 
considerations:
These chemotherapy agents have been well recogn ized as SOC in a number of malignancies in 
first-line (carboplat in+paclitaxel) or in various relapse settings (both regimens).
The safet y profiles, risks, and benefits have been widely studied and reported.
Addit ive/synergist ic effects of these agents in c ombinat ion with pevonedistat have been studied in 
a number of in vitro and in vivo models by  [CONTACT_456].
The MTD and RP2Ds have been determined for the combinat ion of pevonedistat+docetaxel and

6.2 Number of Patients
Approximately  20 pati ents (for approximately  12 PK -evaluable pat ients) will be enro lled. A 
patient is considered to be enrolled when the first dose of any study drug has been administered. In 
Part A, patients who are withdrawn fro m treatm ent before com pleting protocol required 
procedures, or are not considered evaluable for Part A will be replaced. Four to 6 study  centers in 
the US will are planned to participate in the study .
6.3 Duration of Study
6.3.1 Duration of an Individual Patient’s Study Participation
[IP_ADDRESS] Part A: PK Assessment
It is ant icipated that an individual pat ient will participate in this study for approximately 12 days in 
Part A, with an EOS visit 30 (+10) days after receivin g thei r last dose of study  drug to permit the 
detection of any delayed treatment -related AEs. If patients continue to the optional part of the 
study , Part B, they  will forgo the EOS visit after Part A and be evaluated per the Part B 
continuat ion criteria (see Section 7.3). At least [ADDRESS_248052] before the start of 
Part B.
[IP_ADDRESS] Part B (Optional): Continued Treatment With Pevonedistat in C ombination With SOC 
Eligible pat ients will have the option to continue to receive treatment in Part B of this study  until 
discontinuat ion criteria are m et (see Secti on 9.6). If a pat ient chooses to continue to Part B, that 
patient may  enter Part B after meeting the entry  criteri a and wit hin approximately 1 week o f 
completing Part A; however, patients entering Part B must begin treatment within 1 to2weeks of 
completing Part A. The maximum durat ion of treatment will be 12 cy cles; however, if it is 
determined, after discussio n between the invest igator and the sponsor, that a patient would derive 
clinical benefit from cont inued treatment, the patient ma y remain on the current combinat ion 
therapy  or receive pevonedistat as a single agent bey ond [ADDRESS_248053] igator’s discretion, that are no l onger than 2 weeks in durat ion (up to 4 weeks 
after consul ting wit h the sponsor); treatment breaks may not be taken consecut ively. The 
investigator will confirm pat ient eligibilit y for continued treatment (Section 7.3) upon return fro m 
a treatment break, before resuming treatment.

Patients will  receive a single dose of 50 mg/m2pevonedistat via an approximate 1- hour 
(60±5 minutes) IV infusio n on Day  1. Pl asma PK sam ples will  be collected at a series of 
predetermined time poin ts up to 48 hours (Day 3) following the single dose of pevonedistat. The
start and end times of the IV infusio n should be recorded accurately. If the IV infusio n is 
interrupted, 2 addi tional PK samples (1 sam ple drawn when the infusio n is stopped and 1 sam ple 
drawn when the infusio n is restarted) should be co llected so that the patient may be considered 
evaluable. The exact date and time of each addit ional sample co llection and the actual start and 
stop times o f the infusio n should be recorded accurately. Patients will not be considered evaluable 
and need to be replaced if, in the assessment of the [COMPANY_005] clinical pharmaco logist, the infusio n 
interrupti on com promises PK evaluabilit y. All infusi on times must be recorded. Refer to the 
Pharmacy  Manual for the p reparati on of  the IV infusi on. 
There will be no pevonedistat doses from Day 2 through Day  9. On Day  10, a single dose of

Premedication for Docetaxel -Associated Hypersensitivity or Othe r Acute Reactions Guidelines
Prem edicat ion to prevent docetaxel- associated (hypersensit ivity or other) reactions is 
recommended according to inst itutional guidelines or l ocal practi ces. For exam ple, pati ents m ay 
be treated with dexamethasone (4 mg twice da ily for 3 day s), which shoul d start 24 hours before 
docetaxel administration.
[IP_ADDRESS] Carboplatin+Paclitaxel Administration
On Day  [ADDRESS_248085] atin as an approximately 
30-minute IV infusio n. After a m andatory  approximately 15 -minute time -out (pevonedistat -free 
period), pevonedistat will be administered IV. On Days 3 and 5, only pevonedistat will be given. 
The durati on of each cycle will be 21 days.
Refer to the applicable USPI [INVESTIGATOR_207573].
If a patient’s glo merular filtrat ion rate (GFR) is estimated using serum creat inine 
measurements by  [CONTACT_207605], the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that physicians consider cappi[INVESTIGATOR_207574] (AUC) to avoid potential toxicit y caused by [CONTACT_200033]. 
Using the Calvert formula described in the carb oplatin label , the m aximum  doses can be 
calculated as follows:
Total  carbopl atin dose (mg)=(target AUC) (GFR+25) [Calvert formula]
Maximum carboplat in dose (mg)=target AUC (mg min/mL) (150 m L/min)
The maximum dose is based on a GFR est imate that is capped at 125 mL/min for patients wit h 
norm al renal funct ion. No hi gher estimated GFR values should be used.
For a target AUC=5, the maximum dose is 5 150=750 mg.
For a target AUC=4, the maximum dose is 4 150=600 mg.
Refer to the applicable USPI [INVESTIGATOR_207575].
Prem edicat ion to prevent paclitaxel -associ ated (hypersensit ivity or other) reactions is 
recommended according to inst itutional guidelines or l ocal practi ces. For exam ple, pati ents 
may be treated with either dexametha sone (10 mg) 24 hours before and on the day of paclitaxe l 
dosing or methylpredniso lone immediately before paclitaxel dosing.

8.3 Dose Modification Guidelines (Part B)
8.3.1 Criteria for Beginning or Delaying a Subsequent Treatment Cycle
For individual pat ients experi encing specific toxi cities, treatm ent in each new cycle will be 
delayed unt il toxicity is reduced to Grade ≤1, patient’s baseline, or to a level considered acceptable 
by [CONTACT_207606] n with the proj ect clinician or designee.
Patients will  receive pevonedistat in combinati on wi th chem otherapy  on a dose regimen that has 
been established fro m Study  C15010. If dosing with pevonedistat is held for toxicit y during any 
given cycle, dosing may resume within that same cycle when toxicit y is reso lved (ALT/AST to 
Grade ≤1 or bilirubi n wit hin normal range). Alternatively, dosing may be held until the next cycle. 
The start of the next cycle may also be delayed for up to 3 weeks to allow pat ients to recover fro m 
any safety concerns, so that pevonedistat may be administered in co mbinat ionwith chemotherapy .
In Part B only , Day 1 dosi ng may be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 day s (of any cycle) to accommodate 
inclement weather, holidays, vacat ions, or other administrative reasons.
8.3.2 Criteria for Dose Interruption During a Cycle
In Part B, the infusio n may be slowed or stopped and restarted for any  associ ated 
infusio n-related reacti ons; however, this should be avo ided in Part A. The exact date and time 
of each addi tional sample collect ion and the actual start and stop times of the infusio n shoul d 
be recorde d accurately.
8.3.[ADDRESS_248086], 
if appropriate. Dose modification of pevonedistat (by 1 dose level=5 mg/m2) may  also be 
considered for events judge d by [CONTACT_207607].
Alopecia o f any duration will not lead to dose modificat ion or treatment delay.
Patients receiving pevonedistat+docetaxel may have a maximum of 2 docetaxel dose 
modificati ons. Docetaxel  is initially dosed at 75mg/m2, dose reductions up to 60 mg /m2and 
45mg/m2may be considered (if applicable) or modificat ion of pevonedistat ( see abov e).
Patients receiving pevonedistat+carboplat in+paclit axel may  have no m ore than 1 dose 
modificati on(if applicable) of chemotherapy  agents, as outlined below, or modificat ion of 
pevonedistat ( see above ). Paclitaxel is init ially dosed at 175 mg/m2. One dos e reducti on to 
135mg/m2may be considered. Carboplat in is initially dosed at AUC5. One dose reduction to 
AUC4 m ay be considered.
The decisio n to treat at a reduced dose level of chemotherapy is at the discretion o f the 
investigator. Discussions with the p roject clinician or designee are encouraged.

8.7.1 Guidance for Clinical Assessment and Management of Hemodynamic Compromise 
(Part A and Part B)
It is essential that the patient is carefully evaluated at screening and before each pevonedistat dose 
for early  symptoms and signs of hemodynamic compromise and/or active infect ion. Parti cular 
attenti on shoul d be paid to unexplained fever, tachycardia, hypotension, orthostasis, tachypnea, 
recent nausea and vo miting, and clin ical evidence of dehydrat ion. 
For those patients for whom there is a concern o f dehydrat ion, the fo llowing gui dance for 
rehydration before pevonedistat dosing may be considered: 500 mL/hour of 0.5 N saline given 
over 2 to 4 hours for a total o f 1 to 2 L o f fluid as clinically appropriate; each infusion of IV fluids 
shoul d be recorded in the electronic case report forms (eCRFs).
For all patients with anemia, and especially  for patients wi th hemoglo bin values <9 g/dL at 
screening or during the conduct of the study , RBC transfusio ns should be considered before 
pevonedistat dosing on the basis of the patient’s risk of inadequate oxy genat ion, underlying 
cardi opulm onary status, clinical judgment, and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48799]; each RBC transfusion 
shoul d be recorded in the eCRFs.
Patients who experience signs and symptoms of hemodynamic compromise after pevonedistat 
dosing (eg, tachy cardia, hypotension, orthostasis, changes in mental status, syncope, and 
dizziness) should be fo llowed clo sely and managed with supporti ve care, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207583].

drawn when the infusio n is stopped and 1 sample drawn when the infusio n is restarted) should be 
collected so that the patient may  be considered evaluable. The exact date and time of each 
additional sample collect ion and the actual start and stop times of the infusion should be recorded 
accurately.
There is no protocol -specified PK sampling for Part B.
The primary  purpose of PK sampling in this study  is to m easure pevonedistat concentrations in

treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a medicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal la boratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to

by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change fro m baseline.

development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion prot ein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any  lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [2].Clarificat ion should be made between 
an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), becau se the terms serious 
and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensit y 
(severit y) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor m edical  
significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). Thi s is NOT the same as serious , which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that 
pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not 
necessarily n eed to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to 
less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not 
intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section
 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an 
AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a c ommo n underlying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs and serious PTEs (as defined in Section 10.1) must be reported (see 
Secti on 10.3 for the peri od of  observati on) by  [CONTACT_207613] 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.
This will be done by [CONTACT_207614] (EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of 
an EDC SAE report is not feasible, then a facsimile of the completed [COMPANY_005] paper -based SAE 
form will be sent. A sample of the paper -based SAE form and processing directions are in the 
Study  Manual. Informat ion in t he SAE report or form must be consistent with the data provided on 
the eCRF.
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes availab le at a later date, the 
investigator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based SAE form if an EDC 
SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation immediately wit hin 24 hours of receipt. 
Copi [INVESTIGATOR_207588] (eg, ECGs, l aboratory  tests, di scharge 
summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.
All SAEs and serious PTEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or perm anent outcome o f the 
event. The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.

Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207589] (eg, surgery  was perform ed 
earlier or later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the event a nd the rel ationship of the event to study drug administration. For 
seriousPTEs, the investigator must determine both the severit y (toxi city grade) of the event and 
the causalit y of the event in relation to study  procedures.
Severit y (toxicit y grade) for each AE, including any lab abnormalit y, will be determined using the 
NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [2]. The criteria are provided in the St udy 
Manual.
Relationship of the event to study drug adm inistration (ie, its causalit y)will be determined by [CONTACT_4175] y es (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug?” If the event i s considered “not related” 
to study  drug administration, an alternate etio logy must be provi ded.
10.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study .

13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The populat ions used for analysis will include the fo llowing:
Safety popul ation will include patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. The safet y 
popul ation will be used for all safet y analyses.
PK populat ion will  include pat ients who:
–Receive the protocol -specified single pevonedistat dose in Part A .
–Do not receive any excluded conco mitant m edicat ions through the completion o f Part A .
–Have sufficient concentration -time data to permit reliable est imation of PK parameters.
13.1.[ADDRESS_248133] Version 1.1 guidelines ( Appendix H). The durati on of  response 
will be defined in pat ients with disease response (CR or PR) as the time between the first 
docum entati on of  response and PD. Responders without PD will be censored at the last clinical
assessment of response.
13.1.[ADDRESS_248134] ics of pevonedistat plasma concentration time 
data and PK parameters will be listed and tabulated as fo llows:
Day 1 (pevonedistat [in the absence of rifampin])

13.1.5 Safety Analysis
A safet y analysis will be conducted separately  for Part A and Part B to respectively characterize 
the safet y profile of pevonedistat in combinat ion wit h SOC. The safet y population will be used for 
the safet y analysis. Safet y will be evaluated on the basis of the incidence of AEs, severit y and type 
of AEs, and by  [CONTACT_207615]’s vital signs, weight, and clinical laboratory  
values using the safet y populat ion. Exposure to study drug and reasons for discontinuation will be 
tabul ated.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) in Part A is defined as any AE that occurs after 
administration of the first dose of study  treatm ent in Part A and up through [ADDRESS_248136] 
dose of study  drug in Part A for patients who do not con tinue into Part B; or up through Part B 
Cycle 1 Day  1 (predose) for patients wh o conti nue into Part B.
A TEAE in Part B is defined as any  AE that occurs after administration of the first dose of study  
treatm ent in Part B and up through [ADDRESS_248137] dose of study  drug in Part B.
AEs will be tabulated according to Medical Dic tionary  for Regulatory  Activities by [CONTACT_12360], Hi gh-Level  Term , and Preferred Term  and will  include the following categories:
TEAEs.
Drug -related TEAEs.
Treatment -emergent Grade 3, 4, and 5 AEs (presented by  [CONTACT_14555]).
Treatment -emergent drug-related Grade 3, 4, and 5 AEs (presented by  [CONTACT_14555]).
The m ost comm only reported TEAEs (i e, those events reported by  ≥10% of all pat ients).
SAEs.
Drug -related SAEs.
A listing of TEAEs result ing in study  drug di scont inuat ion will be provided.
The m ost comm only reported TEAEs (i e, those events reported by  ≥10% of all pat ients) will be 
tabul ated by  [CONTACT_161813]. Tabulat ion also will be provided that 
enumerates AEs by  [CONTACT_207616]. Deaths, SAEs, and AEs result ing instudy  drug 
discontinuat ion will  be tabulated.
Descript ive statistics for the actual values of clinical laboratory parameters (and change fro m 
baseline in clinical laboratory  param eters) will be presented for all scheduled measurements over 
time. Mean labo ratory  values over time will be plo tted for key  laboratory  parameters.
Shift tables for laboratory  parameters will be generated to show changes in NCI CTCAE grade 
from baseline to the worst postbaseline value. Graphical displays of key safet y parameters, s uch as

pevonedistat safet y profile.
Graphical displays will be used to show vital sign parameters over time separately for Part A and 
for Part B. 
All conco mitant m edications collected from screening throughout the study  period will  be 
classified to Preferred Terms according to the World Healt h Organizat ion Drug Di ctionary.
Addit ional safet y analyses may be performed to enumerate rates of toxicit ies and to further define 
the safet y profile of pevonedistat.
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination
No interim analysis is planned.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
The sample size calculat ion is based on the expected two -sided 90% CI for the difference in the 
paired, log-transform ed AUC (or C max) means of pevonedistat co -administered with rifampin and 
pevonedistat administered alone. Based on the preliminary  data obtained from  Study  C15011, the 
within-subject coefficient of variat ion was est imated to be 13% for AUC and 58% for C max, 
respectively . Assuming the AUC (or C max) ratio is 1.0, with a sample size of 12 evaluable patients, 
the 90% CI of the ratio of geometric means is expected to be (0.907, 1.102) for AUC and (0.671, 
1.49) for C maxbased on the previously di scussed vari ance assumpt ions. If the ratio is X, the 90% 
CI of the ratio of geometric means is expected to be within (0.907X, 1.102X) and (0.671X, 1.49X), 
respectively . Pati ents who are not PK evaluable may  be repl aced to ensure availabilit y of 
approximate ly 12 PK -evaluable patients for the final analysis.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment 02 04 September 2018
CONFIDENTIALTests and procedures should be performed on schedule, but occasional changes are allowable (±2 days) for holidays, vacations, and other administrative reasons.
(a) For patients to be eligible for dosing with pevonedistat+chemotherapy (Part B), they must meet certain entry criteria (se e Section 7.3). 
(b) If the patient continues into Part B, the EOS visit will occur 30 days (+10 days) after the last dose of study drug(s) in Part B or before the start of subsequent therapy for the 
patient’s indication, if that occurs sooner.
(c) The investigator will select which chemotherapy (docetaxel or carboplatin+paclitaxel) that each patient will receive in c ombination with pevonedistat. On Day 1, when 
pevo nedistat and chemotherapy agents are both administered, chemotherapy will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_51203]. Th e infusion of pevonedistat may be slowed or 
stopped and restarted for any associated infusion -related reactions. The dose of pevone distat may be reduced because of toxicities in accordance with Section 8.3.3 . The 
chemotherapeutic agent may be dose reduced because of toxicities in accordance with Section 8.3.3 . See Section 8.1for the details of study drug administration. NOTE: a time -out 
of approximately 15 minutes is required between the end of infusion of the chemotherapy regimen and the start of infusion of pevonedistat.
(d)For patients to be eligible for dosing with pevonedistat+chemotherapy (Part B), they must meet certain entry criteria (see Se ction 7.3). For Cycle [ADDRESS_248155] meet 
the criteria for beginning a new cycle of treatment (Section 8.3.1 ).
(e) A full ph ysical examination is required on Day 1 (predose) of Cycle 1. For Cycle 2 and beyond, a symptom -directed phy sical examination is to be performed on Day 1 predose.
(f) Predose assessment may be performed 1 day in advance if necessary.
(g) On days when study drug is administered, vital signs are to be measured predose (20 minutes [±10 min]) before the infusion of chemotherapy (when pevonedistat and 
chemotherapy agents are both administered) or pevonedistat; 30 minutes (±10 min) after the start of pevonedistat dosing; and 1 hour (±10 min) after the completion of pevonedistat 
dosing. When the timing of vital signs assessment coincides with the timing of a blood draw, vital signs will be measured bef ore blood sample collection. 
(h) Radiological imaging (as CT sc an or MRI) will be required as entry criteria for Part B to assess the status of the patient’s underlying disease. If the pat ient has had appropriate 
imaging scans performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of Part B, then the results of those scans may be used; otherwise, the first assessment will take place before Cycle [ADDRESS_248156] (with IV contrast, 
except for patients with an allergy to contrast agents), MRI, x -ray, and/or bone scanning to monitor and assess disease progression. If the anatomic region cannot be adequately 
imaged by [CONTACT_4654], MRI may be used instead; see Section 9.4.14. Response will be determined according to RECIST version 1.1.
(i) Including serious PTEs in Part A; see Section 10.1.1 .
(j) In Part B, a serum or urine pregnancy test must also be performed for women of childbearing potential at every cycle (typ ically  performed on Day 1 predose of each cycle; 
however, if a se rum pregnancy test is used, this may be performed up to 3 days before Day 1), with negative results available before the firs t dose is administered in the respective 
cycle. A serum or urine pregnancy test will also be performed for women of childbearing po tential at the EOS/Early Termination visit in Part B. Pregnancy tests may also be repeated 
during the study if requested by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB or if required by [CONTACT_427].
(k) Hematology samples will be collected as part of the entry criteria for Part B an d before dosing with study drug on Days 1, 3, and 5. Samples may be drawn up to [ADDRESS_248157] samples on the previous Friday. In addi tion, a sample will be taken at the EO S visit.
(l) Clinical chemistry samples will be collected as part of the entry criteria for Part B and before dosing with study drug o n Day s 1, 3, and 5. On Days 1, 3, and 5, samples may be 
drawn up to 1 day before dosing. In addition, a sample will be tak en at the EOS visit.

Appendix F Definition of Postmenopausal
Definition of Postmenopausal
A postm enopausal  state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternat ive medical 
cause. A high FSH level in the postm enopausal  range m ay be used to confirm a postmenopausal 
state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy . However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Refer to the

Appendix GAcceptable Methods of Contraception Considered Highly Effective
Birth control  methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used 
consistent ly and correctly  are considered to be highly  effect ive. Such methods include t he 
following:
Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibit ion of ovulation (a).
–Oral.
–Intravaginal.
–Transdermal.
Progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation (a).
–Oral.
–Injectable.
–Implantable (b).
Intrauterine device (b).
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (b).
Bilateral tubal occlusio n (b).
Vasectomized partner (b,c).
Sexual abst inence (d).
Methods Considered Less Highly Effective
Acceptable birth control methods tha t resul t in a failure rate of more than 1% per y ear include the 
following:
Progestogen -only oral horm onal contracepti on, where inhibit ion of ovulation is not the primary 
mode of act ion.
Male or female condo m with or wi thout spermicide (e).

(a) Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product, which may 
reduce the efficacy of the contraception method.
(b) Contraception methods that, in the context of this guidan ce, are considered to have low user dependency.
(c) Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the woman of childbearing potential participant of the study and that the vasectomized p artner has received medical 
assessment of the surgical success.
(d) In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk asso ciated with the study treatments. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject.
(e) A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm , or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier methods) is 
also considered an acceptable, but not a highly effective, birth control method.

C=maximum grade over all cours es, G -CSF=granulocyte colony stimulating factor, E=estimate, N=number of courses in set C and number of patients in set P, NCI CTC= National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, P=maximum grade over all courses within a patient, pRBCs=packed red blood cells, WBC=white blood cell.
(a) Differences are calculated by [CONTACT_207621]+carboplatin arm proportion from the cisplatin+paclitaxel arm pro portion; statistically significant differences in proportions 
between the [ADDRESS_248167]; therefore, the estimates may differ by ±1 from the difference of the percentages of the 
treatment arm columns.
(b) Transfusion of pRBCs and use of antibiotics and G -CSF were not assessed for the last treatment cycle within a patient. Use of antibiotics and use of G -CSF are graded in the same 
fashion as transfusion of pRBCs. Use of antibiotics/application of G -CSF is coded as a toxicity of Grade 3; a Grade 0 is applied otherwise.

Appendix LDetailed Description of Amendments to Text
The primary  secti on(s) of the protocol affected by [CONTACT_51280] 02 are indicated. 
The corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol.
Change 1:Clarify the exclusio n criterion regarding the assessment of LVEF.
The primary  change occurs in Section 7.2, Exclusion Criteria .
Initial 
wording:13. Left ventricular eject ion fraction <50% as assessed by  [CONTACT_161788].
Amended 
or new 
wording:13. Left ventricular eject ion fraction(LVEF) <50% as assessed by [CONTACT_207622] [ADDRESS_248169] be determined by 
[CONTACT_207623] .
Rationale for Change:
The intent of the protocol has been to allow sites to use historical LVEF data,if available ,or 
perform  an echocardiogram ,if needed , to determine patient eligibilit yfor the study . This point has 
been clarified in this protocol amendment.
The fo llowing sect ions also contain this change:
Secti on 9.4.12 Echocardi ogram .
Appendix A Schedules of Events (SOE for Treatment Part A [DDI]).

Protocol Incorporating Amendment 02 04 September 2018
Change 2: Delete the requirement that, for inclusion in the study, patients must have a tumor that 
is radiographically or clinically evaluable and/or measurable.
The change occurs in Sect ion 7.1, Inclusio n Cri teria.
Deleted 
text:2. Adult pat ients who have a histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic or 
locally advanced so lid tumor that is appropriate for treatment with pevonedista t 
in combinat ion with either docetaxel  or carbopl atin+paclitaxel in Part B of this 
study , or have progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_14482] , or f or whom  convent ional 
therapy  is not considered effective. The tum or m ust be radi ographically  or 
clinically evaluable and/or m easurable.
Rationale for Change:
As this is a phase 1 DDI study, the requirement for measurable disease is not considered essent ial.
Change 3:Change serious adverse event reporting from a paper -based system to electronic data 
capture.
The change occurs in Sect ion 10.2, Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs .

This will be done by [CONTACT_207614] (EDC) SAE report. 
If transmission of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, then a facsimile of the 
completed [COMPANY_005] paper-based SAE form will be sent. A sample of the 
paper-based SAE form and processing directions are in the Study Manual. 
Information in the SAE report or form must be consistent with the data 
provided on the eCRF.
If information not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a 
later date, the investigator will transmit a follow-up EDC SAE report (or a 
paper-based SAE form if an EDC SAE report is not feasible) or provide other 
documentation immediately within 24 hours of receipt. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_207591] (eg, ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, 
postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested.
All SAEs and serious PTEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent 
outcome of the event. The timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the 
same as those for the initial report.Property of [COMPANY_005]: For Non-Comone by [CONTACT_207626] o

Protocol Incorporating Amendment 02 04 September 2018
Rationale for Change:
SAEs are being reported by  [CONTACT_207628]; the amended text reflects only  a change in 
procedure for reporting SAEs.
Change 4:Clarify the timing of chemistry  and hematol ogy laboratory  assessments before 
administration of the Day  1 dose of pevonedistat in Part A (drug -drug interaction) of the study.
The primary  change occurs in Section 7.1Inclusio n Cri teria.
Deleted 
text:3.Clinical laboratory  values as specified below within [ADDRESS_248174] dose of 
study  drug :
Rationale for Change:
To clarify that the clinical laboratory  values specified in Inclusio n Criterion #[ADDRESS_248175] been performed within 3 days of Day 1, these results can also be used as the 
Day 1 predose evaluat ion to determine whether the patient can receive study drug and do not need 
to be repeated.

and subject population.  The summary should provide a concise overview of the study for non-scientific and scientific members of the IRB.  Please avoid medical or technical term inology.  In general, the abstract of a grant does not provide 
a suitable lay summary.
Body dysmorphic disorder is a common condition charact erized by [CONTACT_220318] "imagined ugliness" with 
debilitating distress, checking and avoidance behaviors, and seeking unnecessary cosmetic medical procedures. Serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications and cognitive behavioral therapy helps some patients, but many do not benefit from existing treatments, and no medications are FDA-approved for this indication. Psilocybin is under development as a treatment of several psychiatric disorders, with placebo-controlled trial evidence of safety and prolonged efficacy for majo r depression when administered as a single dose with 
intensive support by a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220289]. A single case report in body dysmorphic disorder suggests psilocybin might also have efficacy for this disorder.

Significance and Rationale
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 5Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder in which individuals are preoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_220290], causing significant distress and functional impairment (Phillips 2005). Compulsive checking may occur, and sufferers may seek out unnecessary or risky cosmetic procedures. Most co mmon concerns in BDD involve skin, hair, and nose. 
BDD has a high prevalence in the general population of 1.7%-2.9% (Buhlman et al., 2010), but it is under-studied. To date, there have only been controlled clinical  trials to evaluate a single medication class – 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Phillips et al 2002, 2006;  Hollander et al 1999) – and a single psychotherapy 
modality – cognitive-behavioral therapy (Wilhelm et al 2014). Although these treatments can be effective in many, they typi[INVESTIGATOR_220291]. There is a need for new intervention approaches.
The rationale for considering psilocybin as a potential treatment for BDD includes a case report (Hanes 2003), 
in which unsupervised use of psilocybin resulted in symptomatic improvement, as well as evidence for psilocybin efficacy in conditions that frequently co-occu r or overlap with BDD, such as obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (Moreno et al, 2006) and major depressive disorder. The first step in further evaluation of the efficacy 
and safety of psilocybin for BDD is this proposed open trial, utilizing methods established in prior controlled trials of psilocybin for other disorders.
Psilocybin Background (see Studerus, et al., 2011, for a useful review)
"Magic mushrooms" have been used ceremonially and recreationally for thousands of years. psilocybinproduces an altered state of consciousness (ASC) si milar to LSD, characterized by [CONTACT_220319], mood, and thought, including changes in the experience of time, space, perceptual hypersensitivity, illusions, and pseudohallucinations (i.e. hallucinations with intact reality testing and insight) 
intensification of affective responses, enhanced ability for introspection, regression to primitive and childlike thinking, and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional undertones (Fischer, 1971; Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008; Isbell, 1959; Leuner, 1962; Nichols and Chemel, 2006; Rümmele and Gnirss, 1961; Wolbach et al., 1962). These effects are similar to those of LSD, except of shorter duration (4-6 hours instead 
of 8-12 hours) and psilocybin tended to produce less anxiety, fewer panic reactions and affective disturbances, and milder vegetative side effects than LSD.     Direct pharmacologic effects of psilocybin appear to occur through stimulation (agonism) of variousserotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A. The 5-HT2A receptor seemsparticularly important as many, but not all of psilocybin's effects are blocked by 5-HT2A receptor antagonists. Serotonergic hallucinogens such as psilocybin are considered relatively safe physiologically and do not produce dependence (Johnson et al., 2008; Leuner, 1981; Nichols, 2004).     Studerus et al., 2011, summarized patient experi ence, physiologic effects and follow-up from 8 studies in
which 110 non-psychiatrically ill volunteers were given oral psilocybin 2-28 mg (depending on the study) orplacebo and followed for up to 16 months. They report the following dose-dependent symptoms (i.e., the higher the dose, the greater the effect):
- Positive experienced derealization
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 6- Positive experienced depersonalization
- Changed sense of time- Positive mood- Mania−like experience
- Anxious ego dissolution- Negative experienced derealization- Thought disorder- Paranoia- Loss of thought control- Loss of body control- Visionary restructuralization- Elementary hall. & illusions- Scenery hallucinations- Synesthesiae (that is, stimulation of one sensory organ elicits a response from another sensory organ)- Changed meaning of percepts- Facilitated recollection- Facilitated imagination
Psychological Adverse Events included:
- inactivation- poor concentration- tiredness- dazed state- introversion- self-confidence (initially increased, later slightly decreased)- heightened mood- emotional excitation- sensitivity- slight increase in anger- apprehension-anxiety- depression- dreaminess
Most of these adverse events returned to or toward baseline by 24 hours. The main exceptions were what 
they call "inactivation" and "tiredness" which remained nearly as high at 24 hours as at 3 hours. In addition, though closer to baseline, concentration remained decreased and dazed state and dreaminess were still increased at 24 hours. Griffith, et al. (2016) reports next  day headache even with low dose psilocybin (1 mg or 
3 mg).
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 7Physical Adverse Events included (in parentheses are % experiencing at highest dose [.315 mg/kg = 22 mg in a 
70 kg person (154 pounds)]):- fatigue (60%)- exhaustion (22.5%)- headache, head pressure or facial pain (37.5%)
- lack of energy (22.5%)- excessive sleep requirement (15%)
- fast exhaustibility (17.5%)- lack of appetite (17.5%)- heavy or tired legs (12.5%)- sleeplessness (5%)- abdominal pain (7.5%)- throat pain/irritation (7.5%)- diarrhea (7.5%)
Long-term Negative Effects
We found a single case report of persistent psychological effects ("flashbacks") following psilocybin use (Espi[INVESTIGATOR_220292]., 2005). Griffiths et al. (2016), followed 51 depressed and/or anxious terminal cancer patients for 
six months after they received 30 mg or 22 mg of psilocybi n, reporting “all . . . adverse events resolved fully by 
[CONTACT_220320]” except headache which persisted into the next day in two subjects, and "There were no cases of hallucinogen [sic] persisting perception disorder or prolonged psychosis.".     While not definitive, given there are hundreds of  reported dosings of psilocybin plus unknown numbers of
recreational usages, a single case report suggests continuing  symptoms long past the drug's active effects are
likely ra re. Several authors point out that early reports of  continuing flashbacks following uncontrolled use of 
hallucinogens mainly refer to LSD, not psilocybin, and did not address whether other drugs were also used or whether pre-existing psychiatric conditions that will be excluded in the present study were also present. Also, such uses were rarely closely monitored by a facilitator as will occur in the present study.     We are not aware of a study comparing facilitator to no facilitator. Intuitively, it makes sense that having
someone present who might assist the individual in making sense of their experience might mitigate againstit being as negative an experience as it might otherw ise be, and we are not aware of reports of "flash-backs"
or other late negative effects in individuals who used  psilocybin in the presence of a trained facilitator.
Addiction Potential
As psilocybin is a Schedule I drug (meant to mean "no currently accepted medical use and a high potentialfor abuse") it is reasonable to have concern that study  participants will become addicted to psilocybin. Our
understanding is there is no documented case of an individual becoming addicted to "magic mushrooms" orpsilocybin. In fact, individuals who have used either magic mushrooms or psilocybin repeatedly spacetheir use out as if their repeat use is less than several months after a prior use, they achieve only a fraction of
the earlier effect. This also argues against there being addiction potential for this compound.
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 8Rationale for the Psilocybin Doses use in this Study
Carhart-Harris, et al. (2016), suggested efficacy for depression with 10 and 25 mg and Griffiths, et al. (2016) found [ADDRESS_264673] adverse events being transient (1-3 hours) and mild, while Griffiths decreased their "high dose" from 30 mg to 22 mg because of poor tolerance of the 30 mg dose (vomiting); they reported [ADDRESS_264674]. Both 
Carhart-Harris and Griffiths reported the only delayed (n ext day) adverse events were headaches lasting < 24 
hours. Personal communication with Carhart-Harris (2019), supported use of the 25 mg dose as optimal to maximize efficacy while minimizing risk of adverse events, based on his published studies and subsequent unpublished experience with psilocybin.

I attest to follow the COVID-19 Safety Guideline for Columbia Psychiatry and NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40372]-Entry outlined in the 
NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40373]’s June 1, 2020 memo, which include but are not limited to:
•Infection Control/PPE – Guidelines
•Research participants will only come on-site if absolutely necessary for study procedures.
•Clinical research teams will screen heir participants for COVID symptoms (night before and day of 
onsite visit, documenting this in the chart), and escort them in and out of the building.
•COVID/COVID-like symptoms in participants will be reported to the IRB via PRISM as an SAE.
COVID testing: Depending on COVID conditions in th e community, the participant and the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220296], to determine if any may currently be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The test involves collecting a sample by [CONTACT_220326] a cotton swab several inches into the nose. If the 
test shows that the participant or either therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220297]-19, your research treatment visit will be postponed.
Internet-based data collection or transmission will be conducted following HIPAA and NYSPI [CONTACT_21401].1. Visit 1 (Screening). A complete psychiatric and physical examination will be performed, including
Psychiatric, Medical and Social Histories, MINI Structured Psychiatric Interview, SCID-[ADDRESS_264678] laboratory testing including 
EKG, urine for routine analysis, drugs of abuse and (if appropriate) pregnancy and blood for hematologies and 
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 17chemistries including thyroid function. A physical examin ation will be performed at the screening or between 
screening and Visit 2 (Day -1), with results obtained before psilocybin administration day. 
Additional screening will specifically assess eligibility for the MRI portion of the study with the self-rated 
PhenX Toolkit Hand Dominance Measure and MRI Metal Screening Questionnaire. Contraindications to MRI scanning are:
•Paramagnetic metallic implants or devices
•Contraindicating magnetic resonance imaging or any other non-removable paramagnetic metal in the 
body (e.g., pacemaker, paramagnetic metallic prosthesis, surgical clips, shrapnel, necessity for constant medicinal patch, some tattoos)
•Being unable to tolerate the scanning procedures (i.e., severe obesity, claustrophobia)
Patients with contraindicated metal or left-handedness will not be offered MRI participation but will complete 
all other parts of the protocol.
 
Additional visits (V1a, V1b) will be scheduled as needed to follow up on any lab abnormalities and for patient to establish relationship with study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
Participants will be invited to bring to the screening a companion (friend/family member) whom they would 
like to support them through the study. Such a companion will be informed of their potential role and will be asked to sign a “caregiver” consent form at the Screening Visit. Caregivers will receive information about the signs of worsening of depression and suicide risk a nd ways to contact [CONTACT_220327]. The 
caregiver will complete a questionnaire at screening, Week 3 and Week 12. 
2. Visit 2 (Baseline, Day -1) . Eligibility and willingness to participate will be reassessed. At this visit, the patient 
meets with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220298]. MRI-eligible subjects will complete acquisition of resting state fMRI. Subjects will also complete an invert ed face computer task in which they will view an image 
of a face and then will be shown an image of two faces (one matching and one non-matching morphed face) and asked to select the matching face as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_220299]. The matching and non-matching faces will be presented either upright or inverted, in various combinations. This task assesses global vs. local visual processing, and it has previously been shown to be abnormal in BDD (Feusner, 2010).
3. Visit 3 (Psilocybin Day, Day 0). The next day, a study psychiatrist again assesses eligibility; those eligible and 
agreeable receive their dose of psilocybin (25 mg) and spend the next eight hours (longer if needed) with the two therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]; when deemed appropriate, the patient is accompanied home either by a person of their choosing or a staff member. The patient will be reminde d that they should not drive or drink alcohol at least 
until after the end of Visit 4 (next day). Vital signs are taken prior to their dose of psilocybin and prior to leaving the clinic and a study psychiatrist evaluates prior to their departure for whether their condition requires them not to leave. In the latter case, they w ill either remain in the Biological Studies Unit (BSU) until

Psychological Approaches to Anxiety
•During Visit 2 and prior to ingestion of psilocybin dur ing Visit 3, explain anxiety, even fear, may occur
•During Visit 2, train patient in relaxation and breathing techniques that may alleviate anxiety
•On Visit 3, shortly after psilocybin ingestion, rem ind subject of possible anxiety reaction and that 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220300]
•During Visit 3, if patient reports excessive anxiety or fear, walk them through relaxation and breathing 
techniques taught during Visit 2
•Encourage exploration of psilocybin experience
•Call M.D. if fear is not alleviated by [CONTACT_220328]
•Anxiety: Lorazepam or alprazolam
•Psychosis: Risperidone
•Headache: Acetaminophen
•Symptomatic elevation in BP: Beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol)
•Nausea/vomiting: Ice chips
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220301]
•Given prior experience with psilocybin treatment, the need for inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220302]
•In the event that patients require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_220303] 5-South unit.
•Prior to psilocybin dosing [CONTACT_220346] will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (email or text [PHONE_4672]) to ascertain
•whether backup 5S inpatient bed at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_5915]. In event of lack of availability for such a 
bed on 5S after it has been offered (e.g., unanticipated issue on inpatient unit) the NYPH. Emergency Room will serve as backup.
4. Visit 4 (Post-Psilocybin Day 1). The patient returns to the anxiety clinic and reports any experiences since
leaving the clinic as well as having blood, urine, and EK G tests. MRI eligible patients will have another resting 
state fMRI session, The inverted face task will be repeated.
5. Visits 5-8 (Post-Psilocybin Weeks 1-3 and 12). The patient returns 1, 2, [ADDRESS_264680] evaluation of psychiatric symptoms, functioning and AE's. These visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_40425].
6. Telephone visits (Weeks 6 & 9). The patient is contact[CONTACT_5143] 6- and 9-weeks post-psilocybin
for standard evaluation of psychiatric symptoms and AE's.

12, if the patient agrees, all Visit 10 (Week 12) ratings including Independent Evaluation will be made.
Extra Visits
1. Extra visits (or in-person visits when phone visits are called for) will "kick in" if:2. Patient reports on-going or intermittent nega tive effects, including but not limited to:
a. "Flash-backs"b. Psychotic or quasi-psychotic (e.g., illusions, non-paranoid worries re. how others are viewing or 
treating them) experiences
3. Significant (e.g., > 25% increase in BDD-YBOCS) worsening from original severity.4. Significant suicidality (e.g., patient reports suicidal thinking with any intent to act)5. Physician's clinical judgment
Detailed Procedure for Staff Escort Home
In the event that it is deemed appropriate for a patient to return home following their psilocybin experience and said patient has not provided a responsible party to accompany him or her home, a staff member will accompany the individual from the BSU treatment room to the exterior door of their home. Transportation 
will be via a car service for which we will pay. The staff member will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_220329] [INVESTIGATOR_220304], erring  on the side of further observation. Else, the staff 
member will allow the individual to enter their home and close the door, the staff member remaining outside and relieved of escort duties.

include a medication taper and discontinuation may be asked to include an independent medical monitor (an MD not on the study team) who will aid the study team in determining whether study discontinuation is needed.   In addition, explain procedures for managing subjects who are withdrawn from the protocol.
For treatment studies: To minimize risks to subjects, operationalized drop-out criteria should be defined so that subjects 
who worsen, or in some cases, fail to improve, are removed from the study and offered standard care.  The threshold for drop-out should consider the level of risk associated with non-improvement for the specific disorder, the availability of alternatives, and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_220305].  For example, emergence of suicidal intent, or psychosis, should prompt immediate clinical evaluation and withdrawal from the study.
1. Patient withdraws consent
2. Study personnel determines it is not in the pa tient's best interest to continue in the study. 
3. Clinical worsening
4. At each assessment participants will be evaluated for clinical worsening, and any participant who 
reports symptomatic worsening (CGI Change Score >4) will be further evaluated for need for urgent clinical treatment. Further evaluation will include the Hamilton Depression Scale, the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and the Clinical Global Impression Change Scale, but the ultimate decision to provide or refer to non-st udy treatment will be based on clinical judgement, 
with reasoning documented in the chart. 
5. Any participant who evidences need for non-study  clinical treatment before psilocybin 
administration  will be removed from the study and offered appropriate referrals, including 
transitional treatment in the Anxiety Disorders Clinic, or being walked to the emergency room if indicated. After psilocybin administration, clinical deterioration will be treated the same way, except that patients will be permitted to conti nue participation in remaining study assessments.
6. Potential pregnancy: Participants who prior to dosing have a positive pregnancy test or report 
suspecting pregnancy will be removed from the study.  Participants who after dosing have a positive pregnancy test will be excluded from th e repeat MRI but will be allowed to continue in 
study assessments of symptoms.  They will be offered assistance with obstetrical follow-up

Research involving participants who are in need of treatment invariably involves delay to care, and this delay is 
associated with risk.  Scheduling of procedures must be carefully organized to minimize delay.  Other delay must involve only that minimally necessary to accomplish the aims of the research while respecting subject well- being and safety. 
Describe the delay, by [CONTACT_220330], before a participant can receive treatment of known 
efficacy or standard care routinely offered in the community.
Participants in the study will need to be free of SSRI medication for at least 2 weeks prior to psilocybin administration and for 3 weeks thereafter, so total delay to an established treatment will be 5 weeks. Patients who for clinical reasons need treatment intervention sooner will be offered established treatment. If patients need to restart SSRI’s prior to the psilocybin session, they will be excluded. If they restart after the session, the reason will be documented, and the patient will be followed until the end of study visit provided that informed consent is maintained.

1. BDD might not remit or may worsen
2. Psilocybin has not been extensively studied, so both short and especially long-term consequences of its

Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 27Describe procedures for minimizing risks:
1. BDD might not remit - standard medication treatment, such as with an SSRI will be instituted and 
patient will be referred for CBT or other therapy as clinically indicated.
2. Psilocybin has not been systematically studied, so both short and especially long-term consequences of 
its use may not be known at present - while unknown risks cannot be minimized, we will minimize the 
likelihood of such risks occurring unnoticed during the study period by [CONTACT_220331]'s at every post-psilocybin visit and encouraging patients to call between visits should any untoward events occur, whether they think they may be related or not.
3. Known psychologic effects of psilocybin include:
a. Euphoric mood - the risk of feeling too good is it can result in rash behavior, as in mania. We 
anticipate that if euphoria occurs, it will happen on the psilocybin day when the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220308]. As overly euphoric mood is a characteristic of bipolar  illness, so to minimize risk the study excludes 
patients with known bipolar disorder. 
b. Dissociative experience (i.e., feeling outside one's body or unreal, a distorted sense of time) – 
We anticipate that if the patient has a dissociative experience, it will occur on the psilocybin day when the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_220309] "talk them down" and other clinicians will also be readily available.
c. Hallucinations - as with b)d. Psychotic experience such as paranoia - as with b); our anticipation is psychotic experiences will 
spontaneously remit within hours of the subject receiving psilocybin. If not, the on-call psychiatrist can determine whether to give an antipsychotic medication.
e. Difficulty with cognition (e.g., trouble adding or solving puzzles) - again, this will occur on the 
psilocybin day and will be minimized by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_34722], and it is anticipated to dissipate by 
[CONTACT_220332], or at least by [CONTACT_58079]. 
f. Disturbance in attention - this is also anticipated to mainly occur on the day the patient receives 
psilocybin, but its impact on functioning will be monitored out to Week 12 using the SDS.
g. Mood alteration – mood will be monitored using the HAM-D-[ADDRESS_264683] (e.g., crying when one is not sad or laughing when nothing odd occurred) – 
this will be monitored by [CONTACT_220333][INVESTIGATOR_541]'s interaction with the patient.
4. Known medical effects of psilocybin:
a. Clumsiness - a staff member will remain with patient at all times ready to prevent falls as 
needed (e.g., traveling to and from the bathroom)
b. Feeling weak - dittoc. Headache - standard headache remedies (i.e., NSAID's)

j. Vomiting - this is unusual and time limited; probably too short-lived for anti-emetic medication 
to help; could try ginger ale or ginger tea
5. Discomfort of repeated needle sticks and other procedures: experienced, trained phlebotomists will 
obtain blood
6. Time commitment to completing forms, and attending evaluation, treatment, and follow-up sessions - 
we will do everything we can to limit time spent; e.g. , if patients must wait for their doctor, they will be 
instructed to complete their self-report forms
7. Psilocybin is not considered safe during pregnancy or breast-feeding, because such safety testing has 
not been done. Therefore, potential participants will be excluded if pregnant, breast feeding or planning to become pregnant during the next [ADDRESS_264684] twice during the study (on the day prior to taking psilocybin, 
and on the day taking psilocybin). Participants will be cautioned that even if a pregnancy test is negative, they could still be pregnant, because these tests cannot detect very early pregnancies (that is, within the first few days). Participants will be excluded if they do not agree use an effective form of birth control before and throughout study participat ion. Methods of birth control considered to be 
effective include double barrier methods (condom plus spermicide, or diaphragm plus spermicide), birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], birth control shots and intrauterine devices. Men who are sexually active will also be excluded if they do not agree to using adequate contraception. Female partners of men participating in this study should use one of the acceptable methods of contraception (contraception pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], intrauterine device, bilateral tubal occlusion).
8. To minimize the risk of MRI we will observe [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidelines for magnet strength and exposure to radio waves. We will exclude people with magnetic 
metal in their body through careful review and checklist. Participants will be specifically warned about risks of a pacemaker or metal objects inside the body, as well as the need to remove all metal from their clothing and all metal objects from their pockets. Also, although there are no known risks to 
pregnancy, we will not scan someone who is pregnant, and women in childbearing years will take a pregnancy test just before each MRI scan.

become uncomfortable, whether with physical reactions (s uch as elevated blood pressure) or behavior (e.g., 
belligerence) or reported symptoms (reports of psychotic sy mptoms or suicidality). The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]'s training will 
be to err on the side of calling the physician unnecessarily rather than allowing the patient's condition to worsen further. While our read of others' experiences wi th similar doses of psilocybin is situations requiring 
medical interventions are highly unlikely, we recognize it is important to be prepared for such an eventuality. I 
have not seen articles documenting the need for rescue medication so can only make the generic suggestion that for difficult psychiatric symptoms, one might fi rst consider a short acting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], such as 
lorazepam, and then an antipsychotic medication, such as quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Medical symptoms would be counteracted using appropriate medications, e.g., nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_220311]. As the half-life of psilocybin and its first metabolite are a few hours it is not surprising that the adverse effects of psilocybin typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] 1-3 hours, so it is likely that should rescue medication be needed it would only require short acting drugs; adverse events that continue into the next day are re ported as having been mild (e.g., Hasler et al., 1997) 
while the only reported late appearing (i.e., not presen t acutely following psilocybin dose) adverse event is 
mild-moderate headache lasting < 24 hours.

All types of adverse event will be promptly reported to  Compass for use in the Compass/WCT safety database, 
they do however have different recording and reporting requirements, as set out below. For the purposes of reporting to the safety database, and subject to data protection requirements, we will promptly report to Compass all Serious Adverse Events (“SAEs”) regardless of the causal relationship to the 
Study Drug.  
Assessment of Seriousness 
For the purposes of the reporting of the adverse events to Compass, each adverse event will be assessed for 
its seriousness.  An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria:
•Death
•Life-threatening
•Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
•Persistent or significant disability/incapacity
•Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the study drug.
Other: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardise the Subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are:
•Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
•Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
•Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
For the purposes of the safety database, an adverse event of special interest (“AESI”) is an adverse event 
(serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical c oncern specific to the study drug, for which ongoing 
monitoring by [CONTACT_220335]. Su ch adverse events may require further investigation to 
characterise and understand them. 
Protocol Summary Form             
Rev. 10 – 11/08/2022 31The following events will be reported as AESI:
•Euphoric mood
•Dissociative disorder
•Hallucination
•Psychotic disorder
•Cognitive disorder
•Disturbance in attention
•Mood altered
•Psychomotor skills impaired
•Inappropriate affect
•Overdose
•Intentional product misuse
All AESIs will be followed until resolved or stable.
Reporting Adverse Events Each adverse event will be assessed to determine whether it should be classified as a SAE.  If the adverse 
event is considered serious, we will report this event in  line with requirements of the study sponsor and the 
IRB. This may include completing a sponsor specific SAE reporting form, within [ADDRESS_264687] becoming aware of 
such adverse event. These events will be reported and transferred on our Institution’s own study CRFs. 
All information about adverse events will be collected and once the relevant form is completed, it will be 
scanned and sent by [CONTACT_220336]. The initial report should include the following 
information:

Statistical Anal ysis Plan  
The primary efficacy  measure was BDD symptom severity, as measured by [CONTACT_220340] -
YBOCS , a clinician -rated scale  (total score range:  0-48, with higher scores indicating 
greater severity) . Response to treatment has been  defined and validat ed as > 30% 
decrease in total score, and partial -to-full remission  as total score <16 (Fernandez de la 
Cruz et al. 2019 ).  
 
Statistical Ana lyses:  For YBOCS and other repeated outcome  measures, repeat ed 
measures ANOVA s with Greenhouse -Geiser corrections will be  conducted a cross time 
points  from baseline to week 12  using SPSS  Version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for 
Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp ), with post hoc pairwise Bonferroni -
corrected comparison s. For the HRSD a  paired  samples t-test w ill be performed  to 
compare baseline to week 12 scores .

 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference 
on Harmonization guidelines), applicable governm ent regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures.  
 
Feeding problems requiring medical interven tion occur in 3 -10% of children ( 1). Premature infants are 
overrepresented among  children with feeding problems ( 2). Improved preterm infant survival has 
increased the prevalence of feeding problems in older infants and  toddlers ( 3). In addition, severe feeding 
problems occur in 40 -70% of children with chronic medical conditions ( 4,5). Neonates with long intensive 
care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563680]  (6). Gastrostomy (G -) and gastrojejunal (G -J) tube feeding requirem ents may persist for 
months or years resulting in chronic oral food refusal. As the prevalence of gastrostomy tube feeding has 
increased, so have the challenges associated with managing a child with tube feeding and transitioning a 
child from tube to oral feeding ( 7,8). Previous research on transitioning children from tube to oral feeding 
indicates that most programs are inpatient or intensive day treatment, and ma ny children are not 
successful (8).   
 
Our team developed a novel interdisciplinary outpatient protocol for transitioning children from tube to oral 
feeding  (9,10) called iKanEat. Data indicate iKanEat is effective for transitioning tube fed children to 
eating by [CONTACT_1966]. iKanEat results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in oral 
eating. iKanEat is composed of several key components, incl uding two medications – amitriptyline and 
megestrol . However, our most recent work (HD066629) (11) demonstrated that amitriptyline is  not a 
necessary component of the protocol, as all children who completed the protocol consumed 100% of their 
calories orally at post treatment regardless of receiving amitriptyline or placebo. The current proposal is a 
randomized controlled trial of the s econd medication ( megestrol ) compared to placebo, to ensure that the 
addition of a [ADDRESS_740621] significant side effects, it is critical we determine if the  benefits of megestrol  as 
part of iKanEat outweigh the risks of the medication.  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Gastrostomy Tube Feeding  
 
Gastrostomy (G -) and gastrojejunal  (G-J) feeding tubes are placed in infants and children who refuse to 
eat or are unable to eat enough to sustain normal growth. Common medical causes of inadequate weight 
gain include neurological disease, congenital heart defects, chronic pulmonary diseas e, renal failure, 
genetic disorders, anatomic abnormalities, behavioral disorde rs, and oropharyngeal dysphagia ( 4,19). 
Although usually intended as temporary, short -term solutions to medical complications, feeding tubes can 
become a permanent conduit for enteral nutrition.  
 
Although tube feeding routinely saves the lives of children who are unable or unwilling to eat by [CONTACT_1966], 
chronic tube feeding is a burden to patients, caregivers, and families. First, the decision to have a G -tube 
placed is difficult for caregivers  (20). Once it is placed, caregivers cope with complications including 
vomiting, diarrhea, infection of the G -tube insertion site, granulation tissue, and leakage of gastric 
contents  (21). Stress levels of caregivers often increase after G -tube placement  (22). Because eating is 
such an integral part of culture, there are many mealtime socialization issues that children and parents 
miss when the child is tube fed (20).  In addition, parents report negative issues secondary to G -tube 
feeding such as sleep disruption and deprivation, restricted ability to leave the home, childcare problems, 
negative attitudes of others toward feeding, and difficu lties finding a place to feed (21).  Although some

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_563719] G -tube placement can improve quality of life for parents in the short term  (23), there is 
consensus that delaying the transition from tube to oral feeding has negative medical, emoti onal, and 
economic consequences ( 21,24 ). 
 
Transitioning to Oral Feeding  
 
Existing treatment options for transitioning children with severe feeding problems from tube to oral 
feeding include outpatient, inpatient, and day treatment. The most widely available treatment option for 
severe feeding problems is outpatient treatm ent by a multidisciplinary team ( 25). These teams include 
professionals from multiple specialties, including pediatric gastroenterology, psychology, speech, 
occup ational therapy, and nutrition (4).  Outpatient treatment is typi[INVESTIGATOR_563681], a nd 
can be tailored to meet the needs of the patient and family. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_563682] (i.e., monthly, quarterly) to receive recommendations that are then implemented in the 
home. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_563683] f eeding programs, there is little published evidence on 
outcomes of these programs.  
 
Inpatient programs take place in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], and are justified when: 1) a child’s feeding problems 
are leading to severe weight loss; 2) outpatient treatment has proven unsuccessful; and/or 3) parents are 
willing to participate (increasing the like lihood of generalization to the home setting , (22)) The advantages 
of inpatient treatment include reduced access to food between meals and the ability of the pr ofessionals 
to feed meals daily (22).  These types of inpatient treatment programs are effective at increasing child oral 
intake and decreas ing mealtime behavior problems (23).  Yet, there are many drawbacks to inpatient 
treatment including high cost, large burden on the family, extensive demand on professionals, and 
difficulties with generalization of treatment gains to the home environment (23).   
 
Day treatment programs have become more common in the last decade. They capi[INVESTIGATOR_563684], but have lower costs (due to the lack of overnight 
stays). However, cost is still high, and some experts have expressed concern that treatment gains may 
not gen eralize to the home environment (24 -26).  
 
Therefore, although treatment options do exist for tube fed children, empi[INVESTIGATOR_563685], and there is little evidence that outpatient programs are 
effective.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
 
Oral Suspension: Each mL of lemon -lime flavored oral suspension contains: megestrol acetate 40 mg. 
Inactive  ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, natural and artificial lemon -lime flavor, polyethylene glycol 1 450, 
polysorbate 80, purified water, sodium benzoate, sodium citrate dihydrate, sucrose and xanthan gum. 
Bottles will be stored  at room temperature (15 to 30°C). Protect from temperatures above 30°C ( 41). 
 
The precise mechanism of action by [CONTACT_563720]. Pharmacologic doses of megestrol exerted a direct cytotoxic effect on human breast cancer cells 
in vitro and proved capable of modifying and aboli shing the stimulatory effects of estrogen on breast cancer 
cell lines. Megestrol may have other mechanisms of action as well, including an antiandrogen activity, 
suppression of adrenal androgens, and possibly the inhibition of enzymes, e.g., 5 a -reductase,  critical to 
androgen metabolism within the prostate. The precise mechanism of action by [CONTACT_563721]. The gain in weight associated with 
megestrol is associated with increas ed appetite, an increase in fat and body cell mass ( 41).

 1.3 Review of Literature  
 
Feeding  
 
Our team has published several studies of pediatric feeding difficulties. Our early work examined the 
relationship between feeding diff iculties and medical complexity (27),  and found that by [CONTACT_563722], preterm children more often demonstrated difficulty than full -term children. Also, 
medical factors, primarily the need for breathing assistance, accounted for more of the variance in this 
relations hip than prematurity alone. We have also assessed parent perceptions of mealtime beh aviors in 
children who are tube fed, and learned that parents report surprisingly high levels of stress around the 
mealtime, both for themselves and their children (28).  We have also examined pediatric sensory 
processing issu es related to feeding problems (29)  and found that 67% of children who present for 
treatment have sensory profile scores in the abnormal range. Also, co -occurring diagnoses are frequent 
in the areas of developmental, gastrointestinal, and neurological areas. This foundational work led to th e 
multidisciplinary protocol which we call iKanEat that was designed to move these complicated children to 
oral eating on an outpatient basis.  
 
Clinical Data: iKanEat  
 
In 2008, our team published a retrospective chart review of the first 9 patients to undergo our iKanEat 
tube weaning protocol clinically (30).  At that time, the protocol included two medications (amitriptyline and 
megestrol ) as well as behavioral and oral motor/sensory components. Results from this initial 
retrospective study indicated that the nine initial patients were 100% orally fed at the end of the 
intervention period, and 8 of the 9 were 100% orally fed six months lat er (one patient with cerebral pal sy 
had stamina issues and was only able to sustain 50% of intake orally over the long term). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_563686] a randomized controlled trial of amitriptyline, one of the two medications 
in the protocol (HD066629). The finding s (11) suggest that 100% of children who completed the protocol 
moved from tube feeding to total oral feeding, regardless of group assignment (amitriptyline, placebo). 
More specifically, of the children who completed the 6 month protocol, % kilocalories/da y obtained orally 
(our primary outcome measure) increased statistically significantly from M = 31.51% (SD = 16.09%) to 
100%. Therefore, it does not appear that amitriptyline is a necessary component of the iKanEat protocol.  
 
Parent Stress  
 
During the iKanEat protocol, we expect the child to lose weight during weeks [ADDRESS_740622] recent study (HD066629) also examined the role of pain and quality of life in tube weaning. 
Findings demonstrate improvement in pain symptoms (t = 1.85, p = .006) and in several areas of quality 
of life (i.e., growth and development, t = -2.285, p  < .05; behavior, t = -2.376, p < .05; general health 
perceptions, t = -2.232, p < .05; parental impact: emotional and time, t = -3.718, p < .005) in the transition 
from tube to oral feeding. (11) In the current protocol we will assess whether successful transition to oral 
feeding has an effect on parent and child quality of life.  
 
Remote Interventions.

Version:  [ADDRESS_740623] been e xploring the use of pureed diets to remedy these 
issues (e.g. retching, coughing).    Very few studies have been conducted examining a blended diet, but 
Pentuik et al.47 studied 33 children receiving a pureed diet by [CONTACT_181616]. Results indicate that both gaggin g and 
retching (73% of patients with 50% reduction in symptoms) improved when children were moved from a 
formula diet to a pureed diet. A more recent study demonstrated increased microbial diversity in [ADDRESS_740624], changes in the gut microbiota can be seen as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_4782] 24 hours after dietary changes occur.52, 53   
 
There are no published pediatric studies to date examining the differences in microbiota between children 
who are tube fed versus fed orally.  
 
Summary  
 
Our previous work suggests that iKanEat is effective in moving children from tube to oral eating, and that 
amitriptyline does not improve the outcomes associated with the protocol. However, we do not know if the 
remaining medication ( megestrol ) improves the outcomes associated with iKanEat. As all medications 
have risks, it is necessary to test this remaining medication to determine if the risk is outweighed by [CONTACT_563723].  
 
Rationale  
 
Tube fed children have few treatment options for moving from tube to oral feeding, causing substantial 
economic impact on their families and the health care system, as well as negatively impacting many 
parent and child factors including stress and quality of life. Previous research by [CONTACT_563724] . The 
current study will provide important information about one of the only empi[INVESTIGATOR_563687], and will also provide much needed 
information on parent stress and parent and child quality of life during this transition period.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
The dose of the megestrol  was based upon the preliminary clinical data published.  
iKanEat Protocol   Page 10 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740625] a randomized controlled trial of a 4 -week course of 
megestrol , the only remaining medication that is part of the iKanEat protocol, to ensure that the addition of 
megestrol  results in improved child outcomes. The second aim is to assess the safety of megestrol  as part 
of the iKanEat protocol. Our previous work (as well as work by [CONTACT_2312]) suggests that a 6 week course of 
megestrol  can lead to adrenal  insufficiency in some children ( 11-14), so as part of the current protocol, we 
will assess the safety of a 4 week course of this drug.  
 
Finally, parents of tube fed children encounter multiple psychosocial stre ssors regarding tube feeding ( 15) 
These include concerns about their child’s survival due to their underlying medical issues, feelings of 
“failure” due to their inabi lity to feed their child orally (16),  increased feelings of  stress around the tube 
feeding (17)  and decreased support from  others due to the tube feeding ( 18,19 ). Our research indicates 
that quality of life c an be poor in tube fed children (11),  even more so than children  with cancer or burns. 
Given the significance of these issues, the third aim of the study is to examine the effect of the transition 
from tube to oral feeding on parent stress and parent and child quality of life.  
 
Aim 1:  To assess the efficacy of megestrol  as part of the 24 week iKanEat protocol.  
Hypothesis 1: Children randomized to the megestrol  group will be significantly more successful in making 
the transition to oral feeding (defined as obtaining at least 90% of calories orally) than children randomized 
to the placebo group.  
 
Aim 2:  To assess the safety of 4 weeks of megestrol  as part of the 24 week iKanEat protocol.  
Hypothesis 2A: Children randomized to the megestrol  group will not differ from control children in morning 
cortisol  classification level (low, average, high) and will remain within the normal range at all time points. 
Analyses 2B: Exploratory analysis will determine which, if any, covariates (gender, age, and diagnoses at 
week 0, diagnoses at birth) are related to abno rmal morning cortisol  levels.  
 
Aim 3:  To examine the effect of the transition from tube to oral feeding on parent stress and parent and 
child quality of life. Hypothesis 3A: The transition to oral feeding will temporarily increase parent stress at 
week 14 at the cessation of tube feeding, wit h a return to baseline by [CONTACT_5875] 24. Hypothesis 3B: The transition 
to oral feeding will increase parent/child quality of life at [ADDRESS_740626] dissemination of the 
iKanEat protocol.  
 
Aim 4: To examine the effect of the transition from tube to oral feeding on the gut microbiome. Hypothesis 
4A: The transition to oral feeding will increase the variety of food consumed orally, thus diversifying the gut 
microbiome  by [CONTACT_5875] 24. Hypothesis 4B: Children who are on a blended diet formula at week [ADDRESS_740627] a 
more diverse microbiome than children on commercially prepared formula prior to transitioning to oral 
feeding (Week 0, 10). Little is known about the gut microbiota of children who transition from formula feeding 
to oral feeding. Determining the changes in the gut microbiome could add to general knowledge about how 
the gut microbiome adapts to changes in diet over time in children who transition from commercial or 
blended formulas to a diet consumed orally.

 3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a multi -center, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind clinical trial. The primary focus of the 
study is the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment with megestrol as part of a 24 week behavioral 
feeding protocol  in transitioning from tube to oral feedings in a pediatric population. Approximately 60 
pediatric subjects matching the criteria for eligibility will be enrolled in the study and randomized to re ceive 
either megestrol (n=30 ) or placebo (n=30 ).    
3.[ADDRESS_740628] valid and reliable method of dietary assessment for chi ldren  
(35) The data will be collected using highly standardized probes by [CONTACT_7628], and parents will 
be presented with paper food models and measuring devices prior to interviews to reference during the 
recall. Recalls will be analyzed with the Nutriti onal Data System for Research, version 2016; University of 
Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. Although a plethora of information is available from this analysis, the current 
study will focus on total daily oral calorie intake.  This measure will be compl eted the week following Clinic 
Visits at weeks 0, 10, 14 and 24.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
Parent stress and parent and child quality of life  will be the secondary study endpoint s and be completed 
by [CONTACT_563725] 0, 10, 14, and 24.  
 
1. Parent Stress (The Pediatric Inventory for Parents – PIP36) . Parent stress will be measured via 
the Pediatric Inventory for Parents, a 52 item parent questionnaire developed to measure parent 
stress around caring for a medically complicated child. The measure has a total and four domain 
scale scores (communication , medical care, role function, emotional function). For the purposes 
of the current study, we will use only the total score. The measure has been shown to be a valid 
and reliable measure of pediatric illn ess-related parenting stress (36).  
 
2. Child Health -Related Quality of Life (Infant Toddler Quality of Life – ITQOL 47). Child quality of life 
in children <5 years old will be measured with the Infant Toddler Quality of Life short form 
questionnaire, validated for children 2 months through 5 years of age. The ITQOL has 47 items 
which result in 9 multi -item scales with well -established reliability (Crohbach’s alpha > .70) and 
validit y. Similar to our previous work ( 11), we will use the multi -item scales in our analyses.  
 
3. Child Health -Related Quality of Life (Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form – CHQ -PF50).  
Child quality of life in children ≥ 5 years old will be measured with Child Health Questionnaire 
Parent Form  questionnaire . The parent -reported CHQ is normed for ages 5 -to-18 and measures 
14 unique physical and psychosocial concepts. The CHQ has 50 items and s cores for the parent -
reported versions can be analyzed at the concept level (CHQ Profile Scores ) or combined to 
derive an overall physical and psychosocial score, (CHQ Summary Scores).  
 
4. Parent Quality of Life (SF -36v2).  Parent Quality of Life will be measured with the widely used 
Parent Quality of Life Short Form 36, version 2. Over [ADDRESS_740629] used the SF -36, making 
it a widely accepted measure, and v2 has improved reliabil ity (α = .73 -.90), and validity ( 38). The 
[ADDRESS_740630] 8 scaled scores: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, 
general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role

in a standardized combined score (39).  This standardized combined score will be used in 
analyses, as well as specific subscales that previous research indicates may be sensitive to the 
current intervention (Growth and Development, Behavior, General Health Perceptions, Parental 
Impact: Emotion,  Parental Impact: Time).  
 
5. Impact of Pediatric Chronic H ealth Conditions (PedsQL 2.0, Family Impact Module).  The impact 
of pediatric chronic health conditions on parents and the family will be measured with the PedsQL 
2.0, Family Impact Module (63). This 36 -item survey measures parent self -reported physical, 
emotional, social, and cognitive functioning, communication, and worry. In addi tion, the Module 
assesses parent -reported family daily activities and family relationships.  
 
6. Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) -9 is a 9-item 
measure of depressive symptoms . It is used to provisionally diagnose depression and grade 
severity of symptoms in general medical and mental health settings. Scores each of the 9 DSM 
criteria of MDD as “0” (not at all) to “3” (nearly every day), providing a 0 -27 severity score. This 
measure asks about the parent’s thoughts of suicide or self -injury. Study staff will view the 
responses to this measure within [ADDRESS_740631] the parent to decide if a referral to local support 
centers is necessary.    
 
7. General Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD -7). The GAD -[ADDRESS_740632] common anxiety disorders (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic 
Disorder, Social Phobia and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Higher GAD -[ADDRESS_740633] of Event Scale – Revised (IES -R). The IES -R is a 22 -item self -report measure (for DSM -
IV) that assesses subjective distress caused by [CONTACT_563727]. It is a revised version of the 
older version, the 15 -item IES (Horowitz, Wilner, & Alvarez, 1979). The IES -R contains seven 
additional it ems related to the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD, which were not included in the 
original IES. Items correspond directly to [ADDRESS_740634] seven days by [CONTACT_233963] "difficulty" listed.  
 
9. Demographics.  Families will complete a demographic questionnaire regarding age, race, 
ethnicity, income, free/reduced lunch status, and parental education, along with a medical history 
questionnaire asking about diagnoses at birth and diagnoses at week 0. These variabl es will be 
used to describe our sample and in any covariate analyses  
 
10. Gut microbiota . Stool will be collected at each of the 4 clinic visits (Weeks 0, 10, 14 and 24).   
Once participants are consented, they will be provided with a toilet hat and sterile cup for stool 
collection.  Once collected, stool will be stored in the sterile collectio n cup in the participant’s 
freezer, until it is transferred or shipped on ice to a -80° C freezer at the study site.  Each sample 
will be labeled with less than 8 characters and each label which matches the participant ID and 
will start with a letter (labe ls may not start with a number; per Novogene guidelines). Micro tubes 
will be shipped on dry ice to Novogene, where samples will undergo 16s rDNA sequencing 
utilizing HiSeq PE250. Sequencing will occur in the V4 region with primer 515F and 806R.  Data 
output will be 100,000 raw reads per sample.   
 
11. Clinical care measures.  Height, weight, and vital signs will be obtained at clinic visits 1 -4. These 
measures are routine clinical care, but will the data will be used for research purposes.

 12. Tube Feeding Parent Report . Some participants may receive tube feedings after the protocol 
dictates that they should be fully weaned due to an unsuccessful tube feeding wean or an acute 
illness where the child needs to temporarily resume tube feedings. Caregivers  who are giving  
tube feedings after the weaning phase of the protocol at Week 1 2 will be asked to self -report the 
amount of tube feeding their child is receiving. The survey is four questions and asks parents to 
report the volume of formula given, t he approximate % of total calories from tube feedings, and 
the reason tube feedings were given. The survey will be sent to parents daily while the participant 
is receiving tube feedings. Once the participant is no longer receiving tube feedings, they will not 
be asked to complete the survey.  
 
Post-Intervention Survey and Qualitative Interview.  The study team will conduct an online survey 
and qualitative interviews over the phone with parents of children who have completed the 
intervention. Parents who choose to participate will be verbally consented over the phone. The 
survey ask parents will also be asked to self -report their child’s current height, weight, and tube 
feeding status. The 1 -hour interview will ask parents about their  experience of having a child with 
feeding issues , opi[INVESTIGATOR_563688] , the health coaching , and the tube 
wean transition . Parents will be pai d $20 for completing the online survey, and up to $80 for the 
phone interview. In total, parents may receive up to $[ADDRESS_740635].  De-
identified structured interview audio recordings will be transcribed by a professional transcription 
service.  
 
13. Other considerations.  All children already receiving intensive feeding therapy will be excluded 
(see Participant section). Participants will continue treatment with their multidisciplinary feeding 
teams (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 -10 weeks between visits at our participating sites) and any o ther therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563689] [ADDRESS_740636] -treatment questionnaire at the final 
clinic visit (week 24) and be available for use in analyses as covariates if necessary. Also, once 
the study is completed and all measures are turned in to the study team, participants will be 
unblinded by [CONTACT_202559], informed of their group ( megestrol /placebo) and scheduled for 
follow up care with their multidisciplinary feeding team as appropriate.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_740637] s, patients will be interviewed during clinic visits and tele -visits  for any 
negative gastrointestinal, behavioral, feeding, or other negative sequela suspected to result from our 
treatment. Participants will be asked to measure the child’s weight using a digital home weight scale 
during tele -visits to monitor changes in weight.  
 
Subjects will be considered “at risk” and reviewed by [CONTACT_563728] [INVESTIGATOR_563690]. The medical monitor and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_563691] (or, under what condi tions it may be safe for the participant to continue) given all

1) Morning Cortisol. The blood for the morning cortisol test will be drawn before 8am by [CONTACT_563729]. The test will take 
approximately [ADDRESS_740640] 
and study team’s assessment.  
[ADDRESS_740641] meet all of the following inclusion criteria:  
 
1. Males and females aged [ADDRESS_740642] a G or G/J tube.  
4. Subjects  must receive over 80% of their total daily calorie needs from a tube in order to be 
classified as tube dependent.  
5. Subjects  must have a  ≥ [ADDRESS_740643] permission from the physician on the team to 
ensure that they are medically stable enough to participate in a weaning study . (Please refer to 
Medically Stable Screening Form  to help guide assessment ). 
6. Subjects must possess the oral motor skills necessary for eating according to Table [ADDRESS_740644] possess behavioral skills necessary for mealtime according to Table 2 in the 
Appendix, or be judged by [CONTACT_563730] 10 of the protocol.  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
Study enrollment will exclude potential subjects with any of the following conditions or taking any of the 
following medication:  
 
1. Children  receiving oral steroids . 
2. Parent has a known developmental delay or cognitive impairment that may make participation in 
the study difficult (children with these issues will not be excluded).  
3. Children receiving intensive (defined as more than one session per month) behavioral feeding 
therapy with a licensed psychologist  (previous behavioral feeding therapy is not an exclusion 
criterion; neither is current oral -motor , sensory, or speech therapy).  
4. Children of non -English speaking parents.  
iKanEat Protocol   Page 15 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740645] Recruitment and Screening  
 
Sixty subjects are needed for our analysis plan, so with a maximum of 20% drop out (which exceeds drop 
out from our previous work), a total sample of [ADDRESS_740646] (for 
more information see Sample Size Determination i n Data Analysis Plan section). To allow for study start 
up and completion phases, we will need to recruit approximately 20 subjects per year when in active 
recruitment. Currently, the University of Kansas Medical Center team sees 12 new patients per month,  
Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563692] 12 new patients per month, University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego/Rady 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563692] 8 new patients per month, the New Orleans site sees 8 new patients per month, 
Arnold Palmer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563693] 8 new patient s per month, and Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563694] 12 new patients per month, resulting in a total potential recruitment base of 60 feeding 
subjects per month across our primary sites. Based upon clinic data, 20% of the patients seen will meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (resulting in 12/month or 144/year). Of these, we predict that half will be given 
permission to participate, given the highly medically complex nature of many children with feeding 
problems (resulting in 72/year). Assuming that half  of eligible families participate (36/year), current clinic 
volume at participating sites will result in success fully meeting recruitment goals.  
 
Participants  will be recruited by a pediatric healthcare provider or other members of the feeding team at 
each site. Sites will likely recruit through their multidisciplinary feeding teams, but may recruit from other 
clinics, patient registries, electronic medical rec ords, and inpatient settings as appropriate. Methods of 
recruitment could include: approaching patients during routinely scheduled patient visits, sending letters, 
emails, or calling patients identified through and electronic medical record or other site s pecific patient 
registry, or emailing patients through the electronic medical record platform. Sites may also place 
recruitment flyers , informational videos,  and information on their institution’s local webpage or social 
media pages, affiliated research network pages (such as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_563695]), post ads to social media and local media, and post flye rs in the 
community or to online groups (such as social media or other sites that focus on feeding issues in 
children, parents of tube -fed children, etc.) If parents are interested in participating, they will have access 
to a toll free number to call with questions, or they may request to be contact[CONTACT_563731] a REDCap survey. Our team members are experienced with each of these types of 
recruitment methods and many were used in our previously funded NIH study in feeding.  
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects will be considered “at risk” and reviewed by [CONTACT_563728] [INVESTIGATOR_563690]. The medical monitor and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_563691] (or, under what condi tions it may be safe for the participant to continue) given all 
patient characteristics, including baseline weight for height ratio or BMI percentile.  
1) If more than 0.[ADDRESS_740647] consistently per week over three consecutive weeks  
2) If the subject experiences 10% loss of total body weight  
 
Children who are removed from the study will be treated clinically.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_740648] withdraws  from the study, they will be asked to continue on with their assessments (at least 
height and weight and diet recall, at the very minimum). This will be done so we can have outcome on our 
primary endpoint even for subjects who withdraw . Unless a subject/parent actively refuses, we will try to 
contact [CONTACT_563732], we will attempt to reach them via 
certified letter at their last known address .

 5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 
Megestrol  
 
Megestrol is a steroid and progestational drug FDA approved for treating anorexia or weight loss in 
patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Its use in the current protocol is “off label” to  
stimulate appetite in tube -fed infants and toddlers who are weaning from tube feedings and learning to  
eat. The precise mechanism of action that leads to increased appetite and weight gain is unknown, but is  
probably related to megestrol’s glucocortocoid effect ( 41). Side effects of megestrol include suppression  
of the adrenal glands and new onset diabetes mellitus ( 41). These complications are minimized by  
[CONTACT_563733] 6 weeks ( 41). Other side effects include heart failure, nausea and  
vomiting, edema,dyspnea, hyperglycemia, alopecia, hypertension, carpel tunnel syndrome, mood  
changes, malaise, asthenia, lethargy, sweating and rash ( 41). Megestrol’s safety and effectiveness have 
not been established in children. However, there are  several pediatric trials with megestrol  for anorexia or 
malnutritio n (42-44). In a megestrol  trial for  children with cystic fibrosis, the youngest child treated was 6 
months of age and treated with 10 mg  megestrol /day ( 42). The proposed study will use megestrol 6 
mg/kg/day in two doses because this dose has been effective and safe in two previous studies using 
megestrol to stimulate  appetite in children transitioning from tube to oral feedings. (6,45). Megestrol  will 
be dosed at 6 mg/kg/d at  weeks 10 -11, at 4 mg/kg/d  at week 12, at 2 mg/kg/d at week 13, and fully 
tapered a t the end of week 13.  Megestrol is absorbed from the small bowel, so feeding it through the tube 
will be acceptable (41).  
 
Placebo Group  
 
Subjects randomized to the placebo protocol will receive a placebo syrup identical in taste and  smell to 
megestrol  at the same intervals as those in the megestrol  group but the syrup will contain no  active 
ingredients.  
5.[ADDRESS_740649] 0.1 ml. Megestrol will be dosed at 6 mg/kg/d at weeks 10 -11, at 4 mg/kg/d at week 12, at 2 
mg/kg/d at week 13, and fully tapered at the end of week 13.  
 
Equal doses will be taken twice daily. Subjects will be given instructions on when to take the medication 
and what to do if they miss a dose. If it has been < 6 hours since missing the dose, they should take the 
dose as soon as they remember. If it has been ≥ 6 hours since missing the dose, they should skip the 
dose. Subjects will be asked to document any skipped doses and report those to the study team at their 
next visit.   
 
If a participant is removed from the study while taking the study drug, we will follow the drug tapering plan 
based on what what day they are in the treatment regimen:  
- Day 1 -14     Drug can be stopped at current dose.  
- Day 15 -18   Continue 4 mg/kg for a total of 3 days. Decrease to 2 mg/kg for 3 days and then stop.  
- Day 19 -21   Decrease to 2 mg/kg for 3 days and then stop.  
- Day 22 -23   Continue 2 mg/kg for a total of 3 days and then stop.  
- Day 24 -28   Stop drug.  
Regardless of when the drug is stopped, a morning cortisol lab value will be taken 5 days after the final 
dose of study drug.

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  
 5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Patients will be randomized within each site at a 1:[ADDRESS_740650] Compliance Monitoring  
Subjects will be asked to report missed doses of study medication during their regularly scheduled clinic or 
tele-visits. If a patient is significantly noncompliant with medication (as evidenced by [CONTACT_94893] 7 or more 
days of dosage in a one month period) subjects will be counseled, and withdrawn from the study if unable 
to change.  
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 
All current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563696], except those listed 
in the exclusionary criteria section.  
 
Parents will be educated that megestrol is a steroid, and what to do if their child becomes acutely ill and 
the treating provider prescribes a steroid. So, if the child is prescribed a steroid (oral or inhaled), the parents 
should consult with the treating physician to see if a non -steroidal option is available. If not, and the treating 
physician proceeds with steroids for medical reasons, the parent shou ld contact [CONTACT_563734].  
 
If the prescription is over 7 days, then the iKanEat medical monitor will review the case and decide how to 
proceed with the study drug. Options could include tapering off the study drug temporarily  and to reactivate 
after the prescription is given; or, tapering early if the child is in the final weeks of study drug; or other 
options as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_7195].  
 
If the prescription is 7 days or less, than the study  team will note it in the REDCap Case Report Form and 
report it to the medical monitor, but no action will be taken.  
5.5 Packaging  
The drug will be placed in bottles and will be dispensed directly or from the investigati onal pharmacy . 
5.6 Blinding of Study Drug  
The drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_563735], who will be the only unbl inded part 
of the team. They will receive the random codes prepared by [CONTACT_4305] , and will dispense 
placebo/ megestrol  as appropriate.  
5.6.1  Storage  
The drug will be stored at room temperature in amber bottles.  
5.6.2  Dispensing of Study Drug  
The megestrol /placebo will be dispensed by [CONTACT_25733]’s investigational pharmacy. Site pharmacists may 
round doses to the nearest 0.1 ml if not done previously by [CONTACT_093]. Refer to the pharmacy manual 
for detailed instructions and a dosing table.

6 Study Procedures  
 
iKanEat Intervention  
 
The 24 week iKanEat intervention is composed of 4 clinic visits and a series of approximately 14 (See Table 
3. Procedures Timeline). Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be assessed at every point of contact.  
 
 
Clinic Visits  
 
Clinic visits will occur at each site (see Sites) in their clinical space. Each visit will involve obtaining weight 
and height (in triplicate, in light clothing), vital signs, and then speaking with a healthcare practitioner 
regarding overall health. The c hild will also receive a complete physical exam, similar to a routine pediatric 
visit, including blood pressure and temperature, and will also be assessed for side effects of the iKanEat 
protocol. All participants will complete a blood draw at weeks 10 and  14. Participants taking inhaled or 
intranasal steroids will take an additional blood draw at week 0.  At the initial clinic visit a medical history 
will also be obtained.  
 
Remote Clinical Visits  
In the event clinics  are closed (ie. COVID -19 outbreak)  or when convenient for patients , clinical  visits will 
be conducted remotely via the Zoom teleconferencing app. Any supplies needed (stool collection kits, scale, 
tape measures, iPad with data, etc.) will be mailed to the family in advance. If parents do not have a device 
compatible with the Zoom app, they will be loaned a device with a data plan. P arents will be trained on how 
to obtain height and weight at home. Digital scales and tape measures will b e sent to the families  (or they 
may use their own if they have them) , and each family will measure the height and weight during a video 
call via Zoom app with an i KanEat  team member to ensure measurement accuracy. Other vitals, such as 
blood pressure, pulse, and temperature will not be obtained remotely. Participants will be asked to collect 
a stool sample and store it in their home freezer until the sample can be obtained by [CONTACT_563737][INVESTIGATOR_263205] -off at the local site .  
 
Tele-Visits  
 
Tele-visits will begin by [CONTACT_563738] a summary of all relevant information since the last 
point of contact, including parent perception of changes in weight, feeding habits, progress, stress of 
parent/child, and illness. Children will be assessed for side effects of the iKanEat protocol at every tele -visit 
per parent report. The majority of the time left in the [ADDRESS_740651] indicates may include questions about measures, questions about 
implementation of the iKanEat protocol, and ensuring that children/families adhere to the oral -motor and 
behavioral guidelines for feeding (see Table 1 and 2). Specifically, we will assess for the presence of daily 
mealtimes (at l east 3 -5 times per day), limited grazing between planned meals/snacks, consistent mealtime 
location, appropriate meal length (approx. 20 minutes), and limited distractions during mealtime (refrain 
from use of TV, iPad, toys, etc.). Families will also be en couraged to engage in family mealtime together, 
to prohibit force feeding across all feeders, and to focus on positive parent behavior, positive meal 
demeanor, and appropriate food presentation (as defined in Table 2). Motivational interviewing and 
cogniti ve behavioral parent training techniques will be used to improve parent performance on these skill 
areas. These skills will rely heavily on the detailed training manuals available from The Incredible Years, 
and our therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563697] “Collaborating with Parents to Reduce 
iKanEat Protocol   Page 19

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the guidance of clinical investigation.   Do not disclose o r use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_563739]’s Behavior Problems: A book for Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563698].” The structure 
and content of these tele -visits is based directly on those used in our prior work (HD066629). All visits (clinic 
and tele -visits) will focus directly o n the oral -motor and behavioral skills necessary for oral eating.  
 
Tele technology  
 
Parents will be allowed to choose if they wish to receive their tele -visits over phone (as we did in our 
previous work) or via interactive televideo (such as Skype or Facetime). For patients who choose to do the 
visits over phone, we will provide a toll fr ee number with a fully secure connection. For patients who choose 
to use the tele -visit option, KUMC also has access to the Zoom Mobile Meeting Platform which provides a 
secure videoconference bridge. These point -to-point connections are highly secure, mea ning there is no 
concern about the release of protected health information. The Zoom platform also allows for the connection 
of diverse types of systems, including mobile devices, desktop computers, and established telehealth 
equipment in many clinical set tings (important for eventual dissemination, if appropriate). The Zoom app or 
a similar secure technology will be utilized to connect participants to the researchers for all study 
procedures. No matter whether patients chose to receive their tele -visits ov er phone or interactive televideo, 
they will be using their own existing device, such as a home phone, cell phone, desktop computer or tablet 
device , a study -owned device that is loaned to the participant . Tele-visits will be recorded to ensure 
interventionist adhere to the treatment manual and for patient care purposes.  
 
Interventionists  
 
Interventionists for the clinic visits will be pediatric healthcare providers accompanied by [CONTACT_563740] (see letters of support). These providers are experts in feeding and serve as the physicians 
and/or Medical Directors of the feeding programs at their sites (see letters of support). Interventionists for 
the tele -visits will be behavioral experts at the University of Kansas Medical Center and are trained 
multidisciplinary feeding team members with telehealth experience, including two Ph D level psychologists 
(Davis, Bruce), and a research dietitian who worked with the team as an interventionist on the previous 
study. All behavioral interventionists are trained in motivational interviewing and in cognitive behavioral 
parent training and ar e familiar with The Incredible Years program that will serve as a basis for the 
behavioral parent training program used here.  
 
Fidelity  
 
Treatment fidelity for tele -visits will be measured by [CONTACT_7661] a Graduate Research Assistant code a randomly 
selected sample of 10% of all intervention sessions (via video recording ). They will code for adherence to 
the visit checklist . The recordings will be selected and coded via a random numbers table.  
6.1 Pre-Screening Session ( -14 to -1 day before Week 0)  
 
Participants will be identified through ongoing multidisciplinary feeding teams at the participating sites. 
Pre-screening sessions will occur within a regularly scheduled clinical care visit. The study team will 
evaluate the patient for  eligibility, and families will be  invited to participate and consent forms signed.  
 
If approved, e lectronic consent will occur in person during a regularly scheduled clinic visit. A member of 
the study team will pull up the consent document on tablet and review the form with the participant. The 
participant and study personnel will sign the document by  [CONTACT_563741]. After the consent form is 
submitted, the study personnel will receive  a prompt in REDCap to print a pdf copy of the signed consent 
and give to the participant during the visit. The study personnel will also have the option to email a cop y 
of the consent to the participant directly from REDCap. As this is a multi -site study, the e -consent process 
will be done in accordance with state laws of the participating site.  
 
iKanEat Protocol   Page 20 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740652] the option of doing the e -consent 
over a tele -video call (Zoom). In this case, the REDCap e -Consent template will be modified so that the 
parent can open the parent signature e -Consent  page on their device during the Zoom call. After the 
consent discussion, the parent will sign their REDCap signature [CONTACT_563771]. The study personnel 
will sign the study personnel signature [CONTACT_563772]. The participant will be provid ed with 
a copy of the consent form as well as the signature [CONTACT_563773].  
 
Alternatively, a paper consent can be obtained. The study team will access the latest consent form from 
REDCap, print it, and proceed with the consent discussion with family. Once the consent has been fully 
executed, a copy will be provided to the family a nd uploaded to REDCap.  
 
After consent is obtained, measures will be completed  by [CONTACT_563742] (PIP, ITQOL  or CHQ , 
RAND SF -36, PedsQL). Parents will be asked for 3 days/times when research staff can call them to 
complete the three 24 hour dietary phone recalls (24hr DR). Participants will be given a supplies for the [ADDRESS_740653] the sam ple at home 1 -7 days prior to each clinic visit (Week 0, 
10, 14, 24), store in their home freezer, and return the sample at their study visit. Families will  be 
scheduled for their first study visit in approximately 1 to 14 days.  
6.2 Clinic Visit 1 (Week 0)  
 
Participants will be given a full medical history and exam (including vital signs). Height and weight will 
both be taken in triplicate via calibrated equipment by a trained staff member . Participants taking inhaled 
or internasal steroids will complete a blood draw (morning cortisol). Participants who are not taking 
inhaled or intranasal steroids will not complete a blood draw during the Week 0 visit. If an abnormal 
morning cortisol value is measured, follow the redraw procedures under section 3.4 Primary Safety 
Endpoints. Participants will bring in a frozen stool sample. Subjects will remain on their current G or G/J 
tube feeding regimen as determined by [CONTACT_563743]. If patient is volume sensitive, the 
feeding team may intervene clinically by [CONTACT_563744]. Families 
will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_563745]. Participants who complete the measures at pre -screening and complete Clinic Visit 1 will be 
randomized to an intervention by [CONTACT_4305].  Participants will be asked measure the child’s 
weight using a digital home weight scale . If the family does not have a digital weight scale, one will be 
provided to them.  
6.3 Tele-Visit (Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)  
 
Participants will complete a tele -visit with a member of the study team to discuss parent perception of 
changes in weight, feeding habits, progress, stress of parent/child, and illness . Participants will be asked 
to measure the child’s weight using a digital home weight scale. Families will be encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_563746] t ime throughout the study period.  
6.4 Clinic Visit 2 (Week 10)  
 
Participants will return to clinic to complete vital signs and blood draw ( morning cortisol). If an abnormal 
morning cortisol value is measured, follow the redraw procedures under section 3.[ADDRESS_740654] dose until lab value for morning cortisol are confirmed normal .

occur (as outlined elsewhere), providers will be unblinded to the subject’s group, the subject will be removed 
from the study  and patients will receive all necessary treatment clinically . 
 
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination and Statistical Methods  
For Aim1 (To assess the efficacy of megestrol  as part of the 24 week iKanEat protocol), if at least 90% of 
the treatment group successfully transitions (in pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 100% successfully transitioned), with [ADDRESS_740657] an odds ratio of .18. If only 75% of the treatment group successfully transitions, we will still have 
.[ADDRESS_740658] expected sample size of 60.  
 
For Aim 2 (To assess the safety of megestrol  as part of the 24 week iKanEat protocol), all analyses are 
descriptive, so a power analysis is not conducted.  
 
For Aim 3 (To examine the effect of the transition from tube to oral feeding on parent stress and parent 
and child quality of life), with [ADDRESS_740659] size of d=.[ADDRESS_740660] size of .70. 
To answer those questions in which the groupi[INVESTIGATOR_563699], su ch as 3A (The 
transition to oral feeding will temporarily increase parent stress at week 14 at the cessation of tube 
feeding, with a return to baseline by [CONTACT_5875] 24) and 3B (The transition to oral feeding will increase 
parent/child quality of life at 24 week s compared to week 0), assuming that 60% of the participants across 
groups are successful, we would have sufficient power to detect effects equivalent to a standardized 
effect size of d=.[ADDRESS_740661]  size would increase 
to d=.59. If 70% percent are successful, with [ADDRESS_740662] effects equivalent to d=.61, 
and with 60 participants d=.70. These are moderate sized effects.  
 
 
Planned Analyses  
iKanEat Protocol   Page 23 
Version:  24 March 2025  
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the guidance of clinical investigation.   Do not disclose o r use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_563754] 1, analyses will be conducted using Generalized Linear Mixed Models with a logit link 
within SAS Proc GLIMMIX to model the binary outcome of transitioned to oral feeding (y/n) defined as at 
least 90 percent of calories consumed orally. Fixed  effects (dummy variables) will be entered for each site 
as described by [CONTACT_563755] (2016) to account for the clustering of the participants within 
sites. This will result in essentially, a logistic regression model with appropriate standard err ors. Sex, age 
at initiation, treatment condition, and interactions with treatment condition will enable us to examine the 
effect of group assignment on successful transition to oral feeding by [CONTACT_5875] 24. Interactions between 
treatment group and sex will be e xamined but will not be sufficiently powered to reach definitive 
conclusions about sex differences. In addition to overall effects, subgroup analyses will be reported for 
males and females to examine treatment effects within sex groups.  
 
To address Aim 2, we will determine whether any of our participants in either group have adrenal 
sufficiency levels outside of the normal range at any time point. Should any participant have levels 
outside of the normal range, we will descriptively examine  the individual characteristics associated with 
this, including group assignment, medical diagnoses, sex, and age at initiation. These characteristics will 
be reported descriptively.  
 
To address Aim 3, we will model parent stress levels, child quality of life, and parent quality of life for 
participants in both treatment conditions over the four measurement occasions using General Linear 
Mixed Models. As in Aim 1, fixed effects for site  will be added to the model as will sex and age at 
initiation. Once the shape of the trajectory over time has been modeled, a successful transition to oral 
feeding indicator, defined as consuming 90% or more of calories orally, will be added to the model a t level 
2. For 3A, the primary variable of interest will be the time by [CONTACT_563756]. Estimate statements will examine group differences in stress at week [ADDRESS_740663] time will show more response to intervention than 
others. A significant positive slope for some quality of life indicators are hypothesized for those children 
who transition to oral feeding while stable or declining quality o f life ratings are expected for those who 
are unable to transition to oral feeding. Finally, to complete our analyses of sex as a biological variable 
(SABV) we will assess study outcomes by [CONTACT_547].  
 
To address Aim 4, t he Shannon Index60 will be used to determine microbial diversity.  Data analysis will 
be completed using the paired t -test unless the data is not normally distributed in which case analysis will 
be completed with the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test to compare the index values of patients on each diet.  
 
Heterogeneity of Subjects  
 
Children with enteral feeding requirements are diverse in their presenting medical problems (cardiac, 
developmental delays, post -prematurity, cerebral palsy, etc.). If the subject group in this study was more 
homogenous, it would be easier to determine eff icacy of the protocol. However, because we have opted 
to select a more heterogeneous group, the external validity of this study will be high, making our results 
highly generalizable to other children in clinical need.  
 
Multi -site 
 
The current study is proposed at several sites in order to recruit the number of children who meet the 
specific inclusion/exclusion criteria. Conducting a multi -site study can present hurdles. However, many of 
the investigators have worked together previou sly on feeding studies (HD068221) and publications. To 
iKanEat Protocol   Page 24 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740664] agreed to participate include the University of Kansas Medical Center (Almadhoun, Bruce, 
Davis), Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Edwards, Cocjin), University of [LOCATION_004] San Diego/Rady Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Mousa), New Orleans Children’s Hospit al (Hyman), Arnold Palmer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7722] 
(Mehta), Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (Cohen) , and [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Rosen) . Additional 
sites available for recruitment, if the current sites fall behind in their recruitment goals, include t he sites of 
our Data Safety Monitoring Board Members, and sites that are members of the newly formed National 
Feeding Consortium (of which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_563700]). See letters of support for more 
information. Sites will all have an existin g multidisciplinary feeding team that includes at least a pediatric 
healthcare provider (MD, DO, ARNP) , Psychologist, Dietitian, and Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/Speech 
Patholog ist, as recommended by [CONTACT_106971] (1) . 
 
Coordinating site  
 
The University of Kansas Medical Center will be the lead and coordinating site. Research data will be 
entered by [CONTACT_563757] a REDCap data capture system managed by [CONTACT_563758].  
 
Pharmacy  
 
The investigational pharmacy at Children’s Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563701]. All sites will use the exact formulation, containers, 
and instructions as specified by [CONTACT_563759].  
 
Single IRB Review for a Multi -site study  
 
KUMC will serve as the IRB of record for all sites. Procedures will be identical at all sites. Sites will all 
have an existing multidisciplinary feeding team that includes at least a pediatric healthcare provider (MD, 
DO, ARNP) , Psychologist, Dietitian, and Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]/Speech Pathologist . 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_563702]. The study 
coordinator will be responsible for notifying all sites of amendments to the IRB and dissemination of 
current study documents (please see Multi -Site Communication Plan).  
 
To minimize any differences across sites, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_563703], and the team will meet 
together every year at the NASPGHAN meeting. Also, a weekly mandatory one hour phone conference 
will occur across all sites to discuss protocol imple mentation issues. The study coordinator will send 
communication to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_563704] (POC) at each site of any relevant study communication 
(please see Multi -Site Communication Plan).  
 
Protocol compliance, problems, and adverse events will be discussed in the weekly multi -site conference 
call. Sites will be given written protocols during orientation that define protocol deviations, unanticipated 
problems, and adverse events, and the meth od to report those to the lead site.   
 
Safety  
 
For the treatment arm of the current study we are proposing to use medications off label. Therefore there 
is risk of unexpected negative results. We do not expect any negative outcomes, however, as these 
medications have been used saf ely in previous work ( 12,13 ). To monitor for these negative side effects,

authorized in writing by [CONTACT_563760]  (via the Tele -visits described previously) for 
any negative gastrointestinal, behavioral, feeding, or other negative sequelae suspected to result from the 
medications . (If such patients are subjected to stress such as an infection or surgery, th ey may develop 
adrenal crisis. The patient suddenly becomes cyanotic and cold, blood pressure drops, and without 
immediate resuscitation the patient goes into shock) . If any negative outcomes are identifie d they will be 
reported to our Data Safety and Monitoring Board and proper steps will be taken.  
 
Under certain conditions children may removed from the study and treated clinically. The medical monitor 
and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_563705].  
 
Risk/benefit assessment:  
 
Our previous work suggests that iKanEat is effective in moving children from tube to oral eating, and that 
amitriptyline does not improve the outcomes associated with the protocol. However, we do not know if the 
remaining medication ( megestrol ) improves the outcomes associated with iKanEat. As all medications 
have risks, it is necessary to test this remaining medication to determine if the risk is outweighed by [CONTACT_563723].  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
 
For the current study we will have a Data Safety Monitoring Board that will review all subject safety data 
twice annually. DSMB will review  protocol adherence, adverse events, unanticipated problems, voluntary 
and study team initiated withdrawals, etc. This team is available to the investigators at any time should an 
issue of safety arise, as was the DSMB for their previous study (HD068221). Th is board will be composed 
of [CONTACT_563774], Professor of Pediatrics and [CONTACT_563775] S. Huang, Professor, Rady  Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563706]. Twice annual conference calls will be held between the DSMB members and the 
investigation team to assure the best outcome for all subjects. Any serious adverse events will be 
reported immediately to the relevant institutional  IRBs and to the DSMB.   
 
Population(s) for Analysis . Our primary analysis will focus on a protocol -compliant population, but we will 
secondarily also analyses the all -treated population, as described below.  
• All-randomized population :  Any subject randomized into the study, regardless of whether they 
received study drug  
• All-treated population :  Any subject randomized into the study that received at least one dose of 
study drug  
• Protocol -compliant population :  Any subject who was randomized and received the protocol required 
study drug exposure and required protocol processing  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
For the current study, we will use CTCAE criteria, incorporating the additional considerations about pediatric 
effects and regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related documents such as 
the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc .) 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
iKanEat Protocol   Page 26

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the guidance of clinical investigation.   Do not disclose o r use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530]  
 • Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_740665] administration of study treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse 
event must also be recorded and docum ented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be relate d to participation in this study.  The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
iKanEat Protocol   Page 27 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740666] that has participated in this study.  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following  
conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, 
etc. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_563707], we will use CTCAE criteria, incorporating the additional considerations about pediatric 
effects and regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_118276] a serious adverse event unless specifically 
instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be document ed as an 
adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
 
Expected and Unexpected event criteria  
Side effects of megestrol affect up to 5% of adults and older children. Those expected side effects include:  
 
• Diarrhea  
• Rash  
• Gas 
• High blood pressure  
• Weakness  
• Trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
• Nausea  
• Low levels of oxygen in the blood causing pall skin color and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]  
• Adrenal insufficiency (pale skin color, cold to the touch, weight loss, thirsty, dizzy or disoriented)  
• Fever  
• Stomach  pain and discomfort  
• Heartburn  
• High levels of sugar in the blood, which can cause tiredness, blurry vision, increased thirst and 
hunger, and passing urine often.  
• Headache  
• Pain 
• Vomiting  
• Pneumonia  
• Urinary Frequency

unexpected and would be also reported to the IRB. If an expected event is happening at a higher rate than 
anticipated (>5% of patients), the IRB must also be notified.  
 
If medical or psychosocial concerns occur during week [ADDRESS_740667]’s feeding routine, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_563708]. The subject will resume the protocol if the feeding interruption is 
short -term (2 weeks to 6 months). For long -term feeding interruptions (>6 months), the subject may start 
the protocol over at week 0.  
8.[ADDRESS_740668] seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in th e appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should 
recorded in the source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or 
participation is not the cause.  Serio us adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period 
must be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or stu dy participation should be 
recorded and reported immediately.

be reported are those that are:  
• related to study participation,  
• unexpected, and  
• serious or involve risks to subjects or others  
(see definitions, section 8.1).   
If the report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the 
initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study Center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study treatment was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association 
between the event and study treatment  
8.3.1  Investigator reporting: notifying the investigator sponsor  
 
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and any type of serious 
adverse event, must be reported to Ann Davis  by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event.  To report such 
events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form must be completed by [CONTACT_563762] 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.  Report 
serious adverse events by [CONTACT_36982]: Ann Davis, PhD, MPH, ABPP (email, 
[EMAIL_10752] , Fax 913 -588-2253, Phone 913 -588-5928 or 24 hours 913 -588-5000).  
 
Within [ADDRESS_740670] provide further information on the serious adverse event 
or the unanticipated problem in the form of a written narrative.  This should include a copy of the completed 
iKanEat Protocol   Page 29 
Version:  [ADDRESS_740671] the understanding of the 
event.  Significant new information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the 
study sponsor . 
8.3.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the IRB  
Investigators are responsible for safety reporting to their local IRB.  Investigators are responsible for 
complying with their local IRB’s reporting requirements, though must submit the required repor ts to their 
IRB no later than 5  working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_563709]’s study file.  
 
Other Reportable events:  
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the IRB:  
• Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
• Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, protocol or 
informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_65804].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to treatment than 
initially expected.  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C and 
the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved protocol) 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_116576], or affects 
the rights or welfare of subjects.  
 
The following describes the safety reporting requirements by [CONTACT_563763]:  
 
• Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
• Within 15 calendar days

criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was deemed 
reportable).  
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, 
or carcinogenicity.  
8.3.3  Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators  
 
It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to notify a ll participating investigators of any adverse event 
associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected, as well as any finding from tests 
in laboratory animals that suggest a signifi cant risk for human subjects.  
8.[ADDRESS_740672] a grade 3 event  related to the study , we will stop or modify the study; if 
[ADDRESS_740673] has a grade 4 event  related to the study , we will stop the study. After a stop the study will only re -
start after a thorough review and uniform agreement by t he investigators and the DSMB.  
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Site Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as 
well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 9 
Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  The medical monitor will  review all reported adverse events and 
regularly assess  the number and type of serious adverse events.

9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these or iginal documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_403904], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank 
because the procedure was not done or the q uestion was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable 
to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has 
been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through th e incorrect entry and enter the 
correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT 
ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial 
and date it.  
9.4 Records Retention  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_740677].  These documents should be retained for a longer period 
if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the resp onsibility of the sponsor to 
inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
9.[ADDRESS_740678] access to their own site’s data. The lead PI [INVESTIGATOR_563711]. Sites will not have access t o other site’s identified data. 
Deidentified aggregate data may be shared for safety monitoring during site conference calls and to the 
DSMB. Children’s Mercy’s Investig ational Pharmacy will have access to iden tified data from each site for 
drug randomization.  
 
Data will be shared from the sites to the coordinating site via REDCap or secure file transfer. Data will be 
saved onto secured shared drives at KUMC and on shared drives at the site’s home institutions. KUMC 
will retain the data for [ADDRESS_740679] access to the linking log for their site only. 
Identified data will be located in REDCap. Once data is abstracted from REDCap, it will be saved on the 
KUMC shared drives where identifiers will be removed and placed into a linking log. Identifiable data will 
be sent from the site to KUMC using secure file transfer.

This material is strictly confidential and is intended solely for the guidance of clinical investigation.   Do not disclose o r use except as 
authorized in writing by [CONTACT_563764]. Consent will be obtained 
electronically via REDCap. REDCap may be brought up on a mobile device for participants to complete, 
however, no data will be stored directly  on the mobile device.   
 
9.6 Specimen collection  
 
Blood s amples will be collected during the clinic visit and sent to the lab for processing.  Stool samples will 
be split in half, with part of the sample being sent to Novogene for processing. The other half of the 
sample will be retained at the site until processing at Novogene is complete.  After processing, the 
specimen s will be destroyed, and nothing will be retained.  
9.7 Quality Assurance and Monitoring  
 
Data will be collected using REDCap, which allows us to make responses required to ensure complete 
data. Study coordinators will verify the data during the clinic visit to ensure data collection was accurate 
and complete.   
10 Ethical Considerations

13.1 Table 1: Oral -Motor Skills Required Prior to Starting Protocol  
SKILL  Assessment 
Method  Description  Supports Oral Skill  
Age- appropriate 
strength and 
coordination of 
the oral cavity  Observation  
 
Manipulation  
 
Swallow study  
(if necessary)  Adequate range of 
motion, strength 
and coordinated 
movement of the 
lips, tongue, jaw; if 
safety of swallow is 
in question, a study 
will be done to 
assess  
 The manipulation of food, 
either liquid or solid that is 
appropriate for the child’s 
developmental age or 
would support adequate 
nutrition  and hydration.  
Head/Neck/  
Trunk Support  Observation  
 
Manual Testing  
if necessary  Strength and 
control of the head, 
neck, and trunk to 
provide midline 
stability of the body  Control of the head, neck 
and trunk support erect 
posture and alignment so 
that the mouth is able to 
manage and manipulate 
food and there is support 
surrounding the swallow.  
 
Sensory 
Processing  Observation,  
 
Short Sensory Profile  
(McIntosh et al., 
1999)  
 
Interview with family 
and other care givers  No overt sensory 
processing issues 
that interfere with 
daily life activities, 
specifically 
eating/feeding  The ability to organize 
sensory input supports the 
mouth’s ability to control 
and manipulate food 
without reaction to texture, 
temperature, etc. This in 
turn supports a safe 
swallow. Difficulties with 
sensory processing may set 
up food aversions that may 
or ma y not be directly 
related to oral skills.  
 
13.2 Table 2: Behavioral Skills Necessary Prior to Week [ADDRESS_740692] in the same location.  
Meal Length  Meal length falls between 10 -20 minutes.  
Meal Distractions  There are few distractions during mealtime (ex. TV), that occur 
on a routine basis. A child who requires distraction in order to 
take bites is not eligible.  
Family Mealtime  The child and family eat meals together on a regular basis.

command such as “It’s time to eat” or “You may get down now.”   
Parent Behavior During 
Meals  Parent behavior during meals is appropriate with limited 
coaxing, never any forcing of food, and no yelling or threatening.  
Force Feeding  There is never any forcing of food or other objects into the child’s 
mouth.  
Meal Demeanor  Child is neutral or positive in response to mealtime (voluntarily 
places food in mouth (or allows adult to do so) without crying, 
turning head away from spoon.  
Good Food 
Presentation  Appropriate amount/variety of foods are presented in a calm, 
relaxed manner; feeders announce each bite.

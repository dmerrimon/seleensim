1.0  Introduction
1.1  Locally Advanced NSCLC and Radiation Therapy
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the [LOCATION_002] each year with an
estimated 215,000 new cases and over 160,000 deaths, [1].  The majority of these, approximately
80%, are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  Only 15-20% of these cases present with early or
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Page | [ADDRESS_751871] are more advanced, with large tumors, regionally involved lymph
nodes, or distant metastatic disease [2].
Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for stage I and II NSCLC, often followed by [CONTACT_572772].  For stage III NSCLC, selected cases can be treated surgically, while for many
patients, combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy is the best curative option.  If a NSCLC
patient has co-morbid conditions or poor performance status, the treatment options are more limited.
Surgery may not be possible for curative treatment of early stage disease, and concurrent
chemoradiation may not be tolerable as treatment of more advanced disease.  Conventionally
fractionated radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment for locally advanced NSCLC has poor
survival rates, with a median survival of only [ADDRESS_751872] dose[3].  Since then, there have been many efforts to increase the efficacy of radiation
therapy for locally advanced lung cancer.  Clinical trials have suggested a benefit from dose
escalation.  For example, A University of Michigan phase I study that included mainly stage III
NSCLC, showed a 5 year overall survival improvement from 4% to 28% when dose was increased
from 63-69 Gy to 92-103 Gy [4].  Also, a median survival of 24.7 months was achieved in 112
patients treated on four University of North Carolina phase I/II trials of high dose (60-90 Gy)
radiation therapy in unresectable stage III NSCLC [5].  However, local failure remains a significant
problem even with high dose radiation therapy, with local failure rates of 22-50% in multiple studies
[5, 6].
The best method found to date for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy for locally advanced
NSCLC is to combine it with chemotherapy.  One of the early phase III trials showing a benefit to
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_572773] 8433 trial, which showed a median
survival increase from 9.6 to 13.7 months with the addition of chemotherapy [7].  Since then,
multiple trials of locally advanced NSCLC in good performance status patients have shown even
better outcomes with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, rather than sequential [8-12].
A recent randomized phase III trial even achieved a median survival time of 21.7 months in
inoperable stage III NSCLC [13].
However, the better local control and survival achievable by [CONTACT_572774].  Some of the most commonly used
chemotherapy combinations in locally advanced NSCLC are cisplatin/etoposide and
carboplatin/paclitaxel.  All of these agents are associated with myelosuppression, nausea, and
vomiting and several are associated with neuropathy and nephrotoxicity.  When given with radiation
therapy, these toxic effects can be worsened and the adverse effects commonly seen with radiation
therapy to the chest, such as esophagitis, can be intensified.  The CALGB 8433 trial reported higher
rates of serious adverse effects including neutropenic infections, vomiting, and severe weight loss in
the group of patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy [14].  Toxicity with concurrent
chemoradiation therapy can be even greater than with sequential.  RTOG 94-10 reported higher
rates of acute grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity, including esophagitis, with concurrent compared
to sequential chemoradiation therapy [9].  In a phase III trial by [CONTACT_572775], patients
receiving carboplatin with radiation therapy suffered more neutropenia, thrombopenia, and anemia
than did patients receiving radiation therapy alone [15].  These adverse effects can decrease quality
of life for patients and cause administration of combined modality therapy to be impractical in poor
performance status patients.
Progress in technology has changed the delivery of radiation therapy to allow more precise targeting
of tumor and avoidance of normal structures.  3D conformal radiotherapy (3-DCRT) and intensity
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), based on computed tomography (CT) planning are possible
due to modern computer and software advances.  These treatment techniques have allowed
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 10
reduction of treatment volumes and dose escalation of fractionated radiotherapy.  RTOG 9311
showed the feasibility of delivering up to 83.8 Gy at 2.15 Gy per fraction for stage I-III NSCLC [6].
Recently, there has been increasing use of image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), which involves
frequent imaging to account for interfraction and sometimes intrafraction motion of the target and
thus improves the accuracy of dose delivery.  IGRT involves modalities such as daily ultrasound,
kilvoltage (kV) imaging such as x-rays or kV cone beam CT, or megavoltage (MV) imaging such as
helical MV CT or MV cone beam CT.  Adaptive radiotherapy is the concept of using frequent
imaging to alter treatment based on changes in the tumor or normal tissue during the course of
treatment.  This can be important in treatment of NSCLC since tumors can shrink considerably
during treatment, allowing greater avoidance of normal structures when the treatment plan is
modified.  Kupelian et.al. reported an average decrease in the tumor volume of 1.2% per day in a
study of 10 NSCLC patients [16].   Imaging can also be used to account for organ motion with
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], which is crucial in treatment of lung tumors.  One method to manage respi[INVESTIGATOR_572725], using techniques such as abdominal compression or breath holding.
The other method to account for respi[INVESTIGATOR_572726]-based motion compensation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344].
All of these advances in treatment planning and delivery have allowed the development of
stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a promising treatment for early stage NSCLC.  This
treatment method combines the previously mentioned techniques with stereotactic targeting to allow
a dramatic reduction in treatment volumes, enabling delivery of hypofractionated, ablative doses of
radiation therapy.  SBRT can be safely used in patients with co-morbid conditions or poor
performance status and can achieve local control rates as high as 95% at 2 years [17].  The
technological advances making possible SBRT in early stage NSCLC could be transferred to
treatment of locally advanced NSCLC as well, to allow a shorter overall treatment time without
increasing toxicity.  Notably, the reported dose escalation trials for locally advanced NSCLC utilize
3-D conformal radiation therapy but do not include daily image guidance or methods for
compensating for tumor motion with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  With these technological advances, it should be
possible to further limit dose to normal tissue and thus treat lung tumors to a higher dose in fewer
fractions of radiation therapy.  This protocol will address the management of stage II-III NSCLC who
are not candidates for surgical resection or stereotactic body radiation therapy as definitive
treatment.
The study is designed to determine whether an accelerated course of hypofractionated radiation
therapy with daily image guidance and motion assessment/control will allow more effective
treatment of poor performance status patients with stage II-III NSCLC, who would benefit from local
therapy compared to standard radiation therapy (60 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction).  Poor performance
status patients can be a heterogeneous group, with tumor-related factors, other co-morbidities, or
advanced age placing patients in the category.  These patients have traditionally been
underrepresented in clinical trials, and thus no prospective study has evaluated the efficacy of other
radiotherapy dose fractionations -
NSCLC (RTOG 93-04) included just over 40% Karnofsky performance status 60-70 patients and
showed median survival times of 9.5 and 10.3 months with 60 Gy of conventional radiation therapy
-interferon [18].  [ADDRESS_751873] 44% in these patients.
1.2  Rationale for Radiation Therapy Dose
A dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions (3 Gy per fraction) has been commonly employed in the past to treat
poor performance status NSCLC patients.  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_572727]/paclitaxel for stage III NSCLC was closed after enrollment of only 5 patients
due to excessive toxicity.  The radiation therapy dose used was 60 Gy in 4 weeks of daily treatment,
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751874] [19].  Our protocol is different in that it will not permit concurrent
chemotherapy, it will not allow treatment of elective nodal regions as was done in that trial, and it will
use daily image guidance so that treatment volumes will be significantly smaller.  In a small study of
14 patients, Tsoutsou et.al. showed the feasibility of treating with 3.5 Gy daily for 15 fractions (52.5
Gy total) with a one week break after the 10th fraction, along with concurrent chemotherapy, in
locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer PS 0-2 patients [20].  Slotman et.al. treated 301 stage
III NSCLC patients with three different hypofractionated radiation therapy regimens of 40 Gy in 8-10
fractions with a one week break, 30-32 Gy in 6 fractions or 24 Gy in 3 fractions.  These regimens
were all well tolerated [21].
Standard radiation to the chest for unresectable stage III NSCLC is 60-66 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction.
Radiobiologic calculations indicate that the accelerated therapy regimen of 3 Gy/fraction to 45 Gy is
similar to 2 Gy per fraction to 60 Gy, with regrowth delay time (time to progression) of 92% and late
complication biologically effective dose (BED) of 90% of that calculated for standard radiation.
Additionally, [ADDRESS_751875] similar clinical outcomes and toxicity.
This has been shown in a retrospective review at MD Anderson of 2 cohorts of node positive patients
with inoperable LA-NSCLC treated with radiation alone [22].  One cohort (26 patients) had borderline
prognostic factors (KPS < 70 but > 50 and/or weight loss of more than 5%) and was treated to 45 Gy
over 3 weeks at 3 Gy/fraction. The second cohort (29 patients) had significantly better prognostic
factors and was treated to 60-66 Gy over 6 to 6.5 weeks at 2 Gy per fraction during the same period.
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_572728], the cohort treated to 45 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction over 3 weeks
had response rates, locoregional control, and overall survival comparable to those in the cohort
treated to a total dose of 60-66 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction over 6 weeks without difference in acute or
late toxicity.  Radiation dose intensification in locally advanced NSCLC has been studied in
prospective trials. Slotman et.al. treated 301 stage III NSCLC patients with three different
hypofractionated radiation therapy regimens of 40 Gy in 8-10 fractions with a one week break, 30-32
Gy in 6 fractions or 24 Gy in 3 fractions.  These regimens were all well tolerated.[23]  A group from
Poland found similar toxicity profiles in patients treated with 21 fractions of radiation using 2.7, 2.8
and 2.9 Gy fractions. Of those patients, 7% had grade III acute esophageal toxicity and 6% had grade
III or greater late pulmonary toxicity [24]. An Italian group reported a 30 patient trial wherein 60 Gy in
20 fractions was given to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Grade 3 hematological toxicity
occurred in 1 patient, grade 3 esophagitis in 1 patient and grade 3 pneumonitis in 2 patients [25].
Subsequently , the MD Anderson group reported a phase I trial evaluating 45, 52.5 and 60 Gy
delivered in 15 fractions using proton beam and found similar, acceptable levels of toxicity in all
arms[26].  Collectively, this information support both our trial concept and the dose intensity utilized.
Specifically, the experimental arm dose for this trial is based on a dose escalation trial at University
of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern evaluating the maximum tolerated dose of hypofractionated IGRT in this
patient population.  Doses were escalated from 3 Gy per fraction (total dose 45 Gy) to 4.0 Gy per
fraction (total dose 60 Gy) and evaluation for treatment related toxicity was being performed.
Critical structure dose constraints will be expressed as organ dose-volume limits, with limits
formulated with the approval of the study investigators using known tolerance data, radiobiological
conversion models, and norms used in current practice at academic centers [27]. The trial design
called for treating many patients per dose level, akin to a phase II trial, so as to collect outcome data
on enough patients to simultaneously appreciate toxicity and efficacy in order to optimize dosing.
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was never reached on this protocol up to 60 Gy in 15 fractions
for effectively the same population treated on this protocol.  50 Gy, 55 Gy or 60 Gy in 15 fractions
was delivered using image guided radiation therapy. Patents with tumor volumes larger than 500 cc
were excluded.  18, 23 and 21 individuals were enrolled at each dose level respectively. The median
follow-up is 195 days (range 26-927 days).  Median follow-up is 452 days if patient deaths are
censored in a population that succumbs commonly to non-cancer or treatment related causes.  Of
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751876] chosen the 60 arm to be
the experimental arm of this protocol.
1.3 Comparative Economic Analysis
In the [LOCATION_002], total national health expenditures (NHE) increased from $7.14 billion in 1990 to
$2.23 trillion in 2007, which represents an average annual growth rate of 7.0%.  In contrast, over the
same period, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) increased from $5.8 trillion in 1990 to $13.8 billion,
or average 5.2% annual growth rate.  Given that national health expenditures have grown faster
than GDP, the share of GDP devoted to health expenditures has increased from 12.3% in 1990 to
16.2% in 2007[28].  Moreover, national health expenditure growth is expected to continue to
outpace income growth, with total NHE reaching $4.35 trillion by 2018, accounting for 20.3% of GDP
(CMS 2009).  There is growing concern that these trends in health expenditures are not sustainable.
For the Medicare program, current estimates of the present value of total unfunded liabilities through
the year 2083 (the present value of the difference between projected future Medicare expenditures
and Medicare revenues over the next 75 years under current Medicare policy) total $89 trillion, with
[29].
Prior studies have estimated that about half of the recent growth in health expenditures is
attributable to advances in various forms of health technology, including new pharmaceutical
products, surgical procedures, imaging modalities, and new biomarkers[29].  While almost all of
these new technologies offer some potential to improve clinical outcomes, they also more often than
not add to health expenditures.  Within the context of unsustainable trends in health expenditures, a
key policy question relates to whether the extent of improvement in outcomes associated with the
technology.  Indeed, the value offered by [CONTACT_572776].  For example, in the United
Kingdom, the National Health Service bases payment policy decisions for new technologies on
recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which in turn
are substantially influenced by [CONTACT_225437]-
quality-adjusted life-
considers technologies offering improved outcomes at a cost less than £20,000 to £30,000 per
QALY gained (about $33,000 - $50,000) acceptable, though exceptions are common[30].
Therefore, we propose to collect cost information in both arms in this Phase III trial, and assess
new technology proposed in this study and its impact on quality of life.  We hypothesize that the new
treatment course, making it very attractive for adoption in treatment for lung cancer patients.
Alternatively, we hypothesize that the new technology will increase quality-adjusted life-years for
lung cancer patients (compared to the current standard of care) at a reasonable incremental cost, as
defined by [CONTACT_572777]-effectiveness thresholds.
1.[ADDRESS_751877].  Adjuvant chemotherapy, either prior to
radiotherapy or afterwards, has been allowed since opening in either of the randomized arms.
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751878] amended the protocol to allow concurrent chemotherapy
with radiotherapy using the popular and less toxic Carboplating/paclitaxel regimen in standard
concurrent dosing specifically in the standard arm only (30 fractions).  Our hypothesis testing
regarding the higher potency of hypofractionated radiation in the experimental arm (15 fractions)
would be disrupted if concurrent, radiosensitizing chemotherapy were given; hence, concurrent
chemotherapy will not be allowed on the experimental arm in any circumstance.  Survival estimates
related to the power and sample size determination of the study in all likelihood will not be affected
given that concurrent therapy has never been shown to be superior to radiation alone in poor
performing patients.  Nonetheless, we will perform a statistical sensitivity analysis at the time of the
interim analysis (50% patient enrollment) to determine is a change in the assumption and sample
size determination need adjustment.

within 3 weeks of completion of simulation.
6.1.1 Image-guidance, adaptive radiation therapy, and motion control
Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a process of using various imaging technologies to
locate a tumor target prior to each treatment with radiation therapy. The purpose of this
process is to improve the treatment accuracy and eliminate the need for large target margins
which have traditionally been used to compensate for errors in localization.  As a result, the
amount of healthy tissue exposed to radiation can be reduced, minimizing the incidence of
side effects.  An example of three-dimensional (3D) IGRT is localization of a cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) dataset with the planning computed tomography (CT) dataset
from planning.  Example of two-dimensional (2D) IGRT includes matching planar kilovoltage
(kV) radiographs or fluoroscopy with digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the
planning CT.  Isocenter or reference point port localization films should be obtained at each
treatment on the treatment unit (or patients should undergo a tomographic imaging study
using the linear accelerator couch, if available) immediately before treatment to ensure
proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., isocenter) of the simulated fields.
Adaptive Radiation Therapy: With daily imaging, the change in tumor size during the course
of treatment can be easily monitored.  At physician discretion, the treatment plan can be
modified if enough response is attained to meaningfully reduce dose to normal tissue.    If
daily imaging is not feasible at a given center, axial reimaging (CT, etc) should be performed
immediately before or after day 10 of treatment to assess whether adaptation is warranted.
Tumor Motion Control: Special considerations must be made to account for the effect of
internal organ motion (e.g., breathing) on target positioning and reproducibility. Acceptable
maneuvers include reliable abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], tumor tracking, and active breath-holding techniques such that the
unaccounted tumor motion during treatment is less than [ADDRESS_751891] be validated and accredited by [CONTACT_49005]
(Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Chairs) before enrolling or treating patients on this trial.
Internal organ inhibition maneuvers must be reliable enough to insure that the GTV does not
deviate beyond the confines of the PTV as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant
probability (i.e., < 5%).

6.1.2 Dose Fractionation for Arm A
Patients on Arm A will receive 15 fractions of radiation.  Patients will receive 4.0 Gy per
fraction for 15 fractions (total dose = 60 Gy).  All fields must be treated daily.  Plan
adaptation for treatment response is allowed and encouraged. (see Section 6.1.1)
6.1.3  Normalization and Prescribing Dose for Arm A
Normalization of the treatment plan will be to the center of mass of the conjugate PTV.  The
prescription dose will cover 95% of the PTV (dose covering 95% of the PTV, D-95). In
addition, 90% of the prescription dose should cover 99% of the PTV (D99). All radiation
doses will be calculated with tissue density (heterogeneity) corrections that take into account
the density differences within the irradiated volume (i.e., air in the lung and bone).  The
following heterogeneity correction algorithms are not allowed because of known deficiencies:
6.1.[ADDRESS_751892] (> 1
cm short axis diameter) or pretreatment PET scan (SUV > 3) will constitute the Gross Tumor
Volume (GTV).  The GTV, strictly defined, does not include motion and hence is identified on
a specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_572730] a 4-D
CT). This volume(s) may be disjointed. In the event of a collapsed lobe or lung segment, the
use of PET to distinguish tumor from fluid/atelectasis is encouraged. The GTV should be
expanded into a Clinical Target Volume (CTV) to account for microscopic infiltration by
[CONTACT_1583] a minimum of 5 mm and a maximum of 10 mm in any direction (at the discretion of
the treating physician) with careful attention to trim expansions into normal structures and
bone. Elective treatment of nodal areas is not allowed.
  Definition of the ITV:
The ITV includes the envelope that encompasses the tumor motion for a complete
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126].  The motion quantified from the 4-D scan or real time fluoroscopy will be
added to the CTV to constitute the ITV.  If the motion is greater than 10-15 mm in any
direction, special maneuvers such as abdominal compression, gating, chasing or regimented
breath hold should be used to reduce the final motion below 10mm.  Thus, expansions will
range from 0-10 mm.  If it is observed that the tumor has no motion, then the ITV would be
identical to the CTV.
Definition of the PTV
The PTV is defined as the ITV with additional margin for setup uncertainties. Daily imaging is
used to reposition the patient to minimize setup errors (see Section 6.1.1).  The ITV will be
expanded by 5 mm in all directions to create the PTV.
6.1.5 Critical Structures and Constraints for Arm A

the entire PTV treated daily.
6.2.3  Normalization and Prescribing Dose for Arm B
Normalization of the treatment plan will be to the center of mass of the conjugate PTV.  The
prescription dose will cover 95% of the PTV (dose covering 95% of the PTV, D-95). In

Note:  The following definitions are written for Arm B with the assumption that image
guidance, adaptive replanning, and motion assessment and control are not utilized as per
standard lung radiotherapy practice.  However, at the discretion of the treating physician,
such methods may be utilized on Arm B as absolutely required for patients randomized for
Arm A.  If these technologies and techniques are utilized, the Target Volumes should be as
described in Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_751895] (> 1

  Definition of the ITV:
The ITV includes the envelope that encompasses the tumor motion for a complete
respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126].  A minimum of 1 cm in the axial direction and 2 cm in the superior-inferior
direction will be added to the CTV to define the ITV. If the motion quantified from the 4-
D scan or real time fluoroscopy is greater, additional margin should be added
accordingly .
Definition of the PTV
   The PTV is defined as the ITV with additional margin for setup uncertainties and may be
individualized but should not be less than 0.5 cm or greater than 1.0 added to the ITV to
create the PTV.

not deviate beyond the confines of the Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) as defined in
Section 6.4 with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).
6.4.[ADDRESS_751898] study will be required to define gross tumor volume
(GTV), clinical target volume (CTV), internal target volume (ITV), and planning target volume
(PTV) (see definitions for both arms). Each patient will be positioned in an immobilization
device in the treatment position on a flat table.  Contiguous CT slices, having [ADDRESS_751899] slices.
6.4.3   Intravenous (i.v.) contrast during the planning CT is strongly encouraged but optional
provided a diagnostic chest CT was done with contrast to delineate the major blood vessels.
If not, i.v. contrast should be given during the planning CT if the patient can tolerate it.
6.4.4   A treatment planning FDG PET/CT scan (or FDG-PET alone) with the patient in the
treatment position is encouraged for treatment planning. In the case where the PET/CT is
obtained in the treatment position, the CT from this study may be used as the planning CT
scan.
6.4.5  Tumors very near or abutting serially functioning normal structures (e.g., esophagus, great
vessels) make it difficult to meet normal tissue constraints while giving compliant target dose
coverage.  PTV expansions may cross into adjacent normal tissues confounding the ability to
respect the constraint.  Priorities for planning are listed in section 6.7.  These priorities must
be respected.  In cases where a higher priority takes precedence over a normal tissue
constraint, attempts should non-the-less be made to spare as much high and intermediate
dose to the normal tissue as possible.  Specifically, since the prescription dose of 60 Gy in
each arms is only required to cover 95% of the target volume, the 5% not fully covered by
[CONTACT_572780] a
critical normal structure or in the portion of a PTV/normal tissue overlap.  While 90% of the
prescription dose (i.e., 54Gy) must still cover the target, this allows the planner to at least
lower the maximum dose to the adjacent structure to around [ADDRESS_751900] serial
tissues is depi[INVESTIGATOR_572731] (note:  respecting the spi[INVESTIGATOR_572732]).
For the purposes of the esophagus, two approaches may be utilized to reduce the risk of
acute toxicity to this linear structure.  Even independent of the following options, we
recommend that when planning to cover disease near the esophagus, an attempt should be
made to prevent significant dose (i.e. prescription) to the entire circumference of the
organ.  The approaches to achieve this and in general limit toxicity include: 1) To remove the
PTV out of the esophageal OAR structure and 2) To accept a lower PTV coverage of disease
near the esophagus as a means of avoiding excessive spi[INVESTIGATOR_572733].  The paragraph above highlights a means of reducing dose to adjacent normal
structure while still following the guidelines for PTV coverage.

6.7  Compliance Criteria (both Arms A and B)
Planning Priorities:
1) Critical normal structure constraints (see sections 6.1.5 and 6.2.5): The spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], brachial
plexus, heart, and lung are considered critical normal structures and constraints on these
structures will be prioritized. No plan will be accepted that exceeds the stated dosimetric goals
for the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  If there is a need to drive dose to other normal structures, including lung,
heart, etc., in order to not exceed spi[INVESTIGATOR_522263], this is acceptable as long as these changes
in dose to other normal structures fulfills the protocol rules. Exceeding these limits for the
brachial plexus, heart, or lung structures by [CONTACT_726] 5% in any circumstance constitutes a
minor protocol violation.  Exceeding these limits by [CONTACT_726] 10% constitutes a major protocol
violation.  It is understood that other normal structures dose limits would be exceeded in some
patients because of their corresponding tumor distribution and meeting target coverage
requirements.   In general, when targets are within [ADDRESS_751905] be
made to avoid exceeding constraints on these structures especially sparing of the contralateral

electronically to the QA review co-PI, [CONTACT_572815], at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The
electronic submission process involves (1) the treatment plan (CT images, contours and dose
distribution) which is deidentified; (2) the electronic data is sent to MD Anderson using an
encrypted transmission (e.g. sFTP).  The details of the software used for deidentification and
transmission are determined based on the software/network of each institution. As part of image
guidance used in the study, many sites will generate frequent cone-beam CT scans on the
treatment unit.  Although not mandatory, it is encouraged to send these de-identified images to

Definitions
An adverse event is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human
research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam,
imaging finding or clinically signif icant laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, o r disease,
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse events occur most
commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on occasion, they can occur in the
context of social and behavioral research. Adverse events may be expected or unexpected.
Acute Adverse Events
Adverse events occurring in the time period from the signing of the inf ormed consent, through [ADDRESS_751911] treatment will be considered acute adverse events.
Late Adverse Events ( as applicable )
Adverse events occurring in the time period from the end of acute monitoring, to 2years post
treatment, will be defined as late adverse events. Only Radiation Oncology visits will be reviewed for
adverse events.
Severity
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. Adverse events not specif ically
defined in the NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general
guidelines provided by [CONTACT_114642].

Radiation pneumonitis is a subacute (weeks to months from treatment) inflammation of the
end bronchioles and alveoli. Note: It is very important that a Radiation Oncologist participate
in the care of the patient, as the clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_572740]052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751916] x-ray should include the area treated to high
dose, but may extend outside of these regions. The infiltrates may be characteristically
l defined.
Patients reporting symptoms as above will be promptly evaluated and treated. Mild radiation
pneumonitis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or steroid inhalers.
More significant pneumonitis will be treated with systemic steroids, bronchodilators, and

6.10 Steps to Determine If a Serious Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting to the SCCC
DSMC and/or HRPP
Step 1: Identif y the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE v4).
Step 2: Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.
Step 3: Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy.
Attribution categories are as follows:
- D e f i n i t e  The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.
- Probable  The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
- Possible  T h e  A E may be related  to the study treatment.
- Unlikely  The AE may NOT be related  to the study treatment.
- Unrelated  T h e AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.
Note: This includes all events to the end of the acute adverse events reporting period as defined in
section 6.9.1. Any event that occurs during the late adverse event period as defined in section 6.9.1
and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported as indicated
in the sections below.
Step 4: Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those that have
been previously identified as resulting from administration of the treatment. An adverse event is
considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the
severity of the event is not listed in:

http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/therasserecistjnci.pdf  for further details.
9.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.   Disappearance of all target lesions.
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to
observations conducted not less than 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 34
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): > 20% increase in the SLD taking as reference the smallest SLD
recorded since the treatment started (nadir) and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. There can be no
unequivocal new lesions.
 9.3.2 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (Non-CR/Non-PD): Persistence of one or more non-target
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression
of existing non-target lesions

                9.3.4 Progression-Free Survival
Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of
progression.
 9.[ADDRESS_751922] diameter (LD) for the target lesion (or lesions) will be calculated from the
treatment planning CT scan using pulmonary and/or mediastinal windowing and reported
as the baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as a reference by [CONTACT_572786].
Local treatment effects in the vicinity of the tumor target may make determination of tumor
dimensions difficult. For example, bronchial or bronchiolar damage may cause patchy
consolidation around the tumor that over time may coalesce with the residual tumor. In
cases in which it is indeterminate whether consolidation represents residual tumor or
treatment effect, it should be assumed that abnormalities are residual tumor.

 9.7  Comorbidity Data and Rating
The Charlson Comorbidity index will be used to assess pretreatment comorbidity status
(see Appendix V).
 9.[ADDRESS_751933]-Effectiveness
Health care utilization data needed to assess costs will be obtained at the baseline visit (for
the prior one year period) and at each follow-up visit (see Appendix II). Questions will be
asked for the utilization of all the health care services (see Appendix VI).  The health
utilization data will be collected at each study site. They will be transferred to the data
management center located at the Department of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_69637], [LOCATION_007]
A&M Health Science Center (TAMHSC). At TAMHSC, a designated staff member will be
responsible for calling each health service provider and obtain the bills that are associated
with each service reported in the CRF, with costs calculated using methods outlined below
and stored in a designated computer for analysis purpose.  Patients will be given a diary at
the beginning of the study to aid in recording all health related visits and expenditures.
Additionally, in order to assess the treatment related indirect costs and patient out of
pocket costs, a form will be administered during the last week of treatment or at the first
available follow up visit after completion of radiation treatment (see Appendix VII).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]: Inpatient admissions (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572750]) with dates of
admission and discharge and name [CONTACT_407080][INVESTIGATOR_307].  Patient bills (UB-04s) also will be obtained
for each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Inpatient facility costs will be estimated by [CONTACT_572787] a facility-specific cost-to-charge ration from Medicare Cost Reports.  We also
will attempt to obtain billing records for inpatient physician services.  For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572751], impatient physician costs will be estimated by [CONTACT_572788]-based Medicare Fee Schedule to billed
procedures in the physician billing records.  For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572752], inpatient physician costs will be estimated using a multivariate
regression model from data that combines Medicare inpatient and physician bills. This is to

be accomplished by [CONTACT_572789] (MEDPAR) data
set (a file that contains a record for each discharge of a Medicare beneficiary) and the 5
percent sample file of Medicare claims for physician services in the Medicare Beneficiary
Survey.  We will calculate the ratio between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572753]-allowable
charges.  Separate regression models will be estimated for all lung-related admissions
(e.g., DRG 082) and for all other admissions. These regression models will be used to
predict the ratio of inpatient physician costs to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572754]. This
predicted ratio multiplied by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_572755], but only for admissions without inpatient billing information.
Treatment Cost: Direct costs of radiation treatment including consultation, simulation,
treatment planning, and treatment delivery.  Patient bills related to treatment will be
obtained and estimated by [CONTACT_572790]-specific cost-to-charge
ration from Medicare cost reports as described above.
Emergency Room visits: The date of ER visit and name [CONTACT_444246], and whether the ER
visit resulted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  ER costs will be estimated using Medicare average
payment rates for facility and physician charges, using the merged MEDPAR and MBS
data as described above.
Physician  and Clinic Visits: The date of the visit, the name [CONTACT_572810], and the service provided (physician exam, lab test, physical therapy, etc.).  Costs for
physician and clinic visits will be calculated based on billing records obtained for such
visits, using Medicare payment rates for procedures indicated in the clinic billing records.
Prescription Medications: Prescription drugs used, including dosage strength and
frequency of administration.  Information about name, dose, and frequency of all
prescription medications will be recorded.  The medications used by [CONTACT_572791] 15%.  Outpatient drug costs will be calculated by

 9.9 Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Analysis
The study design is to prospectively analyze the QOL among patients with stage III
NSCLC randomized between standard radiotherapy (60 Gy) versus hypofractionated IGRT
radiation therapy. While hypofractionation is hypothesized to yield greater tumor cell kill, it
may also increase the normal tissue toxicity, in which case there may be a decrease in
HRQOL. The primary normal tissue toxicities in patients receiving radiation for lung cancer
are esophagitis and pneumonitis. Prior studies have demonstrated that the most sensitive
and clinically meaningful method for accurately capturing the normal tissue toxicities is via
patients reported outcomes (PROs), such as HRQOL.
In this randomized trial, we plan to assess the FACT-TOI in all arms at 4 specific
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 38
time points to minimize patient burden: baseline (pretreatment), at the end of treatment
(last day of treatment), and at the 6 and 12 month follow ups (See Appendix II).  In order to
analyze the difference in QOL between all arms, we plan to use a brief, validated
instrument that is user friendly and has clinical relevance (the Lung Cancer Subscale of the
FACT-TOI). FACT-TOI is a measure that sums the functional well being (FWB), physical
well being (PWB), and the lung cancer subscale (LCS) of the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy - Lung (FACT-L) QOL instrument, which has been extensively used for
measuring QOL in patients with lung cancer.[31]  In a review of the literature reported that
the FACT-L scale has been used in more than 5,000 patients and has been found to be
sensitive to changes in performance status, treatment response.[32]  FACT has been
translated into 26 languages and is available free of charge to institutions with the
completion of an agreement to share data, accessible at
http://www.facit.org/translation/licensure.aspx . The full FACT-L questionnaire can
be completed in less than [ADDRESS_751934]-TOI has been associated with clinically
meaningful changes in
patients with lung cancer.[33] The lung cancer sub-scale (LCS) consists of 9 items,
involving lung cancer specific symptoms. All items are rated on a 5 item (point) Likert
Scale, from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). It has been determined that a 3-point difference
on the FACT-G subscales is associated with a meaningful difference in clinical and
subjective indicators. Thus, a difference of 3 LCS points will be considered clinically
significant. As the LCS focuses on lung cancer
symptoms, this will be used for the primary endpoint; however, the more general subscales
of physical and functional well-being (on the brief FACT-TOI) will also be collected.  See
Appendix VIII for the appropriate forms.
In addition, the EQ-5D health related quality of life questionnaire will be used as well.  EQ-
5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. Applicable to a
wide range of health conditions and treatments, it provides a simple descriptive profile and
a single index value for health status. .  The US version of the EQ-5D will be used, to
enable mappi[INVESTIGATOR_526629]-QoL scores from EQ-5D scores into health state utility
scores (ranging from 0 to 1) for the US population.  These utility scores are needed for
cost- -year gained).  See
Appendix IX for the appropriate forms.

with the 2-sided significance level of 0.05 and 80% statistical power using a 2-sample log rank
test. We assume that the overall survival function follows an exponential distribution for each
arm. Accrual to the study is assumed to be uniformly distributed. The null hypothesis is that the
there are no difference in 1-year survival rates between two arms.  We assume that the patients
will be accrued for [ADDRESS_751938] a 1-year survival rate of 45% (hazard

11.4 Randomization Scheme
Patients will be allocated to the treatment using a randomized permuted block within strata to
balance for patient factors other than institution. The stratifying variables are Zubrod performance
status (2 vs. > 2) and stage (II vs. III).
11.5 Analysis Plans
All eligible patients who are randomized to the study will be included in the comparison of
treatment arms, regardless of treatment compliance (intent-to-treat analysis).

The null and alternative hypotheses are H0: S1(t) < S2(t) vs. HA: S1 2(t), where Si(t)
is the distribution of overall survival times for patients in arm i.
The Cox proportional hazard regression model will be used to determine hazard ratios and
95% confidence intervals for the treatment difference in overall survival. Unadjusted ratios
and ratios adjusted for stratification variables and other covariates of interest will be
computed.

11.5.2 Quality of Life  (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-L) :
Patient-reported functional status will be assessed with the lung cancer subscales of the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung (FACT-L). The FACT-L is a 36-item
questionnaire that uses 5-point Likert-type response choices (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit;
2 =somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). It will take less than 10 minutes to complete
the questionnaire. The Trial Outcome Indices (TOI) also will be utilized to measure the
summed functional well-being, physical well-being, and the additional concerns (lung
symptom module) subscales of the FACT-L. A 5-point deterioration in the FACT-L TOI
between pre-treatment and at year [ADDRESS_751941]-L TOI points will be considered clinically significant.[33]
The first analysis of change in QOL from baseline to 6 months will only be performed on
patients who are still alive at 6 months. Changes in QOL will be also analyzed using all
available data at baseline, 6, and 12 months with generalized estimating equations (GEE).
We will also compare the percentage of patients in each arm with an effect size for the
change in FACT-L TOI scores between pre-induction and 6 months of < .2; this will allow
us to compare the percentage of patients in each arm whose functional status remains
more similar to baseline levels.
11.5.[ADDRESS_751942] information, or a Kaplan-Meier estimator
on censored costs, since these all produce biased estimators of the mean costs[34].
Instead, we will use the inverse-probability weighting method to calculate average costs
for each treatment group.[35, 36]  The assumption used in this method is that censoring is
independent of the survival time, or cost collection process, which is often satisfied in well-
conducted clinical trials. If the n
quality-adjusted survival time), and save costs at the same time, the new treatment will be
preferred to the current standard treatment under any willingness to pay threshold.
However, if the new treatment extends survival time but costs more, cost-effectiveness
analysis provides an estimate of the incremental cost of greater incremental effectiveness.
For traditional cost-effectiveness analysis, treatment effectiveness is measured simply as
survival time.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicates the additional cost
required to attain one additional year of survival.  For cost-utility analysis, treatment
effectiveness is measured as quality-adjusted survival time (which accounts for the impact
of treatment on both mortality and morbidity, including any differences in adverse affects
of treatment affecting HR-QoL).  For cost-utility analysis, the incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio indicates the additional cost required to attain one additional year of
quality adjusted survival.
11.5.4 Quality-Adjusted Survival Time
The quality-adjusted survival time estimates need to account for the presence of censoring.
Due to the induced informative censoring problem, the ordinary survival method (e.g.,
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 42
Kaplan-Meier estimator) cannot be applied in this case.[35-37]  Accordingly, we will use
the inverse-probability weighted method of Zhao and Tsiatis to carry out the survival time
analysis.[35, 36]  To estimate quality adjusted survival time, data from EQ-5D will first be
translated into utility measures. These measures are obtained at discrete time points, so
they will be interpolated into the time intervals between the visits. The quality-adjusted
survival time is just an integration of the u
until the time limit similar as the cost calculation, whichever occurs earlier.
11.5.[ADDRESS_751943] effectiveness results.
11.5.6 Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and Time to Local Progression
The time to disease progression and time to local regression will be estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier approach. The stratified log-rank test will be used to test for a statistically
significant difference in PFS and time to local progression distributions. The null and
alternative hypotheses are H0:  S1(t) < S2(t) vs. HA: S1 2(t), where Si(t) is the
distribution of survival times for patients in arm i.   The Cox proportional hazard regression
model will be used to determine hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the
treatment difference in progression-free survival and time to local progression. Unadjusted
ratios and ratios adjusted for stratification variables and other covariates of interest will be
computed .
11.5.[ADDRESS_751944] who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each patient will
be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events table ( Appendix II ).
Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made according to the system showing the
greatest degree of toxicity.
  Only adverse events assessed to be definitely, probably, or possibly related to protocol
treatment will be considered. The rates of all Grade 3-[ADDRESS_751945] with a 0.05 significance level.
11.5.8 Interim Reports to Monitor the Study Progress
  Interim reports with descriptive statistics will be prepared once a year until the initial paper
reporting the treatment results has been accepted for publication. In general, the interim
reports will contain information about the patient accrual rate with a projected completion
date for the accrual phase; data quality; compliance rate of treatment delivery with the
distributions of important prognostic baseline variables; and the frequencies and severity
of adverse events. The interim reports will not contain results from the treatment
comparisons with respect to the primary or secondary endpoints.
11.5.9 Interim Analysis of Study Endpoints
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 43
  There will be one interim analyses of the primary study endpoint (overall survival). The
interim analysis will be conducted using Lan-DeMets alpha spending function when half of
patients are followed-up for 1-year. The significance level will be calculated to ensure an
overall significance level of 0.05 (type I error). In addition, a conditional power analysis will
be performed at an interim efficacy analysis.[38] If the 95% confidence interval of the
conditional power is less than 25%, then a recommendation for study discontinuation will
be made to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The results of the interim
analyses only will be reported, in a blinded fashion, to the DSMC.  This analysis will also
track the outcomes of the first 44 patients (enrolled when concurrent chemotherapy was
not allowed) to subsequent patients performing sensitivity assessment regarding the need
for a change in survival assumptions or a change in sample size.

         12.4 Data Management and Monitoring/Auditing
Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval review of
trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_375298]/or the CRO Multi-Center IIT
Monitor. This review includes but is not limited to accuracy o f case report forms, protocol
compliance, timeless and accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting.
Documentation of trial monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents
and will be reviewed during internal audit.
For further information, refer to the UTSW SCCC IIT Management Manual
Toxicity and dose escalation reviews will be performed annually .These reviews will be documented
by[CONTACT_572797].
The UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Committee
(DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all UTSW SCCC clinical
trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events and
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_572459] a quarterly basis.  The
quality assurance activity for the Clinical Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical
research documents to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan
is available upon request.
The SCCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of ongoing clinical
trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as part of the DSMC to conduct
regular audits based on the level of risk. Audit findings are reviewed at the next available DSMC
meeting.  In this way, frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level
is determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of factors such as the phase of the study; the
type of investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required to ensure
the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol-specific DSMC
plans must be consistent with these principles.

Appendix I:  Sample Treatment Consent Form
Study Title: Phase III Study of Standard versus Accelerated Hypofractionated Image-Guided
Radiation Therapy (IGRT) in ) in the Definitive Setting Patients with Stage II-III or
Recurrent Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Poor Performance Status
INVITATION:   You are invited to participate in this research because you have lung cancer.
NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS:   238 patients.
PURPOSE:   The purpose of this study is to compare a new method of treating lung cancer with radiation
with a more standard method.  Modern technology uses frequent imaging and other techniques that allow
precise delivery of a large radiation dose to a tumor while avoiding normal tissue.  The higher dose
technique may work better to kill cancer cells.
What will happen if I take part in this research study?
You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. Randomization means that you
are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. A computer program will place you in one of the study groups. Neither
you nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal chance of being
placed in either group. If you are in Group 1 (often called "Arm A"), you will receive [ADDRESS_751956] and upper abdomen or a PET/CT
4. MRI scan of the brain (or CT if the MRI cannot be performed for medical
reasons)
5. Pulmonary function studies
6. Routine blood tests
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then
you will need the following tests and procedures. They are part of regular cancer care.
1. Physical exam  following completion of radiation therapy at [ADDRESS_751957] imaging to follow the cancer  following completion of radiation therapy at 3 months, 6
months, 9 months, 12 months, and every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for
years 3-5, and then yearly.
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | 51
3. Pulmonary function testing at 6 and 12 months after completing therapy
 At [LOCATION_007] A & M Health Science Center, a designated staff member will be responsible for calling
each health service provider and obtain the bills that are associated with each service reported in
the Case Report Form (CRF), with costs calculated using methods stored in a designated
computer for analysis purpose.  The following bills will be collected for:
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], treatment cost, emergency room visits, physician and clinic visits, prescription
medications and Home Health Care bills.
 The records also may include identifying information about you, such as your name,  and
address.
How long will I be in the study?
You will receive radiation therapy for 3-[ADDRESS_751958] of
your life according to the schedule given above, in order to monitor the status of your cancer.
Can I stop being in the study?
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572761]/her. Another reason to tell your study
doctor that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most
helpful for you.  The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes
it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?
While on the study, you are at risk for the side effects listed below.  You should discuss these with the
researcher and/or your regular doctor.  There may be other side effects that we cannot predict.  Many
side effects go away soon after you stop being treated with radiation therapy.  But in some cases, side
effects can be serious, long lasting,
or may never go away.  Drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and uncomfortable.   It is
also possible that your cancer may not respond to radiation therapy.
Risks and side effects related to radiation therapy to the chest include those which are:
Likely (>10%):
 Difficulty, pain, or a burning sensation when swallowing, which is temporary
 Fatigue (tiredness), which is temporary
 Tanning, redness of the skin, and hair loss within the treatment area, which is
temporary
 Skin in the treatment area may remain permanently dry, and chest hair may not grow back
 Cough and some difficulty in breathing due to lung damage
Less Likely:
 Decrease in blood counts while undergoing treatment that may result in bleeding, and
bruising easily
 Fever
 Chest wall discomfort or pain
 Rib fracture, which may cause pain
 Narrowing of the esophagus causing difficulty swallowing meals (requiring internal dilation

Rare, but serious:
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751959] radiotherapy can cause changes in normal lungs. These changes can be as unimportant as small
amounts of "scarring" seen on x-rays that does not cause symptoms. Sometimes chest radiotherapy can
cause lung damage that leads to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or fever.
Rarely, these symptoms can be severe or life threatening.  Treatment for this lung damage involves pain
medicines, anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids), and rarely, oxygen therapy, which may be
permanent. You should tell your doctors immediately if you have any of these symptoms.
Risks from radiation exposure from diagnostic tests:
There is no additional risk of harm from radiation as a result of your participation in this study except as
standard care for your medical condition.
Risks from blood samples:
You may experience discomfort, bleeding, and/or bruising.  You may feel dizzy or faint.  On a rare
occasion, an infection could develop at the site where the blood was collected.
Risks from Loss of Confidentiality:
Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be
made to keep information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.
Reproductive Risks:
You should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_572799]. If you are a woman able to have children and have not been surgically
sterilized (tubal ligation or hysterectomy), you must have a pregnancy test before enrolling in this study.
Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. It is important you understand that you need to
use birth control while on this study. Check with your study doctor about what kind of birth control
methods to use and how long to use them. Some methods might not be approved for use in this study.
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.
How you can help reduce some of the risks:
During your participation in this research, your study doctor will watch closely to determine whether there
are problems that need medical care.  It is your responsibility to do the following:
 Ask questions about anything you do not understand.
 Keep appointments.
 Let your study doctor know if your telephone number changes.
 Tell your study doctor before you take any new medication even if it is prescribed by
[CONTACT_186167] a different medical problem.
 Tell your regular doctor about your participation in this research.
 Talk to a family member or friend about your participation in this research.
STU052011-093, Iyengar, Form A, Mod_48, 08-26-19 Pa ge | [ADDRESS_751960] problems:
If you have any problems such as unusual symptoms or pain at any time during your participation in the
research, your study doctor can recommend treatment.  Please report the problem to your study doctor
promptly.  Telephone numbers where your study doctor may be reached are listed on the first page of this
consent form.
If you suddenly have a serious problem (such as difficulty breathing) or severe pain, go to the nearest
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9487], or call 911 (or the appropriate emergency telephone number in your area).  Tell
emergency personnel about your participation in this research.  Ask them to telephone your study doctor
immediately.
Are there benefits to taking part in the study?
Benefit to you:  Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. While doctors hope
accelerated hypofractionated, image-guided radiation therapy will be more useful against your lung
cancer compared to the usual treatment, there is no proof of this yet.
Benefit to other people with lung cancer:  In the future, other people with lung cancer could benefit from
the results of this research.  Information gained from this research could lead to improved medical care
for them.  However, your study doctor will not know whether there are benefits to other people with lung
cancer until all of the information obtained from this research has been collected and analyzed.
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?
Your other choices may include:
 Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study
 Taking part in another study
 Getting no treatment
Talk to your study doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in
this study.
What are the costs of taking part in this study?
Expenses related to standard medical care for lung cancer are your responsibility (or the responsibility of
your insurance provider or government program).
All tests and procedures performed during your treatment and follow up visits will be billed as standard of
care.
There are no funds available to pay for parking expenses, transportation to and from the research center,
lost time away from work and other activities, lost wages, or child care expenses.
You will not be paid for taking part in this study.
What happens if I am injured because I took part in this study?
Compensation for an injury resulting from your participation in this research is not available from The
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center.
You will get medical treatment if you are injured as a result of taking part in this study.
You and/or your health plan will be charged for this treatment. The study will not pay for medical
treatment.

TX Primary tumor cannot be assessed, or tumor proven by [CONTACT_572801].
T0 No evidence of primary tumor.
Tis Carcinoma in situ
T1 Tumor [ADDRESS_751964] dimension, surrounded by [CONTACT_529230], without
bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus,* (i.e., not in
the main bronchus)
T2 Tumor with any of the following features of size or extent: More than [ADDRESS_751965]
dimension; Involves main bronchus, 2 cm or more distal to the carina; Invades the visceral
pleura; Associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar
region but does not involve the entire lung
T3 Tumor of any size that directly invades any of the following: chest wall (including superior
sulcus tumors), diaphragm, mediastinal pleura, parietal pericardium; or tumor in the main
bronchus less than 2 cm distal to the carina, but without involvement of the carina; or
associated atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung.
T4 Tumor of any size that invades any of the following: mediastinum, heart, great vessels,
trachea, esophagus, vertebral body, carina; or separate tumor nodules in the same lobe;
or tumor with a malignant pleural effusion.**
*Note: The uncommon superficial tumor of any size with its invasive component limited to the
bronchial wall, which may extend proximal to the main bronchus, is also classified T1.
**Note: Most pleural effusions associated with lung cancer are due to tumor. However, there are
a few patients in whom multiple cytopathologic examinations of pleural fluid are negative
for tumor. In these cases, fluid is non-bloody and is not an exudate. Such patients may be
further evaluated by [CONTACT_572802] (VATS) and direct pleural biopsies. When these
elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the
effusion should be excluded as a staging element and the patient should be staged T1,
T2, or T3.
Regional Lymph Nodes (N)
NX Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed.
N0 No regional lymph nodes metastasis
N1 Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, and
intrapulmonary nodes including involvement by [CONTACT_529231]

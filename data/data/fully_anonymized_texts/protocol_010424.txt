Title:  A Problem  Solving  Intervention  for Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399559]: G. Demiris  
Date of Document: December 20, [ADDRESS_503628] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399560] (Group 1) or a group receiving standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399561] n of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_399562] a hybrid format (first session in 
person, remaining sessions via video) (Group 2) or a group receiving standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399563] a hybrid format (Group 3) o r a 
group receiving standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399564] (Group 4).  
 
Setting  and Participants  
We partnered with Penn Homecare and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399565]. Penn Homecare and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399566] (part of the Penn Medicine system) that is Medicare and Medicaid - 
certified,  accredited  by [CONTACT_399599],  licensed  in the Commonwealth  of Pennsylvania.  It 
serves patients and families in Philadelphia, Chester, Delaware, Bucks and Montgomery 
counties  mostly (total number of counties serves is 20) and is experiencing a growth over the 
years (20% increase in admissions over the past 5 years). The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399567] a total number of 2,970 home admissions, an average daily census of 380 and an 
average length of service (LOS) of 68 days in 2016  
Inclusion  criteria  for caregivers  were  the following:  
• enrolled  as a family/informal  caregiver  of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399568]  
• 18 years  or older  
• with access  to a standard  phone line  or Internet  and computer  access  at home  
• without functional  hearing  loss or with a hearing aid that  allows  the participant to conduct 
telephone conversations as assessed by [CONTACT_16133] (by [CONTACT_399600])  
• no or only mild cognitive impairment —mental status will be assessed using the Short 
Portable  Mental  Status  Questionnaire;i individuals  with a  score  of less  than seven  (i.e., 
more than three errors) will be excluded, similar to other studies involving this 
instrument.  
• speak  and read  English,  with at least  a 6th-grade  education  
 
Enrollment  
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399569], 
asking them if  they agree  to be contact[CONTACT_399601]. 
The admissions staff then forwarded contact [CONTACT_399602]. The interventionist 
called and scheduled the initial visit. The interventionist visited the caregiver, discussed the 
project,  obtained informed consent from the caregiver, and documented demographic  data. The 
interventionist open ed a numbered sealed envelope, prepared by [CONTACT_399603], which 
assigned caregivers to  one of the three  groups. This approach ensured  that consent is  obtained 
prior to group  assignment  and caregivers  consent  to participate in  the study, regardless  of group 
assignment. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  Furthermore, we followed a block 
randomization approach to ensure that treatment groups are not imbalanced with respect to  
time of the year as season (e.g., holidays) may have an effect on some of the psychometric 
measures. Upon consent, caregivers were asked to review and prioritize common caregiver 
concerns  using a checklist, as  the intervention will  focus  on the top three concerns  or problems. 
Following this visit, a research assistant  called the caregiver to conduct the baseline  
assessment (including anxiety, quality of life, caregiver reaction and problem solving inventory) 
over the phone. The research assistant was blinded to the caregiver’s group assignment to  
eliminate an y potential bias. While the pre - and post assessments were conducted by [CONTACT_399604],  the consent  visit, actual  intervention visits/  video -calls and 
exit interviews were delivered by [CONTACT_399605].  
 
Group  1: PI[INVESTIGATOR_399570],  the interventionist  tentatively  scheduled  the upcoming  three  face-to-face visits 
for caregivers, and leave a manual on problem -solving designed for the lay audience based on 
“Solving Life’s Problems” by [CONTACT_399606] D’Zurilla who developed the PST theoretical frameworkii 
with a  special  emphasis  on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399571].  The three intervention visits 
were scheduled with a suggested timeline between days [ADDRESS_503629] recommendations86 and 
previous work on cognitive behavioral interventions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125].iii However, this was only a 
guideline,  and the  actual  timing  and scheduling was  tailored to the individual  caregiver  needs 
and challenges (the visits  were scheduled and confirmed based on the caregiver’s feedback 
and preferences and with the recognition that unexpected and stressful even ts can lead to 
frequent rescheduling). Each intervention visit lasted approximately [ADDRESS_503630] face to face visit for caregivers (suggested timeline 5 -7 days after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141]) includes an explanation of the purpose of the v isit/call, and confirmation of 
the three specific problems that the caregiver had selected from the concern list during the 
consent visit. Caregivers’ problem -solving inventory scores and sub -scales indicate their 
problem -solving style (positive problem or ientation, negative problem orientation, rational 
problem -solving, impulsivity/carelessness and avoidance6) and this allows the interventionist to 
customize the delivery of the intervention. During the first session, the interventionist works on 
steps  one and two of the ADAPT  model  of the  PST, namely  “Attitude”  and “Defining the  Problem 
and Setting Realistic  Goals.” For the first  step the focus  is on realistic  optimism, i.e.,  acceptance 
that problems are a normal part of life. This step focuses on promoting visualizing successful 
problem solving, healthy thinking rules, positive self -talk and using emotions adaptively. The 
problems identified by [CONTACT_399607] s. The second step of defining the problem focuses on 
enabling caregivers to seek available facts, describe facts in a clear language, separate facts 
from assumptions, set realistic goals and identify obstacles to overcome.  
During the second visit (suggest ed timeline 11 -13 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141]) the 
interventionist covers steps three and four of the ADAPT model. Step three encourages 
caregivers in being creative and generating alternative solutions. This step involves 
brainstorming  possible solutions  to the identified  problem,  encouraging  caregivers  to brainstorm 
many alternatives, defer judgment on these alternatives until a later stage of the intervention 
and think of a wide range of possible strategies (general) and tactics (more specific). Step fo ur 
focuses on predicting the consequences and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a solution plan. This step involves 
evaluating  alternatives  and choosing the  one that is most likely to effectively solve  the identified 
problem.  Making effective decisions involves screening out obv iously ineffective solutions, 
predicting possible consequences, evaluating solution outcomes, and identifying effective 
solutions/developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a solution plan.  
The third visit (suggested  timeline  16-18 days  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399572])  focuses  on step five, 
namely trying out the solution plan and determining if it works. The general goal is to 
systematically evaluate the solution that caregivers implemented as a result of the previous 
steps to determine if it was effective in solving (or improving) the identified problem.  
 
Group  2: PI[INVESTIGATOR_399573] a hybrid  format  
In this  group,  participants  received  the PI[INVESTIGATOR_399574];  however,  the first 
session was  delivered face  to face and the  other  two via video. The  three intervention sessions  
were scheduled with  a suggested  timeline  between days  [ADDRESS_503631] in person (suggested timeline 5 -7 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141]) 
and included an explanation of the purpose of the visit/call, and confirmation of the three  
specific problems that the caregiver  had selected from the concern list. During the first session, 
the interventionist worked on steps one and two of the ADAPT model of the PST, na mely 
“Attitude” and “Defining the Problem and Setting Realistic Goals.” After the first session where 
the in person  encounter  allowed  for the establishment  of rapport  between  the interventionist  and 
the caregiver, the second session (suggested timeline 11 -13 days  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141])  and 
the third session (suggested timeline 16 -18 days after  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399575]) were conducted via 
live videoconferencing.  
 
Group  3: PI[INVESTIGATOR_399576] a hybrid  format  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_399577] e PI[INVESTIGATOR_399578]. The agenda for the first face to face visit for 
caregivers  (suggested  timeline 5 -7 days  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399572])  includes  an explanation  of the 
purpose of the visit/call, and confirmation of the three specific problems that the caregiver had 
selected. During the first session,  the interventionist works  on steps  one and two of the ADAPT 
model of the PST, namely “Attitude” and “Defining the Problem and Setting Realistic Goals.” 
Additionally, at the end of the first session, the interventionist will ask the caregiver to take the 
time until the next scheduled session to think about and  identify some positive aspects of 
caregiving, whether these are tasks or responsibilities they enjoy, or other elements of the 
caregiving experience that they perceive as positive or beneficial.  
During the second session (suggested timeline 11 -13 days  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141]) which took 
place via video the interventionist covers steps three and four of the ADAPT model. At the end 
of the session the interventionist  asked the caregiver to go over the benefits  or positive aspects 
of caregiving  that they had identified  and asked  them  to comment  as to why  they perceive these 
as positive or beneficial and whether there are ways to maximize the perceived benefits. The 
interventionists asked the caregiver to take the time until the next scheduled session to record 
how the  appreciation  of these  positive  elements helps them  through  stressful situations  or when 
they have negative thoughts.  
The third session (suggested timeline 16 -18 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47141]) which also takes 
place via video focuses on step five, na mely trying out the solution plan and determining if it 
works.  The interventionist  concluded  the session  by [CONTACT_399608]’s  perceived 
positive aspects of caregiving and reiterating the importance of recognizing and celebrating 
these aspects during the caregiving trajectory.  
Group  4: PI[INVESTIGATOR_399579]. The first session is conducted via video 
and not in person (as is the case in Group 3). The  agenda for the first video v isit for caregivers 
(suggested  timeline 5 -7 days  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399572])  includes  an explanation  of the  purpose  of 
the visit/call, and confirmation of the three specific problems that the caregiver had selected.

positive aspects of caregiving and reiterating  the importance of recognizing and celebrating 
these aspects during the caregiving trajectory.  
 
After all three intervention sessions were completed, a research assistant (blinded to the group 
assignment) called caregivers in all four groups for a post-intervention assessment of anxiety, 
depression,  quality  of life and  problem  solving inventory.  This segregation  of responsibilities  and 
the blinding of the research assistant to the group assignment aimed to minimize any potential 
bias. Caregivers rec eived a phone exit interview a few days after the last intervention visit and 
post intervention assessment phone call.  
 
Treatment  Fidelity  
To ensure treatment fidelity to the planned interventions, we used the training and treatment 
fidelity manual refined  during previous work. The  guide details the training of research staff, the 
nature of each of the three intervention sessions, and the protocol for administering each of the 
evaluative instruments. All face to face visits and all video -calls were audio -taped by [CONTACT_399609] a randomly chosen sample of 10% of all sessions were studied. Thus, the 
integrity of the intervention protocol was systematically assessed via reviews of audio  
recordings of these sessions. Tapes were rated by [CONTACT_458] (PI) for overall 
adherence to the protocol and inclusion of all required elements, as well as to confirm that no 
contamination took place (e.g., a case where the interventionist p rovided specific advice for a 
problem without allowing the caregiver to review and select an option). The research team was 
required to make adjustments if interventions were violating the intervention protocol. The 
intervention  manual  included  our interve ntion  monitoring  tools  (IMTs)  that were  refined  based  on 
recommendations by [CONTACT_399610].  
 
Measures  
Measures  for Specific  Aims  1 and 2: 
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD -7): The GAD -7 is a brief, valid and efficient tool for 
screening for anxiety and assessing its severity in clinical practice and research. The GAD -7 
has been tested and demonstrated high levels of reliability and validity.v The total score is 
calculated by  [CONTACT_399611] 0-3 for each  of the seven items.  Scores  of 5, 10, and 15 are 
taken as the cut off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.  
Problem -Solving Inventory (PSI): The PSI is a 25 item Likert -type inventory that serves as a 
measure of problem -solving appraisal, or an individual’s perceptions of their problem -solving 
behavior and attitudes.vi The total score is used as an overall index of problem -solving ability. 
Reliability  and validity  of this instrument  have  been documented extensivel y (Cronbach’s  Alpha 
reported at .85).  
Caregiver Quality of Life Index – Revised (CQLI -R): The CQLI -R, a measure of caregivers’ 
quality of life (QOL), includes four dimensions: emotional, social, financial, and physical.vii This 
four-item instrument was des igned specifically for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_154264], and its reliability and 
validity  have  been  established.  The instrument  has been  used  successfully  with elderly  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399580].viii Our research team has revised the CQLI instrument for use in oral interviews  
using [ADDRESS_503632] of the visual analog scale.ix Cronbach’s 
alpha  for the revised  instrument  (CQLI -R) was 0.769,  and test-retest  reliability  was supported 
(rs = 0.912, p<0.001).  
Nine-item Depression  scale of the Patient Health  Questionnaire (PHQ -9): The PHQ -9 is a brief 
tool for  assisting clinicians and researchers in assessing and monitoring levels of depression.x 
The PHQ -9 assesses symptoms and functional impairment due to depression and derives a 
severity s core. It  is based  directly  on the diagnostic criteria for  major  depressive  disorder  in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fifth Edition (DSM -V). It is widely used in practice and has 
been extensively tested (kappa = 0.65; overall accuracy, 85%; sensitiv ity, 75%; specificity, 
90%).  While  all other  measures  described  above  were also  used in  our original  clinical  trial, the 
PHQ -9 is a new measure we are planning to utilize; we decided to include a depression 
measure as it has been found to be impacted by [CONTACT_399612].  
Demographic data:  Standard demographic data were collected on patients and caregivers, 
including a ge, gender, nativity, education level, marital status, occupation, patient’s diagnosis, 
relationship to patient, location of residence (residing with patient or not), estimate of average 
time spent on caregiving activities per week, impact on employment (w hether caregiver had to 
decrease work hours or give up employment) and perceived income adequacy (having a 
comfortable income,  having just  enough to  get by, not having  enough  to get by). Furthermore,  if 
the patient dies during the subject’s participation, that will be recorded along with the date of 
death (to allow for calculation of timing of death in the context of subject’s days in the study).  
Table  1 demonstrates  the timeline  for the collection  of these measures.

Measures  for Specific  Aim 3 
We conducted exit interviews with caregivers in all three groups. Caregivers in Group 1 were 
asked to provide general feedback about the PI[INVESTIGATOR_399584]. Exit interviews with 
caregivers in Groups 2, and 3 also assessed caregivers’ perceptions of the hy brid delivery 
platform (face to face and video sessions); caregivers in Groups 3 and 4 were further  asked to 
provide feedback on the positive reappraisal aspects of PI[INVESTIGATOR_399585]. Interviews were carried 
out by [CONTACT_399614] -taped based o n an interview protocol aiming to 
examine caregivers’ perceptions  and satisfaction.  Interview  questions  pertained to satisfaction 
with this  form of interaction,  barriers  and facilitators  to the use  of video,  and confidence in  using 
this form of interaction , lasted 20 to 30 minutes. The interviews were digitally recorded and 
transcribed. The QSR Nvivo11 software was used to manage and interpret the data. This 
software facilitates  the organization  of emerging  ideas,  to search  and explore in context,  and to 
seek patterns.  
 
Measures  for Specific  Aim 4: 
We conducted a cost analysis and we utilized the demographic data collected on enrollment in 
the study to allow for comparisons between the groups. These include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399586],  patient  and informal  caregiver  age and sex,  race,  informal  caregiver  employment 
status,  education and income range, relationship of informal caregiver to patient,  and residence 
of the informal caregiver. We also equipment costs (including equipm ent price and 
depreciation), and training costs based on time to train research staff in the use of 
videoconferencing. The participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399587] -level data to estimate resource use and costs : 
• direct  care time for scheduled  visits  by [CONTACT_399615]  
• travel  distance and  time spent  traveling  for scheduled  visits  by [CONTACT_399615]  
• direct  care time for after-hour calls and visits  by [CONTACT_399615]  
• travel  distance  and time spent  traveling  for after-hour visits  by [CONTACT_399615]  
• time and travel  associated  with the installation  and maintenance  of videophones  and 
addressing potential technical problems  
• average  salary  paid by [CONTACT_399615]  
• number  and cost of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399588].  
 
Other  Measures  
We assessed the quality of the video calls using a previously developed instrument for 
assessing the technical quality of a “virtual visit” in home care,xi a video -based interaction 
between he alth care providers and patients or caregivers. This instrument is a form that will be 
filled out by [CONTACT_399616] -session with a caregiver in Groups [ADDRESS_503640] the frequency of 
difficulties with audio and image by [CONTACT_16133].  The next two items address problems 
with video and sound at the caregiver’s end, as reported to the research staff during the video - 
call. The last item  addresses possible disconnection(s)  and their frequency of occurrence.  This 
section  allows  for the definition  of a score for  the overall  technical  quality  of each video -call. This 
instrument has been tested for reliability and validity and used to rate the technical quality of 
video -calls in home care settings.xii 
 
Data  Analysis  Plan 
Data  Analysis  for Specific Aims  1 and 2 
The primary analyses focused on examining differences between treatment groups in terms of 
caregiver  outcomes  during  the time  of intervention.  Changes  in caregivers’  scores  from baseline 
to post -treatment will be analyzed using analysis of covariance, with baseline score, site, and 
whether the caregiver’s patient has died, as covariates. Separate models were run for each 
outcome (caregiver  quality of life, anxiety, depression, and  problem -solving ability). For Specific 
Aim 1 (SA1) to assess the equivalence between PI[INVESTIGATOR_352757] F2F and PI[INVESTIGATOR_399589], a 
confidence interval approach was used on the ANCOVA model, with a two -sided 5% leveI of 
significance. If the CI of the differenc e between the two groups falls within the pre -specified 
range of equivalence, the two interventions will be considered equivalent.xiii xiv The range of 
equivalence is defined between – Δ and + Δ. The clinically informed Δs for the primary 
outcomes  are: CQL I-R = 1.0; GAD -7 = 1.75;  PHQ -9 = 2.0; PSI = 2.5, respectively. The  analyses 
of equivalence  will be on a per-protocol  basis and  will be supplemented  by [CONTACT_399617] -to-treat analyses.55 
The analyses for Specific Aim 2 (SA2) focus on pair-wise comparisons between PI[INVESTIGATOR_399590]. A significance level of α=0.025 for each comparison was used 
to account for the multiple (2) comparisons and assure an overall significance level of no more 
than 0.[ADDRESS_503641] member. Transcript data were coded  by [CONTACT_399618] (first -level)  and 
theme (p attern) codes.[ADDRESS_503642]  of themes, 
arising from content, concepts, and descriptive categories (the process  will be supported by  [CONTACT_399619]11, an index -based qualitative analysis software package). The thematic 
elements was used to develop coding keywords. Each response was coded along a number of 
salient dimensions, such as topic, thematic content, a nd general sentiment using the previously 
abstracted keywords. Data were grouped and reviewed for trends and patterns or ideas that 
give insight into caregivers’ overall satisfaction with the intervention, their perception of the 
hybrid delivery platform ( for Groups  2 and 3)  and of the positive reappraisal modules (for Group 
3). Perceived benefits and challenges associated with both the focus and content of the 
intervention and its components as well as the mode of delivery were examined.  
 
Data  Analysis  for Specific  Aim [ADDRESS_503643] costs 
for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_399591].  
Intervention implementation costs included equipment costs (based on equipment price and 
depreciation), and staff training cost s. Operating costs were measured by [CONTACT_399620] (wages 
and time)  for delivery  of the intervention (based  on average wages  and average time research 
staff took to do the intervention), and costs of home visits (frequency and duration) by [CONTACT_399621][INVESTIGATOR_154261] a s documented in the record review. Caregiver costs were based on overall 
informal  care time (using  income  data gather  upon  admission), intervention  time,  any time  lost 
from work, and out -of-pocket and travel expenditures related to caregiving as reported by [CONTACT_399622].

SYNOPSIS – BMT CTN PROTOCOL 0403 
 
A Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Soluble Tumor Necrosis Factor 
Receptor: Enbrel (Etanercept) for the Treatment of Acute Non-Infectious Pulmonary 
Dysfunction (Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome) Following Allogeneic Cell Transplantation 
 
 
Co-Princip
al Investigators: Gregory Yanik, M.D., Kenneth Cooke, M.D. 
 
Study Design: The study is designed as a Phase III, multi-center randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the use of 
etanercept for the treatment of acute, non-infectious pulmonary 
dysfunction (IPS) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT).   
 
Primary Objective:  To determine the Day [ADDRESS_108260].  
Response will be defined as (a) Survival to Day 28 of study, plus 
(b) Discontinuation of all supplemental oxygen support for > 72 
consecutive hours by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  
 Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate response to therapy at Day 56. 
To evaluate overall mortality in patients with IPS. 
To evaluate time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen. 
 To evaluate pro-inflammatory markers of pulmonary disease, in 
both BAL fluid and plasma, in patients with IPS.   
  
Eligibility Criteria: Eligible patients are ≥ [ADDRESS_108261] be ≤ [ADDRESS_108262] evidence of 
idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, based upon the presence of 
bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (on chest radiograph) plus a 
supplemental oxygen requirement.  The patient cannot have 
evidence for sepsis syndrome, or uncontrolled bacterial, invasive 
fungal or viral infections at the time of study registration.  In 
addition, patients receiving mechanical ventilation for > 168 hours 
(7 days) at the time of study registration are ineligible.

iiiRegistrati
on and Randomization:    
 Patients will be registered  pr
ior to undergoing a broncho-alveolar 
lavage (BAL) procedure.  Initial diagnostic studies are then 
performed on the BAL fluid, and if negative, the patient is eligible 
for study randomization.  Patients whose BAL special stains (gram 
stain and fungal stain) or whose initial BAL fluid cultures are 
abnormal are ineligible for study randomization .   
 
BAL Pro
cedure:  BAL  samples are recommended to be collected from both the right 
and left sided airways and then pooled together.  BAL fluid 
samples shall be sub-divided and distributed for the following 
assays: Hematology (5 mL), Microbiology (5-10 mL), 
Cytopathology (5 mL) and Cytokine analysis (5 mL) 
 
 All BAL fluid will be analyzed for the presence of bacterial, viral, 
fungal, PCP, and mycobacterial organisms as outlined in Section 
4.4.2.  BAL fluid will also be analyzed for inflammatory markers 
of disease, including but not limited to IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF , 
sTNFR, TGF- , and for components of the lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) activation system (LPS, LPB, and CD14).  BAL fluid 
samples for the above biology studies (inflammatory markers) will 
be initially cryopreserved for subsequent analysis.   
  
 See Section 4.4.2 for full discussion of BAL procedure, Section 
2.6.3 for circumstances in which the “on therapy” BAL may be 
waived and Appendix C for sample handling and processing.  
 
Treatment Description:  Eligible patients will be randomized to receive one of two arms of 
therapy: (A) etanercept plus corticosteroids, or (B) placebo plus 
corticosteroids.  Patients will receive a total of eight doses of study 
drug (etanercept/placebo) over a 4-week period.  The initial dose 
of study drug (etanercept/placebo) will be administered 
intravenously on Day 0, with subsequent doses administered 
subcutaneously (SQ).  Dosing will be administered twice weekly 
over 4 consecutive weeks.  The placebo will be the inert diluent 
used for the etanercept formulation.  
 
Additionally, patients in both arms will receive corticosteroids  
(2 mg/kg/day) Day [ADDRESS_108263] radiographs shall be obtained weekly 
through Day 28.  Plasma cytokine profiles will be obtained on 
Days 0, 7 and 28.  
 
If, at any point following  in
itiation of study drug therapy,

The primary study endpoint is response at Day 28, with response 
defined as above (see Primary Objectives).  Patients who 
discontinue study drug therapy for any reason will still be followed 
for primary and secondary study endpoints.  
 
Accrual Objective: A maximum of 60 patients will be enrolled on study, 30 per arm.   
 
Accrual Period:  5 years. 
 
Study Duration: Patients will be followed for 1 year after randomization.

L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #[ADDRESS_108268] two decades, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has emerged as 
an important treatment for a number of malignant and non-malignant disorders.  Unfortunately, 
several complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and pulmonary dysfunction, 
limit the utility of this aggressive form of therapy.  Infectious and non-infectious lung 
complications occur in 25% to 55% of HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98315] 50% of transplant-
related mortality1,2,3,4,5,6.  In
 about half of affected patients, no infectious organisms are identified 
in the lungs.  Two major types of non-infectious pulmonary injury are recognized: acute 
idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and subacute lung injury (obstructive airway disease or 
bronchiolitis obliterans (BrOb) and restrictive lung disease).  The current study will examine the 
use of etanercept in patients with IPS.   
 
1.2. IPS 
Overview 
 IPS refers to diffuse, non-infectious lung injury occurring in the acute setting.  In 1993, a panel 
convened by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) proposed a broad working definition of IPS 
to include widespread alveolar injury in the absence of active lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_98316]
7.  
The NIH panel was careful to stress that they considered this definition to be 
that of a clinical syndrome, with variable histopathologic correlates and several potential 
etiologies.  Diagnostic criteria of IPS include signs and symptoms of pneumonia, non-lobar radiographic infiltrates, abnormal pulmonary function and the absence of infectious organisms in 
the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352]
1,7.  
A variety of histopathologic findings are associated with IPS; the 
most frequently reported pattern is interstitial pneumonitis, a term historically used 
interchangeably with IPS.  The time of onset for IPS ranges from 14 to 90 days after the infusion 
of donor hematopoietic cells.  Survival after onset is poor; mortality rates of 50% to 70% are 
reported1,3,5,6,7,8.  
Although a recent retrospective study showed a lower incidence and earlier 
onset of IPS than previously reported, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_98317] (rapid onset of respi[INVESTIGATOR_98318]) was similar to historical reports, underscoring the critical nature of this 
transplant related problem6.  
Potential etiologies for IPS include direct toxic effects of HCT 
conditioning regimens, occult pulmonary infections, and inflammatory cytokines that have been 
implicated in other forms of pulmonary injury9,10,11,12,13.  Ad
ditionally, immunologic factors may 
be important, since IPS is more frequent with allogeneic (vs. autologous or syngeneic) HCT and 
in patients with severe GVHD (vs. mild or absent GVHD)1,3,5,6,8.  
In many instances, acute 
GVHD precedes IPS, suggesting a possible causal relationship14,15,16. 
 1.3. Incid
ence of IPS: Investigator’s Experience  
 A retrospective review of 651 allogeneic transplants (304 unrelated donor, 347 related donor) 
performed at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1996-2002 noted a 9.0%

GVHD was present at diagnosis in 70% of IPS cases.  Affected patients were treated with high 
dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy.  Survival rates at [ADDRESS_108271] onset of IPS were 33% and 26%, respectively.  Survival was not impacted by [CONTACT_98377] 
(unrelated versus related donor) or underlying disease.  The median time to death following the 
onset of IPS was 14 days.   
 
1.4. Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha in the Pathogenesis of IPS 
 
IPS Pathophysiology:  The association between IPS and GVHD suggests a mechanistic 
relationship.  The pathophysiology of GVHD is complex and is now known to involve donor T 
cell responses to host antigens, inflammatory cytokines and endotoxin
17,18,19,20,21,22,23.  Endotox
in 
or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of endogenous bowel flora and is a potent enhancer 
of inflammatory cytokine release.  Translocation of LPS across a gut mucosa damaged early in 
the post-transplant period by [CONTACT_98378]24,25,26,27.  
When LPS reaches the systemic circulation, it 
induces the release of inflammatory cytokines from monocytes and macrophages that have been 
“primed” or made more sensitive to LPS via the effects of interferon γ (IFN γ) produced by [CONTACT_98379].  These cytokines, along with cellular effectors, contribute to GVHD target organ 
damage and dysfunction.  During recent years, several lines of investigation have added to our 
understanding of how inflammatory cytokines contribute to complications of allogeneic 
HCT21,28,29,30.  
In particular, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) is an established effector of both 
clinical29,30,31 and ex
perimental26,27 GV
HD.  The clinical importance of TNF  was initially 
suggested by [CONTACT_98380]  in the serum of patients with acute 
GVHD32,33.  
Patients with higher serum TNF levels during the conditioning regimen had a 90% 
incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (with mortality > 70% compared to a 20% mortality in 
patients without acute GVHD33.  
HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] a genetic polymorphism associated with 
high TNF  production are reported to have enhanced early mortality and an increased incidence 
of severe acute GVHD.  TNF  appears critical for the development of early gastrointestinal

y from acute GVHD20,26,27; i
ts role in GVHD mediated damage to other target organs is less 
well defined34.  
 
Al
though the lung is historically not recognized as a classic target organ of GVHD, the clinical 
association between IPS and GVHD and the demonstration of pathologic lung changes in rodents 
with acute GVHD make this possibility intriguing.  Pertinent to this hypothesis, elevations of 
TNF are reported in the serum of patients who develop IPS32 and
 in the lungs of animals with 
GVHD35,36,37,38.  
Furthermore, evidence for cytokine activation and LPS amplification, 
previously recognized in the broncho-alveolar compartment during adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_13086] (ARDS),[ADDRESS_108272] 40,41.  
Clark 
and colleagues found increased vascular permeability and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) 
fluid containing IL-1, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF  and components of the LPS amplification system 
(LPB and CD14) in patients with IPS2.  
The investigators concluded that pro-inflammatory 
cytokine activation contributed to the pathogenesis of IPS and suggested that patients with this 
complication may be at increased risk for LPS mediated lung injury. 
 
Murine Models of IPS after Allogeneic HCT: During the last several years, the lab of [CONTACT_98423] (co-principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_98322]) has studied murine models of allogeneic HCT to investigate mechanisms of IPS.  The majority of preliminary data has been 
generated using two HCT systems: B10.BR  CBA and C57BL/6  B6D2F1.  The 
B10.BR/CBA donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98323] (H) antigens and therefore most closely models an HCT from a 
matched unrelated, volunteer donor. In the C57BL/6  B6D2F1 strain combination, donor and 
host differ at both major and minor H antigens.  This system provides the unique opportunity to 
use genetically altered mice, bred on the B6 background, as donors in our experiments.  
 
In initial studies, B10.BR donor bone marrow and T cells were transplanted into CBA recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Mice were killed at various time points after HCT and detailed histopathologic analysis of the 
lungs was performed.  At [ADDRESS_108273] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98324]35.  
Iden
tical histopathology is also observed using strain combinations across 1) other minor 
antigens, 2) class I or class II antigens only, and 3) major and minor H antigenic 
differences43,44,45.  
In each scenario, significant pulmonary pathology is first detected between 
weeks [ADDRESS_108274] and progresses in severity through week 6.  Potential infectious 
etiologies of pulmonary injury were ruled out in these studies by [CONTACT_98381] (minimum n = 5) for a broad panel of pathogenic bacteria, viruses and Pneumocystis 
carinii.  No pathologic organisms were identified in any mice strongly suggesting that the lung

b. Administration of rhTNFR:Fc significantly reduces the development of lung injury 
after HCT. CBA animals received allogeneic HCT and were treated with control Ig (filled

evaluated at week four and received no treatment (open symbol).  Data are expressed as mean ± 
standard error, n = 8 to 15 per group and represent a combination of 2 similar experiments, #P 
< 0.01, filled symbol vs. open symbol; *P < 0.01, **P < 0.05 shaded symbol vs. filled symbol. 
 
 
In summary, these laboratory data correlate well with clinical reports of an association between 
inflammatory cytokines and IPS (see above) and with our own clinical experience (see below).   
 
1.5. Etanercept (Enbrel, [COMPANY_010], Thousand Oaks, CA)  
 
Normally, two distinct cell surface receptors exist for TNF: a 55 kilodalton (kd) (p55) and a 75 
kd (p75) TNF receptor.  Soluble TNF receptors are shed forms of the extracellular portion of the 
TNF receptor, occurring naturally in humans50.  
Soluble TNF receptors function by [CONTACT_98382]51.  
Etanercept is a dimeric protein consisting of two soluble p75 TNF receptors 
fused to the Fc portion of a type I immunoglobulin (IgG1).  The use of an immunoglobulin Fc 
region as a fusion element in the construction of the dimeric receptor imparts a longer half-life to 
the agent and allows alternate day dosing52.  
 
Clinica
l trials of etanercept have been conducted in healthy volunteers, patients with sepsis 
syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, HIV infection, and Crohn’s disease.  Injection 
site reactions are the most commonly reported adverse event.  In the sepsis syndrome trial, 
etanercept was associated with increased mortality in patients treated for gram + septicemia.  An 
increased risk of infectious complications or mortality was not noted in other clinical trials.   
 
1.5.1.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacology of Etanercept 
 
The pharmacokinetics of etanercept are reported in multiple studies involving both healthy 
volunteers and patients with RA53.  Ph
armacokinetic parameters have been determined following 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SQ) administration for doses ranging from 0.125mg/m2 to 
60
mg/m2 whe
n administered primarily as single doses.  In adults, pharmacokinetic parameters

milar between men and women, and do not vary significantly with age.  In pediatric studies, 
the clearance of etanercept was similar, with a small reduction in clearance in children 4-8 years 
of age (product information, Immunex).   
 
Etanercept is slowly absorbed after SQ injection, and has a relatively slow clearance from the 
body; the elimination half life is 70 hours after a single subcutaneous injection.  When etanercept 
is administered twice weekly, steady state serum concentrations are approximately 2 times that 
of a single dose.  When administered subcutaneously, bioavailability ranges between 25% and 
60%53.  Af
ter subcutaneous administration of 10 mg into the abdomen, etanercept reaches peak 
concentrations of 0.43 ± 0.2l mg/mL by 66 ± 22 hours53.  T
he volume of distribution is 9.6 ± 3.[ADDRESS_108275] ranged from 22-73 mL/hr/m2.  
Comp

dosing [mean time to Cmax: 0.8 hours (IV) versus 66 hours (SQ)].  Etanercept is metabolized through the reticulo-endothelial system

trials in individuals with RA
55,56,57,58.  
Etanercept was studied extensively in 1039 patients with 
RA (the disease for which etanercept is FDA approved) in 10 individual trials.  In one 
randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase II study of patients with RA, etanercept significantly 
ameliorated the clinical symptoms of active RA and primary efficacy parameters showed a clear 
dose response56.  
 
In 
healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin, etanercept significantly decreased release of the 
following inflammatory mediators: bioactive TNFα, IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], cortisol, 
plasminogen activator inhibitor, and tissue plasminogen activator59.  H
owever, a subsequent trial 
in patients with sepsis syndrome demonstrated increased mortality with etanercept with a dose-
response relationship between the drug and mortality60.  
In this Phase II, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial compared single IV doses of etanercept (approximately 6 mg/m2, 
18
 mg/m2, o
r 60 mg/m2) 
and placebo, which were administered during a period of 30 minutes to 
141 patients with potential sepsis.  Sepsis was based upon having all of the following clinical criteria at the time of study entry: temperature > 38.2° C, or < 36.0° C, heart rate > 90/minute, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_98325] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] > 20/minute, pCO2 < 32 mmHg, or the need for mechanical 
ventilation), and hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, a decrease in systolic blood 
pressure > 40 from baseline, or the need for inotropic support above 5mcg/kg/minute of 
dopamine).  The 28-day mortality was 30% in the placebo group and 30%, 48%, and 53% in the 
6 mg/m
2, 18
 mg/m2, a
nd 60 mg/m2 gr
oups, respectively.  Overall, the relationship of increased 
mortality to increasing etanercept dose level was significant (p=0.016).  Among patients who 
received etanercept, those infected with Gram-negative organisms had no increase in mortality 
rates while those infected with Gram-positive organisms had a statistically significant increase in 
mortality rates.  Only 39% of patients in this study had documented bacteremia at the time of 
study entry.  Patients who were neutropenic, patients receiving > 1.0 mg/kg/day of corticosteroid

uivalent, or patients < [ADDRESS_108277] adverse events were mild and the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to 
adverse events was the same in both the etanercept and placebo groups (4%).  Other than 
injection site reactions, no other adverse events occurred at increased frequency with etanercept 
alone or when given in combination with methotrexate compared to the control groups.  All 
injection site reactions were described as mild to moderate (erythema and/or itching, pain, or 
swelling), generally occurred in the first month of treatment, and did not necessitate study drug 
discontinuation61.  T
he mean duration of these local reactions was 3 to 5 days.  No treatment was 
necessary in approximately 90% of cases, and those patients who required treatment received topi[INVESTIGATOR_98326].  Rare occurrences of redness at a previous injection 
site when subsequent injections were given have been reported but have not required treatment
61.  
Uppe
r respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] (“colds”) and sinusitis were the most frequently reported infections 
in patients receiving etanercept or placebo.  The frequency of such infections was 0.68 events per patient-year in the placebo group and 0.82 events per patient-year in the etanercept group. 
 
1.7. Etanercept/Initial Experience in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation 
 
Reports on the use of etanercept in HCT are anecdotal to date.  A case report describing the 
successful therapy of an 11 year old with gastro-intestinal GVHD is described.  There were no 
adverse reactions or complications with its use
62. T
he use of etanercept for the treatment of 8 
patients with chronic GVHD was reported in December 2000; [ADDRESS_108278]-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and methylprednisolone 
(2 mg/kg/day) prior to and during etanercept therapy.  One patient required bilevel positive 
airway pressure (BiPAP) and two others required mechanical ventilation at the onset of therapy.  
The administration of etanercept  was well tolerated and associated with significant 
improvements in pulmonary function within the first week of therapy.  All three patients ceased 
oxygen support during their course of therapy.  Response parameters are noted below (Table 
1.7a, Figures 1.7a and 1.7b).

A pi[INVESTIGATOR_98327] / Brigham

criteria for IPS, were enrolled from 05/25/2001 to 02/04/2004.  All patients required 
supplemental oxygen at therapy onset, with seven patients requiring mechanical ventilation.  
Etanercept was administered at 0.4 mg/kg via SQ injection, twice weekly for a maximum of 8 
doses.  Etanercept therapy was initiated a median of 17 days (11-87 days) post-transplant. 
Therapy was well tolerated overall.  All patients underwent BAL prior to initiation of therapy to 
rule out infectious etiologies. From a safety standpoint, all patients who were intubated for the 
BAL procedure were extubated upon completion of the BAL.  There were 17 severe adverse

nts, including two epi[INVESTIGATOR_98328], and two admissions for acute GVHD within 56 
days of study onset.  One dose-limiting toxicity was noted, a grade 4 dermatologic reaction 
necessitating drug withdrawal.  There were no epi[INVESTIGATOR_98329].  Nine of 15 patients had a complete response, defined as the ability to completely 
withdraw from supplemental oxygen support within 28 days of initiation of etanercept therapy.  
The median time to response was 7 days (range 3-18 days) and the median time to chest 
radiograph normalization was 6 days (range 2-10 days).  The median survival was extended from 
14 days (historical controls, see above) to 67 days (range 3-822) in treated patients.  Survival at 
Day 28 and Day 56 (from the first etanercept dose) was 73% and 60%, respectively.  The 
duration of mechanical ventilation required prior to study onset impacted survival.  Patients 
requiring < 48 hours of mechanical ventilation prior to study entry had a median survival of 150 
days (range 46-822).  In comparison, patients requiring mechanical ventilation >  48 
hours prior 
to study entry had a median survival of only 17 days (range 3–148).      
In order to begin to define the biologic parameters associated with the development of IPS, we 
measured inflammatory cytokine levels in BAL fluid samples collected before (and when 
possible) after the administration of etanercept.  Levels from BAL of IPS patients were 
compared to those obtained from untransplanted controls, from HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98330] (discussed below), or from HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98331].

shown in Figure 1.7c, BAL levels of TNF , TNFRI, soluble CD14 and LPB levels were 
significantly elevated in patients with IPS as compared to patients with subacute lung injury and 
untransplanted healthy volunteers (p < 0.05).  These findings are consistent with those reported 
by [CONTACT_98383] a similar subset of patients.  Of note, total protein levels were also 
elevated in IPS patients consistent with significant endothelial damage and capi[INVESTIGATOR_98333].  By [CONTACT_22242], levels of 
IL-1, IFN γ and IL-2 were not consistently elevated in any group (data not shown).  Strikingly, 
BAL fluid protein levels decreased significantly after treatment with etanercept in the 8 patients 
in whom a repeat BAL was performed (p < 0.05 for TNFRI, sCD14 and LPB).

Th
e University of Michigan also recently completed a trial of etanercept for the therapy of 
subacute lung injury post allogeneic HCT.  Fifteen patients with either bronchiolitis obliterans or 
restrictive lung injury post-allogeneic transplant were treated over a four-week period.  Similar to 
the IPS trial, therapy was well tolerated, with no injection or local site reactions reported.  One 
patient was documented to have aspergillus fumigatus on a post therapy BAL specimen.  No 
other pathogens or infectious complications were identified.   
 
Over the past year, therapy for five patients with IPS was initiated with IV etanercept instead of 
SQ dosing [Personal communication, G. Yanik].  Therapeutic responses were noted within 24 
hours of administration of the IV dose.  Pharmaco-kinetic data provided by [CONTACT_86962] 
([COMPANY_010] Inc.) note a marked reduction in the time to Cmax (maximal drug concentration) when 
etanercept has been administered IV, compared to SQ dosing (0.8 versus 66 hours).  Similar drug 
t ½ (hal
f lifes) have been reported comparing IV to SQ dosing (approximately 72 hours).   
 Overall, over thirty patients have now been treated with etanercept at the University of Michigan 
for either idiopathic pneumonia syndrome or subacute lung injury following allogeneic HCT.  
All patients were treated with 0.4 mg/kg/dose (max 25 mg) over a planned 4-week course of 
therapy, with over [ADDRESS_108280] been rare, with < 10% of patients treated coming off study therapy due to infectious issues 
that have arisen during therapy.    
 
We now plan to further investigate the role of etanercept in the therapy of IPS post allogeneic 
HCT in a Phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center trial.

2. STUDY DESI
GN 
 
2.1. Study Overview 
 
This is a Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center comparison of 
etanercept plus corticosteroids (Arm A) versus placebo plus corticosteroids (Arm B) for the 
treatment of IPS.  All patients will undergo a bronchoscopy at the time of study entry, with the 
exception of those who are less than [ADDRESS_108281] transplant and the patient’s clinical condition is 
such that a bronchoscopy is not possible to be performed.  Study registration will occur prior to 
this bronchoscopy procedure.  Following the bronchoscopy procedure, patients will be 
randomized to Arm A or Arm B of therapy.  Randomization is not allowed until preliminary 
testing on the BAL fluid has been completed (see Section 2.4 for details).  Randomization will be 
performed in a 1:1 ratio using random block sizes for the two arms.  Randomization will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_384].  The primary study objective is to compare response rates to therapy between 
the two arms at Day 28 after randomization.  Response is defined as survival plus the ability to 
completely discontinue all supplemental oxygen support for > 72 consecutive hours.  Patients on 
the two study arms will also be followed for Day 28 and Day 56 mortality, time to 
discontinuation of supplemental oxygen, and for BAL fluid and plasma cytokine analysis. 
 
2.2. Hypothesis and Specific Objectives 
 
2.2.1.  Hypotheses 
 
Primary Hypothesis:  Activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF  contributes to 
the development of IPS following allogeneic HCT.  The development of IPS is associated with a high mortality within 28 days of onset.  Cytokine neutralization with a soluble dimeric TNF  
binding protein (etanercept) will significantly improve both the survival and pulmonary status of 
patients with IPS.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses:  Therapy with a soluble TNF  binding protein will be well tolerated, 
with minimal toxicity, in patients with IPS.  
 
Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels are elevated in the BAL fluid of patients with IPS. 
 
2.2.2.  Study Objectives 
 
This trial is designed to compare the efficacy of etanercept plus corticosteroids versus 
corticosteroids alone in the treatment of patients with IPS following allogeneic HCT.  The 
primary study objective is to determine the Day 28 response rates following therapy in the two 
treatment arms.  Response is defined as above, the ability to survive to Day 28 plus discontinue 
supplemental oxygen support during that time period.  Historical data indicate that IPS develops 
in approximately 10% of allogeneic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], with mortality rates as high as 50-75%.

L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #0403 
  Version 5.0 dated June 2, 2010 
 
 
2-2Supp
ortive care measures plus corticosteroids are the historical mainstay of therapy.  Recent 
animal model and human data indicate that pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF , may 
play a key role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.  The current study will examine the impact of a novel TNF inhibitor, etanercept, in the therapy of such patients.  
 
Secondary objectives will examine response to therapy at Day 56, overall mortality post 
randomization, time to discontinuation of supplement oxygen support, and BAL fluid and plasma 
cytokines analysis.  
 
As noted, recent evidence indicates a potential role for pro-inflammatory cytokines, including 
TNF, IL-1, IL-[ADDRESS_108282] (LPB, CD-14) in the pathogenesis of the 
disorder.  As a secondary objective, the study will examine BAL fluid obtained prior to initiation 
of therapy for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, LPS mediators, and chemokine 
expression.  BAL analyses will be performed in the laboratory of [CONTACT_98424] at the Case 
Western Reserve University Medical Center (see Appendix C).  Plasma will also be obtained 
pre-therapy, Day [ADDRESS_108283] also be met to continue to randomization.  All questions regarding eligibility criteria should be directed to the Protocol Coordinator at the Data Coordinating Center.

2.5. Timing of Reg
istration and Randomization 
 Patients should be registered
 pr
ior to
 bronchoscopy.  
 
Patients will be randomized  foll
owing  the b
ronchoscopy procedure, provided that criteria for 
IPS, see Section 2.6, are met at that time.  Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_384].  Patients will be 
assigned to either Arm A (etanercept plus corticosteroids) or Arm B (placebo plus 
corticosteroids) in a 1:[ADDRESS_108287] administration of study drug. 
 
Patients who are registered, but whose BAL is positive for an infectious pathogen prior to 
randomization, will not be randomized or followed for subsequent study endpoints and outcome. 
 
In all cases, both the study team, physicians involved in the care and management of study 
subjects, and the pharmacists/Investigational Drug Pharmacy at the treating center will remain 
blinded to a subject’s study drug therapy.  Only EMMES and [COMPANY_010] Inc will have access to the 
treatment arm assignments.  Investigational Drug Pharmacies will be provided with study drug 
labels that do not identify which arm of treatment is being administered to a study subject.  A 
code will be available within EMMES and [COMPANY_010], if safety concerns arise regarding a particular 
patient or therapy.  
 
2.6. IPS Definition 
 
The term IPS has been developed to describe diffuse lung injury occurring post HCT for which 
an infectious etiology is not identified7. 
 Patients must meet the following criteria for IPS, which 
includes evidence of both widespread alveolar injury, and the absence of active lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_98336]: 
 
1. Evidence of widespread alveolar injury  
a. Radiographic evidence of bilateral, multi-lobar infiltrates (by [CONTACT_13190] x-ray or CT scan).  b. Evidence for abnormal respi[INVESTIGATOR_98337], based upon a room air oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) <
 93%
, or the need for supplemental oxygen to maintain an oxygen 
saturation > 93%. 
2. Absence of active lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]; assessed by [CONTACT_29065]-alveolar lavage 
(BAL); BAL fluid negative for pathogenic bacterial and nonbacterial microorganisms.  Tests to be performed include: 
a. Gram stain, fungal stain, acid fast bacilli stain (AFB). 
b. Bacterial culture (a quantitative culture ≥ 10
4 CFU/
mL is considered positive). 
c. Viral cultures for respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531], including (but not limited to) 
RSV,adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza A and B, and CMV.  
d. Fungal and mycobacterial cultures. 
e. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) assay, by [CONTACT_954], direct fluorescent antibody 
(DFA) stain, or cytology (per institutional guidelines).

L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #0403 
  Version 5.0 dated June 2, 2010 
 
 
2-53. Other D
iagnostic Issues 
a. The presence of mixed oral flora, “rare” Candida species, or Penicillium species on 
BAL fluid analyses (gram stain or cultures) does not exclude a patient from study, as 
such findings may reflect oral pharyngeal contamination. 
b. The terms diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) or peri-engraftment respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (PERDS) are included within the definition of IPS.  
c. A radiographic finding of pulmonary edema does not exclude the diagnosis of IPS, 
provided that the treating physician concludes that the pulmonary edema is not 
secondary to cardiac dysfunction or iatrogenic fluid overload. 
d. If viral cultures become positive for other potential viral pathogens not listed above, 
discuss with the study chair (or designee) prior to proceeding further on study. 
e. For patients < [ADDRESS_108288]-transplant : If
 the patient’s clinical condition is such that a 
BAL is deemed “not possible to be performed” by [CONTACT_1963] (or 
pulmonologist), then the “on study” BAL may be waived.  In such circumstances, the 
patient may register and be randomized to study therapy without the BAL being 
undertaken. 
For patients not on mechanical ventilation : If
 a BAL is not done, appropriate virology 
studies on a nasal swab (or nasal washing) are required as a minimum procedure to 
study entry.  
For patients on mechanical ventilation : 
Microbiologic studies of a deep endotracheal 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_98338] a formal bronchoscopy procedure.  However, no 
protocol-specified biologic studies (see Section 4.4) will be done on these specimens.    
For patients 31-[ADDRESS_108289]-transplant:  An “
on study” bronchoscopy is required in 
all cases.  
 
Patients may be randomized upon completion of the BAL gram stain and fungal stain, while the 
remainder of BAL studies are still pending.  Patients whose BAL special stains (gram stain and 
fungal stain) or those whose initial BAL fluid studies (including cultures) are abnormal by [CONTACT_98387], are ineligible for study randomization. 
 
If a BAL has been obtained within 72 hours of study registration, the procedure need not be 
repeat
ed, provided that no infectious pathogens were identified in that diagnostic specimen.   
 
2.7. Study Tre
atments 
 
2.7.1.  Initiation of Study Therapy (Day 0): Arm A and Arm B 
 
Study drug therapy (etanercept/placebo) should begin within 24 hours of randomization.   
 
If, at any point prior  to 
initiation of study drug therapy, cultures, special stains or analysis of 
BAL fluid become positive for any infectious pathogen, therapy shall not be started.   
 
If, at any point following  initiation 
of study drug therapy, cultures, special stains or analysis of 
BAL fluid become positive for any infectious pathogen, study drug therapy shall be discontinued

be followed for outcome. 
 
2.7.2.  Corticosteroids (Day 0-28): Arm A and Arm B 
 
All patients are required to be on methylprednisolone (or corticosteroid equivalent) at  
2 mg/kg/day on Day [ADDRESS_108290] 7 days of study 
enrollment, they may be given orally (PO) if deemed appropriate.  If initially given IV, 
corticosteroids can later be changed to PO dosing when the patient is able to tolerate oral intake.  
Corticosteroid dosing should be based upon actual body weight.  
 
a. Patients not on corticosteroids at the time of study registration may begin corticosteroids on Day 0, upon completion of the BAL procedure, and prior to the first dose of study 
drug (etanercept/placebo). 
b. Patients receiving corticosteroids prior to study randomization should remain on 
corticosteroids, with dosing adjusted to 2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone equivalent.  
 c. No corticosteroid taper is allowed during the first 7 days of study therapy  
(Day 0 to Day 6).  Corticosteroid taper is subsequently recommended, beginning Day 7 
of therapy.  Suggested

Dose 1 (Intravenous):  The first etanercept/placebo dose will be administered by [CONTACT_22671]  
0.4 milligrams/kg/dose (maximum dose 25 milligrams).  The etanercept/placebo shall be diluted 
in 100 mL of 0.9 NS and infused over 30 minutes.  Vital signs shall be obtained immediately 
prior to the IV infusion, then q.15 minutes x 2 during the infusion.  The etanercept/placebo may 
be administered via peripheral or central venous catheter.  
 
Doses 2-8 (Subcutaneous):   Subsequent etanercept/placebo doses shall be given subcutaneously 
(SQ) at 0.4 milligrams/kg/dose (maximum dose 25 mg), twice weekly, for a total of 7 SQ 
dosages.  The initial SQ dose shall be given 3 days (approximately 72 hours) after the IV dose.  
All subsequent SQ doses shall be administered 3-4 days following the prior dose (according to 
Table 2.7.3).  All patients should be observed for local reactions at the injection site within [ADDRESS_108292] SQ dose.

2.7.5.  Other GVHD Therapy 
 
The institution of other therapy for the treatment of acute or chronic GVHD is allowed after 
enrollment, with the exception that the patient cannot be concurrently enrolled on the BMT CTN 
#0302. 
 
2.7.6.  Other Supportive Care Measures 
 
All patients will receive prophylaxis against bacterial, fungal and viral infections during the peri-
transplant period according to the BMT CTN MOP.  CMV: monitoring and preemptive treatment 
strategy will be in accordance with the BMT CTN MOP and local institutional practice.  Anti-
fungal prophylaxis for invasive non-Candidal organisms should be considered while on study 
therapy. 
 
2.7.7.  Additional Therapy after Day 28 
 
Patients who survive to Day 28 but remain on supplemental oxygen may be considered for 
additional therapy, including etanercept, at the discretion of the treating physician.  Such patients 
will be deemed non-responders regardless of subsequent clinical course. 
 
2.8. Study Drug Information: Etanercept (Enbrel) 
 
2.8.1.  Chemistry 
 Recombinant human etanercept is a dimer of two molecules of the extracellular portion of the 
p75 TNF receptor (TNFR) each consisting of 235 amino acids.  The two receptors are fused to 
the Fc portion of human IgG1 consisting of 232 amino acids.  The gene fragments encoding the 
truncated TNFR and the Fc portion of human IgG1 are expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO) expression vector. 
 
2.8.2.  Formulation 
 
Etanercept is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder containing 25 mg etanercept; 40 mg 
mannitol, USP; 10 mg sucrose, NF; and 1.2 mg tromethamine (TRIS), USP per vial.  For 
parenteral administration, etanercept is reconstituted with 1 mL of sterile bacteriostatic water for 
injection, USP, containing 0.9% benzoyl alcohol.  Investigational product, not commercially 
available product, will be used for this trial. 
BMT CLINICA
L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #[ADDRESS_108295] 1.0 mL bacteriostatic water for injection, USP, 
(containing 0.9% benzyl alcohol) for a final concentration of 25 mg/mL.  The water should be 
directed against the side of the vial and the contents gently swirled to avoid foaming during 
reconstitution.  To avoid excessive foaming, do not shake or vigorously agitate the vial . 
 
Foaming will interfere with the ability to draw up an accurate dose.  Do not filter reconstituted 
solution during preparation or administration.  After reconstitution, draw up the prescribed dose 
using a [ADDRESS_108296] (25 mg etanercept):   
Vials of study drug should be stored refrigerated at  
2-8oC (36
-46oF).  
Do not freeze.  Lyophilized [ADDRESS_108297] 12 
months at 2oC to 8oC. 
  
 
Reconstituted etanercept:   
After reconstitution with bacteriostatic water for injection, the solution 
should be stored at 2oC to
 8oC.  
Reconstituted etanercept in the original vial or a plastic syringe 
is stable for 28 days at 2oC to
 8oC. 
 Do not freeze.  In the absence of compatibility and stability 
data, no other medications should be added to infusion solutions containing etanercept/placebo.  
The medication should not be prepared or administered using filtration.  Etanercept shows 
stability when reconstituted and diluted in 100 mL saline and stored for 24 hours at 4oC.  
 2.8.5.  Adve
rse Events 
 
Etanercept should not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to this drug or any 
of its components.  Etanercept should not be administered to patients with sepsis syndrome as 
defined as a patient requiring dopamine > 5 mcg/kg/min or use of > one vasopressor, e.g. 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_98339], or steroid prescribed with septic shock as an indication.  
Administration of etanercept should be discontinued immediately if a patient develops an active 
systemic or pulmonary infection or evidence of impending sepsis syndrome. 
 
Parental administration of any biologic product should be attended by [CONTACT_98388].  Allergic reactions associated with administration of 
etanercept during clinical trials have been rarely reported.  If any serious allergic or anaphylactic 
reaction occurs, administration of etanercept should be discontinued immediately and 
appropriate therapy initiated. 
 
The inhibition of TNF hypothetically may be associated with malignancy, autoimmunity, or 
infection.  Although malignancies have been reported in clinical trials, epi[INVESTIGATOR_98340] a causal relationship with etanercept.  Furthermore, no patient has developed 
other autoimmune systemic or rheumatic diseases while on etanercept nor has there been a 
reported increase in frequency or severity of infections in placebo-controlled trials.

be found at www.enbrel.com, listed under “Important Product Information.”   
 
2.8.6.  Route of Administration 
 
Both IV and SQ route of administration have been used, with SQ administration the current 
approved route of administration.  For subcutaneous administration, the etanercept product label 
suggests rotating sites of SQ injections between the thigh, abdomen, and upper arm.  Use a 27-
gauge needle for administration.  New injections should be given at least one inch from an old 
site and never into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intravenous infusions 
 
For intravenous infusion, dilute in 100 mL of 0.9 NS and administer as a 30 minute IV infusion.  
 
Etanercept has been administered in healthy volunteers and patients with a variety of conditions 
(e. g., rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, human immunodeficiency virus, and heart failure) as a single 
IV infusion in doses ranging from 1 to 60 mg/m2.  In
 these studies, etanercept was further diluted 
in 100 mL of normal saline and was administered as a 30-minute infusion.  Data on chronic or 
multiple doses given by [CONTACT_98389]. 
 
The pharmacokinetic profile of etanercept was determined in a crossover study comparing two 
10 mg etanercept doses administered SQ or IV (over 30 minutes) to healthy volunteers.  Serum 
samples were collected for 21 days following SQ administration and for 14 days following IV 
administration.  These samples were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA).  The results are presented in the Table 2.8a below.

this trial, the pharmacokinetic parameters observed are consistent with those observed in 
rheumatoid arthritis patients.  In addition, etanercept was determined to be generally well 
tolerated.  Side effects following IV administration were not specifically described. 
 
An earlier safety trial of etanercept also evaluated the pharmacokinetic parameters in 14 healthy 
volunteers over a wide range of doses.  Patients were given a single IV dose of etanercept over 
30 minutes.  The results are presented in Table 2.8b.

Th
e authors reported that the infusion was not associated with any clinical or laboratory 
abnormalities.  They concluded that etanercept had no acute toxic effects following IV 
administration to healthy volunteers and that the achievable serum levels had potent TNF 
inhibitory activity in vitro.  No anti-etanercept antibodies were detected at 14 or 28 days.  
2.8.7.  Supplier 
 
Etanercept will be supplied by [CONTACT_21931], and distributed through an independent contractor.  
Questions regarding study drug orders and study drug distribution should be directed to the trial 
protocol coordinator at EMMES, [PHONE_2269].   
 
2.8.8.  Discard Instructions 
 
Discard each vial, with its remaining contents, after each dose is given.  At the completion of the 
study, unused vials should be discarded, not returned.  
 
2.8.9.  Accountability 
 
The investigator (and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98341]) will ensure that all study drug is stored in a secured 
area under recommended storage conditions and is dispensed by [CONTACT_98390].  All 
study drug will be accounted for on medication inventory sheets. 
 
The BMT CTN clinical monitor will be allowed at intervals, and upon request during the study, 
to check unused supplies.  Accounting for the use of supplies will be by [CONTACT_98391]'s record of supplies received, the dispensing records for the total number of patients 
enrolled at each center and the unused and returned supplies.

the protocol.  
 
2.9. Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy 
 
2.9.1.  Discontinuation Criteria 
 
Study drug therapy (etanercept/placebo) shall be discontinued and not re-instituted if any one of 
the following criteria are met.  The patient will be taken off study drug therapy at that point, but 
still followed for primary and secondary study endpoints.  A response assessment will be made at 
the time of therapy discontinuation and at subsequent defined study endpoints.  The patient will 
not be replaced on study.  In cases where a potential pathogen is identified by [CONTACT_98392], the treating investigator should discuss the case with the Study Chair prior to 
study therapy discontinuation.  Note: though the study drug will be immediately discontinued in 
the following circumstances, corticosteroid dosing will be tapered as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_47806].  Follow-up data will be required unless consent for data collection is withdrawn.   
 
1. If pre-therapy BAL fluid cultures, special stains or PCR analysis, become positive for any 
potentially infectious pathogen, study therapy will be discontinued and not re-instituted.  (Exception: The presence of mixed oral flora, “rare” Candida species, or a Penicillium 
species on BAL fluid analysis does not warrant discontinuation of study therapy, as such 
findings may reflect oral pharyngeal contamination.)  
 
2. If pre-therapy blood cultures become positive for an infectious pathogen following 
initiation of study therapy, study therapy will be discontinued and not reinstituted.  
 3. If the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with sepsis syndrome, defined as 
fever plus hypotension requiring inotropic support (excluding dopamine  
<
 5mc
g/kg/minute), study therapy will be discontinued and not re-instituted.   
 
4. If the patient develops an invasive fungal infection, study therapy will be discontinued 
and not re-instituted.  Patients with asymptomatic viruria may continue on therapy.  
 5. Regarding CMV, adenovirus and other viral infections:  If during the course of study 
therapy, the patient develops a viral infection that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_98342], study drug will be held.  If > 2 doses of 
study drug are missed, study drug therapy will be discontinued at that time and not re-
instituted.  The patient will still be followed for outcome.  
 
6. If the patient develops bacteremia for > 72 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_98343], the study drug (etanercept/placebo) shall be held until the patient is no longer bacteremic.  If > 2 doses of study drug are missed, study drug therapy will be 
BMT CLINICA
L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #[ADDRESS_108300] one criteria listed in 3-6 above, will not warrant 
discontinuation of study therapy. In addition, empi[INVESTIGATOR_98344], without 
change in clinical status or documented evidence of infection will not warrant discontinuation of 
study drug therapy. 
 
2.9.2.  Additional Discontinuation Criteria 
 
In addition, study drug therapy shall be discontinued and not re-instituted if:  
1. A patient develops hypersensitivity to the study drug injections or if any serious allergic 
or anaphylactic reaction occurs.  
2. Refusal of further protocol therapy by [CONTACT_4676] (or legal guardian). 
3. Per investigator discretion.  In this circumstance, a patient will be deemed a non-
responder at the time of study drug therapy discontinuation, provided the patient is within 
the first 28 days of study therapy.  Patients who discontinue study after Day 28 will 
undergo the Day 28 response evaluation as described in Chapter 3.   
 
In the event that an investigator elects to “temporarily hold” study drug therapy to 
evaluate a potential toxicity issue, the patient may remain on study drug until greater than 
two consecutive doses of study drug are withheld.  If less than or equal to two 
consecutive doses of study drug are withheld, the investigator may elect to continue study 
drug therapy.  The missed doses of study drug will not be given.  If three consecutive 
study drug doses are withheld, the patient can no longer receive study drug therapy.

3. STUDY ENDPOINT
S AND DEFINITIONS 
 
3.1. Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary study endpoint is the number of patients with IPS who respond to etanercept plus 
corticosteroids (versus placebo plus corticosteroids) at Day 28 following randomization. 
 
Response to therapy will be defined as: 
a. Survival to Day 28 of study, PLUS 
b. Discontinuation of all supplemental oxygen support for > 72 consecutive hours by [CONTACT_2006] 
28. 
 
The “time to response” will be defined as the first of 3 consecutive days in which all 
supplemental oxygen has been discontinued, provided that the patient survives until Day 28 of 
study.  Patients who require re-institution of supplemental oxygen to achieve a SpO2 > 93% 
during this 72 hour time period will be deemed non-responders.  Patients who require re-
institution of supplemental oxygen support beyond the 72 hour time period will still be deemed 
as responders provided they meet the response criteria listed in “a” and “b” above.    
 
Patients who are unable to completely withdraw from supplemental oxygen support or those who 
die from IPS or non-IPS related causes by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_108301] 72 hours of the observation period 
(Days 25-28) will be classified as responders provided they survive to Day 28 and remain off 
supplemental oxygen for > [ADDRESS_108302] dose of etanercept (or placebo) to the date of 
death or last follow-up.  Patients who are treated with open-label study drug or other new therapy 
for lung complications before Day 28 are considered a failure for the primary endpoint. 
 
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
a. Response to therapy at Day 56 
Response to therapy at Day 56 will be defined as the ability to survive to Day 56 of 
study, plus the ability to completely discontinue all supplemental oxygen support for > 72 
consecutive hours during this time period. 
b. Overall mortality 
c. Time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen 
The “time required to discontinue supplemental oxygen” will be measured in the number 
of days from study entry.

ENT AND EVALUATION 
 
4.1 Enrollment Procedures 
 
4.1.1.  Screening and Eligibility Procedures 
 
Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN Advantage Electronic Data Capture (EDC)SM 
sys
tem.  The following procedures should be followed: 
1. Once a patient is identified with respi[INVESTIGATOR_98345], an 
authorized user at the clinical center completes a screening form with demographic 
information and Segment A of the Eligibility Form (primary eligibility screening 
questions and date informed consent was signed).   
2. If the patient is eligible, a study number is generated.  A BAL must be obtained prior to 
initiation of study therapy. 
3. An authorized user at the clinical center completes the enrollment process by [CONTACT_98393] B of the Eligibility Form (eligibility for randomization) when the results of the 
BAL are available. 
4. If the patient is eligible for randomization, a random treatment assignment is generated. 
 If a connection is interrupted during a randomization session, the process is completely cancelled 
and logged.  A backup manual registration and randomization system will also be available to 
provide for short-term system failure or unavailability. 
 
4.2. Study Monitoring  
 
Criteria for Forms Submission : Criteria for timeliness of submission for all study forms are 
detailed in the Data Management Handbook.  Forms that are not entered into the web-based data 
entry system within the specified time will be considered delinquent.  A missing form will 
continue to be requested either until the form is entered into the web based data entry system and 
integrated into the DCC's master database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the 
Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Data Management Handbook. 
 
Reporting Patient Deaths:  Death information must
 be ent
ered into the web-based data entry 
system within 24 hours of knowledge of the patient’s death.  If the cause of death is unknown at 
that time, it need not be recorded at that time.  However, once the cause of death is determined, 
the form must be updated in the web-based data entry system. 
 
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Data 
Reporting:   Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre and post-transplant 
outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their institution during

(CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant 
Outcomes Database (SCTOD).  (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these forms for 
all US allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)  Additionally, CIBMTR pre- and post- transplant Report Forms 
must also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial according to the randomization 
assigned to the patient at the time of initial registration with the CIBMTR.  CIBMTR forms will 
be submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule.  
 
4.3. Adverse Event Reporting 
 
Unexpected, grade 3-5 adverse events (AE) will be reported through an expedited AE reporting 
system via AdvantageEDC.  Unexpected, grade 4-[ADDRESS_108304] be reported within three business days 
of knowledge of the event.  Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology

-randomization Bronchoscopy: Arm A and Arm B 
 
All patients will undergo a bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) at baseline, prior 
to randomization, unless criteria for Section 2.6.3.e are met.   
 
The BAL procedure shall be performed, with the following guidelines:  It is recommended that  
< 2 m
L/kg of sterile normal saline (max volume 150 cc) be instilled into the patient’s lungs.  If 
possible, BAL  samples should be collected from both the right and left sided airways and then 
pooled together.  BAL fluid samples shall then be sub-divided and distributed for the following assays: 
1. Hematology:  Recommended 5 mL (minimum 2 mL) a. Cell count and cytospin 
2. Microbiology : Recommended 5 -10 mL (minimum 5 mL) 
a. Stains for bacteria, fungi, AFB  
b. Culture for bacteria (quantitative culture if available) 
c. Fungal, mycobacterial and viral cultures (as defined in Section 2.5) 
d. PCP testing by [CONTACT_954], direct fluorescent antibody stain, or cytology (per local 
institution) 
3. Cytopathology: Recommended 5 mL (minimum 2 mL) 
4. BAL fluid cytokine studies: 5-10 mL in sterile container.  Samples for BAL cytokine 
studies should be placed in a sterile container and kept on ice (or refrigerated at 4° C) until processing at the local institution.  Ideally, the BAL fluid specimen should be 
processed (for cryopreservation) within 30 minutes of collection (see Appendix C). 
 
If BAL fluid samples are being obtained on a weekend or holiday, and the lab is unable to 
process BAL fluid for required cytokine studies, please notify Study Chair (Gregory Yanik, MD 
at [EMAIL_1930] or Kenneth Cooke, MD at [EMAIL_1931] ).

TISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
5.1. Study Design 
 
The study is designed as a Phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center 
comparison of etanercept plus corticosteroids versus placebo plus corticosteroids for the 
treatment of IPS.  The target enrollment is 60 patients. 
 
5.1.1.  Accrual 
 
It is estimated that five years of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
Over 25 centers, both Core and Affiliate Centers, will enroll patients on this study.  Accrual will 
be reported by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, gender, age and donor type. 
 
5.1.2.  Randomization 
 
All patients will be randomized following the BAL provided that the required special stains (on 
BAL fluid) are negative (see Section 2.6.1).  Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio 
using random block sizes for the two arms.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_384].  
  
5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint 
 
The primary endpoint is the response rate to therapy at Day 28 after randomization defined in 
Section 3.0 as:   
a) The ability to survive to Day 28 of study, PLUS   
b) The ability to completely discontinue all supplemental oxygen support for > 72 
consecutive hours by [CONTACT_2006] 28 (see Section 3.0 for details). 
 
The primary analysis will be performed using the intent-to-treat principle, beginning at the time 
of study randomization, so that all randomized patients will be included in the analysis.   
 
5.1.4.  Primary Hypothesis 
 The primary null hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference between the response rates 
to etanercept plus corticosteroids compared to placebo plus corticosteroids.

individuals will be completely observed for the primary outcome.  The sample size of 30 patients

in the response rate from 0.[ADDRESS_108309] 
size is large, it is similar to what was observed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_98347] 1.7. 
 
5.3. Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98348], due to the small sample sizes 
planned.  Monitoring of key safety endpoints will be conducted monthly, and if rates 
significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can 
be advised and if an ad-hoc meeting will be convened.  Policies and composition of the DSMB 
are described in the BMT CTN Administrative Manual of Procedures.   
 
5.3.1.  Guidelines for Safety Monitoring 
 
Historical data at the University of Michigan Medical Center indicate that 76% of patients with 
IPS die within 56 days of the onset of IPS.  These data also indicated that 50% of patients with 
IPS required mechanical ventilation, 70% exhibited grade II-IV acute GVHD, 42% had 
concurrent hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and 36% were on hemodialysis at the time of their 
IPS diagnosis.  Given the high acuity of this patient group, many patients will enter this study 
with both grade III-IV non-pulmonary toxicity and grade IV pulmonary toxicity already present 
(Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, CTCAE version 3.0).   
 
We will monitor three different toxicities separately in each treatment arm: (1) the cumulative 
incidence of new serious or life-threatening infections developi[INVESTIGATOR_98349] [ADDRESS_108310]-randomization; (2) the cumulative incidence of grade 4 dermatologic toxicity (CTCAE 
version 3.0) by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_108311]-randomization; and, (3) the incidence of mortality by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  The 
rationale for examining dermatologic toxicity is based upon data from the Dana Farber Cancer 
Institute and the University of Michigan Medical Center.  Grade 4 dermatologic toxicity (rash 
with desquamation) was noted in 4 of 12 patients treated with etanercept at the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute, and in 0 of 40 patients treated with etanercept (for IPS or acute GVHD) at the 
University of Michigan Medical Center [personal communication, G. Yanik MD, V. Ho MD]. 
Dermatologic toxicity will now be examined in this multi-center trial, in a larger cohort of 
patients.  
 
In the first two endpoints (serious infections and dermatologic toxicity), death prior to the 
toxicity occurring will be considered as a competing risk.  Monitoring will be performed 
monthly until enrollment to that treatment arm is closed.  Each month, the null hypothesis that 
the cumulative incidence of new serious infection is less than or equal to 15% will be tested 
BMT CLINICA
L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #[ADDRESS_108312] 
the alternative that it is greater than 15%.  Similarly, the incidence of grade 4 
dermatologic reactions and mortality will be compared to a threshold of 5% and 65%, 
respectively. 
 
A truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) for a binomial outcome will be used for 
each endpoint, as described in greater detail below.  Note that in the absence of censoring, the 
binomial proportion of patients experiencing the toxicity prior to death is equal to the cumulative 
incidence.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monthly 
examinations for a single toxicity endpoint, but not across two treatment arms or across the three 
endpoints.  Thus for a single endpoint and study arm, the type I error is < 5%, and across both 
treatment arms and all three endpoints, the study-wide type I error is < 30%. 
 
The rationale for not conserving type I error across multiple treatments and outcomes is twofold.  
First, adjusting the size of the test for multiple comparisons would reduce statistical power to 
detect adverse outcomes, which seems imprudent.  Secondly, the procedure is a guideline for 
requiring additional review by [CONTACT_39109], and is not a formal 
“stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]” that would mandate automatic closure of study enrollment.   
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each monthly interim analysis, the total number of 
patients enrolled is plotted against the total number of endpoints observed in those patients, (e.g., 
patients with new serious infection).  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_98394].  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring each treatment arm to 
protect against high incidences of new infection.  If the graph falls above the upper boundary, the 
SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more new serious infections than 
predicted by [CONTACT_98395].  Otherwise, the SPRT continues 
until enrollment to the treatment arm reaches the target goal.   
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities  and  of rejecting 
H0 whe
n  = 0 and
 of accepting H 1 whe
n  = 1, resp
ectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|I).  
The tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following SPRTs:   
 
 A SPRT contrasting 15% versus 30% Day 28 incidence of new serious infection, with 
nominal type I and II errors of 5.6% and 20%, respectively.  The common slope of the 
parallel lines is 0.219 and the intercept for the upper boundary is 2.997. 
 A SPRT contrasting 5% versus 15% Day 28 incidence of subcutaneous reaction, with 
nominal type I and II errors of 6.5% and 20%, respectively.  The common slope of the 
parallel lines is 0.092 and the intercept for the upper boundary is 2.075. 
 A SPRT contrasting 65% versus 80% Day 28 mortality, with nominal type I and II errors 
of 5.6% and 20%, respectively.  The common slope of the parallel lines is 0.[ADDRESS_108313] will be lower than the nominal level given %.

hat because there is a lag from randomization to complete follow up (28 days), the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98352].  For example, there may 
be [ADDRESS_108314] or the competing event of death prior to observing that toxicity.  The monitoring 
rule is based only on the binomial outcome of whether a patient experienced the toxicity by 28 
days and prior to death.  Because the simulations only use a binomial outcome, the mean month 
stopped is calculated based on the accrual time of the patient triggering the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] + 28 
days for complete follow-up.  In practice, because of the potential for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98353] a particular patient, the actual mean month stopped may 
be earlier than shown in the simulation results.  However, this is difficult to estimate because it is 
dependent on assumptions about the time to event distribution for both the toxicity event and the 
competing risk, as well as the dependence between them.

1. Response to therapy at Day 56: A binomial test of proportions will be computed after 
all patients are followed for [ADDRESS_108316] and 
experimental treatment arms.  
2. Overall mortality:  Kaplan-Meier curves will be computed by [CONTACT_3148], and the groups 
will be compared using the log-rank test.  Estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be 
tabulated also specifically for Day [ADDRESS_108317] based on the difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimates at a fixed 
point in time (Day 28 and Day 56).   
3. Time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen support:  cumulative incidence 
curves will be computed by [CONTACT_3148], with death prior to discontinuation as the competing risk.  A log-rank test will be used to compare the two arms.     
4. BAL Fluid and Plasma Cytokine Analysis: BAL fluid and plasma will be collected for 
cytokine analysis using standard ELISA assays .  This analysis will include but be not 
limited to TNF , sTNFRI, sTNFRII, LBP, IL-1, IL-6, MCP-[ADDRESS_108318] to the severity and

B-3  Study
 Sponsor  
The research in this study is paid for by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH), which supports the 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN).  The BMT CTN will direct the 
research study.  Some support will also be given by [CONTACT_98398], which makes the drug 
being tested in this study.  All decisions about how the study is done are made independently by [CONTACT_98399].   
 Why is this study being done?   
Pneumonia is a term that refers to the presence of fluid, congestion, or irritation or swelling in the lungs.  Patients with pneumonia often have a cough and/or chest pain.  They can be short of 
breath.  Oxygen may be needed to help them breathe.  In many cases, pneumonia is caused by 
[CONTACT_98400].  However, sometimes patients develop symptoms of pneumonia but no 
germs are present.  This is called Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome  (IPS).  IPS usually occurs 
within the first [ADDRESS_108320] found that the lung fluid of patients with IPS contains certain chemicals that 
may directly damage the lung.  One of these chemicals is called Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).  
Some recent tests suggest that TNF may be involved in causing lung damage.  
 
Currently, there is no proven treatment for IPS.  Patients may receive oxygen to help with 
breathing.  They may receive medications (called diuretics) to remove fluid from their lungs.  
Patients often receive steroids to decrease some of the irritation and swelling in the lungs.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_98356], many patients with IPS do not get better.   
 
Etanercept is a drug approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of 
rheumatoid arthritis (joint disease) and psoriasis (skin disease).  We know that TNF is 
responsible for the damage caused to the joints or skin in patients with these diseases.  
Etanercept blocks the effects of TNF.  Since we think that TNF may cause some of the lung 
damage in patients with IPS, it is possible that etanercept will help this disease too.  In a previous 
small study of etanercept in patients with IPS, no serious side effects were seen.  Some of the 
patients got better.    
 
The purpose of this study is to find out whether adding etanercept to a commonly-used treatment 
for IPS (steroids) is more effective in treating IPS than steroids alone.  Patients will receive 
either “etanercept and steroids” (Group A) or “placebo and steroids” (Group B).  The placebo 
has no good or bad effect on IPS.  Thus patients in Group B are actually receiving only steroids 
to treat IPS. 
 
Steroids are the most common treatment for IPS. 
 
Doctors want to know if giving etanercept plus steroids is better, the same or worse than giving 
steroids alone.  The study will also see whether side effects result from adding etanercept to the 
commonly-used steroids.  The study may help doctors make better treatment choices for future 
patients with IPS.

B-5  Scree
ning studies:  
You w
ill need to have the following tests or procedures to find out if you are eligible for this 
study.  We refer to these as “screening studies.”  These screening studies are often part of regular 
care, and may be done even if you do not join the study.   
 Chest X ray  
 Blood tests  
 Bronchoscopy  
 
Bronchoscopy: A bronchoscopy is a procedure performed by [CONTACT_98401].  A small flexible 
tube is inserted into your nose (or mouth), and passed into your lungs.  The tube has a light on 
one end that allows doctors to see into your lungs.  The doctors will take out a sample of fluid 
from your lungs.  This lung fluid will be tested for the presence of germs.  If any germs are 
found, you can not be on this study but will receive treatment for the specific germs found.  A 
portion of the fluid will also be tested for research purposes.  The research will look for the 
presence of chemicals such as TNF.   
 
During the bronchoscopy, you may or may not be put to sleep.  In some cases, your doctor may 
place you on a breathing machine (called a mechanical ventilator).  This will make sure you get 
enough oxygen during the procedure.  At the end of the procedure, the breathing tube is usually 
removed.  In some cases, however, the breathing machine may need to remain in place longer.  
 
If you have had a bronchoscopy in the past 3 days, this procedure will not need to be repeated as 
long as no germs were found. 
 
In some cases, your physician may choose not to do the bronchoscopy procedure.  If your 
medical condition is such that a BAL is deemed “not possible to be performed” by [CONTACT_98402], then the “on study” BAL may be waived (not done).  In this circumstance, you may 
enroll and still be randomized to study therapy without the BAL being undertaken . 
 Randomization:
 
If the
 results of tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, you will be “randomized” 
into one of the study groups described below.  Randomization is done by a computer.  
Randomization puts you into a group by [CONTACT_3364], much like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  You will have an 
equal chance of being placed into either group.  You will not be able to choose which group you 
are assigned.  Neither you nor your doctors will know your group.   
 If you are in Group A, you will receive treatment with etanercept plus steroids.   
 If you are in Group B, you will receive treatment with steroids plus a placebo.  The 
placebo will be a salt solution without medication.   
 
You will not be able to tell the etanercept from the placebo, as both will look the same.  Once 
you start treatment, you may not change to therapy in the other group while on this study.  
 
Study Treatment:  
Th
e etanercept (or placebo) may begin within 24 hours after the bronchoscopy procedure.  You 
will receive either etanercept or the placebo two times per week, for 4 weeks (see Table below).  
BMT CLINICA
L TRIALS NETWORK  Etanercept IPS – Protocol #[ADDRESS_108321] dose of etanercept (or placebo) 
as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion.  You will receive the second dose of etanercept (or 
placebo) as an injection under the skin (SQ) [ADDRESS_108322] dose.  You will receive the 
remaining etanercept (or placebo) doses as injections under the skin approximately 3-4 days after 
the previous dose. The dosing plan is provided below.

In addition to the etanercept (or placebo), you will also be given steroids (such as prednisone, 
Medrol, or Solumedrol).  The steroids may be given to you by [CONTACT_98403].  The dose of 
steroids you receive varies according to your weight.  If you are getting better (requiring less 
oxygen to breathe) by [CONTACT_2006] 7 of treatment, the dose of steroids may be decreased.   
 
If you continue to get better (requiring less oxygen to breathe), the steroid dosage will be 
decreased further over a 2-month period.  In some cases, the steroids will be continued for a 
longer period of time (after 2 months).

What side effect or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
There are risks involved in this study.  There may be side effects from the drugs or study procedures.  The side effects we know about now  are described below.  Side effects can range 
from mild to severe.  Some side effects may last only a short time (hours – days).  Others may 
last longer.   
 
Please talk with your doctor about possible side effects.  If you want to read more about the drugs used in this study, please ask your doctor.  We have grouped side effects according to how 
likely they are to happen: 
 
 
Lik
ely Side Effects  What
 it means: This type of side effect is expected to occur in more 
than 20% of patients.  This means that [ADDRESS_108325].  
Less Lik

B-10  III. Risk
s related to etanercept:  (th
is applies if you are assigned to Group A therapy)  
 
Etanercept has been studied in both children and adults with a number of other conditions.  
These conditions include rheumatoid arthritis (a joint disease), psoriasis (a skin disorder), 
Crohn’s disease, AIDS, heart failure, or serious infections.  Infections, some serious, have been 
reported in these studies.  Many infections occurred in patients who already had diseases that 
tended to weaken their body’s ability to fight infection.  In all cases, the occurrences of these 
side effects were rare.  Also it is unclear whether or not etanercept was the cause.  In patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, the number of infections in patients treated with etanercept 
did not differ from the number in patients treated with a placebo.  This included serious 
infections. 
 
We cannot determine how etanercept may affect your risk of getting cancer.  To date, the 
incidence of cancer in patients receiving etanercept has been similar to the risk in untreated 
people. 
 
A small number of people receiving etanercept have formed antibodies (proteins that attack 
foreign matter)  against etanercept.  Although these antibodies do not appear to decrease the 
effect of the drug, it is a possibility that it may in some patients.  The effects of a person developi[INVESTIGATOR_98361].  Your chances of developi[INVESTIGATOR_98362], < 5%. 
 
Etanercept given by [CONTACT_98406], bleeding, bruising, and rarely, 
an infection at the site of injection.  A summary of the possible risks of etanercept is shown 
below:  
 
Likely 
(“Like
ly” refers to a side effect 
that is expected to occur in more 
than 20% of patients)  Pain at the site
 of the injection 
Less Lik
ely 
 
(“Less like
ly” refers to a side 
effect that is expected to occur in 
20% or fewer patients) 
  Increa
sed risk of infections.  Some of these infections 
may be serious or even life threatening 
 Irritation, itching, bruising, swelling or redness at the site of the etanercept injection 
 Hyper or hypothyroidism, where the thyroid gland produces too little or too much thyroid hormone 
 Belly pain, nausea and/or vomiting 
 High blood sugar levels 
 Blurred vision 
 Headache, or dizziness 
 Runny nose, sore throat

B-11  Rare, bu
t Serious 
 
(These possib
le risks have been 
reported in rare occurrences, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] < 2% of patients, but 
may be serious if it occurs.  In 
most cases it is unclear whether 
or not etanercept was the cause.) 
  Severe
 allergic reactions during the infusion or injection 
 Severe rashes which can affect the skin and mouth, 
leading to pain, peeling of the skin and increased risk of 
infections 
 Headaches, seizures, strokes 
 Onset of multiple sclerosis or muscle weakness  
 Decreased blood counts, such as  
­ A low number of white blood cells, which can make it 
easier to get infections 
­ A low number of red blood cells, which can make you 
feel tired and weak 
­ A low number of platelets, which causes you to bruise 
and bleed more easily 
 A relapse of one’s cancer, or the development of a new 
cancer such as leukemia or lymphoma.  Patients with 
Wegener’s granulomatosis, a known immune system 
disorder, have had an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_98363]. 
 Weakened heart muscle which may make you feel tired, 
weak, or short of breath 
 Recurrence of certain viral infections, such as the 
hepatitis B virus, which can lead to severe liver damage 
or liver failure 
 Recurrence of tuberculosis, if you have been previously infected with tuberculosis 
 Development of proteins (called antibodies) that react against your own body tissue.  Collectively, these are 
called auto-immune reactions.  They are often associated 
with rashes and fever.  
 Blood clots, or bleeding problems 
 
 
Th
ere may be other, as yet unknown, side effects of etanercept. 
 
 
IV. Reproductive risks:   The e
ffects of etanercept on your ability to get pregnant is not 
known.  Its risks to an unconceived, unborn or newborn child are also unknown.  Because the drugs in this study may affect an unborn baby, you should not become pregnant or father a baby 
[CONTACT_56035].  You should not nurse a baby [CONTACT_56035].  Women or men of child-
bearing potential are not allowed to be in the study unless they use birth control (which may 
include abstinence).

 Risks related to the placebo:  (th
is applies if you are assigned to Group B therapy)  
The treatment with placebo is anticipated to have few side effects.  Pain at the site of the 
injections of the placebo may be noted in > 20% of patients receiving the placebo injections.  
 Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
Being in this study may or may not lead to any direct benefit for you.  We also hope that information gathered in this study will help future patients with IPS.   
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
If you do not take part in this study, you will be followed and treated according to the usual practice at your transplant center.  This may include, for example:  
 
 Bronchoscopy.   
 Supportive care such as oxygen, or medications to remove fluid from your lungs. 
 Steroid medications to treat IPS. 
 Etanercept to treat IPS (this etanercept is the same as the study drug, but it would be given to 
you not as part of this study). 
 
You should know about your treatment choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.   
 
What are the costs of taking part in this study?  
You or your insurance company will pay for all standard care relating to your transplant and IPS.  This includes (but not limited to) routine blood tests, chest X-rays, and bronchoscopy 
procedures. 
 
You will not be billed for tests that are only done for research purposes.  These include the cost 
of the etanercept or placebo, and the cost of laboratory studies to measure chemicals called 
cytokines, such as TNF.   
 
You will not be paid to be in this study. 
 
[COMPANY_010], the company that makes etanercept, is providing funds for some of the costs of this 
study.  However, [COMPANY_010] did not plan or design this clinical trial.  [COMPANY_010] will also not have a 
part in analyzing the results of this study. 
 
Some health plans will not pay these costs for people taking part in studies.  Check with your 
health plan or insurance company to find out if they will pay.

BLOOD AND LUNG FLUID FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: 
Please note: This section is about future research studies.  These studies will be done using 
blood and lung fluid samples.  You may give samples for these future research studies if you 
want to.  You can still be a part of the main study even if you say 'no' to allowing these 
samples to be used for future research studies.  Please mark your choice at the end of this 
section. 
 
The study investigators ask your permission to store and use any remaining blood or lung fluid  
for future research.  If your blood/lung fluid has already been collected, any remaining 
blood/lung fluid will be used for research, if you agree.  These future studies may help 
researchers learn more about IPS and your response to treatment.  Researchers may also perform 
genetic studies to determine whether there are correlations among your genetic make-up, the risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_98367], and your response to treatment.  This new research will be unlinked to your 
private personal information or other medical history.  The doctors involved in running this study 
will not give other researchers your name, address, phone number, or any other information that 
will let the researchers identify you.  Data generated from your blood/lung fluid will be entirely 
investigational.  Reports about research done with your blood/lung fluid will not be given to you 
or your doctor.  These reports will not be put in your health record.

B-17  Your blood
/lung fluid may be distributed to the researchers in the BMT CTN and other qualified 
researchers interested in IPS or other transplant-related complications.  As noted above, the 
researchers will be given these samples without any potentially identifying information.  
Information gained from research on your blood/lung fluid may be used for the development of 
diagnostic procedures or new treatments for lung complications after transplant.  Your 
blood/lung fluid will not be sold to any person, institution, or company for financial gain or 
profit.  Moreover, neither you nor your heirs will gain financially from discoveries made using 
the information and/or specimens that you provide. 
 
In some cases, you may have already given consent to your treating institution or the National 
Marrow Donor Program (if you were the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98368]) for the 
collection of blood samples prior to your bone marrow transplant.  If this has occurred, your 
treating institution (or the NMDP) will also be requested to, when possible, supply a portion of 
these samples for research purposes.  In addition, you will be asked to provide a tissue sample 
that could be collected by [CONTACT_98413] a cotton swab on the inside part of your cheek. 
 
Things to Think About: The choice to let us use these samples for future research is up to you.  
No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
 
If you decide now that your blood/lung fluid can be kept for research, you can change your mind 
at any time.  If you change your mind, we ask that you tell [the study Principal Investigator] in 
writing; his/her mailing address is on the first page of this form.  Tell your doctor that you do not 
want us to use your blood or lung fluid.  Then any blood/lung fluid that remains will no longer be 
used for research.  
 
Benefits: You may not get any direct benefit for providing blood/lung fluids for this study, but 
the research performed with these samples may help us learn more about what causes IPS and 
other complications after transplantation, and how to prevent and/or treat them. 
 
Risks: The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  We will 
do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private and secure.  The 
chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.  
 
To help us protect your privacy, we have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the 
National Institutes of Health.  With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose 
information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, 
criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings.  The researchers will use the 
Certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained 
below. 
 
The Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United 
States Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects or for 
information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA).

I. Pro
cessing of BAL fluid sample (at Local Institution): 
A minimum of 5 mL (range 5-10 mL) of BAL fluid is required for the cytokine studies.  Upon 
completion of the bronchoscopy procedure, the BAL fluid should be placed in a sterile container 
and kept on ice (or refrigerated at 4o C) unti
l processing.  Ideally, the BAL fluid specimen should 
be processed within 30 minutes of collection.  Specimen should be spun at 400x g for 5 minutes 
in order to separate supernatant from the cell pellet.  Supernatant will be extracted and divided 
into 1-2 mL aliquots in five sterile cryovials and frozen at –80oC.  
The samples will remain 
cryopreserved until later shipment to the laboratory of [CONTACT_98424] (see below).     
II. Processing of serum samples (at Local Institutions):  
Five to ten mL of peripheral blood should be obtained in green top tubes on Day 0, 7, and [ADDRESS_108330] dose of study drug on Day 
0 of study.  Samples should be separated within 30 minutes of sample acquisition.  Samples 
should be centrifuged a 400x g for 10 minutes, the supernatant separated from the cell pellet, 
aliquoted into two sterile cryovials, and frozen at –[ADDRESS_108331]. Kenneth Cooke.

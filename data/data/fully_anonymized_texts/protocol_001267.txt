4.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
4.1 Imprime PGG Background  
4.1.1 Imprime PGG – Therapeutic Mechanism of Action  
Imprime PGG is a soluble, β -1,3/1,[ADDRESS_505775] strain. Imprime PGG acts as a Pathogen -Associated 
Molecular Pattern (PAMP). PAMPs are critical, “non -self” signals efficiently and effectively 
recognized by [CONTACT_401126] - macrophages, monocytes, 
neutrophils and dendritic cells. As a PAMP, Imprime PGG enhances innate immune cell 
killing, counteracts immune suppression and, importantly, triggers the activation and 
maturation of antigen presenting cells (ie , macrophages and dendritic cells), enabling T cell 
expansion and activation.

Non-clinical ex vivo  studies using whole blood from healthy human volunteers have 
demonstrated that Imprime PGG treatment stimulates neutrophils to specifically recognize 
and kill antibody -decorated cancer cells via a remarkable burst in the generation of reactive 
oxygen species.  Imprime PGG treatment also promotes the degranulation and the killing 
activity of Natural Killer (NK) cells directed against human cancer cells. M2 macrophages 
differentiated and isolated from Imprime PGG treated monocytes in human whole blood re -
polarize, reducing expression of M2 -specific surface markers (eg , CD163) and increasing 
M1-state markers (eg , CD86, PD -L1). These repolarized M2 macrophages exhibit 
significantly enhanced capacity to recognize and phagocytose antibody -decorated human 
cancer cells.  Furthermore, these Imprime PGG treated M2 macrophages actively stimulate 
the expansion of CD4 T cells and the production of the potent anti -tumor cytokine 
IFN. Monocyte -derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) from Imprime PGG treated whole blood 
show increased expression of activation and maturation markers (CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA -
DR), indicating these cells have matured into fully professional antigen presenting cells. In 
allogeneic Mixed Lymphocyte Reactions, these Imprime PGG -treated MoDCs can now 
instruct substantial CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion and increased IFN  production. 
Collectively , these ex vivo  studies suggest that Imprime PGG treatment drives the direct 
killing activity of innate immune effectors, re -polarizes the function of normally 
immunosuppressive M2 macrophages, and significantly enhances T cell priming, eliciting 
CD4 and CD8 T cell expansion and IFN  production (Fraser et al, AACR 2016; Fulton et al, 
AACR 2016; Leonardo et al, AACR 2016; Jonas et al, AACR 2016).  
In multiple pre -clinical tumor models in vivo , Imprime PGG has been shown to enhance the 
efficacy of tumor -targeted antibodies (eg , cetuximab). This anti -tumor response absolutely 
requires GR1+ (myeloid) cells, complement , and CR3.  Recent in vivo  work in preclinical 
tumor models further highlights the capacity of Imprime PGG to enlist the full functionality 
of the innate immune system to drive an anti -tumor response. In xenografted human tumor 
models, IV administration of Imprime PGG in conjunction with anti -angiogenic monoclonal 
antibodies (bevacizumab and DC101 - a murine anti -VEGFR2 antibody) enhances anti -tumor 
efficacy while re -polarizing the immune microenvironment  – ie, enhancing M1 marker 
expression (iNOS, TNFα, CD86, PD -L1), decreasing M2 marker expression (Arg1, TGFβ, 
CD206) and promot ing differentiation of Myeloid D erived Suppressor C ells (MDSCs)  
(Fraser et al, AACR 2016  A; Fraser et al, AACR 2016 B; Jonas et al, AACR 2016 ). In the 
B16 melanoma model, Imprime PGG synergizes with the tumor targeting anti -Trp1 antibody 
in immune -competent C57BL/6 mice to significantly reduce the number and size of lung 
metastases (Leonardo et al, AACR 2016).  Finally, in immune -competent C57BL/6 mice, IV 
administered Imprime PGG triggers mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes into 
circulation and into secondary lymphoid organs. Imprime PGG also effectively binds 
dendritic cells, inducing increased surface expression of CD86 and MHC class II, suggesting 
enhanced antigen presentation capability. Consistent with these data, Imprime PGG treatment 
specifically and robustly enhanced expansion of adoptively transferred CD8 T cells (the Ova -
specific OT -1 cells) when co -injected with the model peptide antigen, Ova (Fulton et al, 
AACR 2016).

 These ex vivo  and in vivo  data demonstrate that Imprime PGG treatment prompts a shift from 
an immunosuppressive microenvironment typi[INVESTIGATOR_401103] M2 macrophages, MDSCs and 
immature dendritic cells , to an immune microenvironment characterized by M1 
macrophages, differentiated MDSCs , and mature, activated dendritic cells. These data 
therefore suggest that Imprime PGG may enhance antigen presentation and cross -talk with T 
cells, thereby [CONTACT_401127] -tumor efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy (eg , PD-1 
or PD-L1 antibodies). Indeed, in multiple preclinical tumor models in syngeneic, 
immunocompetent mice, Imprime PGG enhances the efficacy of both anti -PD-1 and anti -PD-
L1 antibody therapy. For instance, in the MC -38 tumor model, Imprime PGG treatment 
significantly expanded the percentage of mice remaining tumor -free from 33% (6/18) in mice 
treated with PD-L1 antibody alone, to 83% (14/17) in mice treated with Imprime PGG and 
PD-L1 antibody. Importantly, when re -challenged with MC -[ADDRESS_505778] the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy and further enhance immunologic memory 
(Fraser et al., AACR 2016 A and B).  
Collectively, these studies demonstrate that Imprime PGG acts as a PAMP to enlist the broad 
functionality of the innate immune system to enhance the anti -tumor efficacy of tumor -
targeting, anti -angiogenic , and immune checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies. Imprime 
PGG activates anti -cancer innate immune effector functions by [CONTACT_401128], overriding tumor -induced immunosuppression, and generating cross -
talk with the adaptive immune system via enhanced activation of the antigen presenting cells.  
In human serum, Imprime PGG forms an immune complex with anti -beta glucan antibodies 
(ABA), which activate the classical complement pathway, opsonizing the complex with 
complement. The opsonized Imprime PGG -ABA complex binds to Fc γRIIa and complement 
receptor 3 (CR3), leading to subsequent modulation of innate immune effector cell functions  
(eg, IL-8 production) (Bose et al, Aug 2013; Q iu et al, 2014; Antonysamy et al, 2014; 
Keystone 2015). The formation of these immune complexes is necessary for Imprime  PGG -
induced innate effector cell function. Immune cells from human subjects with insufficient 
ABA do not respond to Imprime PGG unless supplemented with exogenous ABA. 
Responsiveness to Imprime  PGG -based immunotherapy is predicated on ABA levels in 
individual subjects. Accordingly, pre -treatment ABA levels may represent a plausible, 
minimally invasive biomarker to enrich for patients most likely to benefit from Imprime  
PGG -based immunotherapy (Chan et al, 2016) .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Imprime PGG in Cancer Patients  
To date, Biothera has collected data from 5 cancer studies in which Imprime PGG has been 
administered in combination with anti -tumor monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Three of these 
clinical studies have been completed  with study reports, 1 has been completed and is 
awaiting a final study report , and 1 has completed the treatment phase and is in the process of 
closing . 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Imprime PGG Completed Studies  
▪ Study BT -CL-PGG -CRC0713 [CRC0713] evaluated administration of Imprime PGG 
in combination with cetuximab (Erbitux®), with and without standard irinotecan 
therapy, in subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The primary objective 
of this study was to determine safety and maximum tolerated dose of Imprime PGG; 
key secondary objectives were to determine tumor response rates (including complete 
response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], and progressive disease 
[PD]), overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), time to progression 
(TTP), and duration of tumor response; and to establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
profile in this setting. Subjects were enrolled into dose -escalating cohorts and dosed 
with either 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg Imprime PGG and a standard regimen of cetuximab either 
with concomitant irinotecan (Arm 1; 10 subjects) or without concomitant irinotecan 
(Arm 2; 22 subjects). Under a separate protocol, BT -CL-PGG -CRC0814 (CRC0814), 
tumor tissue samples from consenting subjects in this study were collected for KRAS 
gene status analysis. Complete safety and efficacy results of this study are 
summarized in Section 5  of the Imprime PGG Investigators Brochure . The results 
from the CRC0713 study (and associated CRC0814 protocol) formed the basis for the 
design of a Phase 3 study in KRAS  wild type (WT) mCRC subjects that has 
completed the treatment phase (CRC1031 also known as PRIMUS).  
 
▪ Study BT -CL-PGG -CRC0821 [CRC0821] assessed 4 mg/kg Imprime PGG with a 
standard regimen of cetuximab in the treatment of subjects with Stage IV, KRAS -
mutated mCRC. The primary endpoint was ORR and key secondary endpoints 
included DCR, duration of response (DoR), TTP, PFS and OS. This study enrolled 18 
subjects who had failed previous oxaliplatin and irinotecan -containing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Results from the 18 subjects enrolled in Stage 1 show that 1 (5.6%) subject had a PR, 
and SD was observed in 9 (50.0%) additional subjects (of these 9 subjects SD was 
confirmed in 3 and unconfirmed in 6 subjects), yielding a DCR of 55.6% (10 total 
subjects with a response of SD or better). The DoR was 4.[ADDRESS_505781] 
with a PR, while the median duration of SD for the total 9 subjects with SD was 2.8 
months (range: 0.4 – 7.2 months). In total, 13 (72.2%) subjects had documented

2011, Bremnes 2011, Talmadge 2011, Shirabe 2010, Nosho 2010, Bellati 2009, Oble 2009, 
Uppalari 2008, Dunn 2007) . In particular, the presence of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T cells seem to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long -term survival in many solid tumors  (Nosho 2010, Chang 2014, Preston 2013, Yoon 
2012, Kim 2013, Mathai 2012, Liu 2011, Kirk 2010) . 
The PD -[ADDRESS_505788] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548]  (Pedoeem 2014) . The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface 
of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive 
immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an 
Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4, which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2). 
The structures of murine PD -1 alone (Zhang 2004)  and in complex with its ligands were first 
resolved  (Lazar -Molnar 2208, Lin 2008) , and more recently the NMR -based structure of the 
human PD -1 extracellular region and analyses of its interactions with its ligands were also 
reported  (Cheng 2013) . PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins 
containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a 
cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic 
tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
inhibition motif (ITIM) , and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  
Following T cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to 
the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector 
molecules, such as CD3 zeta, PKCθ and ZAP70, which are involved in the CD3 T cell 
signaling cascade  (Sheppard 2004) . The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_505789] from that of CTLA -4 (Ott 2013) . PD-1 was shown to be 
expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, T 
regs and Natural Killer cells  (Yao 2014) . Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4 -CD8 - (double negative) T cells  (Nishimura 1996) , as well as subsets of 
macrophages (Huang 2009)  and dendritic cells  (Pena -Cruz 2010) . The ligands for PD -1 (PD -
L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types  (Keir 
2008) . PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, most notably 
on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments  (Karim 
2009) . Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like 
domains in the extracellular region and short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling 
motifs. Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T cell activation triggered through the 
T cell receptor.  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T cell activation in lymphoid organs, 
whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell function in peripheral tissues. Although 
healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstrated to 
express abundant levels of this T cell inhibitor  (Karim 2009, Taube 2012) , which, via its 
interaction with the PD -1 receptor on tumor -specific T cells, plays a critical role in immune 
evasion by [CONTACT_15198]  (Sammamed 2014) . As a consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer  (Topalian 2012) .

 4.2.2 Pembrolizumab Background and Clinical Trials  
Pembrolizumab [KEYTRUDA® (US)], a humanized monoclonal antibody against the 
programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1) protein, has been developed by [CONTACT_44873] & Co for the 
treatment of patients with cancer. Pembrolizumab is approved for treatment of patients with 
melanoma in several countries; in the US and EU it is approved for the treatment of patients 
with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults. Pembrolizumab has also 
been approved for treatment of patients with NSCLC in several countries; the US and the 
European Commission have indicated it for either first-line treatment of patients with 
metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by [CONTACT_13247] -approved test , or 
for those patients with metastatic NSCLC  whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by [CONTACT_108076] -approved test  and who have disease progression on or after platinum -containing 
chemotherapy.  Patients  with NSCLC and EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should 
also have disease progression on FDA -approved therapy for these aberrations prior to 
receiving pembrolizumab.  In the [LOCATION_002], p embrolizumab was granted accelerated 
approval for the treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma 
of the head and neck with disease progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherapy , 
and for patients locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who are not eligible for 
cisplatin -containing chemotherapy . Pembrolizumb has also been approved for the treatment 
of Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma , for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma who have disease progression during or following platinum -containing 
chemotherapy or within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum -
containing chemotherapy , and for colorectal cancer patients with a microsatellite instability -
high ( MSI -H) or a mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) biomarker following progression on a 
fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan . Pembrolizumab is administered once every 3 
weeks (Q3W ), and can be administered for up to [ADDRESS_505791] cancer , and Hodgkin’s Lymphoma as determined 
by [CONTACT_30530]. Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted in these tumor types as well as a 
number of other advanced solid tumor indications and hematologic malignancies. For study

 Pembrolizumab has also demonstrated clinical activity  in subjects with metastatic TNBC. 
Study KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_505794] were heavily 
pretreated, in both the early and advanced settings (47% of subjects having received at least 3 
lines of therapy for metastatic disease and 25% at least 5). In the 27 subjects who were 
evaluable for response, ORR was 18.5%, including 1 CR. Stable disease and progressive 
disease were reported in approximately 26% and 48% of subjects, respectively. The median 
time to response (TTR) was 18 weeks, and the median PFS was 1.9 mo nths. The median 
duration of SD was 17 weeks, while median OS was 11.2 months (Nanda et al., 2016).   
Study KEYNOTE -086 Cohort A  enrolled a total of 170 subjects with centrally confirmed 
metastatic TNBC,  1 prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, ECOG performance status 
of 0 or 1 , and had pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 24 months. The median 
age was 54 years an d 44% of subjects received at least 3 lines of therapy for metastatic 
disease. The ORR was 5%  regardless of PD -L1 expression . Best overall response was 0.6% 
CR, 4% PR, and 21% SD. Median DOR was 6.3 mo nths (range 1.2+ to 10.3+) . Median PFS 
and OS were 2.0 mo ths (95% CI 1.9 -2.0) and 8.9 mo nths (95% CI 7.2 -11.2) respectively 
(Adams  et al., 201 7). 
Though  in KEYNOTE -012, 18.5%  of the subjects with PD -L1+ TNBC experienced an 
objective response, further data from the Phase 2 KEYNOTE -086 study showed the ORR 
was approximately  5% regardless of PD -L1 expression. T hese data highlight the need for 
further improvements in pembrolizumab -based combination  immunotherapy .   
Preclinical studies have now shown that Imprime PGG significantly enhances the anti -tumor 
efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy in multiple, syngeneic (immune -competent) tumor 
models. This synergy likely reflects the mechanism of action for Imprime PGG - specifically, 
Imprime PGG -induced immune microenvironmental activation as well as the activation and 
maturation of professional antigen -presenting cells (dendritic cells). This synergy, and the 
mechanistic complementarity of pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG, provide compelling 
rationale for testing this combination clinically.  
Importantly, recent research has now revealed that Imprime PGG forms an immune complex 
with naturally occurring  anti-β-glucan  antibodies (ABA)  and that this complex is necessary 
for Imprime induced immune activation and anti -tumor immune effects (Chan et al, 2016). 
Furthermore, evidence from Imprime PG G clinical trials suggests that IgG  pretreatment ABA  
levels in peripheral blood may act as a predictive biomarker of clinical activity of Imprime 
PGG (company data on file).  In line with this evidence, subjects  enrolled in this study will 
be required to have pre -specified ABA levels in peripheral blood.  
In this study, subjects with advanced melanoma or TNBC failing front line treatment with 
CPI (melanoma) or chemotherapy (TNBC), will receive combination therapy with 
pembrolizumab and Imprime PGG with the purpose of assessing whether a further response 
(melanoma) or an increased response (TNBC) can be obtained by [CONTACT_401131]. An ORR of 2 3% in melanoma subject s and of 21% in TNBC subject s would 
be considered clinically significant and relevant findings in these patient populations .

 4.3.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification   
The dose of 4 mg/kg of Imprime PGG administered IV over 2 hours is based on the results of 
the normal volunteer and oncology clinical studies in over 400 human subjects, including 
over 300 cancer subjects in combination with diverse monoclonal antibodies. A description 
of these studies and the study results is presented in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Additional details may be found in the Imprime PGG Investigators Brochure . 
The dose of 2 mg/kg of Imprime PGG administered IV over 2 hours is based on the results of 
the normal volunteer and oncology clinical studies BIOBG -CL-001, BIOBG -CL-002, BT -
CL-PGG -SCM0611, and BT -CL-PGG -CRC0713 in approximately 47 human subjects, 
including cancer subjects. A description of these studies and the study results is presented in 
the Imprime PGG Investigators Brochure . 
The dose of pembrolizumab planned to be studied in this trial is 200 mg Q3W.  The dose 
recently approved in the [LOCATION_002] and several other countries for treatment of melanoma 
subjects is 2 mg/kg Q3W. Information on the rationale for selecting 200  mg Q3W is 
summarized below.  
KEYNOTE -001 was an open -label Phase 1 study conducted to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD), and anti -tumor activity of 
pembrolizumab when administered as monotherapy.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated 3 dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
and dose expansion cohorts evaluated 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.  All dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities 
were observed.  This first -in-human study of pembrolizumab showed evidence of target 
engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels.  No maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.  In addition, 2 randomized cohort evaluations of 
melanoma subjects receiving pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W 
have been completed, and 1 randomized cohort evaluating 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg 
Q2W has also been completed.  The clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of 
important differences in efficacy or safety profile across doses.  
An integrated body of evidence suggests that 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) is expected to 
provide similar response to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W , and 10 mg/kg Q2W.  Previously, 
a flat pembrolizumab exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safety has been found 
in subjects with melanoma in the range of doses between 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. Exposures 
for 200 mg Q3W are expected to lie within this range and will be close to those obtained with 
2 mg/kg Q3W dose.    
A population PK model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other patient 
covariates on exposure, has been developed.  The PK profile of pembrolizumab is consistent 
with that of other humanized monoclonal antibodies, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a low clearance 
and a limited volume of distribution.  The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed 
dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose and 
importantly will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range established

 in melanoma as associated with maximal clinical response.  Pharmacokinetic properties of 
pembrolizumab, and specifically the weight -dependency in clearance and volume of 
distribution are consistent with no meaningful advantage to weight -based dosing relative to 
fixed dosing.     
In translating to other tumor indications, similarly flat exposure -response relationships for 
efficacy and safety as observed in subjects with melanoma can be expected, as the anti -tumor 
effect of pembrolizumab is driven through immune system activation rather than through a 
direct interaction with tumor cells, rendering it independent of the specific tumor type.   In 
addition, available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other tumor types 
support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at tested doses among 
tumor types.  Thus the [ADDRESS_505797] 
200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose for pembrolizumab.  
4.3.3 Rationale for Endpoints  
The primary and secondary endpoints selected will allow for assessment of whether a further 
response (melanoma) or an increased response (TNBC) can be obtained by [CONTACT_401132]. An ORR of 2 3% in the melanoma subjects and of 21% in the TNBC  
subjects  would be considered clinically significant and relevant finding s in these patient  
population s.   
This clinical study will also explore a number of translational research parameters and 
biomarkers germane to Imprime PGG and to the mechanisms of anti -tumor immunity.  
Specifically, evidence of myeloid cell activation at the tumor site , in peripheral blood 
(increase in CD86, PD -L1), in dendritic cell activation , and increased tumor lymphocyte 
infiltration (especially CD8+ T cells) in tumor biopsies will be measured. Their correlation 
with the observed clinical outcomes and their value at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_401105]. It is expected that these cellular, immunological and biochemical 
parameters will inform on the factors at play in the response to therapy with pembrolizumab 
plus Imprime PGG, and help design and manage future studies of th is combination .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker Research  
Mechanistically,  Imprime acts as pathogen -associated molecular pattern (PAMP) directly 
activatin g innate immune effector cells and triggering a coordinated anti -cancer immune 
response. In ex vivo  systems, using whole blood from healthy human subjects, Imprime - 
induced anti -cancer functionality is dependent on immune complex formation with naturally - 
occurring, anti -β glucan antibodies (ABA). The formation of Imprime:ABA complexes 
activates complement, primarily via the classical complement pathway, and is opsonized by 
[CONTACT_401135]3b. Immune complex binding depends upon Complement Receptor [ADDRESS_505801]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab   23

 monocytes, enabling these effector cells to kill antibody -opsonized tumor cells via the  
generation of reactive oxygen species and antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis. 
Importantly, these innate immune cell changes are not evident in subjects with low ABA 
levels but could be rescued with exogenous ABA supplementation. Thus, pre-existing ABA 
are essential for Imprime -mediated anti -cancer immune activation  (Chan et al, manuscript in 
preparation). These findings have also been corroborated in healthy subjects dosed in vivo  
with Imprime (ongoing findings from Study BT -CL-PGG -HHV1516).  
 
Analysis from a Biothera -sponsored randomized clinical study in colorectal cancer subjects 
in N=168  subjects  (CRC1031 also known as PRIMUS)  established a correlation between IgG 
ABA level and increased PFS and OS only in subjects treated with Imprime PGG. 
Exploration of ABA IgG cutoffs indicate that hazard ratios ( HRs) for both PFS and OS are 
more favorable when ABA IgG > 20 mcg/mL. A similar relationship of this ABA IgG cutoff 
to OS was observed in study BT -CL-PGG -LCA0822 [LCA0822] which assessed Imprime 
PGG in combination with cetuximab and a standard regimen of carboplatin and paclitaxel 
therapy in first -line treatment of late stage (Stage IIIB or IV) NSCLC. In this study, ABA 
IgG levels > 23.4 mcg/mL  showed an increased OS (HR=0.58, CI 0.3 -1.13, p=0.105 ). 
Finally, in studies of healthy human volunteers dosed with Imprime  PGG , the biological 
activities associated with Imprime  PGG  (complement activation, white blood cell 
mobilization, and cytokine production) were never observed in volunteers that had ABA IgG 
levels < 20 mcg/mL, whereas most of these activities were evident in volunteers with ABA 
IgG levels > 20 mcg/mL.   
Based on the above findings, only those subjects with serum IgG ABA levels ≥ 20 mcg/mL 
will be selected for treatment in this protocol. Analysis of ABA IgG levels in all cancer 
patients in trials where Imprime PGG has been dosed reveals an overall median ABA IgG 
level of 18.2 mcg/mL (ranging between median values of 14.3 -23.0 mcg/mL depending on 
the trial). This indicates that at an ABA IgG value of 20 mcg/mL, the population will be 
approximately equally split by [CONTACT_401136]. Thus, for considerations of 
enrollment, it is expected that using a n ABA IgG cutoff of 20 mcg/mL should include 
approximately 50% of subjects. Biothera has developed a technical -qualified manual, direct 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure IgG ABA serum concentrations . 
The assay is in the process of being transferred to a College of American Pathologists (CAP) - 
accredited, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) -environment  laboratory .

 5.2 Trial Treatments  
5.2.1 Dose Selection/Modification  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Selection  
Please refer to Section 4.2.2 . 
If Stage 1 proceeds without the need for any dose modification as described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 , Imprime PGG will be administered to all subjects at a dose of 4 mg/kg IV over a 2 -
hour infusion time period on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 of each 3 -week cycle. Refer to 
Appendix 14.1  for further details.  
If enrollment into an additional cohort in Stage 1 is necessitated based on the dose 
modification requirements as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 , Imprime PGG will be 
administered to all subjects in the specified indication at a dose of 2 mg/kg IV over a [ADDRESS_505825], followed 15 -30 minutes later only on Day 1 
of each cycle by [CONTACT_199946].  
The pembrolizumab fixed dose of 200 mg will be administered IV over 30 minutes on Day 1 
of each 3 -week treatment.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Imprime PGG  
Each cycle will be 3 weeks in duration . The dose of Imprime PGG may be delayed or 
reduced as described below, due to the occurrence of infusion reactions or other adverse 
events.  
 
Per CTCAE guidelines, mild -to-moderate reactions (Grades 1 and 2) are characterized by 
[CONTACT_288881], rash, fever, rigors, chills, dyspnea, nausea, back pain, and mild hypotension. Severe 
reactions (Grades 3 and 4) are associated with bronchospasm and hypotension requiring 
treatment, cardiac dysfunction, anaphylaxis, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and other symptoms.  The 
preferred order for actions the Investigator may take to ameliorate infusion reactions are 
listed below:  
 
1. Premedication (s) 
Subjects may receive pre -treatment with standard anti -histamine medications before 
commencing dosing of study medications on each treatment day and, as needed, 
post-dose.  
 
Premedications:  
▪ Cycle 1/Day 1: Pretreat with an H1 antagonist (eg, 50 mg of diphenhydramine IV)

 ▪ Subsequent cycles: Premedication is allowed for each Imprime PGG infusion, but 
if tolerated by [CONTACT_401139] , reduced premedication 
doses from those administered at Cycle 1/Day 1 should be used  
2. Infusion Time  Extension  
The infusion time should be lengthened from 2 hours to 4 hours and the infusion flow 
rate should be adjusted accordingly to 50% of the previous rate.  
3. Dose Reduction  
If a subject experiences a n infusion reaction despi[INVESTIGATOR_401108] , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_401109] -challenge 
the subject at the next visit by [CONTACT_401140] 2 mg/kg.  
All attempts should be made to ameliorate Grade 3/4 infusion reactions by [CONTACT_401141] 3 recommendations provided above sequentially.  
In Stage 1,  any Grade 3/4 infusion reactions mitigated by [CONTACT_401142] 1/2, if this mitigation occurs within Cycle 1 and the Grade 3/4 
infusion reaction does not recur in Cycle 2, will not be counted towards the total of > 4 or 
33% of Grade 3/4 adverse events which requir e halting the study in Stage 1 for each 
individual indication.  Only Cycle 1 Grade 3/4 infusion reactions (or those which recur in 
Cycle 2) will be counted towards th e total which would halt advancement to Stage 2 . 
▪ In the event there are a total of > 4 or 33% of Grade 3/4 adverse events in Stage 1 
which were unable to be ameliorated by [CONTACT_401143], the 
dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 mg/kg.  
▪ Stage 1 will be repeated with an additional cohort of n=12 subjects at the reduced 
dose of 2 mg/kg. Toxicity at the dose of 2 mg/kg will be assessed in this additional 
Stage 1 cohort in the same manner as was done for the initial dose of 4 mg/kg, with 
the identical sequential recommendations for any observed infusion reactions.  
▪ Advancement to Stage 2 will be halted if there are > 4 or 33% of Grade 3/4 adverse 
reactions. Otherwise , subjects will proceed to Stage 2 with all subjects at the new, 
reduced dose of 2 mg/kg.

Adverse events (both non-serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology. These immune -related adverse events (irAEs) may occur 
shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment 
and may affect more than one body system simultaneously . Therefore, early recognition and 
initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical trial data, 
most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids , and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure 
adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or 
tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of the 
evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue 
pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management 
guidelines for irAEs associated wi th pembrolizumab are provided  as per Table [ADDRESS_505830]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab   31

 Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial. If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination 
specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may 
be required. The Investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor.  
The final decision on any supportive therapy  or vaccination rests with the I nvestigator and/or 
the subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy 
or vaccination schedule requir es the mutual agreement of the Investigator, the Sponsor, and 
the subjec t. 
Other than Imprime PGG or pembrolizumab, any medication administered to the subject 
during any portion of the study after study treatment is initiated on Cycle 1/Day [ADDRESS_505845] be documented in the electronic Case Report 
Form (eCRF). This includes all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, 
and IV medications and fluids . 
Medications administered during the Screening period should be recorded as prior 
medications on the eCRF.  
5.6.[ADDRESS_505846] concomitant medications, including pretreatment with anti -emetics, anti -diarrheals, and 
anti-histamines are permitted and may be administered at the Investigator’s discretion.  
 
5.6.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
The Sponsor or designee should be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of  
any instances in which prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_23730]. Continued participation of the 
subject will be at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
 
Medications or vaccinations contraindicated for use in combination with pembrolizumab 
include those listed in the exclusion criteria should not be administered. If there is a clinical 
indication for a medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required. The Investigator should 
discuss any questions regarding this with the local Clinical Monitor.  
 
Following is a list of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401112]:  
 
▪ Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
▪ Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
▪ Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
▪ Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  or Imprime PGG  
▪ Radiation therapy  
Note:   Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be 
considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with 
Sponsor. The subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated

 field. Administration of palliative radiation therapy will be considered 
clinical progression for the purposes of determining PFS.  
▪ Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_505848] dose of trial treatment and while 
participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the 
following: M easles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and 
typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed 
virus vaccines and are allowed. However, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg , Flu - 
Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.  
▪ Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology. The use of physiologic 
doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor.  
Note:   Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma  
 
In addition, no additional investigational agents are to be administered during the study. In 
the event a subject develops neutropenia, GCSF administration is allowed (to be 
administered per ASCO guidelines and/or the site’s standard of care).  
 
Subjects who have received palliative radiotherapy for pain will be assessed during the data 
analysis phase to determine if their data may be assessed with that of other subjects, or if 
their data should be truncated at the time of receiving the radiotherapy with data extrapolated 
for all remaining visits as the response assessment may be affected.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401113] -Treatment , however any such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401114].  
5.6.3 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Imprime PGG supportive care guidelines should follow the ASCO Clinical Practic e 
Guidelines.  
 
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as de emed necessary by [CONTACT_401146] I nvestigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse 
events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below , along with the dose 
modification guidelines presented earlier in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 in Table 1 . Where appropriate, 
these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well 
as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of 
corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms 
may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made 
to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are i ntended to be applied when 
the Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note:  If after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related  to pembrolizumab , the 
Investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] .[ADDRESS_505849]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab   38

 It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as p art of evaluation of the event.  
See Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2  for treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion 
reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab.  
 
5.7 Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
5.7.[ADDRESS_505851] azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical 
condition).  
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they:  
(1) Are p ostmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -
menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.)  
OR  
(2) H ave had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_38197]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks prior to screening  
OR  
(3) Have a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant 
or impregnating a partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_505852] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_139649]:   
(1) P ractice abstinence† from heterosexual activity;  
OR  
(2) U se (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual 
activity.

Acceptable methods of contraception are  the following‡: 
▪ Single method ( 1 of the following is acceptable):  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
▪ Combination method (requires use of 2 of the following):  
• Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermicide)  
• Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• Contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_401115] -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or 
subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole method of 
contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s preferred and usual 
lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_176742]/IRBs.  
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation 
methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, 
then it does not qualify as an acceptable method of contraception for subjects 
participating at sites in this country/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to 
the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in 
the study , subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the 
initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_505854]’s status until the pregnancy has 
been completed or terminated.  
 
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within [ADDRESS_505855]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab   40

 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (eg, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, 
or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study 
Investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor . 
 
5.7.[ADDRESS_505857] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
5.8.1 Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily withdraw 
at any time without prejudice to future care. The Investigator will provide a written report 
describing the reason for discontinuation. If a subject discontinues study drug, every effort 
should be made to complete the assessments scheduled to occur during the Post -Treatment 
Visit and survival follow -up period. The subject will continue to be followed until 
completion of the study . 
 
A subject may discontinue study drug for the following medical or administrative reasons:  
 
▪ Adverse event: If a subject suffers an AE that in the judgment of the Investigator, 
presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject, the subject may be 
discontinued from study drug  
▪ Progressive Disease per irRECIST  (see Section 7.3.2 ) 
▪ Subject decision: A subject may voluntarily discontinue from study drug at any time  
▪ Intercurrent illness: A subject may discontinue study drug if, in the judgment of the 
Investigator, the subject develops an intercurrent illness or complication that is not 
consistent with the protocol requirements or that, in any way, justifies withdrawal 
from the study drugs, or that requires treatment with a restricted medication.  
▪ Ineligibility to protocol entry criteria determined  
▪ Lost to follow -up 
▪ Administrative discontinuation: After consultation between the Investigator, the 
medical monitor, or the Sponsor when appropriate, a subject may be discontinued 
from study drug for the following administrative reasons:  
• Noncompliance (all occurrences of noncompliance must be documented on the 
appropriate eCRFs)

 • Failure to receive study drug per protocol as defined in Section  5.2 Trial 
Treatments  
• Failure to comply with protocol requirements  
• Refusal of study drug administration (with reason documented)  
In all cases, when subjects discontinue study drug, reasonable efforts should be made to 
monitor the subject for AEs and to complete follow -up assessments  following such 
discontinuation. These efforts should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. The subject 
will continue to be followed for survival for the duration of the study.  
 
If a subject withdraws consent for follow -up of survival, this must be documented, and no 
further efforts at contact [CONTACT_45536].  
5.8.[ADDRESS_505859] 2 treatments with 
study medications beyond the date when the initial CR was declared. Subjects who then 
experience radiographic disease progression may be eligible for up to 1 year of additional 
treatment with Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab at the discretion of the Investigator if:  
• No cancer treatment was administered since the last dose of pembrolizumab  
• The subject meets the safety parameters listed in the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria  
• The trial is open   
Subjects will resume therapy at the same dose and schedule at the time of initial 
discontinuation. Response or progression in this resumed course of therapy will not count 
towards the ORR of the primary endpoint in this trial.

5.10 Clinical Criteria for Early Trial Termination  
If the Sponsor, Investigator, medical or safety monitor, or appropriate regulatory officials 
discover conditions arising during the study that indicate the study should be halted or the 
study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation 
among the Sponsor, Investigator, regulatory, and medical and safety monitors.  
 
Conditions that may warrant early termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
 
▪ The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to enrolled subjects

 disease progression or death or study termination or 2 years or until any of the criteria for 
study drug discontinuation are met (whichever occurs first).  
 
See Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_505879] v1.1 (see Appendix 14. 5) 
(http://www.eortc.be/Recist/documents/RECISTGuidelines.pdf ) and clinical criteria 
(Eisenhauer et al, 2009). Disease progression will be defined as per RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_505880] v1.1 criteria should be performed at baseline and then at 
6-week intervals beginning at Week 6. Immune -related response criteria (irR ECIST ) (see 
Appendix 14.6 ) may be used for clinical management of subjects , but will not be used for OR 
evaluation  (other than as an exploratory endpoint) . Therefore RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_505881] 1.1 will be used with the following adaptations:  
If radiologic imaging verifies initial PD, tumor assessment should be repeated ≥  4 weeks 
later in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment per the conditions stated 
below , while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.   
If repeat imaging shows < 20% or < 5 mm absolute increase in tumor burden compared to 
nadir, stable or improved previous new lesion (if identified as cause for initial PD), and 
stable/improved non -target disease (if identified as cause for initial PD), treatment may be 
continued / resumed.   
If repeat imaging confirms PD due to any of the scenarios list ed below, subjects will be 
discontinued from study treatment *.   
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased, the Investigator 
should consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions.  
Scenarios where PD is confirmed at repeat imaging:  
▪ Tumor burden remains ≥ 20% and at least [ADDRESS_505882]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab  50

MK3475 PN -545 / Amendment [ADDRESS_505883] 2017   
Confidential – Biothera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 ▪ Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)  
▪ New lesion resulting in initial PD is worse (qualitative)  
▪ Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation  
 
In subjects who have initial evidence of radiological PD, it is at the discretion of the subject 
and the Investigator whether to continue a subject on study treatment until repeat imaging is 
obtained : 
 
▪ The subject must re -consent to the study, in order to continue receiving study medication 
in light of the radiological evidence of PD.  
▪ The Investigator’s clinical judgment decision regarding the subject continuing should be 
based on the subject’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical 
symptoms, and laboratory data.  
 
Subjects may receive study treatment while waiting for confirmation of PD if they have re -
consented and are clinically stable as defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
 
▪ Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression  
▪ No decline in ECOG performance status  
▪ Absence of rapid progression of disease  
▪ Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) 
requiring urgent alternative medical intervention  
When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until PD has been c onfirmed. This 
allowance to continue treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_401116] a transient tumor flare in the first few months after 
the start of immunotherapy, but with subsequent disease response. Subjects that are deemed 
clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for confirmation of progressive 
disease.   
*Note : If PD is confirmed but the subject is experiencing an extraordinary clinical benefit, 
contact [CONTACT_401149] . 
 
All RECIST assessments (v1.[ADDRESS_505884] ) will be evaluated against the initial lesion  
measurement values from the baseline computed tomography ( CT) scan or magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI ) obtained prior to the initiation of study treatment. Either CT or 
MRI is acceptable, but the same method must be used throughout the study for any individual 
subject. If MRIs are used, they must include images of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 7.3.[ADDRESS_505886] (preferred). MRI should only be used when CT 
is contraindicated or for imaging in the brain, but the same imaging technique should be used 
in a subject throughout the trial. A CT scan is the more commonly used modality and is 
preferred for the majority of subjects . An MRI can be utilized if clinically appropriate.   
Imaging should include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
For TNBC subjects, b one scans will also be utilized to assess osseous metastases.  
Additionally, X -ray evaluation will be obtained for symptomatic sites with negative bone 
scan evaluations.  The sponsor should be notified of any supplemental imaging done to 
support a positive or negative bone scan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Initial Tumor Imaging  
Initial tumor imaging at S creening must be performed within [ADDRESS_505887] v1.1. 
Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as initial 
tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 28 days prior to the 
start of study treatment  and viewed by [CONTACT_737].    
[IP_ADDRESS]  On Study  Tumor Imaging  
The first on study imaging assessment should be performed 6 weeks ( ±7 days) from the date 
of first dose of trial treatment. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 6 
weeks (±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. Imaging should not be delayed for 
delays in cycle starts or extension of study medication c ycle intervals.   
Per RECIST v1.1, partial or complete response should be confirmed by a repeat tumor 
imaging assessment not less than [ADDRESS_505888] indication of response, or at the next scheduled scan (ie 6 weeks later), 
whichever is clinically indicated.   
Continue to perform imaging until whichever of the following occurs first:  
▪ Disease progression  
▪ The start of new anti -cancer treatment  
▪ Withdrawal of consent  
▪ Death  
▪ End of the study

An additional 3 tumor biopsy samples , preferably obtained from the same localized region, 
are highly desirable when feasible and are as follows:  
 
2. Sample before the first dose of study  treatment (which will also be used for PD -L1 
biomarker analysis)  
3. Sample after Cycle 2 is completed but before initiation of Cycle 3 dosing  (which will 
also be used for PD -L1 biomarker analysis)  
4. Sample either at the time of response or at the End of Study Visit (if no response ). 
Note that for Sample [ADDRESS_505891] be met:  
 
▪ The tumor tissue sample for PD-L1 biomarker analysis should be from a newly 
obtained core or excisional biopsy. Repeat samples may be required if adequate tissue 
is not provided. If submitting unstained cut slides, freshly cut slides should be 
submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from when the slides are cut . 
▪ Submission of formalin -fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue sample blocks are 
preferred; if submitting unstained slides, the slides should be freshly cut and 
submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from site slide sectioning date, 
otherwise a new specimen will be requested.      
 
7.3.6 Physical Examination and Measurement of Vital Signs

 7.3.7 Performance Status  
Performance status will be measured using the ECOG performance status scale (see 
Appendix 14.3). It is recommended, whenever that the subject be assessed by [CONTACT_73478].  
Performance status will be assessed at Screening, on Day 1 of every 3 -week treatment cycle 
before study drug is administered, at the End of Study visit, and at the 30 -Day S afety Follow -
up (S FU) visit.  
7.3.8 Clinical Safety Assessments  
The NCI CTC -AE version 4.03 will be used to evaluate the clinical safety of the treatment in 
this study. Subjects will be assessed for AEs at each clinical visit and as necessary 
throughout the study.  
 
7.3.9 Planned DNA and RNA Analysis   
Understanding genetic determinants of drug response is an important endeavor during  
medical research. This research will evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical trial 
population correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation 
is found to predict efficacy or adverse events, the data might inform optimal use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_401117]. This research contributes to understanding genetic determinants of 
efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study.  
In addition to studying variation across the human genome,  RNA expression profiles may be 
investigated .

8.0 ADVERSE EVENTS (SERIOUS AND  NON -SERIOUS)  
8.1 Non-serious Adverse Events  
8.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event and Non -serious Adverse Event  
The following definition of adverse event will be used for the study:  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
 
This definition includes any abnormalities or anomalies that were not seen at baseline or 
which worsened during the course of the study, if present at baseline. Disease progression, 
and events caused by [CONTACT_388834], will be considered an efficacy endpoint and should 
not be reported as an AE, even if the event results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Therefore p rogression 
of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event.  
 
A “non -serious” AE is any event that does not meet the definition of “serious  adverse event” 
(SAE) as presented in Section 8.2  below.  
 
8.1.2 Reporting and Treating Non -serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to perform regular assessments for AEs. Subjects 
will be regularly queried about the occurrence of any AEs and will be monitored throughout 
the study for reactions to study drug and/or study procedures. The Investigator and clinical 
staff will record all AEs, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_303406], at anytime

 during a subject’s participation in the study. All events occurring prior to the first dosing will 
be recorded on the Medical History eCRF , except a n SAE  leading to exclusion from the trial 
or as a result of a protocol -specified intervention as described in Section 8.2.2, will be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF . All AEs occurring at any time after the initiation of the 
first dose of study drug up to [ADDRESS_505907] dose of study drug will be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF. Adverse events will be recorded according to  the CTCAE v4.03  
(Appendix 14.4 ). Adverse events meeting the definition of SAE require additional reporting 
as described in the following section.  
 
All subjects experiencing an AE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_401150]/or at an 
acceptable level. Unless the event requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (SAE), medical treatment will be 
provided to the subjects at the unit, and treatment medication and/or medical procedures will 
preferably  be provided under the guidance of the treating -Investigator’s clinical discretion. 
All AEs, including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, will be followed until 
resolution. Serious adverse events require special reporting in addition to documentation in 
the eCRF as described in  the section on Serious Adverse Events.  
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide his/her assessment of the relationship of the 
event to the study drug and the severity of the event using the following scales:  
▪ Relationship  
• No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules 
out a causal relationship and another cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
complications, etc.) is suspected  
• Yes – The time course between the administration of study drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the AE is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complic ations, etc.) can be 
identified  
▪ Severity  
The severity of all AEs should be graded according to the CTCAE v4.0 3. These criteria 
can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . For those AEs not listed in the 
CTCAE, the following grading system should be employed:  
▪ Mild (CTCAE Grade 1): Transient symptoms, awareness of sign/symptom, but 
easily tolerated and no interference with subject’s daily activities  
▪ Moderate (CTCAE Grade 2): Marked signs/symptoms that interfere with 
subject’s usual activities, but still acceptable  
▪ Severe (CTCAE Grade 3): Incapacitating signs/symptoms which cause 
considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable

 ▪ Life-threatening (CTCAE Grade 4): Life -threatening of disabling adverse event  
▪ Death (CTCAE Grade 5):  Death -related adverse event. See CTCAE Guidelines 
for assigning Grade 5.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
8.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
The following definition of SAE applies for the study:  
 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
▪ Death 
▪ Life-threatening AE  
▪ Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
▪ Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
▪ Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. A life -threatening AE is any AE that places the subject or 
subjects, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred (eg, it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
 
In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, although 
not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs 
in order to meet certain local requirements . 
Therefore, the  following events are considered serious by [CONTACT_401151] : 
▪ Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)  
▪ Is associated with an overdose  
 
8.2.2 Reporting and Treating Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that is serious (SAE) requires additional detailed reports and follow -up. The content 
of these detailed reports must address the Investigator’s estimate of causality and must 
provide the information specified in the SAE Report Form and International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, in so far as is possible.

9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary  
Key elements of the statistical analysis plan are summarized below.  
 
9.1.1 Hypothesis and Study Design  
The study design is based on hypothesis testing of the ORR for pembrolizumab + Imprime 
PGG. For melanoma subjects, the null hypothesis is ORR ≤ 5%, versus the al ternative 
hypothesis of ORR ≥ 23 %; for the TNBC subjects, the null hypothesis is ORR ≤ 5% 
(ORR= 5% in KEYNOTE -086), and the alternative hypothesis is ORR ≥ 21%. Hypotheses 
testing will be conducted using a one -sided type I error of 0.05.  
     
The study will incorporate Simon’s optimal 2 -stage design with sample size fixed at 12 
subjects in Stage 1  (for melanoma, Simon’s optimal 2 -stage design ha s 12 subjects at Stage 
1; for TNBC, a modified Simon’s 2 -stage design with the sample size fixed at 12 at Stage 1 
is used) . The safety criterion  of ≤ 4 (or ≤ 33%) subjects with Grade 3/[ADDRESS_505920] be met in order to proceed to Stage 2. The starting 
dose is 4 mg/kg for Imprime PGG. In the event there are a total of > 4 (or > 33%) of subjects 
with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1, the dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 
mg/kg, and Stage 1 will be repeated at a dose of 2 mg/kg with an additional cohort of n=[ADDRESS_505921]:   Imprime PGG and Pembrolizumab  63

 melanoma subjects and [ADDRESS_505923] 4 objective responses among the total of up to 29 subjects  with 
melanoma and 5 objective responses among the total of up to 41 subjects  with TNBC .  
 
The above design s correspond to a type I error 0.05 and power of 90% for both melanoma 
and TNBC.  The PASS 14 Power Analysis and Sample Size S ystem statistical software was 
used for the study design calculation.  
 
9.1.2 Sample Size  
The planned sample size for melanoma is up to 41  subjects with up to 24 subjects for Stage 1 
and 17 subjects for Stage 2; the planned sample size for TNBC is up to [ADDRESS_505924] 1 
objective response in melanoma subjects would be needed to proceed to Stage 2 for 
melanoma; and at least [ADDRESS_505925] 4 objective responses among the total of 29 
evaluable subjects with melanoma and /or at least  5 objective responses among the total of 41 
evaluable subjects with TNBC, the null hypothesis will be rejected for melanoma and/or 
TNBC and the study will be declared a success .  
 
The point estimate along with the exact 95% confidence interval will be computed for ORR 
and CRR. PFS and OS will be summarized descriptively and graphically using the Kaplan -
Meier method. The Kaplan -Meier estimate for the median, first , and third quartile s will be 
determined along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The Brookmeyer -Crowley method 
will be used for the CI calculations. For the subset of subjects  who have a CR or PR, TTR 
and Do R will be summarized similarly using the Kaplan -Meier method. The Kaplan -Meier

The dosing schedule is presented in Table 6.[ADDRESS_505936] -dose.  
 
Premedications:  
• Cycle 1/Day 1: Pretreat with an H1 antagonist (eg, 50 mg of diphenhydramine IV).  
• Subsequent cycles: Premedication is allowed for each Imprime PGG infusion, but if 
tolerated by [CONTACT_423], reduced premedication doses from those administered at 
Cycle 1/Day 1 should be used.  
10.5 Preparation and Dosing Instructions for Imprime PGG  
Refer to Appendix 14.1 for complete instructions on the preparation and administration of 
Imprime PGG.  
 
Imprime PGG is to be administered via IV infusion through a low protein binding 0.22 -
micrometer in -line filter; an infusion pump should be used to assure accurate and consistent 
dosing. Imprime PGG should not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. Table 6 
below on Target Imprime PGG Administration Values  describes recommended  
concentration, dilution volume, and administration time. Dependent upon actual total body 
weight  on Cycle 1/Day 1 , the concentration of the final diluted solution and the rate of 
infusion may be outside of the values in  Table 6, but should not exceed 0.8 mg/mL or 4.2 
ml/min respectively . Site standard guidelines should be utilized for any re -calculations of

continue  treating the  subjec t per the protocol until PD is confirmed at least [ADDRESS_505987] per the Investigator , then the subjects may 
continue on treatment and follow the regular imaging schedule intervals until PD is 
confirmed at a later timepoint  by [CONTACT_737] .  
o NOTE : If a subject has confirmed radiographic progression (ie , [ADDRESS_505988] 4 
weeks apart demonstrating PD) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a 
clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden 
at the confirmatory tumor imaging, an exception to continue treatment may be 
considered following consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if treatment is 
continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following the intervals 
as outlined in Section 6. 1 Schedule of Assessments - Study Flow  Chart. 
▪ Any subject deemed clinically unstable  should be discontinued from study treatment at 
first radiologic evidence of PD , and is not required to have repeat imaging for PD 
confirmation.  
▪ In subjects who discontinue study treatment  without documented PD, every effort should 
be made to continue monitoring disease status by [CONTACT_401172] (every 6 weeks ± 7 days), until (1) the start of new anti -
cancer treatment, (2) PD, (3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

Introduction  
 
You have been asked to participate in a research study. In order to decide whether you agree to 
be part of this research study, you should read this informed consent, which  describes how the 
study will be done and the possible risks and benefits.  
 
Please take your time to make your decision about taking part. You may discuss your decision 
with your friends and family or your healthcare team. If you have any questions, you can ask 
your study doctor for more explanation.  
 
If you agree to take part in this study,  you will be asked to sign this form. You will be given a 
copy to keep. If you do not sign this form, you cannot take part in this study.  
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have either:  
 
▪ Metastatic Triple -Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) and you have gotten worse after 
treatment with chemotherapy  
 
or 
 
▪ Advanced (unresectable [cannot be removed surgically] Stage III or Stage IV) melanoma 
and you have gotten worse after treatment with a type of medication called a “checkpoint 
inhibitor”  
 
Why is this study being done?

The purpose of this study is to find out good and/or bad effects of the investigational drug, 
Imprime PGG, when given together with pembrolizumab which is also known as “Keytruda®” (a 
type of “checkpoint inhibitor”) in the treatment of your type of cancer. An investigational drug is 
one that is not approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA). Imprime 
PGG is a glucan. Glucans are molecules that are not normally present in your body. Imprime 
PGG when given with pembrolizumab may help the immune system to fight your type of cancer. 
Pembrolizumab is already approved by [CONTACT_401173], but not for TNBC . The combination of these drugs used in this 
study is also investigational.  
 
Biothera is the sponsor supporting this study and is responsible for the manufacturing of 
Imprime PGG.  
 
Pembrolizumab is manufactured by [CONTACT_44873].  
 
The term “study drug” or “study medication” will be used throughout this document to refer to 
both Imprime PGG and pembrolizumab.  
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
 
The goal of the research study is for up to 9 4 people (up to [ADDRESS_505989] TNBC) to participate throughout the [LOCATION_002].  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
Before you begin the study  
 
You will have the following exams, tests, or procedures to find out if you can be in the study - 
this is called the screening period. These exams, tests, or procedures may be part of your 
regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. If you have had some of 
them recently (within days before the start of the treatment on this study), they may or may not 
need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. These screening tests and procedures 
include the following:  
 
▪ You will be asked to sign this consent form before any screening tests can be performed.  
▪ If you are a female who is able to have children, a urine or blood pregnancy test will be 
done.  You will not be allowed to enter the study if you are pregnant, or if you are breast -
feeding.  
▪ You will be asked about your past and present medical history including information about 
you, and medications (prescription, over the counter, and herbal) you are currently taking or 
have recently taken and the reason that you took them.  
▪ Your performance status will be done which is a general assessment (questions) of how 
your cancer is affecting your daily life, and how well you can carry out daily activities.  
▪ A physical examination including measurement of your vital signs (heart rate, breathing rate, 
blood pressure), weight, and height will be done.  
▪ Blood samples (approximately 18 mL or about 3 and a half teaspoons) and a urine sample 
will be collected for routine tests.  
▪ A screening blood sample (5 ml or 1 teaspoon) will also be collected to see if certain 
antibodies and proteins are present in your blood prior to your participation in the research

05 October 2017  study; if you have previously been pre -screened with this blood test, you will not need to 
repeat it. Additional blood samples (5 ml or 1 teaspoon) will be collected during the study to 
see the effects of the study drug on your body.  
▪ An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be done to check the rhythm (tracing of the electrical 
activity) of your heart . 
▪ A computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast (you will be injected with a dye prior to the 
procedure to make the organs and tissues that are being scanned more visible) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are required within 
[ADDRESS_505990] or MRI only needs to be performed if it hasn’t been done 
within the required time period. If your study doctor believes your cancer has spread to your 
bones, you may be asked to have a bone scan. A bone scan is a diagnostic procedure used 
to evaluate abnormalities involving bones and joints.  
▪ The pathology report describing your cancer upon initial diagnosis, and if available, a 
section of your archived cancer biopsy (which was taken from you in the past when you 
were first diagnosed with cancer), will be provided to the study researchers.  
 
During the Study  
 
Everyone in this study will get the same treatment of Imprime PGG in combination with 
pembrolizumab.  
 
If the exams, tests, and procedures completed for the screening period show that you can be in 
the study, the study doctor feels it is safe for you to do so, and you choose to take part, you will 
be receiving Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab.  
 
Treatment will occur in 3 -week cycles.  
 
Each cycle begins immediately after the end of the previous cycle so treatment continues 
without any gaps in the cycles for as long as you are receiving study drug.  
 
Imprime PGG and pembrolizumab are both given through a needle in a vein as an intravenous 
(IV) line or through a previously surgically inserted venous access line, also known as a Port or 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_67688].  
 
You may receive medications before receiving the study medications, and these medications 
are called “pre -treatment”. This pre -treatment is given to help your body tolerate the study 
medications better, and help to decrease the chance of an allergic type reaction. An anti -
histamine drug (for example, Benadryl or equivalent) or other drugs which your doctor feels may 
help you will be given before administration of the study drug. You will then receive the Imprime 
PGG over a 2 -4 hour period depending on your weight. After the Imprime PGG administration is 
completed, you will wait 15 -30 minutes, (a rest period) and then receive the pembrolizumab 
over approximately 30 minutes.  
 
You will need to be in the clinic for about 3 hours for each visit for all but 2 visits.  
 
During 2 visits (Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycle 3) when extra blood samples will be drawn 
for a pharmacokinetic (“PK”) analysis, you will need to stay in the clinic about 6 hours total. This 
includes your treatment time and 3 hour wait period to draw the PK blood work.

Version 1. 5   
05 October 2017  To find out how you are doing, the following tests and procedures will be d one while you are on 
the study:  
 
Tumor Biopsies  
 
You will be asked if you are willing to undergo three  procedure s to provide the study 
researchers with biopsy sample s of your cancer tumor. You need not agree to having th ese 
procedure s done, but it will be very helpful to the study researchers in order to better 
understand how to help other people with your same disease. Even if you agree at the start of 
the study to undergo th ese procedure s, you are free to change your mind for any reason and 
decline, without any negative consequences to you from your doctor or any of the research 
staff.  
 
If any written documents or reports about the sample are also sent with your biopsy sample(s), 
your name [CONTACT_401183].  
 
The biopsies will be collected at the following timepoints:  
 
1. Before Beginning Day 1 of Week 1 (First Cycle)  
2. After Finishing Cycle 2 But Before Beginning Day 1 of Cycle 3  
3. At Time of Response or End of Study Visit (just one of these times)  
 
 
I agree to these  optional biops ies 
 
I do not agree to th ese optional biops ies 
 
 
Day 1 (All Cycles)  
 
▪ A general assessment performance status (questions) of how your cancer is affecting 
your daily life and how well you can carry out daily activities will be done . 
▪ Your weight (which is important to determine your correct dose of study medication) will 
be measured.  
▪ You will be asked about your health, and any adverse events (any symptoms good or 
bad that you felt during the week after you received the study medications that are new 
or different for you than you normally feel) and any new medications or changes to 
medications you have taken.  
▪ Blood samples will be collected for both routine tests and study -specific tests, unless 
these tests were performed less than 3 days prior to Day 1. The results of your blood 
tests will be reviewed by [CONTACT_401174]. Therefore, 
this may require a separate visit each week for the blood draw prior to your treatment 
day, which can be scheduled up to 3 days prior to your treatment day, in order to allow 
for testing and processing of the blood sample.  
▪ The maximum amount of blood taken on any one day will be on the first day of the study 
when 84 mL (or about 17 teaspoons) will be collected (this includes PK samples listed 
below). On all other first days of subsequent cycles, the amount will vary from 3 mL (a 
little over half a teaspoon) to 54 mL (about 11 teaspoons). The site staff have been given 
a chart showing exactly how much blood will be collected for which tests at every visit.

Version 1. 5   
05 October 2017  ▪ Part of the blood sample collected will include 20 mL (about 4 teaspoons) to see if 
certain antibodies and proteins are present in your blood and to see the effects of the 
study drug on your body.  
▪ You will receive Imprime PGG first and then pembrolizumab.  
 
Day 8 and Day 15 (All Cycles)  
 
• You will receive an infusion of Imprime PGG.  
• You will be asked about your health, and any adverse events (any symptoms good or 
bad that you felt during the week after you received the study medications that are 
different from you normally feel) and any new medications or changes to medications 
you have taken.  
 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 Only (Week 1 and Week 7)  
 
▪ Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures 
the amount of study drug that is circulating in the blood. You will spend additional time in 
the clinic for the study staff to collect the blood samples after the study drug 
administration. A total of [ADDRESS_505991] study drug infusion. A total of 20 mL (about 4 
teaspoons) will be taken for this PK testing.  
 
Every Other Cycle (Every 6 Weeks)  
 
▪ In addition to the blood samples discussed earlier, a CT scan with contrast, or MRI scan 
of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis, will be done. If necessary, a bone scan will be 
done.  
 
These tests and procedures may be part of regular cancer care. However, these tests and 
procedures may be done more often because you are in this study or because your study doctor 
feels it is necessary.  
 
End of Treatment Visit  
 
Within [ADDRESS_505992] dose of study 
medication, the following tests and procedures will be performed:  
 
▪ A general assessment performance status (questions) of how your cancer is affecting 
your daily life and how well you can carry out daily activities will be done . 
▪ A physical examination will be done and your weight will be measured.  
▪ You will be asked about your health, and any adverse events (any symptoms good or 
bad that you felt during the week after you received the study medications that are new 
or different for you than you normally feel) and any new medications or changes to 
medications you have taken.  
▪ A voluntary procedure to provide the study researchers with a biopsy sample of your 
cancer tumor, as discussed in detail earlier.  
▪ Blood samples for routine tests and study -specific test totaling about 39 mL (about 8 
teaspoons).

▪ Blood samples for routine tests and study -specific test totaling 23 mL (a little over 
4.5 teaspoons).  
 
Follow -up After Completion of the Post -treatment Visit  
 
The study staff will call you every [ADDRESS_505994] patient who enrolled in this study took his/her first dose of 
study medication.  
 
How long will I be in the study?  
 
You will receive Imprime PGG + pembrolizumab in 3-week cycles. The [ADDRESS_505995].  
 
Sometimes with checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, your cancer may temporarily get 
worse (or show signs of progression) because the drug is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_401120]. This is sometimes called an “immune response”. If your doctor thinks this is happening to 
you, he/she will discuss with you the option to stay on the same study treatment you are on and 
check the size and number of your tumor(s) within about [ADDRESS_505996] scan. Your doctor will then review your 
results with you and if your cancer is improving, you will remain on the study. But if your cancer 
stays the same or has become even worse, your participation in the study will end.

After the last study visit in the office, study staff will call you every [ADDRESS_505998] patient’s first dose of study medication, and the study staff will ask 
about any additional cancer treatment you have received.  
 
If you stop receiving study medication because you have achieved a Complete Response, and 
then your cancer recurs, you may be able to go back onto the study medication as long as the 
study is still ongoing.  
 
It is possible that your study doctor or the sponsor will decide to end your participation in the study 
without your consent for any reason. Reasons for doing so include the following:  
 
▪ If your study doctor does not think it is best for you to continue  
▪ If your condition gets worse  
▪ If you have serious side effects  
▪ If you develop a serious illness, even if it is not related to your taking part in the study  
▪ New information becomes available that shows this study in not the best option for you  
▪ If you become pregnant, or you are nursing during this study  
▪ If the entire study is discontinued  
▪ If you are unable or are unwilling to follow the instructions for taking part in the study  
▪ If you no longer meet the requirements for the study  
 
Biothera, the FDA, an Institutional Review Board (IRB), an Ethics Committee, or other 
regulatory agencies may decide to stop the study before the study is done and without warning. 
If this happens to you, your study doctor will assist you with the plans for your continued care as 
appropriate.  
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
 
You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched 
for side effects. However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects 
may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side 
effects. Side effects may go away soon after you stop taking Imprime PGG and/or 
pembrolizumab. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  
There is also a risk of death. You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that 
you have while taking part in the study.

Imprime PGG has been studied in patients with advanced cancer. The patients in these studies 
were also taking several other medications (eg antibodies, chemotherapy) to treat the cancer, in 
combination with Imprime PGG. The side effects seen in these studies have been similar to the 
side effects expected to be seen in patients that take these other medications (eg antibodies, 
chemotherapy).  
 
In previous studies with another drug substance (Betafectin®) that contained the same active 
ingredient (PGG Beta Glucan) as Imprime PGG, other observed side effects included 
inflammation of the joints and eyes, permanent liver damage, fever, and dilation of blood 
vessels were observed. The side effects of Imprime PGG may be similar to those seen with 
Betafectin®.

▪ Inflammation of the brain with confusion and fever. This may also include: disorientation, 
memory problems, seizures (fits), changes in personality and behavior, difficulty 
speaking, weakness or loss of movement in some parts of your body, and loss of 
consciousness  
 
In addition to the above, if you have had  an allogeneic stem cell transplant (a procedure in 
which a person receives blood -forming stem cells from a donor), you may experience  graft 
versus host disease (GvHD), which may include diarrhea, skin rashes, and liver damage, after 
receiving pembrolizumab . Sometimes this condition can lead to death . 
 
Patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with pembrolizumab in combination with either 
pomalidomide or lenalidomide (drugs related to thalidomide which affect the body’s immune 
system) and dexamethasone (a steroid) had an increased number of serious side effects and 
deaths as compared to patients who received only dexamethasone and either pomalidomide or 
lenalidomide.  
 
To date, there have been no studies conducted using a combination of Imprime PGG and 
pembrolizumab. Therefore, it is not known what types of side effects might be observed or 
which you might experience with this combination.  
 
Due to the unknown effects of the study medication, you should be aware that the consumption 
of alcohol or the taking of any drugs or medication (with or without prescription or illegal ones), 
other than the study medications, at any time during the study without the consent of the study 
doctor or site staff might cause serious or even life -threatening reactions. Both new and current 
drugs can have unknown side effects, some of which might be serious.  
 
0.9% Normal Saline (Sodium Chloride):  
 
Infusion of normal saline can result in infusion site swelling, tenderness, redness, or infiltration 
(normal saline leaking into the tissue around the vein). More serious side effects may include 
increased heart rate, fever, rash, joint pain or shortness of breath.  
 
Diphenhydramine (Antihistamine):  
 
Diphenhydramine is used to treat symptoms of allergies such as runny nose, sneezing and itchy 
eyes, nose or throat. It is also used as a sleep aid or to decrease motion sickness. More 
common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth (nose and throat), dizziness, nausea, 
headache, tightening of the chest and loss of appetite. More serious side effects may include 
change in vision, decrease or trouble urinating or trouble breathing.  
 
Infusion Site Reaction:  
 
It is possible to have what is called an infusion site reaction following an intravenous (IV) 
infusion (medication given through a needle in a vein). Symptoms of an infusion site reaction 
may include, pain, redness, burning sensation, and itching sensation. You may experience 
inflammation or infection at the infusion site. If you experience any of these report it to the clinic 
staff. The infusion site will be monitored throughout the study.

Version 1. 5   
05 October 2017  Allergic Reaction:  
 
It is possible to have what is called an allergic (or hypersensitivity) reaction during or soon after 
the administration of any investigational or non -investigational medicine. Some subjects have 
experienced difficulty breathing, wheezing, hives or swelling around the vein where the needle 
was placed, face, mouth, lips, gums, tongue, or neck. If you have any allergies that you are 
aware of, you should tell the study doctor before agreeing to take part in this study. Since 
Imprime PGG is investigational when taken alone or in combination with other medications, 
there may be other risks that are unknown.  
 
All drugs have a potential risk of an allergic reaction, which if not treated promptly, could 
become life threatening. If you experience any such symptoms, you should get medical help 
and contact [CONTACT_401175].  
 
Risks and possible discomforts you might experience from the study procedures 
include:  
 
Blood draws:  Temporary discomfort from the needle in your arm, bruising, bleeding, and 
swelling at the needle insertion site or vein [phlebitis], and infection. Standard medical care will 
be taken to avoid these complications.  
 
ECG:  The risks from an ECG can include skin irritation and a rash from the gel that is used or 
from wearing or removing the patches.  
 
CT Scan Risks: In this study, you will be exposed to some radiation from the CT scans. The 
amount of radiation you will get is like the amount from other x -ray exams routinely used in 
medicine.   Public policy is to keep exposure levels as low as possible.  
 
Contrast dye may be used, which has a small possibility of a severe allergic reaction and kidney 
problems.  
 
MRI Scan risk:  You may have risks from MRI if you have metallic objects in your body. You 
may also become anxious from lying in a tight space without moving . 
 
Other Risks:  
 
Since Imprime PGG is investigational, there may be other risks that are unknown. For your own 
safety and for the safety of other subjects in the study, you must inform the study doctor or 
study staff about any side effects or other health problems you experience during the study. 
Other medicines or supplements could cause side effects if you use them while you are 
receiving Imprime PGG. Because of this, you must tell the study doctor or a member of the 
study staff about all of your past and present illnesses and allergies. You must also tell them 
about all drugs, vitamins, supplements, and medicines you are taking.  
 
It is important that you report all symptoms and side effects that you experience as soon as they 
occur, whether or not you think they are caused by [CONTACT_5257]. The phone numbers for the 
study team are on the first page of this document.

05 October 2017  REPRODUCTION RISKS  
 
Pregnancy Related Risks / Use of Birth Control Females  
 
The effects of Imprime PGG on pregnancy, an unborn baby, or a nursing child are not known. If 
you are currently pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding a child, you 
should not take part in this study.  
 
All females who are able to get pregnant and males whose partners are able to get pregnant 
and who are sexually active are required to use an acceptable form of contraception (birth 
control) during the study and continue contraception for [ADDRESS_506005] dose of study 
drug. Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in 
a failure rate of less than 1% when used consistently and correctly. The study doctor will instruct 
you in correct use of your selected birth control method and review with you at each visit your 
responsibility to use your selected birth control method consistently and correctly.  
 
The following are highly effective methods of acceptable birth control:  
 
▪ Abstinence (refraining from intercourse for the required study period)  
▪ Correctly placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD).  
▪ Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
▪ Male sterilization of subject or female subjects’ partner with confirmed absence of sperm 
in the post -vasectomy ejaculate.  
▪ Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_74029] 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).  
 
Use of 2 of the following:  
 
▪ Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)  
▪ Cervical cap with spermicide  
▪ Contraceptive sponge  
▪ Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
▪ Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_64870] -only 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or subcutaneous (under the 
skin) contraceptive injection  
 
Discuss any other forms of birth control with your study doctor to see if they are acceptable.  
 
Birth control methods, even when used consistently and correctly, are not perfect. If you 
become pregnant or want to stop your required birth control while you are in the study, you 
should tell the study doctor immediately. You will be withdrawn from the study if you discontinue 
birth control or you become pregnant.  
 
Males  
 
The effects of Imprime PGG on sperm or a pregnancy are not known. If you are planning to 
father a child you should not join this study. If you and your partner are physically able to have 
children and you are sexually active, you must use an acceptable form of the birth control from 
the methods listed above consistently and correctly beginning with the first infusion of the study 
drug and at least [ADDRESS_506006] injection of the study drug. The study doctor will discuss 
Biothera - BT-CL-PGG -MEL/BCA -1621 /  
MK3475 PN -545/Amendment [ADDRESS_506007] infusion of the 
study drug, please tell the study doctor immediately. Please also tell the doctor who will be 
taking care of you during the pregnancy that you took part in this study. The study doctor will 
ask if you or your pregnancy doctor are willing to provide updates on the progress of the 
pregnancy and its outcome. If you agree, this information will be provided to the study sponsor 
for safety monitoring follow -up. 
 
What if New Information Becomes Available?  
 
The study doctor will tell you in a timely manner of any information learned during the course of 
the study that might cause you to change your mind about taking part in the study. You may 
contact [CONTACT_401176].  
 
As with any new substance, new and/or previously unknown side effects may also occur with 
the use of Imprime PGG.  
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study?  
 
Taking part in this study may or may not help your cancer. The information learned from this 
study may help doctors learn more about  the combination of Imprime PGG and pembrolizumab  
as a treatment for people with cancer such as yours. This information could help future cancer 
patients.  
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
 
Your other choices may include:  
 
▪ Getting treatment or care for your cancer with a different cancer drug without being in a 
study  
o If you have advanced melanoma, the following is a list of other medication options 
available to you (in alphabetical order):  
▪ Aldesleukin for metastatic melanoma  
▪ Cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib for BRAF -mutated unresectable 
or metastatic melanoma (BRAF is a protein which is involved in sending 
signals in cells and cell growth, and a mutation in BRAF can increase the 
growth and spread of cancer cells)  
▪ Dabrafenib for BRAF -mutated unresectable or metastatic melanoma  
▪ Dacarbazine for metastatic melanoma  
▪ Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_401122] - BT-CL-PGG -MEL/BCA -1621 /

About Using Tissue and Blood Specimens for Research  
 
You have had a biopsy (or surgery) of your cancer tumor(s) in the past to see if you have 
cancer. Your doctor removed some body tissue to do some pathology tests (tests and 
examination of your cancer tissue under a microscope). The results of these tests (the 
pathology report) confirmed that you have cancer. You will need to provide permission for this 
pathology tissue to be further examined for use this study.  
 
You will need to provide permission for your pathology tissue sample to be sent to a central 
testing facility for this study. It may be tested for biomarkers (a substance that can be measured 
which is indicative of your disease). Additional biomarkers may be evaluated as new information 
becomes available from research studies. These results will become part of the study record. All 
possible measures will be used to protect your privacy and confidentiality, such as the use of a 
study number specific to you in place of your name [CONTACT_401185]. Any unused tumor tissue 
samples will be returned to your study doctor [ADDRESS_506010]. You will need to provide permission for these samples to be collected.

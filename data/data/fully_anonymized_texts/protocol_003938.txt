Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Miller, Craig  
2 Research Strategy  RESEARCH STRATEGY  (a) Significance   Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common condition affecting up to 10% of the population and characterized by [CONTACT_592405], drainage, facial pain, and hyposmia or anosmia. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_592376], including antibiotics, topi[INVESTIGATOR_592377]. In persistent or recalcitrant cases, surgical treatment may be required. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a commonly performed procedure for patients with CRS. The technique uses a minimally invasive approach to open the sinus cavities and allow for clearance of mucous and infection through widening of the natural ostia of the sinuses. The procedure itself is quite safe and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_592378]. FESS is becoming more and more common with current estimates of 250,[ADDRESS_781367]-operative analgesia reflects the opi[INVESTIGATOR_592379]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_592380]. The majority of these deaths (60%) occur in patients receiving prescriptions based on current prescribing guidelines by [CONTACT_592406].[ADDRESS_781368]-operative ibuprofen administration on pain.  By [CONTACT_592407][INVESTIGATOR_27251], and the ability to decrease that need with addition of other analgesics, we can work to decrease current opi[INVESTIGATOR_592381].

[ADDRESS_781369]-FESS is unknown, thus appropriate sample size estimate calculations cannot be performed. Therefore, we plan on performing this study as a cohort study. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_592382]; first it will allow us to determine the adequate sample size needed to observe a significant effect. Additionally, we will be able to document patient’s willingness to participate in a future randomized study thus allowing for design and execution of the optimal prospective, randomized study.    (b) Innovation    To our knowledge, there has not been a prospective study in CRS patients following endoscopic sinus surgery that examines the use over the counter NSAIDs, namely ibuprofen, in the post-operative period. One previous study has shown that perioperative IV ketorolac improves immediate post-operative pain scores and does not increase epi[INVESTIGATOR_592383].[ADDRESS_781370] us two opportunities; first, we will be able to perform a power analysis for our future randomized control trial and second, we will be able to validate the previously used [ADDRESS_781371] importance. The efforts of this study will lay the foundation to help improve knowledge and understanding of non-narcotic analgesics in an effort to decrease patient use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_592384].   (c) Approach     This is a prospective cohort pi[INVESTIGATOR_592385]. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_592386], ibuprofen safety and ibuprofen analgesic impact to optimize the design of a future prospective, randomized study. Thus our specific aims are as follows:  Aim 1: Measure the number of narcotic pi[INVESTIGATOR_592387] 7 days following sinus surgery for CRS.  Hypothesis: there will be a wide range of narcotic usage among post-op patients with the mean usage being less than the amount typi[INVESTIGATOR_592388]-operatively.    
Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Miller, Craig  
[ADDRESS_781372] size for our outcome measures that will be needed for a power calculation for a future randomized trial.    Aim 2a: Determine impact of ibuprofen on post-operative sinus surgery patients’ pain level.  We will analyze patients with CRS that are set to undergo FESS in two cohorts (standard pain regimen and standard pain regimen plus ibuprofen) and assess postoperative pain at days 1, 3, and [ADDRESS_781373]-operatively taking narcotic medications. Hypothesis: Addition of ibuprofen will decrease post-operative pain and decrease the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173673].  Aim 2b: Determine impact of ibuprofen on post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_592389]. In the same cohorts as above, we will measure degree of post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_592390] a 10-cm visual analogue scale, as well as a [ADDRESS_781374] of ibuprofen on epi[INVESTIGATOR_592391] a previously used epi[INVESTIGATOR_592392]. Hypothesis: Addition of ibuprofen will not impact post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].    Aim 3 will seek to estimate the willingness of individuals to participate in a future randomized double-blinded placebo control trial.   Aim 3: During enrollment we will ask patients to self-select the study arm they would like to join (with or without ibuprofen) and document willingness to participate in a future study given the scenario that they would be randomized to the treatment by a “coin flip”. Hypothesis: greater than 50% of patients approached will be wiling to participate and will indicate willingness to be part of a similar randomized study.  Study Design: Prospective self-selected cohort pi[INVESTIGATOR_592393]: Rhinology Clinic (Drs. Davis and Humphreys) at the University of Washington Medical Center  Subject approach:   All eligible patients set to undergo sinus surgery will be screened and approached in clinic at the appointment where surgery consent is completed.  We will use the following criteria:  Inclusion Criteria: • Patients with CRS scheduled to undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery • >18 years old • Able to speak and comprehend written English  Exclusion criteria:  • Contraindication to NSAID use (CKD, PUD, Sampter’s triad, etc.) • Previous history of bleeding disorder • Sinus cancer • Cystic Fibrosis • History of chronic pain, fibromyalgia, or opi[INVESTIGATOR_592394]/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Miller, Craig  
5 Research Strategy • Excessive bleeding during the surgery as determined by [CONTACT_592408]-operative clinic visit to inquire about interest in participating in the clinical study. If willing to participate, patients will be asked whether they would be interested in taking ibuprofen post-operatively, as a scheduled medication, in addition to the standard pain regimen consisting of acetaminophen and oxycodone taken as needed. If patients are interested, they will be placed in the intervention group. If they are not interested in taking ibuprofen, but willing to participate in the study, they will be placed in the control group. If interested in participating, patients will be asked whether they would like to use REDcap, a mature, HIPAA secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases, versus paper journals to document their outcome measures. If they elect to use REDcap we will take their email address to allow for communication. If they elect to use paper journal, we will take their phone number to allow for reminder “courtesy” calls on post-operative days 1, 3, and 7.   All post-operative FESS patients are seen at two weeks after their surgery. We will collect their journal containing pain and epi[INVESTIGATOR_592395]. No further intervention or study will be done on these patients. In order to promote sufficient recording of daily VAS scores and other outcome measures we will provide patient remuneration with a $[ADDRESS_781375] size, as well as validate a previously used epi[INVESTIGATOR_592396]. We will plan to enroll 30 patients in each arm of the study.    Measurements  Descriptive characteristics will be gathered at the initial visit. • Demographics: age, gender, and race. • Contact [CONTACT_3031]: standard information to arrange interviews and post-operative phone calls, and dispense remuneration  • CT severity: will use the Lund-Mackay CT staging system to assess disease severity. • Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score (0-20): endoscopic appearance will be collected and scored • Additional predictors of CRS outcomes: nasal polyposis, asthma, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_79948], smoking, allergies, depression. • Functional Comorbidity Index: Previously validated in CRS as a tool for assessment of impact of comorbidities on CRS-associated quality of life Subjective and objective details of the individual’s sinus surgery: • Operative time • Estimated blood loss • Extent of sinus surgery performed • Surgical complications  Subjective and objective clinical measures will be evaluated during the post-operative period  • Patient reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]: Number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_592397] • 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale for pain and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]: recorded daily in diary. Will use assessments from post-operative days 1, 3, and 7

6 Research Strategy • 0-4 point epi[INVESTIGATOR_592392]: Previously used scoring system of 0-[ADDRESS_781376] 72 hours9  • Number of gauze changes on moustache dressing over the first 72 hours: Used as a subjective, clinically significant estimate of post-operative bleeding. If patient no longer required moustache dressing during this period, this will be recorded as zero (0).    Treatment Arms  This cohort study will allow patients to choose their treatment arm. If interested in taking ibuprofen post-operatively, the patient will be stratified into the experiment arm. This will consist of the standard pain regimen (acetaminophen 650 mg q4hr PRN and oxycodone 5mg q3hr PRN) with addition of ibuprofen 800 mg q8hr scheduled. If the individual is not interested in being prescribed ibuprofen, but is still willing to participate in the study, s/he will be stratified into the control arm with the standard pain regimen as described above.   Data Analysis  Data analysis will be performed using an unpaired t-test to compare our primary outcome measures of 10-cm visual analogue scales (VAS) for post-operative pain and epi[INVESTIGATOR_592398]-operative days 1, 3, and 7. For all other post-operative outcome measures, we will use t-tests to compare the two treatment arms. Based on our comparison of post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_592399], we will seek to perform validation of the 0-[ADDRESS_781377]-protected documents. Written diaries will be transcribed into excel files and kept in a locked file cabinet until manuscript submission. All protected health information will be protected under HIPAA protocol and Institutional IRB.   Limitations and Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]:  We acknowledge a number of limitations with our proposed study: First, this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_592400] a definitive outcome related to post-operative pain reduction and epi[INVESTIGATOR_592401]. The risk of severe post-operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_592402], due to the safety and low risk of ibuprofen, we will likely not observe a statistically relevant amount of epi[INVESTIGATOR_592403]. This will be helpful for determining adequate sample size in future studies. We also acknowledge the difficulty with expecting patients to record their outcome measures daily following surgery. We hope that by [CONTACT_592409], as well as reminder phone calls or emails on post-operative days 1, 3, and 7, we will have adequate recording to evaluate our aims. Finally, study recruitment will be a potential challenge. If, as the study progresses, it does not appear that we are meeting our expected target enrollment, we will consider opening up recruitment to additional sites of practice both within our institution and to surrounding rhinology practices.   Feasibility:   At our institution, we see a large number of patients with CRS and perform approximately 250 endoscopic sinus cases per year. Given this information, and the expectation that 75% of patients will be willing to participate in the study since they get to self-select their treatment arm, we expect this study to take 4-6 months to recruit 60 subjects (30 in each treatment arm).  
Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Miller, Craig  
[ADDRESS_781378] a stronger understanding of individual’s willingness to participate in a similarly designed RCT. At that point, we will be equipped to design and implement a well designed and appropriately powered randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled trial. We do acknowledge that the results of this study will be that of a single institution that does not pack the nose following ESS. A true randomized trial would want to look multi-institutionally with practitioners that utilize a variety of post-op regimens including nasal packing and non-packing.    1. Bhattacharyya N.

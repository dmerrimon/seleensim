A. SPECIFIC  AIMS:  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_357590],  there  are currently  no tools  for treatment  selection  in Major  
Depressive  Disorder  (MDD).  Referring  to a recent  Positron  Emission  Tomography  (PET)  study  
using  2-[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG),  NIMH  Director  [CONTACT_357620]  remarked  that PET imaging  is 
“on the cusp”  of aiding  in MDD  treatment  decisions.  To finally  realize  this goal,  the limitations  of 
previous  FDG  studies  must  be addressed,  including  limited  sample  size, lack of placebo  
comparison  (the placebo  effect  is a significant  obstacle  to evaluating  treatment  mechanism  and 
efficacy),  and use of relative  outcome  measures.  In the proposed  study,  FDG  imaging  before  
and after Selective  Serotonin  Reuptake  Inhibitor  (SSRI)  treatment  will be performed  using  a 
simultaneous  PET/Magnetic  Resonance  (MR)  scanner  and: (1) the largest  sample  size to date;  
(2) a placebo  group;  and (3) full quantification  using  analysis  of FDG  activity  in plasma,  which  
yields  more  accurate  estimates  of metabolism  than relative  activity.  
Aim 1:  Determine a Pretreatment Marker of SSRI Effectiveness Using PET. With the goal of  
reducing MDD burden, many studies have assessed the utility of FDG -PET in antidepressant  
treatment prediction. However, due to the limitations listed above, there is no consensus on  
which brain regions are predictive of treatment efficacy. In addition to serving as a biomarker of  
SSRI effectiveness, only conclusive determination of these regions will provide insight into  
depression pathophysiology, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_357591], and aiding in the  
search of novel therapeutics. Based on our preliminary data and other, similar studies, we  
hypothesize that SSRI -induced change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS) will  
be correlated with  pretreatment  metabo lic rate of  glucose  (MRGlu, quantified  using  arterial  
blood analysis) in three potential regions: (1) midbrain, (2) right anterior insula, and/or (3) left  
ventral  prefrontal  cortex.  
Aim 2:  Isolate the Neurobiological Basis of the “Loss” Research Domain Cri teria (RDoc) and the  
Change Associated with Treatment. Using a factor analysis of the HDRS, we have previously  
demonstrated that the “loss” RDoC criteria is significantly correlated to MRGlu in frontal cortical  
areas. We therefore hypothesize that change i n MRGlu (pre to post treatment) in these regions  
will be correlated with symptom improvement specifically in “loss” symptoms. As an exploratory  
extension, we will determine whether these changes are treatment -specific (i.e. to SSRI or  
placebo).  A validatio n of our hypothesis  suggests  a targeted  mechanism of  action,  and provides

Expi[INVESTIGATOR_268710]:  1/22/2021  
Stony Brook University Human Subjects Committee (IRB)  
[ADDRESS_446210] for precision treatment. If regional changes in MRGlu are not correlated 
to improvement in this RDoC category, it suggests that SSRI (or placebo) induced changes may 
be a downstream effect that should be examined further.  
Aim 3: Validate NonInvasive Full Quantification of MRGlu Using Simultaneous Estimation. Full 
quantification of brain MRGlu with FDG (as performed in this study) requires measuring FDG in 
arterial plasma (input function) from arterial catheter insertion and blood analysis. This costly and 
invasive procedure creates a barrier to widespread PET use. Our group has developed an 
innovative method for Simultaneous Estimation (SimE) of input information and PET outcome 
measures (e.g., MRGlu). SimE fully quantifies brain M RGlu without requiring an arterial catheter. 
In the case of FDG, our data suggests that SimE used with a single venous sample can provide 
accurate results. We further hypothesize that the venous sample may be entirely replaced by 
[CONTACT_357603] (e.g., injected  dose) and biometrics (e.g., body surface area, lean body mass index). 
Using two different approaches (statistical imputation and physiological parametric modeling) and 
previously collected data, we will train the SimE for accurate quantification in the ab sence of 
blood data. The rich data collected in this study will then provide a robust benchmark for 
validation of the SimE approach.  
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_357592], morbidity  and mortality of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) remain 
high. (Benton, Staab et al. 2007) According to the World Health Organization, MDD affects [ADDRESS_446211] widely used treatment for MDD.(Leuchter, Lesser et 
al. 2008) However, on average, SSRIs require six weeks for onset of action, and two -thirds of 
those on SSRIs fail to achieve remission.(Trivedi, Rush et al. 2006, Leuchter , Cook et al. 2010) 
Compounding this problem, patients with residual symptoms are significantly more likely to 
discontinue treatment or relapse, be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357593], or die of 
suicide and other causes.(Trivedi 2003, Trive di, Rush et al. 2006, Warden, Trivedi et al. 2007) 
Although eliminating ineffective treatment trials would significantly reduce patient suffering and 
healthcare costs, (Taylor, Youngblood et al. 2005, Leuchter, Cook et al. 2010) clinicians currently 
do not  have the tools to objectively select treatment based on an individual’s likelihood of 
remission. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify markers predictive of an individual’s 
SSRI treatment outcome (Taylor, Youngblood et al. 2005, Leuchter, Cook et  al. 2010). 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_357594], SSRI -induced biological changes, and the corresponding 
symptom improvements.  
 
Our proposed study, in which FDG -PET sc ans are acquired before and after escitalopram (or 
placebo) treatment, avoids these previous limitations by [CONTACT_357604], enrolling [ADDRESS_446212] 100 will complete the protocol (largest 
sample size to d ate), performing full quantification with arterial blood sampling, and a priori 
defining the clinical outcome measure as HRDS. Further, we will uncover neurobiological 
correlates of pathophysiology that span diagnoses.  
 
Potential Noninvasive Estimation: P ET research/clinical laboratories have differing levels of 
software and/or hardware expertise. The key, therefore, to promoting widespread PET use is to 
develop multiple, validated pathways for noninvasive imaging. In this study, we will evaluate 
Simultane ous Estimation.  
 
Simultaneous Estimation (SimE) Algorithm. Traditional FDG estimation approaches require 
measurement of both the arterial input function and PET brain signal to quantify MRGlu. In 
contrast, SimE takes advantage of the fact that each brain r egion shares the same input function. 
As such, SimE can quantify the input function and MRGlu at the same time using only the PET 
Approved: 2/6/2020  
Expi[INVESTIGATOR_268710]:  1/22/2021

3  
 brain tissue signal (from multiple brain regions) and one blood sample. This is possible under 
minimal assumptions, but requir es sophisticated data processing. SimE assumes a parametric 
model to describe the common input function, and incorporates this model’s free parameters 
together with the free parameters related to MRGlu into a cost function that is optimized during 
the esti mation process. SimE has been thoroughly tested on simulated data.  
 
Optimization strategy for SimE and Clustering. Compared to traditional analysis, SimE increases 
the number of free parameters that need to be estimated and therefore the computational 
comp lexity of the optimization. Standard non -linear regression techniques, such as those based 
on the Newton -Raphson algorithm, are not always suitable for this complex optimization. 
Currently, SimE is implemented with a robust optimization algorithm known as simulated 
annealing. This technique takes its name [CONTACT_357618] [CONTACT_357605] a high temperature and then cooling them slowly. The parameters identify the state of 
the system and the cost function to be minimized is the energy of the state. The algorithm travels 
iteratively through the parameters’ space by [CONTACT_357606] a new set of parameters at each 
step. At each step, the new set of parameters is accepted with a probability related to the 
decrease in the cost funct ion (energy) that is associated with the new state.  
 
The kinetic richness of the brain regions that are simultaneously estimated can greatly  
affect the simulated annealing performance. Including regions with similar kinetics only increases 
the cost function dimensionality, without adding useful information. With FDG, we have optimized 
the performance of SimE through the development of a data -driven voxel -based algorithm that 
automatically determines five subject -specific regions (via k -means clusteri ng of grey and white 
matter voxels) for use with the SimE approach.  
 
Simultaneous Estimation Anchor: SimE has been recognized as a promising approach for 
noninvasive PET, as it works for several tracers used in neuroreceptor studies . By [CONTACT_5071], 
however, Si mE does not obviate the need to draw blood during the scan. To ensure model 
identifiability, at least one blood sample must be taken and used as an individual. We hope to be 
able to eliminate this single blood draw, which would help reduce barriers to wide spread PET 
use.

* Subjects  will be eligible  if the injected  dose  and dosimetry  of the radiotracer  are known  and the 
cumulative  annual  exposure  of the previous  study  and this study  is lower  than the annual  limit for 
research  subjects  defined  by [CONTACT_1622] (see below).  
 
D. PROCEDURES  
 
Participants will have a PET/MRI prior to and following 8 weeks of SSRI treatment (escitalopram) 
or placebo. The initial PET/MRI will be completed after up to a [ADDRESS_446214] scan (and initiation of treatment).  Patients who are unable to tolerate this washout and 
drug-free period will be removed from the study. They will be monitored with the CGI during this 
period and have weekly con tact with the clinician during washout. After the washout, the rater will 
administer scales such as the MADRS, HDRS, and CGI.   
 
PET/MRI procedures will be performed utilizing the Siemens Biograph mMR -System located at 
the Ambulatory Care Pavilion. Partici pants will complete a metal screening form prior to the 
procedure to ensure there are no MRI contraindications (e.g., pacemaker, non -MR safe metal 
implants).  Participants will be given a list of guidelines before the day of the PET/MRI scan. A 
pregnancy t est will be performed on the day of the scan for female participants to confirm that 
pregnancy has not occurred.  
 
Preparation of the subject will include the placement of venous lines (for radiotracer injection and 
blood sampling), and an arterial line (fo r blood sampling only). At the time of injection, blood 
sampling will be initiated. 128 mL or less (about 4 ounces or 1/2 cup) will be collected during 
each scan. Approximately 8 ml of this will be drawn for assays of candidate gene expression and 
polymorp hisms. If the second IV or the arterial line cannot be placed for any reason, we will 
continue the scan without them using the Simultaneous Estimation Anchor for data analysis. (If 
the arterial line is not used in the baseline scan it will likely not be us ed in the follow -up scan for 
consistency.)

An MRI scan will be performed simultaneously. This will include various structural (e.g., T1 - and 
T2-weighted images, diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) and/or functional (e.g., pseudo -continuous 
arterial spin labe ling [pcASL]), pulse sequences. Psychological tasks will not be conducted while 
the subject is in the scanner. However, a resting state fMRI may be performed. Participants will 
be given a list of post arterial line instructions at the end of the scan.  
 
The PET/MRI procedure will take approximately [ADDRESS_446215] their leg in the scanner for a quick (<10 min) MRI acquisition. Following the initial 
PET/MRI, the study treatment visits will be weekly for 4 weeks and then biweekly for 4 -8 weeks 
(4 weeks for placebo subjects and 8 weeks for the escitalopram subjects). However, in the case 
that patients cannot make an appointment, the study team will accommodate the patients’ 
schedules. The nurse practitioner will be  seeing subjects in her office in the Health Sciences 
Center. In case of emergency, the nurse practitioner will escort the subject to CPEP. The target 
treatment duration will be 12 weeks, for those on SSRIs. (For this reason, the blind will be broken 
at we ek 8.) At each visit, the clinician will complete assessments such as the HDRS and CGI. 
(Participants who have not attained remission at Week 12, but have HDRS17 ≤ 10, will have 
another optional visit at week 14 to allow a participant close to remission an  opportunity to 
achieve it.)   Patients will be randomized to either: 10mg ESC for one week, 20mg for two weeks 
and 30mg thereafter or placebo. The subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_1714], keepi[INVESTIGATOR_357597]. This may be modified based on clinical judgment. After [ADDRESS_446216] another PET/MRI that will follow the same procedures as the 
first PET/MRI.  
 
For participants using substances (including nicotine, alcohol, prescribed medications, or other 
medication s), we will monitor the times/amounts of substance taken throughout the study by [CONTACT_6270] -
report. When possible, substance use will be halted two half -lives before the PET/MRI scan. 
When that is not possible or will significantly affect the comfort of the subj ect, baseline and post -
treatment PET/MRI scans will be scheduled at similar times relative to substance administration 
in order to minimize the effects of the substance.  
 
When possible, participants will also have follow -up visits at [ADDRESS_446217] a target of 8 weeks. 
(For this reason, all subjects will receive PET/MRI scanning at week 8.) Recent studies have 
indicated that response to placebo, if it has not occurred by [CONTACT_5875] 8, is unlikely to occur24, 25, 26. 
To provide an opportunity for placebo non -responders to receive active drug and to aid in 
recruitment, we will provide [ADDRESS_446218] received a PET/MRI prior 
to both their placebo and SSRI treatment. This 8 –[ADDRESS_446219] and similar data collection 
procedures. Frequency of visits may be determined at the clinician’s discretion. To standardize 
protocols, we continue  (or begin, in the case of those receive placebo) ESC treatment after the 
second PET/MRI. However, if the subject does not respond or worsens on ESC, we will change 
treatment as medically indicated.  
 
Cognitive Function: When possible, participants will com plete a battery of tasks (30 min) on the 
same days as the PET/MRI to measure cognitive functions relevant to mood symptoms and 
hippocampal structure and function, including measures of declarative memory, stimulus - 
response/reward learning and executive fu nction. As a function of the design of the trial, cognitive

[ADDRESS_446220] study subjects meet/speak to the same study coordinator 
and clinician  consistently. However, due to scheduling constraints, other trained personnel may 
meet with or contact [CONTACT_357611]. In addition, due to the 
complexity of the study, participants will be in contact [CONTACT_357612] (e.g., the MRI technician and back up technician, PET suite nurses and nuclear 
technicians).  All such personnel are trained for the function they perform in the study.  
 
Image Processing: After MRI and PET processing is perf ormed, the data will be processed using 
the semi -automated analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_357598]. MRI processing includes 
segmentation (grey, white, csf) and parcellation into different regions of interest. PET processing 
includes motion correction, coregis tration to the MRI, determination of regional activity over time 
(time activity curves) and modeling of the time activity curves. The modeling requires information 
about the radioactivity of plasma during the scan. These techniques have been previously 
described. (Parsey, Ogden et al. 2010, Miller, Hesselgrave et al. 2013) Using this analysis, the 
metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu) can be calculated. The arterial input function (as well as 
Simultaneous Estimation, for comparison) will be used to derive the r egional MRGlu.  
 
 
E. STATISTICS  
 
Aim 1: Correlation between HDRS and pretreatment MRglu will be determined in the ESC and 
placebo treatment groups in the three specified regions. In post hoc analysis, spatial resolution 
will be improved through examination of correlation between whole brain voxe l MRglu and HDRS 
using SPM8 on aligned voxel based parametric images. Our group has extensive experience 
performing these analyses. For both analyses, outcome possibilities include: differential 
treatment HDRS prediction (i.e. significant correlation, wit h different sign for placebo and ESC; 
significant correlation, within different regions, for placebo and ESC; significant correlation for one 
treatment only); HDRS prediction insensitive to treatment (i.e. significant correlation in same 
region, same dire ction); or insignificant correlation with HDRS for both treatments. The former 
outcomes would be immediately clinically significant and applicable. The final option, though 
unlikely based on preliminary data, would also be an important finding and suggest that, either 
the cohort should be expanded, or additional imaging/clinical measures are needed for 
prediction.  
 
The power analysis was performed with an estimated 50 subjects per treatment. With a cohort of 
50 subjects (on SSRIs), we can detect a true cor relation as low as 0.39, with 80% power (two -
tailed analysis, = 0.05). In our FDG treatment study, the observed R2 value was 0.32, meaning 
the true correlation between the data was 0.57 (significantly higher than 0.39). However, this is 
almost certainly a n overestimation because only the voxel cluster highly correlated to the 
outcome was chosen (as in all cited studies).  
 
Aim 2: The change in MRgIu from pre to post treatment (SSRI and placebo) will be calculated in 
the midbrain cluster defined by [CONTACT_357613].  The correlation between this value and  
HDRS will be assessed with both SSRI and placebo groups as well as with separate cohorts, to 
determine if there is an effect of treatment. As with Aim 1, a post hoc analysis will also be 
performed ex amining this correlation over all voxels.  
 
Power Analysis. The partial correlation for each cluster and the factor related to “loss” varies 
between 0.5 and 0.6, meaning the true correlation ranges between 0.71 and 0.77. Based on this, 
using a single cohort  (n=50), a true correlation as low as 0.39 can be detected with 80% power 
(two-tailed analysis ,  =0.05).

 When cohorts are combined (n=100 completers, of 120 enrollees), a correlation as low as 0.27 
can be detected.  
 
Aim 3: In a previous cohort, we investigated SimE performance with FDG (and four other 
tracers). The optimal timing for the blood sample used to anchor the FDG SimE estimation was 
found to be 40 minutes after injection. At this time, FDG venous and arterial samples are 
essentially interc hangeable. Results using this 40 -minute blood -based anchor show that SimE - 
derived MRGlu are close to MRGlu derived using arterial sampling -based estimation: slope 
0.730, correlation 0.955 with compartmental analysis slope 0.876, correlation 0.974 with Pat lak 
analysis. Validation: Validation will be considered complete when MRGlu using conventional 
(Patlak) analysis and arterial samples matches MRGlu calculated with SimE and one venous 
sample in the proposed study data. The threshold will be a correlation o f at least 0.[ADDRESS_446221] 30 subjects.

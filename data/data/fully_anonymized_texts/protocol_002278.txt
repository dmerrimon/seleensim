12 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 2a Study to Assess the 
Clinical Efficacy of ISIS  721744, a Second -Generation Ligand -Conjugated Antisense 
Inhibitor of Prekallikrein, in Patients with Hereditary Angioedema  
Study Phase  2a 
Indication  Hereditary angioedema (HAE)  
Primary 
Objective  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of antisense 
inhibitor of prekallikrein (ISIS  721744) in patients with HAE type 1 (HAE -1), HAE 
type 2 (HAE -2), or HAE with normal C1 -inhibitor (C1 -INH). 
Secondary 
Objectives  The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability of 
ISIS 721744 in patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 or HAE with normal C1 -INH (HAE -nC1-
INH) and to evaluate the effect of ISIS  721744 on plasma prekallikrein (PKK) and 
other relevant biomarkers.   
Exploratory 
Objectives  The exploratory objectives of the study are to  evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
ISIS 721744 (as a total full -length antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), including fully 
conjugated, partially conjugated, and unconjugated ISIS  721744) over time and to 
assess potential PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlations o n relevant biomarkers and 
clinical outcomes, as appropriate.   
Study Design  The study will be randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled in Part  A and will 
be open-label in Part B.  
Number of 
Patients Approximately 24 patients with HAE are planned t o be enrolled in the study:  
approximately 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A of 
the study, and, in parallel, approximately 6  patients with HAE -nC1-INH are planned to 
be enrolled in Part B of the study.  Due to the rarity of HAE-nC1-INH, enrollment in 
Part B may be ended early if Study Centers are unable to enroll sufficient patients with 
HAE-nC1-INH; this will not impact completion of Part  A.

history consistent with HAE (SC or mucosal, non -pruritic swelling epi[INVESTIGATOR_84144]) (Maurer et al. 2018 ) AND any 1 of the 
following:  
i. A clinical diagnosis of bradykinin  (BK)-mediated angioedema as 
confirmed with threshold -stimulated kallikrein activity and 
Investigator -confirmed response to acute use of a BK targeted treatment 
(icatibant or ecallantide -). 
ii. One (1) of the established mutations (c.1032C>A, Thr309Lys; 
c.1032C>G, Thr309Arg; c.971_1018+24del72*; or c.892_909dup) in the

During the Treatment Period, Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo) will be 
administered as a single SC injection every [ADDRESS_91761] dose level of 80 mg produced near -complete 
reduction of  plasma PKK levels (a mean reduction of 93.6% from Baseline on Day 99 
[[ADDRESS_91762] dose]).  The estimated half -life (t½) from the Phase 1 PK data 
was approximately 4 to 5 weeks, supporting the once -every-28-day dosing regimen.  
Pharmacokinetic/P D analysis of the Phase 1 data suggested very minor differences in 
plasma PKK reductions at doses higher than 80 mg.  
Adjustment of 
Dose and/or 
Treatment 
Schedule  Down-titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will not be allowed during the 
study. 
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) due to an adverse event (AE) 
is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• None:  No changes made to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration 
and dose.  
• Not Applicable:  AE reported during the Screening Period prior to Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration.  
• Permanently Discontinued:  Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) discontinued 
and not restarted.  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose:  Dosing and/or dosing 
frequency tem porarily interrupted/changed or delayed due to the AE and restarted 
at the same dose.  
Study Visit 
Schedule and 
Procedures  The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will 
be allocated into Part  A or Part B according t o type of HAE (i.e., either HAE -1/HAE-2 
in Part A or HAE -nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A is randomized, double -blind, and 
placebo-controlled; and Part B is open -label.  The study visit schedule and procedures 
are nearly identical in Part A and Part  B, and thus  are presented together; any 
differences are indicated where applicable.  
Patients will be screened for eligibility criteria following written informed consent.   
During the Screening Period, the following assessments will be performed:  
demographics; medical history, including a detailed HAE history; prior and 
concomitant medications, including type of prophylaxis (if used) and type of acute 
treatment; HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C screening; pregnancy testing for women of 
childbearing potential an d FSH testing for confirmation of menopause per inclusion 
criteria; quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_84178] (AE QoL) 
questionnaire; attack frequency, as assessed by [CONTACT_84179] 
8 consecutive weeks, and confirmed by [CONTACT_737]; HAE attack assessment; 
physical examinations, including vital signs, body height, and weight; 
electrocardiograms (ECGs); AEs; PD blood sampling; inflammatory panel; and clinical 
laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).   
ISIS [ADDRESS_91763] experience a minimum of 2 HAE attacks 
(assessed by [CONTACT_84180]) to be eligible for the study; 
patients will be instructed to report deta ils of any HAE attack to the study site within 
[ADDRESS_91764] the patient once a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91765] with 
the patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred.  If a patient 
experiences a third attack, the patient should be randomized as soon as possible, 
assuming all other screening activities have been completed and the patient meets all 
other eligibility requirements; i n such cases, the Screening Period may be shorter than 
8 weeks. 
During the course of the study, the use of acute medications (plasma derived or 
recombinant C1 INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to 
treat angioedema attacks is  allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated 
with on demand therapy as determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
After a Screening Period of up to [ADDRESS_91766] 
2 documented attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84181] b y the Investigator) during 
the Screening Period will be enrolled and/or randomized to receive ISIS 721744 80 mg 
or placebo (Part A) or open label ISIS 721744 80 mg (Part B) every [ADDRESS_91767] ered as a SC injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area 
of the upper arm by [CONTACT_84182] (if available and after dosing instructions and training are provided by 
[CONTACT_1746]).  The  first dose of Study Drug will be administered at the 
Study Center on Day 1.  Study Center person nel (or Home Healthcare if available), 
will complete procedures  per the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix  A.  After 
completion of the Week [ADDRESS_91768] to enroll in the Open -Label 
Extension (OLE) Study (ISIS  721744-CS3), pending study approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC 
and the appropriate regulat ory authority, and will need to sign the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved informed consent.  Patients 
who complete Study Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility requirements, may start the 
treatment period in the CS3 s tudy anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91769]-Treatment Periods, the following data will be collected:  daily AAS and number 
of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180] ); number of 
HAE attacks that required on -demand treatment; HAE attack details, including 
localization, severity, course, and details of any required treatment (i.e., frequency and 
dose); and vital signs.  Throughout the Treatment and Post -Treatment Period s, site 
personnel will contact [CONTACT_84183] a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91770] with the patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred.  
In addition, at study visit  time points , site personnel will inquire abou t any new HAE 
attack information that was not provided through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  See 
Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_91771]-Treatment Periods to assess PD and coagulation parameters, including, but not 
limited to:  plasma  PKK, plasma proenzyme activation, cleaved high molecular weight 
kininogen (cHK) levels, D -dimer levels, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, C4 split products, and platelet counts.  Blood samples 
will also be collec ted regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.  
Additional assessments will be performed throughout the study as indicated in the 
Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix  A. 
Patients who discontinue treatment will remain in the study and attend the Early 
Termination (ET) Visit unless consent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information regarding the CS2 procedures is presented in Section  [ADDRESS_91772] of laboratory analytes required for the study.

Statistical 
Considerations  The sample size of 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 (12 patients administered 
SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg and 6 patients administered placebo) is from 
clinical con siderations for sufficient safety and tolerability evaluation.  The primary 
endpoint is the time -normalized number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week  [ADDRESS_91773] 90% power for the primary 
endpoint, considering a 10%  missing data or dropout rate for both active treatment 
and placebo.  There is no statistical rationale for the sample size of [ADDRESS_91774] (DSMB) will be established prior 
to the initiation  of the study.  The DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the 
overall safe conduct of the study.  Based on its ongoing assessment of the safety and 
tolerability of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide recommendations to the Sponsor 
for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  or continuing the study as planned.  Details on the safety 
assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules and controlled access to 
unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and Statistical Analysis Plan.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE 
2.1. Overview of Disease  
Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_84186][INVESTIGATOR_84145], pain ful abdominal attacks, and, occasionally, laryngeal attacks 
that can be life -threatening.  The disorder is classified in 3 subtypes.  Hereditary angioedema 
Type I (HAE-1) and Type II (HAE -2) are caused by [CONTACT_84187][INVESTIGATOR_1645]1  gene, resulting in either decreased levels of C1 -INH (HAE -1) or loss-of-function of 
this protein (HAE -2) (Bissler et al. 1997 ).  The third form of HAE is associated with normal 
levels and function of C1 -INH (HAE -nC1-INH).  This form is currently categorized as 
4 subtypes, with either specific genetic mutations in the factor XII gene, the plasminogen gene, 
or the angiopoietin -1 gene, or due to an unknown cause (Maurer et al. 2018 ).  Extensive 
evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies supports the key role of bradykinin (BK) in HAE 
attacks, although the data linking HAE -nC1-INH with BK are less strong (Zuraw and 
Christiansen 2016 ).  Diagnosing HAE -nC1-INH can be challenging given the large heterogeneity 
of this patient pop ulation, the lack of diagnostic tests, and the fact that specific genetic mutations 
account only partially for the occurrence of this type of HAE.  Recently, a threshold -stimulated 
kallikrein activity assay was shown to discriminate BK -mediated angioedema from histamine -
mediated angioedema (Lara‑Marquez et al. 2018 ).   
 
 
Treatment options for HAE include on -demand treatment of attacks and prophylaxis.  
On-demand options include supp lementation of C1 -INH (either plasma -derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate) and inhibition of BK2 receptor activation (BK2 -receptor antagonist).  In 
addition, tranexamic acid may relieve symptoms in non -severe angioedema attacks.  
Prophylactic regimens  for HAE include plasma -derived C1 -INH concentrate (administered either 

ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
26 intravenously or subcutaneously [SC]), attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytics and a recently 
Food and Drug Administration -approved monoclonal antibody directed against plasma kallikre in 
(PKa).  Kallikrein circulates in plasma as a zymogen (i.e., PKK) which is bound to one of its 
main substrates, high molecular weight kininogen (HK).  Prekallikrein is cleaved upon contact 
[CONTACT_84188], forming the active protease PKa.  Plasma kallikrein c leaves HK in turn, thereby 
[CONTACT_84189].  The binding of BK to the BK2 receptor leads to 
activation of various intracellular signaling pathways resulting in vasodilation, chemotaxis of 
neutrophils, and increased vascular permeabil ity and fluid efflux, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_84146] (Zuraw and  Christiansen 2016 ). 
2.2. Therapeutic Rationale  
 
Antisense technology is characterized by [CONTACT_84190] a single -gene product, thereby [CONTACT_84191]-target drug effects.   
 
 
    
 
The Phase 1 clinical data show that ISIS 721744 inhibits plasma PKK effectively in a 
dose-dependent manner without safety concerns.

28 2.3.3. Preclinical Experience  
Detailed information concerning the pre clinical studies conducted with PKK ASO ISIS  546254, 
its 5ʹ-GalNAc 3-conjugated mixed backbone variant ISIS 721744, and mouse surrogate PKK 
ASOs can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Results also strongly support that 
GalNAc 3-conjugation of PKK ASO significantly increases the potency of ASO for inhibition of 
PKK hepatic mRNA and circulatory protein e xpression  
 
2.3.4. Clinical Experience  
ISIS 721744 has been evaluated in the clinical setting in a Phase 1 safety study 
(ISIS 721744-CS1).  All subjects have complete d study procedures and final safety and PD data 
are available.  A summary is included below.  Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a 
detailed description of the preclinical pharmacology, nonclinical toxicology and PK, as well as a 
description of  previous clinical experience with other related 2′ -MOE phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotides.  
ISIS 721744 has been studied in 32 healthy volunteers in a double -blind, multiple -dose, 
dose-escalation study.  Of these, 24 subjects received multiple doses of ISIS  721744.  The 
32 subjects were randomized into 4 cohorts (6 subjects each) to receive once -every-4-week SC 
doses of ISIS  721744 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg, or placebo (8 subjects) for a total of 12  weeks (4 total 
doses).  All subjects received all planned doses of Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo).  The 
duration of Study Drug exposure was [ADDRESS_91777].  
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the ISIS 721744 -CS1 study.  There were no 
early discontinuations from Study Drug or the study, and all subjects in the ISIS 721744 and 
placebo arms completed all study procedures.  Adverse events at the injection site (defined as 
any preferred term containing “injection site”) were the most commonly reported 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the ISIS 721744 treatment arms; no injection 
site-related TEAEs were reported in the placebo arm.  There were no flu -like reactions or events 
of local cutaneous reaction at injection site (LCRIS) reported; LCRIS events were defined as 
(A) moderate or sever e injection site erythema, swelling, pruritus, pain, or tenderness that started 
on the day of injection and persisted for at least 2 days; or (B) any AE at the injection site, 
regardless of severity, that led to discontinuation of Study Drug, where AE at t he injection site 
was the principal reason for discontinuation.  No relationship between incidence of TEAEs and 
the dose administered was observed.  
Thirteen (13) AEs related to study treatment were reported for 4 (16.7%) subjects in the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_91778] (2 events; 12.5%) in the placebo arm.  One (1) subject each 
in the ISIS  [ADDRESS_91779] inversion (preferred term) that 
were assessed as related.  Nine (9) of the total [ADDRESS_91780] in the 80  mg arm.  Additional related 
events were tinnitus ([ADDRESS_91781], 1 event in the 60 mg arm), headache ([ADDRESS_91782], 1 event in the 
60 mg arm), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] ([ADDRESS_91783], 1 event in the 20 mg arm).  All TEAEs related to study 
treatment were mild in severity, and none were serious.  

ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
29 ISIS 721744 resulted in a dose -dependent reduction of PKK concentration and plasma 
proenzyme activation.  The difference in absolute and percent change from Bas eline for 
ISIS 721744 vs. placebo was statistically significant for PKK concentration for 40, 60, and 
80 mg (p ≤ 0.043) starting at Day 15, the first evaluation, and for 20 mg starting at Day 29, and 
for plasma proenzyme activation for all doses (p ≤ 0.002 ) starting at Day 15.  The nadir was 
generally reached around Day 71, when the percent reduction with the 80 mg dose was -93.2% 
for PKK concentration and -99.6% for plasma proenzyme activation.  
The difference in absolute and percent change from Baseline in  cHK for ISIS [ADDRESS_91784] that 
enhanced delivery of ISIS 721744 to hepatocytes vs. non -parenchymal cells will result in similar 
PD results as ISIS 546254 at 1/10th to 1/30th of the dose (Viney et al. 2016 ). 
2.4. Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Administration  
The dose level of [ADDRESS_91785] dose level 
of 80 mg produced near -complete reduction of plasma PKK levels (a mean reduction of 93.6% 
from Baseline on Day 99 [[ADDRESS_91786] dose]).  The estimated t ½ from the Phase 1 P K 
data was approximately 4 to 5 weeks, supporting the once -every-28-day dosing regimen.  
Pharmacokinetic/PD analysis of the Phase 1 data suggested very minor differences in plasma 
PKK reductions at doses higher than 80 mg.  
2.5. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
2.5.1. Benefit Assessment  
The benefits of treatment of ISIS 721744 are currently unknown.  Due to its mechanism of 
action, ISIS 721744 has the potential to be efficacious for the treatment of patients with HAE.  
2.5.2. Risk Assessment  
The known potential risks to study participa nts associated with ISIS 721744 are elaborated on in 
the “Guidance to Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
There are no anticipated risks associated with reducing plasma PKK levels; however, a potential 
theoretical risk associated with PKK  inhibition would be prolongation of activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT).  This risk is informed by [ADDRESS_91787] been 
described in the literature (Girolami et al. 2010 ).  In these individuals, there is a dis crepancy 
between an observed in vitro defect and an absence of bleeding.  Thus, it is believed that most 
cases go undetected or, if detected, go unreported.  Occasional bleeding or thrombosis has been 
reported in a few PKK deficient patients but these inst ances were due to the presence of 
associated risk factors.  Diagnosis is based on the prolongation of partial thromboplastin time 
and normal prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time.  In these individuals, platelet and vascular 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
30 tests are normal and the long  partial thromboplastin time has shown to be fully corrected by [CONTACT_84192].  
In monkeys, doses of ISIS 721744 of up to 30 mg/kg/wk for 13 weeks were well -tolerated with 
the exception of thrombocytopenia observed in 1 femal e at 12 mg/kg/wk and 1 male at 
30 mg/kg/wk.  The monkey dose of 6 mg/kg/wk provides an approximate 20 -fold margin relative 
to a human dose of 80 mg every 4 weeks and therefore there is sufficient therapeutic margin to 
assure the safe clinical use of ISIS 7 [ZIP_CODE] at the proposed clinical dose and regimen.  
One (1) subject in the ISIS 721744 -CS1 study had a confirmed platelet nadir count between 
100 × 103/µL and the lower limit of normal (LLN) (140 × 103/µL).  The subject received 
ISIS 721744 at 20 mg and had a  platelet count of 139 × 103/µL on Study Day 99; all other 
reported values for this subject were within the reference range.  
Platelet counts will be monitored closely throughout the clinical study.  
More complete details can be found in the Investigator’s B rochure. 
2.5.3. Overall Assessment of Benefit:Risk  
No specific risks have been identified with ISIS 721744.  The AEs that occurred with the related 
drug ISIS 546254 were unrelated to reduction of PKK.  In addition, the conjugated nature of 
ISIS 721744 is anticipa ted to reduce systemic exposure even further.  Consequently, the platelet 
count reductions observed with the higher doses of the unconjugated molecule are not 
anticipated to occur at the dose tested in this study.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to patients participating in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with ISIS 721744 are justified by [CONTACT_84193].  
3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1. Study Design  
This Phase 2a study will be conducted at multiple Study Centers worldwide to assess the efficacy 
of ISIS 721744 in approximately 24 patients with HAE.  Part A of the study will be randomized, 
double-blind, and placebo -controlled; Part B of the study will be open -label. 
The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according to type of HAE (i.e., either HAE -1/HAE-2 in Part A or 
HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A is randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled; and 
Part B is open -label.  The study visit schedule and procedures are nearly identical in Part A and 
Part B, and thus are presented together; any differences are indicated where applicable.  
In Part A, approximately 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 will be randomized to SC injections of 
ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately 
6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH will be administered open -label SC injections of ISIS  721744 
80 mg.  Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended early if Study 
Centers are unable to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact the completion of Part A.

Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
31 Patients who discontinue treatment will remain in the study and attend the Early Termination 
(ET) Visit u nless consent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information regarding the study procedures is presented in Section  [ADDRESS_91788] of laboratory analytes required for the study.  
3.2. Number of Study Centers  
This study will be conducted at multiple Study Centers worldwide.  
3.3. Number of Patients  
A total of approximately 24 patients in Parts A and B combined will be administered SC 
injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks.  Patient s will be allocated into Part  A 
or Part B according to type of HAE, (i.e., either HAE -1/HAE-2 or HAE -nC1-INH):  
approximately 18  patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A of the study, 
and, in parallel, approximately 6 patients with HA E-nC1-INH are planned to be enrolled in 
Part B of the study.  Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended 
early if Study Centers are unable to enroll sufficient patients with HAE -nC1-INH; this will not 
impact completion of Part A.  
3.4. Overall Study Duration and Follow -up 
The study will consist of Screening, Treatment, and Post -Treatment Periods.  Please refer to the 
Schedule of Procedures in Appendix  A. 
Patients may be required to attend additional visits for monitoring of AEs or abnormal 
investigation results.  The frequency of additional monitoring will be determined by [CONTACT_84194].  
The length of each patient’s participation in the study is approximately 8 months, which includes 
an up to 8 -week Screening Period, a 12 -week Treatment Period  (patients will receive fixed SC 
doses of Study Dru g every 4 weeks during 4  on-site study visits) , and a 4- to 13-week 
Post-Treatment Period  as determined by [CONTACT_84195] a patient enrolls in the ISIS 721744 -CS3 OLE 
study. 
3.4.1. Screening  
Patient eligibility for the study will be determined within 8 weeks (56 days) prior to study entry.  
3.4.2. Treatment Period  
Eligible patients will report to the Study Center for the first administration of Study Drug on 
Study Day  1 (Week 1 Visit) and will continue to receive Study Drug once every 4 weeks during 
the 12-week Treatment Period .  Patients will also return to the Study Center on Week 3 (or 
Home Healthcare (if available), as arranged by [CONTACT_37747], per the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A) for a safety monitoring visit.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91789] -treatment follow -up visits (or Home Healthcare 
(if available), as arranged by [CONTACT_37747], per the Sched ule of Procedures in 
Appendix  A at Study Weeks 17, 21, and 26/ET.  Alternatively, patients who complete Study 
Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility require ments, may start the treatment period in the 
ISIS 721744-CS3 OLE study anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91790]-Treatment Evaluation Period.  Patients may be required to attend additional visits for 
monitoring of AEs or  abnormal investigation results.  The frequency of additional monitoring 
will be determined by [CONTACT_84196].   
The final study visit, for patients not enrolling in the OLE, will be the Week 26/ET Visit.   
3.5. End-of-Study 
The End-of-Study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study.  
3.6. Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assembled to review safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy (as needed)  data collected on ISIS  721744 during this study.  Based on its ongoing 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS  721744, the DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned.  
Details on the safety assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules, and controlled access 
to unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT  
4.1. Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the S ponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center’s written Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF), and all other patient information and/or 
recruitment material.  
Patients must sign the consent form before any screening tests or assessments, prior to screening 
blood draws, are performed.  At the time of consent, the patient will be considered enrolled into 
the study and will be assigned a unique screening number before a ny study procedures, including 
screening procedures, are performed.  At the time of randomization, patients will be assigned a 
unique patient identification number.  This number will be used to identify the patient throughout 
the study and must be used on all study documentation related to that patient.  The screening 
number and patient identification number must remain constant throughout the entire study.   
In the event the patient is re -consented and re -screened, the patient must be given a new 
screening  number.  Screening numbers, once assigned, will not be re -used. 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
33 4.2. Randomization  
Patients will be allocated into Part A or Part B according to type of HAE (i.e., either 
HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or HAE -nC1-INH in Part B).  Only Part A will be randomized and 
placebo-controlled.   
Patients will be enrolled and/or randomized (Part A only)  at the Week [ADDRESS_91791] been completed and after the Investigator has verified that they are eligible per 
the criteria in Sections  5.1 and 5.2.  No patient may begin treatment prior to randomiza tion 
(Part A only) and assignment of a unique patient identification number.   
In Part A, approximately 18  patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 will be randomized via the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) system to SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in  a 
2:1 ratio (ISIS  721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately 6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH will be 
enrolled via the IRT system to receive open -label SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg.  Due to 
the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended ear ly if Study Centers are unable 
to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact the completion of Part A.  
Randomization information will be concealed from the Investigators and patients until the end of 
the study, with the exception of an emergency situ ation involving a patient that requires 
unblinding of the treatment assignment.  
Both ISIS  721744 and placebo will be provided as injections for SC administration and will be 
identical in appearance.  
4.3. Replacement of Patients  
Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
Patients whose randomization code has been broken will not be replaced.  
4.4. Unblinding of Treatment Assignment  
For Part A, the Sponsor and all patients, monitors, and Study Center personnel related to the 
study will be blinded throu ghout the study.  However, if a patient has suffered an SAE (as 
defined in Section  9.3.3), and/or when knowledge of the treatment assignment will impact  the 
clinical management of the patient, the Investigator will have the ability to unblind the treatment 
assignment for that patient via the IRT system.  
In the case of unblinding, the IRT system will send a blinded notification to the Sponsor or 
designee w ithin 24 hours to let them know that a patient was unblinded.  In addition, all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be unblinded by [CONTACT_84197] (see Section  9.2). 
Every reasonable attempt should be made to complete the ET study procedures and observations 
(see Appendix  A) prior to unblinding, as knowledge of the treatment arm could influence patient 
assessment.

6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1. Study Schedule  
The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according to type of HAE (i.e., either HAE -1/HAE-2 in Part A or 
HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A  is randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled; and 
Part B is open label.  The study visit schedule and procedures are nearly identical in Part A and 
Part B, and thus are presented together; any differences are indicated where applicable.  
All require d study procedures are outlined in Appendix  A. 
The safety of ISIS 721744 will be continually monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_84203].  
The length of each patient’s participation from Screening to the last study visit is up to 
approximately 8 months (231 days).  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
37 6.1.1. Screening  
Written informed consent for the study will be obtained prior to the performance of any 
study-related procedures, including screening procedures.  A 56 -day period is provided for 
completing screening assessments and determining patient eligibility for the study.   
Safety labs may be retested for determination of patient eligibility at the Investigat or’s discretion.  
The Sponsor Medical Monitor will be available for consultation, if needed.  
After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for eligibility criteria.  
During the Screening Period, the following assessments will be perfo rmed:  demographics; 
medical history, including a detailed HAE history; prior and concomitant medications, including 
type of prophylaxis (if used) and type of acute treatment; HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis  C 
screening; pregnancy testing for women of chil dbearing potential (WOCBP) and FSH testing for 
confirmation of menopause per inclusion criteria ; quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_84204] -QoL 
questionnaire; attack frequency, as assessed by [CONTACT_84179] 8  consecutive weeks, 
and confirmed by [CONTACT_737]; HAE attack assessment; physical examinations, including 
vital signs, body height, and weight; ECGs; AEs; PD blood sampling; inflammatory panel; and 
clinical laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).  
Threshold-stimulated kallikrein activity will be assessed only in patients who have 
HAE-nC1-INH without a factor XII mutation or the plasminogen or angiopoietin -[ADDRESS_91797] experience a 
minimum of 2 HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180]) to be 
eligible for the study; patients will be instructed to report details of an y HAE attack to the study 
site within [ADDRESS_91798] the patient once a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91799] with the 
patient) in order to inquire about any  attack that may have occurred.  If a patient experiences a 
third attack, the patient should be randomized as soon as possible, assuming all other screening 
activities have been completed and the patient meets all other eligibility requirements; in such 
cases, the Screening Period may be shorter than 8 weeks.  
During the course of the study, the use of acute medications (plasma -derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat angioedema 
attacks is allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated with on -demand therapy as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
6.1.2. Treatment Period  
After a Screening Period of up to [ADDRESS_91800] 2 documented attacks 
(assessed by [CONTACT_84180]) during the Screening Period and met all 
other eligibility criteria will be administered Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  Patients in 
Part A will be randomized to receive ISIS  721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for a t otal 
Treatment Period of 12 weeks.  Patients in Part  B will all receive open -label ISIS  721744 80 mg 
every 4 weeks for a total Treatment Period of 12 weeks.   
Study Drug  will be administered as SC injections in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of the 
upper arm by [CONTACT_84205]  (if available  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91801] ructions and training are provided by [CONTACT_1746] ).  The first dose of 
Study Drug will be administered at the Study Center o n Study Day 1 (Week  1 Visit).  Study 
Center person nel (or Home Healthcare if available),  will complete procedures  per the Schedule 
of Procedures in Appendix  A.  A ± 2-day excursion from the scheduled visit date is permitted for 
all visits (excluding the Week  1 Visit on Study Day  1) during the Treatment Period.  
During the study, patients will be instr ucted to report details of any HAE attack to the study site 
within 72 hours of the onset of the attack.  During the Treatment Period, the following data will 
be collected:  daily AAS and number of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84206]); number of HAE attacks that required on -demand treatment; HAE attack details, 
including localization, severity, course, and details of any required treatment (i.e., frequency and 
dose); and vital signs.  Throughout the Treatment Period, site perso nnel will contact [CONTACT_84207] a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91802] with the patient) in order to inquire 
about any attack that may have occurred.  In addition, at study visit  time points , site personnel 
will inquire about any new HAE  attack information that was not provided through patient contact 
[CONTACT_36362].  See Section  6.2.1 for further information on the collection of data sur rounding 
HAE attacks.  Additional assessments will be performed throughout the Treatment Period as 
indicated in the Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix  A. 
Additionally, blood will be collected to assess PD and coagulation parameters, including, but not 
limited to:  plasma PKK, plasma proenzyme activation, cHK levels, D -dimer levels, aPTT, 
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, C4  split products, and platelet  counts.  Blood samples will also 
be collected regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.   
Patients who discontinue treatment will remain in the study and attend the ET Visit unless 
consent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information regarding t he study procedures is presented in Section  [ADDRESS_91803] -Treatment Period, patients will return to the Study Center (or have 
Home Healthcare (if available), as arranged by [CONTACT_37747], per the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix  A) for visits at Weeks  17, 21, and 26/ET for safety and clinical 
laboratory evaluations and for blood sampling for PK/PD analyses.  A ± 2 -day excursion from 
the scheduled visi t date is permitted for the visits at Weeks  17 and 21, and a ± 3 -day excursion 
from the scheduled visit date is permitted for the visit at Week  26/ET.  Alternatively, after 
completion of the Week [ADDRESS_91804] to enroll in the ISIS 721744-CS3 
OLE study, pending study approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority, and 
will need to sign the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) 
approved informed consent.  Patients who complete Study Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility 
requirements, may start the treatment period in the CS3 study anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91805] -Treatment Period, the following data will  be collected:  daily AAS and number 
of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180]); number of HAE 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
39 attacks that required on -demand treatment; HAE attack details, including localization, severity, 
course, and details of any required treatment (i.e., frequency and dose); and vital signs.  
Throughout the Post -Treatment Period, site personnel will contact [CONTACT_84183] a week (at 
approximately [ADDRESS_91806] with the patient) in order to inquire about any attack 
that may have occurred.  In addition, during study visits, site personnel will inquire about any 
new HAE attack information that was not provided through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  See 
Section 6.2.1 for further information on the collection of data surrounding HAE attacks.  
Additionally, blood will be collected to assess PD and coagulation parameters, including, but not 
limited to:  plasma PKK, plasma proenzyme activation, cHK levels, D -dimer levels, aPTT, 
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, C4 split products, and platelet counts.  Blood samples will also 
be collected regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.  Additional 
assessments will be performed throughout the Post -Treatment Period as indicated in the 
Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix  A. 
Patients who withdraw early from the s tudy during the Treatment Period will be required to 
complete their End -of-Study evaluations following procedures listed for the Week 26/ET Visit; 
see Appendix  A.   
6.2. Study Assessments  
6.2.1. Collection of Hereditary Angioedema Attack Details  
Historical HAE attack information will be collected at Screening.  During the study, patients will 
be instructed to report details of any HAE attack to the study site within [ADDRESS_91807] the patient once a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91808] with the 
patient) in order to inquire about any attack  that may have occurred.  In addition, during study 
visits, site personnel will inquire about any new HAE attack information that was not provided 
through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  
During the Screening, Treatment, and Post -Treatment Periods, detailed information on each 
HAE attack will be collected, and the number of HAE attacks that required on -demand 
treatment, and the details of any on -demand treatment used (frequency and dosing), will be 
assessed.  For each HAE attack, the following data will be co llected:  
• Date/time of symptom onset  
• Description of symptoms  
• Location and description of symptoms:  
− Peripheral angioedema:  cutaneous swelling involving an extremity, face, neck, 
torso, and/or genitourinary region  
− Abdominal angioedema:  abdominal pain, with  or without abdominal distension, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea  
− Laryngeal angioedema:  stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty 
swallowing, throat tightening, or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
40 • HAE attack severity:  
− Mild:  transien t or mild discomfort  
− Moderate:  mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance needed  
− Severe:  marked limitation in activity, assistance required  
• Need for assistance, medical intervention, emergency room visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Medications to treat the attack  
• HAE attack course, including if the HAE attack(s) in question was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84148], or if there was an alternative diagnosis  
• Date/time symptoms resolved  
An HAE attack will be defined as an event with signs or symptoms consi stent with an attack in at 
least [ADDRESS_91809] 
24-hour symptom -free period between attacks.  
6.2.2. Patient-Reported Outcomes  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Quality of life will  be assessed by [CONTACT_84204] -QoL questionnaire during Screening and at Weeks  1, 
9, 17, and 26/ET.   
The AE-QoL questionnaire is a validated tool to assess symptom -specific health -related quality 
of life impairment in patients suffering from recurrent angioedema (Weller et al. 2013 ).  The 
AE-QoL is a self -administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5 minutes; it 
comprises 17 questions across 4 domains:  functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/s hame, and food.  
The AE-QoL can be used to calculate scores for the 4 individual domains, and can also be used 
to determine a total score.   The AE-QoL will be completed by [CONTACT_102].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Angioedema Activity Score  
Patients will be instructed on the use of the  AAS questionnaire during Screening and will record 
their HAE attacks using the AAS questionnaire during the Screening Period to confirm study 
eligibility.  The AAS questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_84208] a daily basis (minimum of 
4 daily assessment s per week) for the duration of the study.   
During the Screening Period, patients must experience a minimum of 2 HAE attacks (assessed 
by [CONTACT_84180]) to be eligible for the study.  
Enrolled patients will continue to record HA E attacks using the AAS questionnaire throughout 
the Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods.  
The AAS is a validated patient -reported outcome instrument to assess disease activity in patients 
with recurrent angioedema.  The AAS was designed as a diary -type tool, and is easy to 
administer and fast to complete.  Using the AAS questionnaire, patients score each of 5 key 
symptom-related factors from 0 to 3, resulting in a total daily score of 0 to 15.  Daily AAS can be 
summed to provide scores every 7  days, every 4 weeks, and every 12 weeks (Weller et al. 2013 ). 
ISIS [ADDRESS_91810] of these analytes is 
contained in Appendix  B.   
If the platelet value, serum creatinine, or liver enzyme tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to 
clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hemolysis, or quantity not sufficient) or missing, a repeat blood specimen should be 
re-drawn as soon as po ssible (ideally within 7 days)  either in clinic or by [CONTACT_84209] . 
6.3. Restriction on the Lifestyle of Patients  
6.3.1. Contraception Requirements  
All male patients and WOCBP must refrain from sperm/egg donation and either be abstinent † or 
use highly effective contraception from the time of signing the ICF until at least [ADDRESS_91811] dose of Study Drug.   
For male patients engaged in sexual relations with a WOCBP, if their female partner is using 
highly effective contracepti on from the time of the patient signing the informed consent until  
24 weeks after the patient’s last dose of study treatment, then it is not required for the male 
patient to also use a highly effective contraceptive method.  
For the purposes of this study, a WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche, and who does not meet 1 of the following conditions:  
• Post-menopausal:  12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females > 55 years of 
age or, in females ≤ [ADDRESS_91812] -menopausal range for the 
laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy  
• Post-hysterectomy  
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception is defined as follows:  
For male patients:  
• Highly effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with neg ative semen 
analysis at follow -up, or the non -pregnant female partner of childbearing potential 
uses a highly effective contraceptive method (defined below).  
• Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception to 
ensure that the  fetus is not exposed to the Study Drug.  
Note: A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction 
between the two can result in either or both products failing.  
For female patients and female partners of male patients, highly effecti ve contraception methods 
comprise 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
42 • Surgical sterilization (i.e., bilateral tubal occlusion); progestogen -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine contraception 
device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system.  
†Note: Abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of 
study participation) is only acceptable as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the 
duration of the study, or withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

8.1. Study Drug Administration  
Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be administered as a single -SC injection once every 
4 weeks by [CONTACT_84211] -site visits at the Study Centers  or by [CONTACT_84212]  (if available  and after dosing inst ructions and training are provided by [CONTACT_84213] ).  Vials of Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo) are for single use only.  
Please refer to the Study Drug Manual provided by [CONTACT_84214] (ISIS  721744 or placebo) preparation and administration.  
8.2. Other Protocol -Required Drugs  
Patients must have access to, and the ability to use, ≥ 1 acute medication(s) (e.g., plasma -derived 
or recombinant  C1-INH concentrate or a BK2 -receptor antagonist) to treat angioedema attacks.  
During the course of the study, the use of acute medications (plasma -derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat angio edema 
attacks is allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated with on -demand therapy as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
8.3. Other Protocol -Required Treatment Procedures  
There are no other protocol -required treatment procedures.   
8.4. Treatment Precautions  
There are no specific treatment precautions required.   
8.5. Safety Monitoring Rules  
Please refer also to the “Guidance for Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
For the purposes of safety monitoring, Baseline is defined as the average of the pre -dose Study 
Day [ADDRESS_91813] monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following guidelines are 
provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical 
observations.  
Confirmation Guidance :  At any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), 
the initial clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monit oring criteria presented below must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the 
initial measurement) on new specimens.  All new specimen collections should take place as soon 
as possible (ideally within 3 days  of the initial collection).  For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], if the initial 
laboratory result is observed during the Treatment Period, the results from the retest must be 
available prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo).  
Re-dosing Guidance :  Patients with initial laboratory test values that reach a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10447]-dosed until the retest results are available.  In general, patients who do not meet the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10448].  However, the I nvestigator and the 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
44 Sponsor Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to whether 
additional close monitoring of the patient is appropriate.  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10449] (refer to Section  8.6) are met, the patient will be permanently discontinued from further 
treatment with Study Drug (ISIS  721744 or placebo), evaluated fully as outlined below and in 
consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be 
followed up in accordance with Section  8.8 of the protocol.   
8.5.1. Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests  
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S.  Department of Health and Human 
Services, Food and Drug A dministration, July 2009.  For a definition of Baseline, please refer to 
guidance in Section  8.[ADDRESS_91814] measurement that i s > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline 
value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (Treatment or 
Post-Treatment Period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described above.  
Additional, confirmatory measurements should also be performed if ALT or AST levels  increase 
to 5 × ULN. 
Frequency of Repeat Measurements :  Patients with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 × ULN (or 
the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) should have their 
liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosp hatase, international normalized ratio [INR], and 
total bilirubin) retested at least once -weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.2 × ULN or 
1.2 × baseline value if the baseline value was > ULN.  
Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations :  For patients with confirmed ALT or AST 
levels > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was 
> ULN), the following evaluations should be performed:  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent dise ases 
• Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel  
• Perform serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M ([IgM], 
hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, cytomegalovirus IgM, and 
Epstein-Barr Virus antibody panel)  
• Perform serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g. , antinuclear antibody)  
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic 
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans, may be performed at the discretion 
of the Investigator, in consultation with the Spo nsor Medical Monitor.  Repetition of the above 
evaluations should be considered if a patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 × ULN. 
8.5.2. Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results  
Please refer also to Table 2. 
ISIS [ADDRESS_91815] met a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10450].  If a patient’s platelet count falls to 
100,000/mm3 or less, then the patient’s platelet counts should be m onitored weekly.  In case of 
platelet reduction to below 75,000/mm3, the platelet monitoring rule defined in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] 
(Section 8.6.2) should be followed.  
In the event of a platelet count < 75,000/mm3, additional laboratory investigations may be 
conducted in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
8.5.3. Safety Monitoring Rul es for Renal Function Test Results  
If a patient’s results meet Criteria 1 or 2 below, the Investigator should confirm the results and 
initiate weekly monitoring if confirmed.  If the event of a persistent elevation is observed over 
2 consecutive weeks, the n go to Section  8.6.3. 
1. Serum creatinine increase that fulfills all of the following:  ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5  μmol/L) 
and ≥ 40% above baseline creatinine values and > ULN (refer to definition of Baseline in 
Section 8.6) 
2. Proteinuria, urine protein/creatinine ratio > 750 mg/g for baseline values ≥  200 mg/g, or 
4 × baseline value for baseline values < 200 mg/g that are confirmed by [CONTACT_84215]/creatinine ratio or by a quantitative total urine protein measurement of 
> 1.0 g/24 hours 
8.5.4. Safety Monitoring for Minor Bleeding Events  
If a bleeding event occ urs, including minor bleeding events such as excess bruising, petechiae, or 
gingival bleeding on brushing teeth, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, PT, and INR) and platelet co unt should 
be performed.  
8.6. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10452], Baseline is defined as the average of the pre -dose Study 
Day [ADDRESS_91816] value prior to Study Day  1.   
8.6.1. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84149], and the event is without an 
alternative explanation as discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor,  dosing of a patient 
with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be stopped permanently; values that are no t 
confirmed due to failure to retest or missing lab values will be presumed confirmed:  
1. ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, which is confirmed  
2. ALT or AST > 5 × ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ [ADDRESS_91817] > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN or INR > 1.[ADDRESS_91818] > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN) , which is confirmed, and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides 
with the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant eosinophilia (> ULN)  
8.6.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84150] a lso to Table 2. 
In the event of any platelet count < 25,000/mm3, dosing of the patient with Study Drug will be 
stopped permanently.  Platelet count should b e monitored daily until 3 successive values 
> 25,000/mm3.  Then, monitor twice weekly until 3 successive values > 75,000/mm3.  Then, 
monitor weekly until 3 successive values > 100,000/mm3.  Consider more frequent monitoring if 
additional risk factors for b leeding are present (see Table 2).  Administration of steroids is 
strongly recommended for patients whose platelet count is < 25,000/mm3.  Treatment guidelines 
for immune thrombocytopenia (Provan et al. 2010 ) recommend dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 
4 days every 2 to 4 weeks for 1  to 4 cycles; prednis(ol)one 0.5 to 2  mg/kg/day fo r 2 to 4 weeks 
then taper; or methylprednisolone 30  mg/kg/day for 7 days.  ( Note:  Patient may require 
continuation with oral steroids after methylprednisolone).   
In the event of a platelet count ≥ 25,000/mm3 to < 50,000 /mm3, dosing of the patient with St udy 
Drug will be stopped permanently.  Platelet count should be monitored twice weekly until 
3 successive values > 75,000/mm3.  Then, monitor weekly until 3 successive values 
> 100,000/mm3.  Consider more frequent monitoring and/or the administration of st eroids if 
additional risk factors for bleeding are present (see Table 2). 
In the event of a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 to ˂ 75,000/mm3, and in the absence  of major 
bleeding or clinically relevant non -major bleeding (defined below), dosing with Study Drug 
should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered to >  100,000/mm3.  The 
suitability of the patient for continued dosing will be deter mined by [CONTACT_84216]’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were experienced, and 
the speed of recovery of platele t count after interruption of dosing.  Platelet count must be 
measured twice weekly until 3 successive values > 75,000/mm3, then weekly until 3  successive 
values > 100,000/mm3.  Consider more frequent monitoring if additional risk factors for bleeding 
are present (see Table 2).  Any unreportable platelet count result must be recheck ed, ideally 
within [ADDRESS_91819] met a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10450].  
Definition of Major Bleeding Events (Schulman and Kearon 2005 ) 
1. Fatal bleeding, and/or  
2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarterial or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or  
3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of  packed red blood cells or 
whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of ≥  2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) within 24  hours 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
47 Definition of Clinically Relevant Non -Major Bleeding Events  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
major bleeding but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had 
clinical consequences for a patient.  
Definition of Minor Bleeding Events  
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major ble eding or clinically 
relevant, non -major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, or 
gingival bleeding on brushing teeth.  
If the subsequent test confirms the initial test result, then monitoring frequency and dosing 
should be  adjusted as recommended in Table 2. 
Table 2: Actions in Patients with Low Platelet Count  
Platelet count 
(K/mm3) Dosing Monitoring frequency

returns to > 100K/mm3, restart 
dosing only if approved by [CONTACT_37679].   Twice weekly until 3 successive 
values > 75K/mm3, then weekly until 
3 successive values > 100K/mm3.

3 successive values > 100K/mm3.   
Consider more frequent monitoring if 
additional risk factors for bleeding are 
present.‡ 
< 25 Permanently discontinue Study 
Drug. 
Corticosteroids strongly 
recommended.*  Daily until 3 successive values 
> 25K/mm3, then twice weekly until 
3 successive values > 75K/mm3, then 
weekly until 3 successive values 
> 100K/mm3.   
Consider more frequent monitoring if 
additional risk factors for bleeding are 
present.‡ 
‡ Additional risk factors for bleeding include age > 60 years, receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medicinal 
products, and/or prior history of major bleeding events.  
* It is strongly recommended that,  unless corticosteroids are contraindicated, the patient receives glucocorticoid 
therapy to reverse the platelet decline as recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by [CONTACT_10536]-dose steroids.  Treatment guidelines for immune thrombocytop enia (Provan et al. 2010 ) recommend 
dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days every 2 to 4 weeks for 1 to 4 cycles; prednis(ol)one 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day for 
2 to 4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone  30 mg/kg/day for 7 days ( Note:  patient may require continuation 
with oral steroids after methylprednisolone).  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91821] Results  
In the event of a persistent elevation that is observed over 2 consecutive weeks, for either of the 
2 criteria below, dosing of a patient with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) may be stopped 
temporarily:  
1. Serum creatinine increase that fulfills all of the following criteria:  ≥ 0.3 mg/dL 
(26.5 μmol/L) and ≥ 40% above baseline creatinine va lues and > ULN (refer to definition 
of Baseline in Section  8.6) 
2. Proteinuria, dipstick 2 + (confirmed by [CONTACT_37709] a 
quantitative total urine protein measurement of > 1.0 g/24 hours)  
The possible dosing reinitiation or follow -up schedule for any events meeting either of these 
criteria will be determined by [CONTACT_37855].  
8.7. Adjustment of Dose and/or Treatment Schedule  
Adjustment of dose and/or schedule is not permitted.  
8.8. Discontinuation of Study Drug  
A patient must permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following:  
• The patient becomes pregnant.  Report the pregnancy according to instructions in 
Section 9.5.4. 
• The patient withdraws consent.  
• The patient withdraws from treatment (but does not withdraw consent).  
• The patient experiences an AE that necessitates permanent discontinuation of Study 
Drug. 
• The patient develops laboratory test abnormalities that meet any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84151]  8.6.1, 8.6.2, or 8.6.3. 
• The patient experiences an AE that necessitates unblinding of the Investigator or 
Sponsor to the patient’s treatment assignment.  
The reason for discontinuation of Study Drug must be recorded in the electronic Case Report  
Form (eCRF) and source documentation.  
Patients who discontinue Study Drug will remain in the study and attend the ET Visit 
(Week 17 visit assessments) , unless consent is withdrawn.  Any patient who discontinues early 
from the Treatment Period or from the Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period should be strongly 
encouraged to complete follow -up study visits, procedures and observations  (see Appendix  A). 
  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91822] be withdrawn from study procedures for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• The patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol  
Other reasons for withdrawal of patients from t he study may include the following:  
• At the discretion of the Investigator for medical reasons  
• At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for non -compliance  
• Significant protocol deviation  
All efforts will be made to complete and report the observation s as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdrawal.  All information, including the reason for withdrawal from study, must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Any patient who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from further 
treatment a nd study observation immediately upon the date of request.  These patients should be 
encouraged to complete the ET study procedures (Week  17 visit assessments) and observations 
at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix  A). 
For patients withdrawn for reasons other than withdrawal of consent, every effort should be 
made to complete the ET study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see 
Appendix  A). 
8.10. Concomitant Therapy and Procedures  
The use of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10458]’s 
eCRF.  Adverse events related to administration of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_10459].  
8.10.1. Concomitant Therapy  
A concomitant therapy is any non -protocol-specified drug or substance (including 
over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, and vitamin supplements) administered 
between Screening and the end of the Post -Treatment Period.  
Allowed Concomitant Therapy  
During the course of the study, the use of acute medications (plasma -derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat angioedema 
attacks is allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated with on -demand therapy as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
All other stable medications (if not excluded below) are allowed, so long as the dose and type is 
not expected to change during the study.  
Disallowed Concomitant Therapy  
1. Chronic prophylaxis for angioedema attacks, except for a stable dose of androgens.  Any 
use of lanadelumab will not be permitted.  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
50 NOTE:  The use of acute medications (plasma -derived or recombinant C1 -INH 
concentrate or BK2 -receptor antagonist) to treat angioedema attacks is allowed as 
medically indicated.  
2. ACE inhibitors or any estrogen -containing medications with systemic absorption (such as 
oral contraceptive or hormonal replacement therapy).  
3. Any oligonucleotides (including small interfering RNA) other than ISIS  721744. 
4. Plasmapheresis.  
5. Any other investigational drug or device.  
8.10.2. Concomitant Procedures  
A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) 
or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between 
Screening and the end of the Post -Treatment Period.  
8.11. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_84217]. 
9. SERIOUS AND NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT RE PORTING  
9.1. Sponsor Review of Safety Information  
Safety information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by [CONTACT_84218]/or designee Standard Operating Procedures throughout 
the conduct of the clinical study.  
9.2. Regulatory Requirements  
The Sponsor  or designee  is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the 
Investigators of SAEs including  S[LOCATION_003]Rs per the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) 
guidelines E2A and ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) .  Country-specific regulatory 
requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines.  
Institutional Review Boards/IECs will be notified of any SAE according to applicable 
regulations.  The DSMB will be notified of any SAE as specified in the DSMB Charter.  
In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the  Sponsor or designee  will evaluate 
the available information and perform an independent assessment of all reported SAEs and 
determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the Study Drug ( ISIS 721744 or placebo) is 
causally related to a reported SAE.  While the Sponsor may upgrade an Invest igator’s decision, it 
is not permissible to downgrade the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_84152] a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
Appropriate personnel at the Sponsor or designee will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting.  The Sponsor or designee will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs to regulatory agencies in 
blinded or unblinded fashion according to local law.  The Sponsor or designee will submit 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Investigators in a blinded fashion.  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
51 9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1. Adverse Event  
An AE ca n be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
An AE can therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered  related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
Baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from Study Drug  
• Events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive procedures such as 
biopsies) 
9.3.2. Adverse Drug Reaction and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
Adverse Drug Reaction  
In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not have been established, adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) are defined as follows:  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should 
be considered ADRs.  
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between the 
medicinal product and the AE has been determined by [CONTACT_10548] a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship c annot be ruled out.  
Suspected Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
A suspected unexpected ADR is any ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information, e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction. 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
52 9.3.3. Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the 
following cr iteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening; that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate 
risk of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that , had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10461] 24 hours to a medical 
facility and does not always qualify as an AE 
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient 
(whether the patient is male or female)  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require 
medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe according to National Cancer Institute Common  
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]); the event itself may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on t he eCRF.  
9.3.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
For the purpose of this study, severe reductions in platelet count < 50,000/mm3 accompanied by 
a major bleeding (MB) event or clinically relevant non -major bleeding (CRNMB) event, or 
platelet count of < 25,000/mm3 independent of a MB or CRNMB event, or any thrombotic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_84153] (AESIs) and  are subject to 15 -day expedited 
reporting by [CONTACT_10651].  
9.4. Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events  
Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as 
ISIS [ADDRESS_91823] of patient s afety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
(regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor  or designee 
within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the  event.  The collection of SAEs will  
begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the end of the patient’s  Post-Treatment 
Period, which is defined as completion of the Week  26/ET Visit .  Serious adverse events should 
be reported using electronic SAE submission (via eDC) whenever po ssible.  In situations where 
electronic SAE submission is unavailable, a paper Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be 
completed and a copy should be faxed or emailed to the Sponsor or designee.  The SAE 
reporting instructions, including the fax numbe r and email address, can be found in the 
Investigator Site File for the study.   
Detailed information should be actively sought and included as Follow -Up as soon as additional 
information becomes available.  All SAEs will be followed until resolution.  Ser ious adverse 
events that remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified follow -up visit will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_10552].  If the Investigator and Sponsor agree that the 
patient’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigat or and Sponsor will determine the 
follow-up requirement.  
9.4.2. Non-Serious Adverse Events  
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the 
end of the patient’s Post -Treatment Period, which is defined as completion of the Week  26/ET 
Visit.  The Investigator will monitor each patient closely and record all  observed or volunteered 
AEs on the eCRF.  
9.4.3. Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non -Serious) 
The Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_84154] : 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to the Study Drug  
The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo)  is characterized by 1 of the 
following:  
• Related:  There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) , e.g., confirmation by [CONTACT_38000] -challenge test  
• Possible:   The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, 
concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and Study Dru g (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., 
concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal relationship 
to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration and/or exposure suggests that 
a causal relationship  is unlikely (for reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be 
grouped together with Not Related)  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
54 • Not Related:   The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_8130]’s underlying medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator 
believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or 
placebo) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity 
The severity of AEs and SAEs relating to laboratory tests and AEs at the injection s ite will be 
graded based on criteria from the CTCAE Version 5.0, November 2017 (refer to Appendix  D).  
Any AE not listed in Appendix  D will be graded as follows:  
• Mild:  The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_10553]’s 
usual daily activities  
• Moderate:  The event causes the patient more discomfort and interrupts the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe:  The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the 
patient’s usual daily activities  
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria  must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section 9.3.3). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action Taken with Study Drug  
Down-titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo)  will not be allowed during the study.  
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo)  due to an AE is characterized by 1 of the 
following:  
• None:  No changes made to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration and 
dose 
• Not Applicable:   AE reported during the Screening Period prior to Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo)  administration  
• Permanently Discontinued:   Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo)  discontinued and 
not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose:   Dosing and/or dosing  
frequency temporarily interrupted/changed or delayed due to the AE and restarted at 
the same dose  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment Given for Adverse Event  
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for the AE should be recorded on the 
eCRF.  Treatment should also be recorded on the concomitant treatment or ancillary procedures 
eCRF, as appropriate.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Outcome of the Adverse Event  
If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following:  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
55 • AE Persists:   Patient terminates from the study and the AE continues  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the AE  
• Became Serious:   The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Ons et Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable):   AE severity changed  
If the event is an SAE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following:  
• Ongoing:   SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non -serious AE):   Patient has not full y recovered but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE eCRF 
(the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:   Patient recovered completely from the SAE (the dat e of recovery should 
be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Recovered with Sequelae:   The signs/symptoms of the reported SAE have improved 
but not completely resolved, and a new baseline for the patient is established since 
full recovery is not expected  
• Fatal:  Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution date)  
• Unknown:   The outcome of the reported SAE is not available, e.g., patient is lost to 
follow-up 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Event  
Investigator Follow -up 
During the Study Period, the Investigator should follow each AE until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered  to be 
related to Study Drug or related to study procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
Resolution of AE (with dates) should be documented on the eCRF and in the patient’s medical 
record to facilitate source data verification.   
Investigators sh ould follow -up, or support the Sponsor’s effort to follow up, with all pregnancies 
reported during the study from either the study patient or the female partner of the male study 
patient until pregnancy outcome is available.   
Sponsor Follow -up 
For SAEs an d pregnancy cases in patients who have completed or terminated the study, the 
Sponsor or a designee should follow -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84155] e summaries, 
consultant reports, or autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of 
the reported case.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91824] re sults may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, 
tetany due to hyp ocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever possible, the 
underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  
Clinically significant abnormalities will be monitored by [CONTACT_84219] p arameter 
returns to its baseline value or until agreement is reached between the Investigator and Sponsor 
Medical Monitor.  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically significant (NCS) by [CONTACT_10555].  Similarly, labo ratory abnormalities reported as AEs 
by [CONTACT_37724].  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports.  The signed 
clinical laboratory reports will serve as source docume nts and should include the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values.  
9.5.2. Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]; the Study Center must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled t reatment was 
scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the patient’s 
consent to participate in the study  
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely 
scheduled treatment was present before an d did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_10464]’s consent to participate in the study and the 
timing of the procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
9.5.3. Dosing Errors  
Study Drug ( ISIS 721744 or placebo) dosing errors (including overdose, underdose, and 
administration error) should be documented as protocol deviations.  A brief description should be 
provided in t he deviation, including whether the patient was symptomatic (list symptoms) or 
asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional.  
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing eCRF.  If the patient takes a dose of Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) that exceeds protocol specifications and the patient is symptomatic, 
then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section  9.4. 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose 
being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an AE, but 
it may result in an AE.  All AEs associated with an overdose or  incorrect administration of Study 
Drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated AE fulfills seriousness 
criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24  hours 
after learning of the event).  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
57 Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the “Guidance for 
Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure and  contact [CONTACT_10557] 
[ADDRESS_91825] learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow -up 
information including delivery or termination is reported by [CONTACT_10558] ‘Follow -up’ on the 
Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours.  
Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the patient’s 
responsibility.   
Female patients :  If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the study (including the 
Post-Treatment Period), a pregnancy test will be performed.  The pa tient with a confirmed 
pregnancy will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug.  However, the 
patient will be encouraged to complete the Post -Treatment Period of the study to the extent that 
study procedures do not interfere with the pregnan cy.  Regardless of continued study 
participation, the study physician will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the 
progress of the pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., 
delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a 
child, the Study Center and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical 
records to obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A 
longer follow-up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical condition.  
Follow-up will be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10560]; e.g., pregnancy ICF may be required.  
Male patients :  The progres s of the pregnancy of a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor m ay 
follow-up with the mother and may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records to 
obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A longer 
follow-up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical con dition.  Follow -up will 
be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10559]; 
e.g., partner ICF may be required.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
The sections below indicate the overall structure and approach to the analy sis of this study.  A 
detailed SAP incorporating these sections below will be prepared separately.  The SAP will 
outline all data handling conventions, including software, and specify additional statistical 
methods to be used for analysis.  The study objec tives and endpoints are listed in Sections  1.1 
and 1.2, respectively.  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
58 10.1. Sample Size Considerations  
The study will enroll a total of approximately 24 patients with HAE.  Approximately 18 patients 
with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A o f the study and, in parallel, 
approximately 6  patients with HAE -nC1-INH are planned to be enrolled in Part B of the study.  
Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended early if Study Centers are 
unable to enroll sufficient patients;  this will not impact completion of Part A.  Patients with 
HAE-1/HAE-2 (Part A) will be randomized to SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo 
administered every 4  weeks in a 2:1  ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo), and patients with 
HAE-nC1-INH (Part B) will  be administered open -label SC injections of ISIS  721744 80  mg 
every 4 weeks.  
The sample size of 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 (12 patients administered SC injections of 
ISIS 721744 80 mg and 6 patients administered placebo) is from clinical considerations for 
sufficient safety and tolerability evaluation.  The primary endpoint is the time -normalized 
number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week  [ADDRESS_91826] 90% power for the primary 
endpoint, considering a 10% missing dat a or dropout rate for both active treatment and placebo.  
There is no statistical rationale for the sample size of [ADDRESS_91827] 1 dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all enrolled or randomized patients.  
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all patients in the ITT Population who are treated 
according to the protocol without any major deviations.  
The PK Population will include all patients who are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) and have at least [ADDRESS_91828]  
An independent DSMB will be established prior to the initiation of the study.  The DSMB will 
be responsible for monitoring the overall safe conduc t of the study.  Based on its ongoing 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned.  
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020

including early withdrawals due to AEs, will also be provided.  
All TEAEs, all TEAEs potentially related to Study Drug, all treatment -emergent SAEs, and all 
treatment -emergent SAEs potentially related to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be 
summarized.  
Laboratory tests to ensure patient sa fety, including chemistry panel, complete blood count with 
differential, coagulation panel, and complement, will be summarized by [CONTACT_84221].  These safety variables will also be presented as change and percent change 
from Baselin e over time after Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration, as 
appropriate.  
Vital sign and ECG measures will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  In addition, the number of 
patients who experience abnormalities in clinical laboratory evaluations wil l be summarized by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
10.6.3. Efficacy Analysis  
The ITT Population will be used for all efficacy analyses.  The PP Population will be used for a 
sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of the efficacy analysis results.

For Part A, the time -normalized number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week  5 to Week  17 
and the time -normalized number of moderate or severe HAE attacks (per month) from Week  [ADDRESS_91830] to the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_1570].  Continuous variables will also be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance or analysis of variance.  The least -squares means, standard 
errors, and the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals for the treatment group and placebo group will 
be presented.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_84222].  Categorical variables will be analyzed using a Pearson’s Chi -square test or 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.  
The Part B data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Efficacy  Analysis 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints include the number of HAE attack -free patients by [CONTACT_10585]  17 and 
potential exposure response analysis using relevant exposure parameters and biomarkers.  All 
exploratory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the sa me methods as described for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
10.6.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
The plasma PK of ISIS 721744 will be assessed following SC administration.  For all patients, 
Pre-Dose (trough) and Post-Treatment plasma ISIS [ADDRESS_91831]-Treatment follow up ISIS 721744 plasma concentrations, if data 
permits.  For patients in the PK sub group, non-compartmental PK analysis of ISIS 721744 will 
be carried out on each individual patient dataset.   
Pharmacokinetic parameters include (but are not limited to) the following:  C max, Tmax, AUC, and  
t½.  Other plasma PK parameters, as appropriate, may be determined or calculated at the 
discretion of the PK scientist.  
Metabolite identification and profiling may be conducted on select plasma samples.  
Plasma PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Additional details 
regarding the PK analysis along with  immunogenicity  (IM) analysis will be described in the 
SAP. 
Analysis of potential exposure -response relationship between biomarkers and PK measures may 
also be explored.  
Population PK and PK/PD analyses may be performed using PK data from this study , and/or 
combined with other ISIS 721744 clinical PK/PD data later in the development timeline.  
11. INVESTIGATOR’S REGUL ATORY OBLIGATIONS  
11.1. Informed Consent  
The written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential 
patient popu lation, based on an English version provided by [CONTACT_16015].  
Before a patient’s participation in the study, the Investigator is responsible for obtaining written 
informed consent from the patient after adequate explanation of the aims, methods,  anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening 
procedures or any Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo ) are administered.  The patient must be 
given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in th e study.   
The acquisition of informed consent and the patient’s agreement or refusal to notify his/her 
primary care physician  should be documented in the patient’s medical records and the ICF 
should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_84223] (not necessarily an Investigator).  The original signed ICF should be 
retained in the Study Master File and in any other locations required by [CONTACT_10569], and a 
copy of the signed consent form  should be provided to the patient.

Investigator should notify the IEC/IRB  of deviations from the protocol in accordance with ICH 
GCP.  The Investigator should also notif y the IEC/IRB  of SAEs occurring at the Study Center 
and other AE reports received from the Sponsor or designee, in accordance with local 
procedures.  
The Investigator will be responsible for obtaining annual IEC/IRB  approval/renewal throughout 
the duration of the study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_5699]’s reports, all IEC/IRB  submissions and the 
IEC/IRB continuance of approval must be sent to the Sponsor or designee.  
11.4. Patient Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that the patient’s confidentiality is maintai ned.  On the case report 
forms or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designee, patients should be identified by 
[CONTACT_10573] (if permitted by [CONTACT_1769]) and a patient identification number only.  Documents that are 
not for submission to the Sponsor or  designee (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict 
confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
In compliance with federal and local regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the 
Investigator and institution permit authorized representatives of the compan y, of the regulatory 
agency(s), and the IEC/IRB direct access to review the patient’s original medical records for 
verification of study -related procedures and data.  Direct access includes examining, analyzing, 
verifying, and reproducing any records and r eports that are important to the evaluation of the 
study.  The Investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the patient to permit 
named representatives to have access to his/her study -related records without violating the 
confidentiality o f the patient.  
12. ADMINISTRATIVE AND L EGAL OBLIGATIONS  
12.1. Protocol Amendments  
Protocol amendments must be made only with the prior approval of the Sponsor or designee.  
Agreement from the Investigator must be obtained for all protocol amendments and amendments 
to the informed consent document.  The regulatory authority and IEC/IRB m ust be informed of 
all amendments and give approval for any amendments likely to affect the safety of the patients 
or the conduct of the study.  The Investigator must send a copy of the approval letter from the 
IEC/IRB to the Sponsor or designee.  
ISIS [ADDRESS_91832].  The Investigator/Sponsor or designee shoul d notify the IEC/IRB in writing of the 
study’s completion or ET and send a copy of the notification to the Sponsor or designee.  
12.3. Study Documentation and Storage  
An eCRF utilizing an Electronic Data Capture application will be used for this study.  
The Invest igator should ensure that all appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has 
delegated study duties are recorded on a Sponsor -approved Delegation of Site Responsibilities 
Form. 
Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which the p atient’s case report 
form data are obtained.  These include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office 
charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, imaging, and correspondence .  In this study, eCRFs 
may not be used as source documents.  
The Investigator and Study Center staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and 
centralized filing system of all study -related (essential) documentation in accordance with ICH 
GCP, suitable for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_84227]/or 
applicable regulatory authorities.  Elements should include the following:  
• Patient files containing completed case report forms, informed consents, and 
supporting copi[INVESTIGATOR_10467]  
• Study files containing the protocol with  all amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_10468] -study documentation and all correspondence to and from the IEC/IRB 
and the Sponsor or designee  
• If drug supplies are maintained at the Study Center, proof of receipt, Study Drug 
Product Accountability Record, Return of Study Drug Product for Destruction, final 
Study Drug product reconciliation, and all drug -related correspondence  
In addition, all original source documents supporting entries in the case report forms must be 
maintained and be readily avai lable. 
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor or 
designee and the Investigator.  Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to 
another party or move them to another location, he/she must noti fy the Sponsor or designee.  
12.4. Study Monitoring  
The Sponsor representative and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contact[CONTACT_10575], upon request, inspecting 
the various records of the study (e.g., case report forms and other pertinent data) provided that 
patient confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor monitor or designee is responsible for inspecting the case report forms at regular 
intervals throughout the study to ver ify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and 
ISIS 721744 -CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3  
Protocol  5 May 2020  
 
64 consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  
The monitor should have access to patient medical records and other study -related records 
needed to  verify the entries on the case report forms.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the 
course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing case report forms, are resolved.  
In accordance  with ICH GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit 
by [CONTACT_10576]’s Clinical Quality Assurance Department (or designees).  
Inspection of Study Center facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, labora tories) and review

Note: When multiple procedures are scheduled at the same visit, clinical assessments and procedures should be performed prior to St udy Drug administration, 
unless otherwise indicated, and should proceed in the following order:  vital signs, physical examinations , patient-reported outcomes (such as the AAS and 
the AE-QoL questionnaire), ECGs, and collection of blood and/or urine for laboratory assessments.   
1 The Screening Period is up to 8 weeks in dur ation.  A patient may be randomized after fewer than 8 weeks of Screening if the patient experiences ≥ [ADDRESS_91835] will be performed during Screening and urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at all other study visits.   
6 If the platelet value, serum creatinine, or liver enzyme  tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007], hemolysis, or quantity not sufficient) or missing, a 
repeat blood specimen should be re -drawn as soon as possible (ideally within 7 days).  
[ADDRESS_91836] HAE genetic diagnostic testing results prior to Screening.  
10 The AAS questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_84208] a daily basis (minimum of 4 daily assessments per week) for the durati on of the study.  Patient s will 
be instructed on the use of the AAS during Screening and will record their HAE attacks using the AAS throughout the Screening  Period (daily during up to 
8 consecutive weeks) to confirm study eligibility; patients are required to experience at least 2 HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84206]) during the Screening Period to be eligible for enrollment.  If a patient experiences a third attack, the patien t should be randomized as soon as 
possible, assuming all other screening ac tivities have been completed and the patient meets all other eligibility requirements; in such cases, the Screening 
Period may be shorter than [ADDRESS_91837] the patient once 
a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91838] with the patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have o ccurred.  In addition, during study 
visits, site personnel will inquire about any new HAE attack information that was not provided through patient contact [CONTACT_4490] t he site. 
12 The following details relating to the localization, severity, and course of all HAE attacks that occured s ince the previous visit will be collected:   date/time of 
symptom onset; description of symptoms; location of symptoms (peripheral angioedema, abdominal angioedema, or laryngeal angio edema); impact of HAE 
attack on activity level; HAE attack severity (mild,  moderate, or severe); need for assistance, medical intervention, emergency room visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
medications to treat the attack; HAE attack course, including if the HAE attack(s) in question was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84157] p atient, or if there was  an alternative 
diagnosis; and date/time symptoms resolved.  The number of HAE attacks that required on -demand treatment, and the frequency and dose of on -demand 
treatment, will also be recorded.

PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 2a Study to Assess the 
Clinical Efficacy of ISIS 721744, a Second-Generation  Ligand-Conjugated  Antisense 
Inhibitor of Prekallikrein, in Patients with Hereditary Angioedema  
Study Phase 2a 
Indication  Hereditary  angioedema  (HAE) 
Primary 
Objective  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of antisense 
inhibitor of prekallikrein  (ISIS 721744) in patients with HAE type 1 (HAE-1), HAE 
type 2 (HAE -2), or HAE with normal C1 -inhibitor (C1 -INH). 
Secondary 
Objectives  The secondary  objectives  of the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability  of 
ISIS 721744 in patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 or HAE with normal C1-INH (HAE-nC1- 
INH) and to evaluate the effect of ISIS 721744 on plasma prekallikrein (PKK) and 
other relevant biomarkers.  
Exploratory 
Objectives  The exploratory objectives of the study are to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
ISIS 721744 (as a total full -length antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), including fully 
conjugated, partially conjugated, and unconjugated ISIS 721744) over time and to 
assess potential PK/pharm acodynamic  (PD) correlations  on relevant biomarkers  and 
clinical outcomes, as appropriate.  
Study Design The study will be randomized,  double-blind, and placebo-controlled  in Part A and will 
be open-label in Part B.  
Number of 
Patients Approximately 24 patients with HAE are planned to be enrolled in the study: 
approximately 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A of 
the study, and, in parallel, approximately  6 patients  with HAE-nC1-INH are planned to 
be enrolled  in Part B of the study.  Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in 
Part B may be ended early if Study Centers are unable to enroll  sufficient  patients with 
HAE-nC1-INH; this will not impact completion of Part A.  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91878] provide written informed consent (signed and dated) and any 
authorizations required by [CONTACT_84174].

Prohibited 
Concomitant 
Medications  The following  medications/procedures  will not be permitted  during the study: 
• Chronic prophylaxis  for angioedema  attacks, except for a stable dose of 
androgens.  Any use of lanadelumab will not be permitted.  
NOTE: The use of acute medications (plasma -derived or recombinant C1 -INH 
concentrate  or BK2-receptor antagonist)  to treat angioedema  attacks is allowed as 
medically indica ted. 
• ACE inhibitors  or any estrogen-containing  medications  with systemic absorption 
(such as oral contraceptive or hormonal replacement therapy).  
• Any oligonucleotides  (including  small interfering  RNA) other than ISIS 721744.  
• Plasmapheresis.  
• Any other investigational  drug or device.  
Treatment 
Groups A total of approximately 24 patients in Parts A and B combined will be administered 
SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks.  Patients will be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE, (i.e., either HAE-1/HAE-2 in 
Part A or HAE -nC1-INH in Part B) as follows:  
• In Part A, approximately  18 patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 will be randomized  to 
SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio  
(ISIS 721744:placeb o). 
• In Part B, approximately  6 patients with HAE-nC1-INH will be administered 
open-label SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg.  Due to the rarity of  
HAE-nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended early if Study Centers are 
unable to enroll sufficient  patients; this will not impact the completion  of Part A. 
Study Drug 
Dosage and 
Administration  The Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) is contained  in 2-mL stoppered  glass vials. 
The Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) and its storage and preparation instructions 
will be provided by [CONTACT_16015].  The Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or 
placebo) must be stored securely at 2 °C to 8 °C and be protected from light.  
During the Treatment  Period, Study Drug (ISIS 721744  or placebo) will be 
administered as a single SC injection every 4 weeks.  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91883] dose level of 80 mg produced near-complete 
 reduction  of plasma PKK levels (a mean reduction  of 93.6% from Baseline on Day 99 
 [[ADDRESS_91884] dose]). The estimated  half-life (t½) from the Phase 1 PK data 
 was approximately  4 to 5 weeks, supporting  the once-every-28-day dosing regimen. 
 Pharmacokinetic/PD  analysis of the Phase 1 data suggested  very minor differences  in 
 plasma PKK reductions  at doses higher than 80 mg. 
Adjustment  of 
Dose and/or 
Treatment 
Schedule  Down-titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will not be allowed during the 
study. 
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) due to an adverse event (AE) 
is characterized by 1 of the following:  
 • None: No changes made to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration 
and dose.  
 • Not Applicable:  AE reported during the Screening  Period prior to Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration.  
 • Permanently  Discontinued:  Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) discontinued 
and not restarted.  
 • Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose:  Dosing and/or dosing 
frequency  temporarily  interrupted/changed  or delayed due to the AE and restarted 
at the same dose.  
Study Visit 
Schedule  and 
Procedures  The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will 
be allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either HAE-1/HAE-2 
in Part A or HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A is randomized, double -blind, and 
placebo-controlled; and Part B is open -label. The study visit schedule and procedures 
are nearly identical in Part A and Part B, and thus are presented together; any 
differences are indicated where applicable.  
Patients will be screened for eligibility  criteria following  written informed consent. 
During the Screening Period, the following assessments will be performed: 
demographics; medical history, including a detailed HAE history; prior and 
concomitant medications, including type of prophylaxis (if used) and type of acute 
treatment;  HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C screening;  pregnancy  testing for women of 
childbearing potential and FSH testing for confirmation of menopause per inclusion 
criteria; quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_84178] (AE QoL) 
questionnaire; attack frequency, as assessed by [CONTACT_84179]  
8 consecutive weeks, and confirmed by [CONTACT_737]; HAE attack assessment; 
physical examinations, i ncluding vital signs, body height, and weight; 
electrocardiograms  (ECGs); AEs; PD blood sampling;  inflammatory  panel; and clinical 
laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91885] experience a minimum of 2 HAE attacks 
(assessed by [CONTACT_84180]) to be eligible for the study; 
patients will be instructed to report details of any HAE attack to the study site within 
[ADDRESS_91886] the patient once a week (at approximately  [ADDRESS_91887] with 
the patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred.  If a patient 
experiences a third attack, the patient should be randomized as soon as possible, 
assuming all other screening activities have been completed and the patient meets all 
other eligibility requirements; in such cases, the Screening Period may be shorter  than 
8 weeks. 
 During the course of the study, the use of acute medications (plasma derived or 
recombinant  C1 INH concentrate,  BK2-receptor antagonist,  or kallikrein  inhibitor)  to 
treat angioedema attacks is allowed as medically indicated.  Patients can be treated 
with on demand therapy as determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
 After a Screening  Period of up to [ADDRESS_91888] 
2 documented  attacks (assessed by  [CONTACT_84237])  during 
the Screening  Period will be enrolled and/or randomized  to receive ISIS 721744 80 mg 
or placebo (Part A) or open label ISIS  721744 80 mg (Part B) every 4 weeks for a total 
Treatment Period of 12 weeks.  
 Study Drug will be administered as a SC injection in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area 
of the upper arm by [CONTACT_84182] (if available and after dosing instructions and training are provided by 
[CONTACT_1746]).  The first dose of  Study Drug will be administered at the 
Study Center on Day 1.  Study Center personnel (or Home Healthcare if available), 
will complete procedures per the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A.  After 
completion  of the Week [ADDRESS_91889] to enroll in the Open-Label 
Extension (OLE) Study (ISIS 721744 -CS3), pending study approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC 
and the appropriate regulatory authority, and will need to sign the Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approved inf ormed consent.  Patients 
who complete Study Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility requirements, may start the 
treatment period in the CS3 study anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91890] -Treatment Evaluation Period.  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91891]-Treatment Periods, the following data will be collected:  daily AAS and number 
of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180]); number of 
HAE attacks that required on -demand treatment; HAE attack details, including 
localization,  severity, course, and details of any required treatment  (i.e., frequency  and 
dose); and vital signs.  Throughout the Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods, site 
personnel will contact [CONTACT_84183] a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91892] wi th the patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred. 
In addition, at study visit time points, site personnel will inquire about any new HAE 
attack information that was not provided through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  See 
Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_91893]-Treatment Periods to assess PD and coagulation parameters, including, but not 
limited to: plasma PKK, plasma proenzyme  activation,  cleaved high molecular  weight 
kininogen (cHK)  levels, D-dimer levels, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 
plasmin-antiplasmin  complexes,  C4 split products, and platelet counts. Blood samples 
will also be collected regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.  
Additional  assessments  will be performed  throughout  the study as indicated in the 
Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix A . 
 Patients who discontinue  treatment  will remain in the study and attend the Early 
Termination (ET) Visit unless consent is withdrawn.  
 Detailed information regarding the CS2 procedures is presented in Section [ADDRESS_91894] of laboratory  analytes required for the study.

Exploratory 
Endpoints  Exploratory  endpoints  include the following:  
• The number of HAE attack-free patients by [CONTACT_10585] 17 
• PK parameters, including, but not limited to:  maximum observed plasma 
concentration  (Cmax), time to Cmax, area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve, and t ½ 
• Potential exposure-response analysis using relevant exposure parameters  and 
biomarkers  
Safety 
Endpoints  The safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744 will be assessed by [CONTACT_84184], type, severity, and dose-relationship  of AEs; vital signs; ECGs; and clinical 
laboratory parameters.  Safety results in patients dosed with ISIS 721744 will be 
compared to safety results in patients dosed with placebo.  
Statistical 
Considerations  The sample size of 18 patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 (12 patients administered  
SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg and 6 patients administered placebo) is from 
clinical considerations for sufficient safety and tolerability evaluation.  The primary 
endpoint is the time-normalized  number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_91895] 90% power for the primary 
endpoint, considering a 10% missing data or dropout rate for both active treatment 
and placebo.  There is no statistical rationale for the s ample size of [ADDRESS_91896] (DSMB) will be established  prior 
to the initiation of the study.  The DSMB will be responsible for monitoring the 
overall safe conduct of the study.  Based on its ongoing assessment of the safety and 
tolerability  of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide recommendations  to the Sponsor 
for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned.  Details on the safety 
assessments, frequency of review, meeting schedules an d controlled access to 
unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and Statistical Analysis Plan.

2. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
2.1. Overview  of Disease 
Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by [CONTACT_84186][INVESTIGATOR_84145],  painful abdominal  attacks, and, occasionally,  laryngeal attacks 
that can be life -threatening.  The disorder is classified in 3 subtypes.  Hereditary angioedema 
Type I (HAE -1) and Type II (HAE -2) are caused by [CONTACT_84187][INVESTIGATOR_1645]1  gene, resulting in either decreased levels of C1-INH (HAE-1) or loss-of-function of 
this protein (HAE -2) (Bissler et al. 1997 ). The third form of HAE is associated with normal 
levels and function of C1 -INH (HAE -nC1-INH). This form is currently categorized as  
4 subtypes, with either specific genetic mutations in the factor XII gene, the plasminogen gene,  
or the angiopoietin -1 gene, or due to an unknown cause ( Maurer et al. 2018 ). Extensive  
evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies supports the key role of bradykinin (BK) in HAE 
attacks, although the data linking HAE -nC1-INH with BK are less strong ( Zuraw and 
Christiansen  2016). Diagnosing  HAE-nC1-INH can be challenging  given the large heterogeneity 
of this patient population, the lack of diagnostic tests, and the fact that specific ge netic mutations 
account only partially for the occurrence of this type of HAE.  Recently, a threshold -stimulated 
kallikrein activity assay was shown to discriminate BK -mediated angioedema from histamine - 
mediated angioedema ( Lara‑Marquez et al. 2018 ). This technique may, therefore, enhance the 
identification of HAE -nC1-INH patients that are likely to benefit from inhibition of the contact 
[CONTACT_84239].  
Treatment  options for HAE include on-demand treatment  of attacks and prophylaxis.  
On-demand options include supplementation  of C1-INH (either plasma-derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate) and inhibition of BK2 receptor activation (BK2 -receptor antagonist).  In 
addition, tranexamic acid may relieve symptoms in non -severe angioedema attacks.  
Prophylactic regimens for HAE include plasma-derived C1-INH concentrate  (administered  either

intravenously or subcutaneously [SC]), attenuated androgens, antifibrinolytics and a recently 
Food and Drug Administration -approved monoclonal  antibody directed against plasma kallikrein 
(PKa). Kallikrein circulates in plasma as a zymogen (i.e., PKK) which is bound to one of its 
main substrates, high molecular weight kininogen (HK).  Prekallikrein is cleaved upon contact 
[CONTACT_84188], forming the active pro tease PKa.  Plasma kallikrein cleaves HK in turn, thereby 
[CONTACT_84189].  The binding of BK to the BK2 receptor leads to 
activation of various intracellular signaling pathways resulting in vasodilation, chemotaxis of 
neutrophils,  and increased  vascular permeability  and fluid efflux, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_84159] ( Zuraw and Christiansen 2016 ). 
 
2.2. Therapeutic  Rationale  
ISIS 721744 is a second -generation, ligand -conjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) drug 
designed to reduce the production  of PKK mRNA. Antisense  technology  is characterized  by [CONTACT_84190] a single -gene product, thereby [CONTACT_84240]-target drug effects.  Furthermore, since ligand -conjugated ASOs requi re infrequent 
administration,  ~once every month or even less often, the availability  of a plasma PKK inhibitor 
could be of additional value to the arsenal of prophylactic drugs for the prevention of HAE 
attacks. The long t ½ of second -generation antisense drugs and the lower frequency of 
administration afforded by [CONTACT_84241].  
The Phase 1 clinical data show that ISIS 721744 inhibits plasma PKK effectively  in a 
dose-dependent manner without safety concerns.  
 
2.3. ISIS 721744 
2.3.1. Mechanism  of Action 
ISIS 721744 is an N-acetyl galactosamine  (GalNAc 3)-conjugated,  second-generation  ASO drug 
targeted to human PKK.  It is complementary to the translated regions (Exon 9) of the PKK 
protein messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and, following cleavage of the GalNAc 3 moiety, 
binds to the mRNA by [CONTACT_37800].  The hybridization (binding) of  
ISIS 721744 to the  cognate mRNA results in the ubiquitous endonuclease that specifically 
hydrolyzes  the RNA strand in RNA/DNA  hybrids (RNase H1)-mediated degradation  of the PKK 
mRNA, thus preventing production of the PKK protein.  Maximal antisense -mediated reduction 
of target mRNA levels is typi[INVESTIGATOR_37497] 90% of control levels in sensitive tissues (Crooke 
and Bennett 1996 ; Zhang et al. 2010 ). Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels using this 
approach correlates directly with a subsequent reduct ion in target protein levels.  
2.3.2. Chemistry  
Chemically, ISIS 721744 is a synthetic oligomer  of 20 nucleotides (i.e., a 20 -mer) that are 
connected  sequentially  by [CONTACT_84242] (mixed backbone 
design). The nucleotide sequence of ISIS 721744 ( Figure 1) is complementary to a  
20-nucleotide stretch within Exon 9 of the PKK protein mRNA.  Structurally, the 
oligonucleotide has 4 regions.  Two (2) of them, the 5 nucleotides at the 5′ end and the 
5 nucleotides  at the 3′ end, are composed  of 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)  (2′-MOE)-modified 
ribonucleotides.  These 2′-MOE-modified nucleotides  confer (1) increased  affinity to the target 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.0

mRNA (Altmann et al. 1996 ; McKay et al. 1999 ), (2) increased resistance to exonucleases and 
endonucleases  (thereby [CONTACT_84243]) (Geary et al. 2003), and (3) amelioration  of 
some of the high -dose toxicities thereby [CONTACT_84244]-generation antisense drugs containing phosphorothioate modified oligodeoxynucleotides 
(Henry et al. 2000 ). The third region, the central portion of the oligonucleotide, is composed of 
10 oligodeoxynucleotides.  This chimeric design is called a MOE -Gapmer, and ISIS 721744 
employs this chimeric structure to enable use of the RNase H1-mechanism  for antisense activity. 
This is because while the 2′ -MOE modification confers increased stability and affinity, it does 
not support RNase H1 -catalyzed cleavage of ribonucleic acid (RNA) hybridized to  
2′-MOE-modified nucleotides  (McKay et al. 1999). This is caused by [CONTACT_84245] 2′ -alkoxy:RNA hybrids that are not recognized by [CONTACT_37695] H1 
enzyme (Inoue et al. 1987 ; Monia et al. 1993 ). By [CONTACT_37761] 2′ -MOE modification to 
nucleotides flanking the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide core, the beneficial attributes 
of the 2′-MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase H1 recognition.  A 
fourth region, comprised of a triantennary cluster of GalNAc 3 sugars, is linked to the 5ʹ end of 
ISIS 721744 via a phosphodiester linkage.  The GalNAc 3 cluster is a high -affinity ligand for the 
asialoglycoprotein receptor, a receptor expressed primarily on the surface of liver hepatocytes 
(Stockert 1995 ). The GalNAc 3 cluster enhances delivery of ISIS 721744 to liver hepatocytes 
over other cell types and enhances potency.  After internalization into cells,  the GalNAc 3 cluster 
is metabolized to release “free ASO” inside the cell ( Prakash et al. 2014 ). The internucleosidic 
linkages are a mixture of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester.  The phosphorothioate linkages 
are introduced into the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) gap region and at both ends of the 
oligonucleotide to protect it from nuclease mediated metabo lism. The mixed backbone design 
reduces the total number of phosphorothioate linkages, which reduces non -specific interactions 
with proteins and further enhances potency and therapeutic  index of GalNAc 3-conjugated  ASOs.

2.3.3. Preclinical  Experience  
Detailed information  concerning  the preclinical  studies conducted  with PKK ASO ISIS 546254, 
its 5ʹ-GalNAc 3-conjugated mixed backbone variant ISIS 721744, and mouse surrogate PKK 
ASOs can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The results support the concept that inhibition of PKK through antisense mechanism may  serve 
as a new and effective strategy for the prophylaxis of HAE.  Results also strongly support that 
GalNAc 3-conjugation  of PKK ASO significantly  increases the potency of ASO for inhibition  of 
PKK hepatic mRNA and circulatory  protein expression  and thus these ASOs should be a useful 
therapeutic strategy for the prophylactic treatment of HAE.  
 
2.3.4. Clinical Experience  
ISIS 721744 has been evaluated  in the clinical setting in a Phase 1 safety study 
(ISIS 721744 -CS1). All subjects have  completed study  procedures and final safety  and PD data 
are available.  A summary is included below.  Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a 
detailed description  of the preclinical  pharmacology,  nonclinical  toxicology  and PK, as well as a 
description of previous clinical experi ence with other related 2′ -MOE phosphorothioate 
oligonucleotides.  
ISIS 721744 has been studied in 32 healthy volunteers in a double -blind, multiple -dose, 
dose-escalation  study. Of these, 24 subjects received multiple doses of ISIS 721744.  The 
32 subjects w ere randomized into 4 cohorts (6 subjects each) to receive once -every-4-week SC 
doses of ISIS 721744 20, 40, 60, or 80 mg, or placebo (8 subjects) for a total of 12 weeks (4 total 
doses). All subjects received all planned doses of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  The 
duration of Study Drug exposure was [ADDRESS_91901].  
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the ISIS 721744-CS1 study. There were no 
early discontinuations from Study Drug or the study, and all subjects in the IS IS 721744 and 
placebo arms completed all study procedures.  Adverse events at the injection site (defined as 
any preferred term containing “injection site”) were the most commonly reported  
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the ISIS 721744 treatme nt arms; no injection 
site-related TEAEs were reported in the placebo arm. There were no flu-like reactions or events 
of local cutaneous reaction at injection site (LCRIS) reported; LCRIS events were defined as  
(A) moderate or severe injection site erythema,  swelling, pruritus, pain, or tenderness  that started 
on the day of injection and persisted for at least 2 days; or (B) any AE at the injection site, 
regardless of severity, that led to discontinuation of Study Drug, where AE at the injection site  
was the principal reason for discontinuation.  No relationship between incidence of TEAEs and 
the dose administered was observed.  
Thirteen (13) AEs related to study treatment  were reported for 4 (16.7%) subjects in the 
ISIS [ADDRESS_91902] (2  events; 12.5%) in the placebo arm.  One (1) subject each 
in the ISIS [ADDRESS_91903] inversion (preferred  term) that 
were assessed as related.  Nine (9) of the total [ADDRESS_91904] in the 80 mg  arm. Additional related 
events were tinnitus ([ADDRESS_91905], 1 event in the 60 mg arm), headache ([ADDRESS_91906], 1 event in the  
60 mg arm), and epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940] ([ADDRESS_91907], 1 event in the 20 mg arm). All TEAEs related to study 
treatment were mild in severity, and none were serious.

ISIS 721744 resulted in a dose -dependent reduction of PKK concentration and plasma 
proenzyme activation.  The difference in absolute and percent change from Baseline for 
ISIS 721744 vs. placebo was statistically  significant  for PKK concentration  for 40, 60, and 
80 mg (p ≤ 0.043) starting at Day 15, the first evaluation,  and for 20 mg starting at Day 29, and 
for plasma proenzyme activation for all doses (p ≤ 0.002) starting at Day 15.  The nadir was 
generally reached around Day  71, when the percent reduction  with the 80 mg dose was -93.2% 
for PKK concentration and -99.6% for plasma proenzyme activation.  
The difference  in absolute and percent change from Baseline in cHK for ISIS [ADDRESS_91908] that 
enhanced  delivery of ISIS 721744 to hepatocytes  vs. non-parenchymal  cells will result in similar 
PD results as ISIS 546254 at 1/10th to 1/30th of the dose ( Viney et al. 2016 ). 
2.4. Rationale  for Dose and Schedule  of Administration  
The dose level of [ADDRESS_91909] dose level 
of 80 mg produced near -complete reduction of plasma PKK levels (a mean reduction of 93.6% 
from Baseline on Day 99 [[ADDRESS_91910] dose]).  The estimated t ½ from the Phase 1 PK 
data was approximately 4 to 5 weeks, supporting the once -every-28-day dosing regimen.  
Pharmacokinetic/PD  analysis of the Phase 1 data suggested  very minor differences  in plasma 
PKK reductions at doses higher than 80 mg.  
 
2.5. Benefit-Risk Assessment  
2.5.1. Benefit Assessment  
The benefits of treatment of ISIS 721744 are currently unknown.  Due to its mechanism of 
action, ISIS 721744 has the potential to be efficacious  for the treatment  of patients with HAE. 
2.5.2. Risk Assessment  
The known potential risks to study participants  associated  with ISIS 721744 are elaborated  on in 
the “Guidance to Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure.  
There are no anticipated risks associated with reducing plasma PKK levels; however, a potential 
theoretical risk associated with PKK inhibition would be prolongation of activated partia l 
thromboplastin  time (aPTT). This risk is informed by [ADDRESS_91911] been 
described in the literature ( Girolami et al. 2010 ). In these individuals, there is a discrepancy 
between an observed in vitro defect and an absence of bleeding . Thus, it is believed that most 
cases go undetected or, if detected, go unreported.  Occasional bleeding or thrombosis has been 
reported in a few PKK deficient patients but these instances were due to the presence of 
associated risk factors.  Diagnosis is b ased on the prolongation of partial thromboplastin time  
and normal prothrombin time  (PT) and thrombin time. In these individuals,  platelet and vascular 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.0

Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  3 
5 May 2020 
30  
  
tests are normal and  the long partial thromboplastin  time has shown to be fully corrected by [CONTACT_84192].  
In monkeys,  doses of ISIS 721744 of up to 30 mg/kg/wk  for 13 weeks were well-tolerated with 
the exception of thrombocytopenia observed in 1 female at 12 mg/kg/wk and 1 male at  
30 mg/kg/wk.  The monkey dose of 6 mg/kg/wk  provides an approximate  20-fold margin relative 
to a human dose of 80 mg every 4 weeks and therefore there is sufficient therapeutic margin to 
assure the safe clinical use of ISIS 721744 at the proposed clinical dose and regimen.  
One (1) subject in the ISIS 721744-CS1 study had a confirmed  platelet nadir count between 
100 × 103/µL and the lower limit of normal (LLN) (140 × 103/µL). The subject received 
ISIS 721744 at 20 mg and had a platelet count of 139 × 103/µL on Study Day 99; a ll other 
reported values for this subject were within the reference range.  
Platelet counts will be monitored  closely throughout  the clinical study. 
More complete details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
2.5.3. Overall Assessment  of Benefit:Risk  
No specific risks have been identified  with ISIS 721744. The AEs that occurred with the related 
drug ISIS 546254 were unrelated to reduction of PKK.  In addition, the conjugated nature of 
ISIS 721744 is anticipated to reduce  systemic exposure  even further.  Consequently, the  platelet 
count reductions observed with the higher doses of the unconjugated molecule are not 
anticipated to occur at the dose tested in this study.  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize  risk to patients participating  in this study, 
the potential risks identified in association with ISIS 721744 are justified by [CONTACT_84193].  
 
3. EXPERIMENTAL  PLAN 
3.1. Study Design 
This Phase 2a study will be conducted  at multiple Study Centers worldwide  to assess the efficacy 
of ISIS 721744 in approximately  24 patients with HAE.  Part A of the study  will be randomized, 
double-blind, and placebo -controlled; Part B of the study will be open -label. 
The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either  HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or 
HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A is randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled; and 
Part B is open -label. The study  visit schedule and procedures are nearly  identical in Part A and 
Part B, and thus are presented together; any differences are indicated where applicable.  
In Part A, approximately  18 patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 will be randomiz ed to SC injections  of 
ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately  
6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH will be administered open -label SC injections of ISIS 721744 
80 mg. Due to the rarity of HAE-nC1-INH, enrollment  in Part B may be ended early if Study 
Centers are unable to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact the completion of Part A.

Patients who discontinue  treatment  will remain in the study and attend the Early Termination 
(ET) Visit unless consent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information  regarding  the study procedures  is presented  in Section [ADDRESS_91912] of laboratory analytes required for the study.  
 
3.2. Number of Study Centers 
This study will be conducted  at multiple Study Centers worldwide.  
 
3.3. Number of Patients 
A total of approximately 24 patients in Parts A and B combined will be administered SC 
injections  of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks. Patients will be allocated into Part A 
or Part B according to type of HAE, (i.e., either HAE -1/HAE-2 or HAE -nC1-INH): 
approximately  18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A of the study, 
and, in parallel, approximately 6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH are planned to be enrolled in  
Part B of the study.  Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended 
early if Study Centers are unable to enroll sufficient  patients with HAE-nC1-INH; this will not 
impact completion of Part A.  
 
3.4. Overall Study Duration  and Follow-up 
The study will consist of Screening,  Treatment,  and Post-Treatment  Periods. Please refer to the 
Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A . 
Patients may be required to attend additional visits for monitoring of AEs or abnormal 
investigation results. The frequency  of additional  monitoring  will be determined  by [CONTACT_84194].  
The length of each patient’s participation  in the study is approximately  8 months, which includes 
an up to 8-week Screening Period, a 12 -week Treatment Period (patients will receive fixed SC 
doses of Study Drug every 4 weeks during 4 on -site study visits), and a [ADDRESS_91913]-Treatment  Period as determined  by [CONTACT_84195] a patient enrolls in the ISIS 721744-CS3 OLE 
study. 
3.4.1. Screening  
Patient eligibility  for the study will be determined  within 8 weeks (56 days) prior to study entry. 
 
3.4.2. Treatment  Period 
Eligible patients will report to the Study Center for the first administration of Study Drug on 
Study Day 1 (Week 1 Visit) and will continue to receive Study Drug once every  4 weeks during 
the 12-week Treatment Period.  Patients will also return to the Study Center on Week 3 (or 
Home Healthcare (if available), as arranged by  [CONTACT_84246], per the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix A ) for a safety monitoring visit.  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91914]-treatment  follow-up visits (or Home Healthcare 
(if available), as arrang ed by [CONTACT_37747], per the Schedule of Procedures in 
Appendix A at Study Weeks 17, 21, and 26/ET.  Alternatively, patients who complete Study 
Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility requirements, may start the treatment period in the  
ISIS 721744-CS3 OLE study anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91915]-Treatment Evaluation Period.  Patients may be required to attend additional visits for 
monitoring of AEs or abnormal investigation results.  The frequency of additional monitoring 
will be determined by [CONTACT_84196].  
The final study visit, for patients  not enrolling in the OLE, will be the Week 26/ET Visit. 
 
3.5. End-of-Study 
The End-of-Study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study. 
 
3.6. Data and Safety Monitoring  Board 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be assembled to review safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy (as needed) data collected on ISIS 721744 during this study. Based on its ongoing 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned. 
Details on the safety assessments,  frequency  of review, meeting schedules,  and controlled  access 
to unblinded data are outlined in the DSMB Charter and Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
4. PATIENT  ENROLLMENT  
4.1. Screening  
Before patients may be enrolled into the study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the 
Study Center’s written Independent  Ethics Committee  (IEC)/Institutional  Review Board (IRB) 
approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF), and all other patient information  and/or 
recruitment material.  
Patients must sign the consent form before any  screening tests or assessments, prior to screening 
blood draws, are performed.  At the time of consent, the patient will be considered enrolled into 
the study and will be assigned a  unique screening  number before any study procedures,  including 
screening procedures, are performed.  At the time of randomization, patients will be assigned a 
unique patient identification  number. This number will be used to identify the patient throughout 
the study and must be used on all study documentation related t o that patient.  The screening 
number and patient identification number must remain constant throughout the entire study.  
In the event the patient is re-consented  and re-screened,  the patient must be given a new 
screening number.  Screening numbers, once ass igned, will not be re -used.

4.2. Randomization  
Patients will be allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either 
HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or HAE-nC1-INH in Part B). Only Part A will be randomized  and 
placebo-controlled.  
Patients will be enrolled and/or randomized  (Part A only) at the Week [ADDRESS_91916] been completed  and after the Investigator  has verified that they are eligible per 
the criteria in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. No patient may begin treatment prior to randomization  
(Part A only) and assignment  of a unique patient identification  number. 
In Part A, approximately  18 patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 will be randomized  via the Interactive 
Response Technology (IRT) system to SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in a  
2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately  6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH will be 
enrolled via the IRT system to receive open -label SC injections  of ISIS 721744 80 mg.  Due to 
the rarity of HAE-nC1-INH, enrollment  in Part B may be ended early  if Study Centers are unable 
to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact the completion of Part A.  
Randomization  information  will be concealed  from the Investigators  and patients until the end of 
the study, with the exception of an emergency situation involving a patient that requires 
unblinding of the treatment assignment.  
Both ISIS 721744 and placebo will be provided as injections  for SC administrat ion and will be 
identical in appearance.  
4.3. Replacement  of Patients 
Patients who withdraw  from the study will not be replaced. 
Patients whose randomization  code has been broken will not be replaced. 
 
4.4. Unblinding  of Treatment  Assignment  
For Part A, the Sponsor and all patients, monitors, and Study Center personnel related to the 
study will be blinded throughout the study.  However, if a patient has suffered an SAE (as 
defined in Section 9.3.3), and/or when knowledge of the treatment assignment will impact  the 
clinical management  of the patient, the Investigator  will have the ability to unblind the treatment 
assignment for that patient via the IRT system.  
In the case of unblinding, the IRT system will send a blinded notification to the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours to let them know that a patient was unblinded.  In addition, all 
suspected  unexpected  serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  will be unblinded  by [CONTACT_84197] (see Section 9.2). 
Every reasonable  attempt should be made to complete the ET study procedures  and observations 
(see Appendix A ) prior to unblinding,  as knowledge  of the treatment  arm could influence patient 
assessment.

6.1. Study Schedule  
The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients wil l be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either  HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or 
HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  Part A is randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled; and 
Part B is open label.  The study  visit schedule and procedures are nearly  identical in Part A and 
Part B, and thus are presented together; any differences are indicated where applicable.  
All required study procedures  are outlined in Appendix  A. 
The safety of ISIS 721744 will be continually  monitored  throughout the study by [CONTACT_84203].  
The length of each patient’s participation  from Screening  to the last study visit is up to 
approximately 8 months (231 days).

6.1.1. Screening  
Written informed consent for the study will be obtained prior to the performance of any 
study-related procedures,  including  screening  procedures.  A 56-day period is provided for 
completing screening assessments and determining patient eligibility for the study.  
Safety labs may be retested for determination  of patient eligibility  at the Investigator’s  discretion. 
The Sponsor Medical Monitor will be available for consultation, if needed.  
After providing written informed consent, patients will be screened for eligibility criteria. 
During the Screening Period, the following assessments will be performed:  demographics; 
medical history, including  a detailed HAE history; prior  and concomitant  medications,  including 
type of prophylaxis (if used) and type of acute treatment; HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C 
screening;  pregnancy  testing for women of childbearing  potential (WOCBP)  and FSH testing for 
confirmation of menopause per inclusion criteria ; quality of life as assessed by [CONTACT_84204] -QoL 
questionnaire;  attack frequency,  as assessed by [CONTACT_84179] 8 consecutive  weeks, 
and confirmed by [CONTACT_737]; HAE attack assessment; physical examinations, including 
vital signs, body height,  and weight; ECGs; AEs; PD blood sampling; inflammatory panel; and 
clinical laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis).  
Threshold -stimulated  kallikrein  activity will be assessed only in patients who have 
HAE-nC1-INH without a factor XII mutation or the plasminogen or angiopoietin -[ADDRESS_91922] experience a 
minimum of 2 HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180]) to be 
eligible for the study; patients will be instructed  to report details of any HAE attack to the study 
site within [ADDRESS_91923] the patient once a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91924] with the 
patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred.  If a patient experiences a 
third attack, the pa tient should be randomized as soon as possible, assuming all other screening 
activities have been completed and the patient meets all other eligibility requirements; in such 
cases, the Screening Period may be shorter than 8 weeks.  
During the course of the study, the use of acute medications  (plasma-derived or recombinant 
C1-INH concentrate, BK2 -receptor antagonist, or kallikrein inhibitor) to treat angioedema 
attacks is allowed as medically  indicated.  Patients can be treated with on-demand therapy as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018].  
 
6.1.2. Treatment  Period 
After a Screening Period of up to [ADDRESS_91925] 2 documented attacks 
(assessed by [CONTACT_84249])  during the Screening  Period and met all 
other eligibility criteria will be administered Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  Patients in 
Part A will be randomized to receive ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for a total 
Treatment Period of 12 weeks.  Patients in Part B will all receive o pen-label ISIS 721744 80 mg 
every 4 weeks for a total Treatment Period of 12 weeks.  
Study Drug will be administered as SC injections in the abdomen, thigh, or outer area of the 
upper arm by [CONTACT_84250] (if available

and after dosing instructions and training are provided by [CONTACT_1746]).  The first dose of 
Study Drug will be administered at the Study Center on Study Day 1 (Week 1 Visit).  Study 
Center personnel (or Home Healthcare if available), will complete procedures per the Schedule 
of Procedures  in Appendix A.  A ± 2-day excursion  from the scheduled  visit date is permitted  for 
all visits (excluding the Week 1 Visit on Study Day 1) during the Treatment Period. 
During the study, patients will be instructed to report details of any HAE attack to the study site 
within 72 hours of the onset of the attack.  During the Treatment Period, the following data will 
be collected:  daily AAS and number of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84251]); number of HAE attacks that required on -demand treatment; HAE attack details, 
including localization, severity, course, and details of any  required treatment (i.e., frequency  and 
dose); and vital signs . Throughout the Treatment Period, site personnel will contact [CONTACT_84207] a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91926] with the patient) in order to inquire 
about any attack that may have occurred.  In addition, at study visit time points, s ite personnel 
will inquire about any new HAE attack information  that was not provided through patient contact 
[CONTACT_36362].  See Section 6.2.1 for further information on the collection of data surrounding 
HAE attacks.  Additional assessments will be performed throughout the Treatment Period as 
indicated in the Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix A . 
Additionally,  blood will be collected to assess PD and coagulation  parameters,  including,  but not 
limited to:  plasma PK K, plasma proenzyme activation, cHK levels, D -dimer levels, aPTT, 
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, C4 split products, and platelet counts.  Blood samples will also 
be collected regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.  
Patients who discontinue treatment  will remain in the study and attend the ET Visit unless 
consent is withdrawn.  
Detailed information  regarding  the study procedures  is presented  in Section [ADDRESS_91927] -Treatment Pe riod, patients will return to the Study  Center (or have 
Home Healthcare (if available), as arranged by [CONTACT_37747], per the Schedule of 
Procedures in Appendix A ) for visits at Weeks 17, 21, and 26/ET for safety and clinical 
laboratory evaluations and for blood sampling for PK/PD analyses.  A ± 2-day excursion from 
the scheduled visit date is permitted for the visits at Weeks 17 and 21, and a ± 3 -day excursion 
from the scheduled visit date is permitted for the visit at Week 26/ ET. Alternatively, after 
completion of the Week [ADDRESS_91928] to enroll in the ISIS 721744 -CS3 
OLE study, pending study approval by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and the appropriate  regulatory  authority,  and 
will need to sign the Institutional Review  Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) 
approved informed consent.  Patients who complete Study Visit Week 17, and meet eligibility 
requirements, may start the treatment period in the CS3 study anytime after the Week [ADDRESS_91929]-Treatment  Period, the following  data will be collected:  daily AAS and number 
of HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84180]); number of HAE

attacks that required on-demand treatment;  HAE attack details, including  localization,  severity, 
course, and details of any required treatment (i.e., frequency and dose); and vital signs.  
Throughout the Post -Treatment Period, site personnel will contact [CONTACT_84183] a week (at 
approximately  [ADDRESS_91930] with the patient) in order to inquire about any attack 
that may have occurred.  In addition, during study visits, site personnel will inquire about any 
new HAE attack information that was n ot provided through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  See 
Section 6.2.1 for further information on the collection of data surrounding HAE attacks.  
Additionally,  blood will be collected to assess PD and coagulation  parameters,  including,  but not 
limited to:  plasma PKK, plasma proenzyme activation, cHK levels, D -dimer levels, aPTT, 
plasmin-antiplasmin complexes, C4 split products, and platelet counts.  Blood samples will also 
be collected regularly throughout the study for safety and PK/PD analyses.  Additional 
assessments will be performed throughout the Post -Treatment Period as indicated in the 
Schedule of Procedures table in Appendix A . 
Patients who withdraw early from the study during the Treatment Period will be required to 
complete their End-of-Study evaluations following  procedures  listed for the Week 26/ET Visit; 
see Appendix A . 
 
6.2. Study Assessments  
6.2.1. Collection  of Hereditary  Angioedema  Attack Details 
Historical  HAE attack information  will be collected at Screening.  During the study, patients will 
be instructed to report details of any  HAE attack to the study  site within [ADDRESS_91931] the patient once a week (at approximately [ADDRESS_91932] with the 
patient) in order to inquire about any attack that may have occurred.  In addition, during study 
visits, site personnel will inquire about any new HAE attack information that was not provided 
through patient contact [CONTACT_36362].  
During the Screening,  Treatment,  and Post-Treatment  Periods, detailed information  on each 
HAE attack will be collected, and the number of HAE attacks that required on -demand 
treatment, and the details of any  on-demand treatment used (frequency  and dosing) , will be 
assessed. For each HAE attack, the following data will be collected:  
• Date/time  of symptom onset 
• Description  of symptoms  
• Location and description  of symptoms:  
− Peripheral  angioedema:  cutaneous  swelling involving  an extremity,  face, neck, 
torso, and/or genitourinary region  
− Abdominal  angioedema:  abdominal  pain, with or without abdominal  distension, 
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea  
− Laryngeal angioedema:  stridor, dyspnea, difficulty speaking, difficulty 
swallowing,  throat tightening,  or swelling of the tongue, palate, uvula, or larynx

− Severe: marked limitation  in activity, assistance  required 
• Need for assistance,  medical intervention,  emergency  room visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Medications  to treat the attack 
• HAE attack course, including  if the HAE attack(s) in question was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84148], or if there was an alternative diagnosis  
• Date/time symptoms  resolved 
An HAE attack will be defined as an event with signs or symptoms  consistent  with an attack in at 
least [ADDRESS_91933]  
24-hour symptom-free period between attacks. 
 
6.2.2. Patient-Reported  Outcomes  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Angioedema  Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Quality of life will be assessed by [CONTACT_84204]-QoL questionnaire  during Screening  and at Weeks 1, 
9, 17, and 26/ET.  
The AE-QoL questionnaire  is a validated tool to assess symptom-specific health-related quality 
of life impairment in patients suffering from recurrent angioedema ( Weller et al. 2013 ). The 
AE-QoL is a self -administered questionnaire that can be completed in less than 5 minutes; it 
comprises 17 questions across 4 domains:  functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and food.  
The AE-QoL can be used to calculate scores for the 4 individual  domains, and can also be used 
to determine a total score.  The AE-QoL will be completed by [CONTACT_102].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Angioedema  Activity Score 
Patients will be instructed  on the use of the AAS questionnaire  during Screening  and will record 
their HAE attacks using the AAS questionnaire during the Screening Period to confirm study 
eligibility.  The AAS questionnaire will be completed by  [CONTACT_84208] a daily basis (minimum of 
4 daily assessments per week) for the duration of the study.  
During the Screening  Period, patients must experience  a minimum  of 2 HAE attacks (assessed 
by [CONTACT_84180]) to be eligible for t he study. 
Enrolled patients will continue to record HAE attacks using the AAS questionnaire  throughout 
the Treatment and Post -Treatment Periods.  
The AAS is a validated patient -reported outcome instrument to assess disease activity  in patients 
with recurren t angioedema.  The AAS was designed as a diary -type tool, and is easy to 
administer and fast to complete.  Using the AAS questionnaire, patients score each of 5 key 
symptom-related factors from  0 to 3, resulting in a total daily score of 0 to 15. Daily AAS can be 
summed to provide scores every  7 days, every  4 weeks, and every  12 weeks ( Weller et al. 2013 ). 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91934] of these analytes is 
contained in Appendix B . 
If the platelet value, serum creatinine, or liver enzyme tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to 
clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  hemolysis,  or quantity not sufficient)  or missing, a repeat blood specimen  should be 
re-drawn as soon as possible (ideall y within 7 days) either in clinic or by  [CONTACT_84209].  
 
6.3. Restriction  on the Lifestyle of Patients 
6.3.1. Contraception  Requirements  
All male patients and WOCBP must refrain from sperm/egg  donation and either be abstinent† or 
use highly effective contraception from the time of signing the ICF until at least [ADDRESS_91935] dose of Study Drug.  
For male patients engaged in sexual relations with a WOCBP,  if their female partner is using 
highly effective contraception  from the time of the patient signing the informed consent until 
24 weeks after the patient’s last dose of study treatment, then it is not required for the male 
patient to also use a highly effective contraceptive method.  
For the purposes of this study, a WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced 
menarche, and who does not meet 1 of the following conditions:  
• Post-menopausal:  12 months of spontaneous  amenorrhea  in females > 55 years of 
age or, in females ≤ [ADDRESS_91936] -menopausal range for the 
laboratory involved  
• 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy  with or without hysterectomy  
• Post-hysterectomy  
For the purposes of the study, highly effective contraception  is defined as follows: 
For male patients:  
• Highly effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen 
analysis at follow-up, or the non-pregnant female partner of childbearing  potential 
uses a highly effective contraceptive method (defined below).  
• Male patients with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception  to 
ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the Study Drug.  
Note: A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction 
between the two can result in either or both products failing.  
For female patients and female partners of male patients, highly effective contraception  methods 
comprise

• Surgical sterilization  (i.e., bilateral tubal occlusion);  progestogen -only hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation; intrauterine contraception 
device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system.  
†Note: Abstinence (i.e., refraining from heterosexual intercourse throughout the duration of 
study participation) is only acceptable as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line with 
the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation , symptothermal,  or post-ovulation  methods),  declaration  of abstinence  for the 
duration of the study, or withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

8.3. Other Protocol-Required  Treatment  Procedures  
There are no other protocol-required treatment  procedures.  
 
8.4. Treatment  Precautions  
There are no specific treatment  precautions  required. 
 
8.5. Safety Monitoring  Rules 
Please refer also to the “Guidance  for Investigator”  section of the Investigator’s  Brochure.  
For the purposes of safety monitoring,  Baseline is defined  as the average of the pre-dose Study 
Day [ADDRESS_91937] monitoring  of clinical safety parameters,  the following  guidelines  are 
provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical 
observations.  
Confirmation Guidance : At any time during the study (Treatment or Post -Treatment Periods), 
the initial clinical laboratory  results meeting the safety monitoring  criteria presented  below must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_10533] (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the 
initial measurement)  on new specimens.  All new specimen  collections  should take place as soon 
as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection).  For stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], if the initial 
laboratory result is observed during the Treatment Period, the results from the retest must be 
available prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  
Re-dosing Guidance : Patients with initial laboratory  test values that reach a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10447]-dosed until the retest results are available.  In general, p atients who do not meet the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10448].  However, the Investigator and the  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.0 
ISIS 721744-CS2 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  3 
5 May 2020 
44  
  
Sponsor Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to whether 
additional  close monitoring  of the patient is appropriate.  If any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10449] (refer to Section 8.6) are met, the patient will be permanently discontinued from further 
treatment with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo), evaluated fully as outli ned below and in 
consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be 
followed up in accordance with Section 8.8 of the protocol.  
 
8.5.1. Safety Monitoring  Rules for Liver Chemistry  Tests 
The following rules are adapted from the draft guidance for industry, “Drug -Induced Liver 
Injury: Premarketing  Clinical Evaluation,”  issued by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Department  of Health and Human 
Services, Food and Drug Administration,  July 2009. For a definition of Ba seline, please refer to 
guidance in Section 8.[ADDRESS_91938] measurement that is > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline 
value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (Treatment  or 
Post-Treatment P eriod), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed as described above.  
Additional,  confirmatory  measurements  should also be performed  if ALT or AST levels increase 
to 5 × ULN.  
Frequency  of Repeat Measurements : Patients with confirmed  ALT or AST levels > 3 × ULN (or 
the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) should have their 
liver chemistry  tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,  international  normalized  ratio [INR], and 
total bilirubin) retested at least once -weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.2 × ULN or  
1.2 × baseline value if the baseline value was > ULN. 
Further Investigation  into Liver Chemistry  Elevations : For patients with confirmed  ALT or AST 
levels > 3  × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline value was  
> ULN), the following  evaluations  should be performed:  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms  and prior and concurrent  diseases 
• Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medications,  herbal and dietary supplement  preparations),  alcohol use, recreational 
drug use, and special diets  
• Obtain a history for exposure to environmental  chemical agents and travel 
• Perform serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin  M ([IgM], 
hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, cytomegalovirus  IgM, and 
Epstein-Barr Virus antibody panel)  
• Perform serology for autoimmune  hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear  antibody)  
Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic 
computed  tomography  or magnetic resonance  imaging scans, may be performed  at the discretion 
of the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  Repetition of the above 
evaluations should be considered if a patient’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 × ULN.  
 
8.5.2. Safety Monitoring  Rules for Platelet Count Results 
Please refer also to Table 2. 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91939] met a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10450].  If a patient’s platelet count falls to 
100,000/mm3 or less, then the patient’s platelet counts should be monitored  weekly. In case of 
platelet reduction to below 75,000/mm3, the platelet monitoring rule defined in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] 
(Section 8.6.2) should be followed.  
In the event of a platelet count < 75,000/mm3, additional  laboratory  investigations  may be 
conducted in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor.  
 
8.5.3. Safety Monitoring  Rules for Renal Function  Test Results 
If a patient’s results meet Criteria 1 or 2 below, the Investigator  should confirm the results and 
initiate weekly monitoring  if confirmed.  If the event of a persistent  elevation is observed over 
2 consecutive weeks, then go to Section 8.6.3. 
1. Serum creatinine increase that fulfills all of the following:  ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) 
and ≥ 40% above baseline creatinine  values and > ULN (refer to definition  of Baseline in 
Section 8.6) 
2. Proteinuria,  urine protein/creatinine  ratio > 750 mg/g for baseline values ≥ 200 mg/g, or 
4 × baseline value for baseline values < 200 mg/g that are confirmed by [CONTACT_84215]/creatinine ratio or by a quantitative total urine protein measurement of  
> 1.0 g/24 hours 
 
8.5.4. Safety Monitoring  for Minor Bleeding Events 
If a bleeding event occurs, including  minor bleeding events such as excess bruising, petechiae,  or 
gingival bleeding on brushing teeth, the Investigator should notify  the Sponsor Medical Monitor 
and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, PT, and INR) and platelet count should 
be performed.  
8.6. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84160], Baseline  is defined as the average of the pre-dose Study 
Day [ADDRESS_91940] value prior to  Study Day 1.  
 
8.6.1. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84161], and the event is without an 
alternative  explanation  as discussed  with the Sponsor Medical Monitor, dosing of a patient 
with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be stopped permanently; values that are not 
confirmed due to failure to retest or missing lab values will be presumed confirmed:  
1. ALT or AST > 8 × ULN, which is confirmed  
2. ALT or AST > 5 × ULN, which is confirmed  and persists  for ≥ [ADDRESS_91941] > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN or INR > 1.5  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91942] > 3 × ULN (or the greater of 2 × baseline value or 3 × ULN if the baseline 
value was > ULN), which is confirmed, and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides 
with the changes in hepatic enzymes)  of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right  upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or concomitant eosinophilia (> ULN)  
 
8.6.2. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84162] 2. 
In the event of any platelet count < 25,000/mm3, dosing of the patient with Study Drug will be 
stopped permanently.  Platelet count should be monitored daily until 3 successive values  
> 25,000/mm3. Then, monitor twice weekly until 3 successive values > 75,000/mm3. Then, 
monitor weekly until 3 successive  values > 100,000/mm3. Consider more frequent monitoring  if 
additional risk factors for bleeding are present (see Table 2). Administration of steroids is 
strongly recommended for  patients whose platelet count  is < 25,000/mm3. Treatment guidelines 
for immune thrombocytopenia ( Provan et al. 2010 ) recommend dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 
4 days every 2 to 4 weeks for 1 to 4 cycles; prednis(ol)one 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day for 2 to 4 weeks 
then taper; or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days.  (Note: Patient may require 
continuation with oral steroids af ter methylprednisolone).  
In the event of a platelet count ≥ 25,000/mm3 to < 50,000/mm3, dosing of the patient with Study 
Drug will be stopped permanently.  Platelet count should be monitored twice weekly until  
3 successive  values > 75,000/mm3. Then, monitor weekly until 3 successive  values 
> 100,000/mm3. Consider more frequent monitoring  and/or the administration  of steroids if 
additional risk factors for bleeding are present (see Table 2). 
In the event of a platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm3 to ˂ 75,000/mm3, and in the absence of major 
bleeding or clinically relevant non -major bleeding (defined below), dosing with Study Drug 
should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered to > 100,000/mm3. The 
suitability of the patient for continued d osing will be determined by [CONTACT_84216]’s platelet count, whether  any bleeding events were experienced, and 
the speed of recovery of platelet count after interruption of dosing.  Platelet count must be 
measured twice weekly until 3 successive values > 75,000/mm3, then weekly until 3 successive 
values > 100,000/mm3. Consider more frequent monitoring  if additional  risk factors for bleeding 
are present (see Table 2). Any unreportable platelet count result must be rechecked, ideally 
within [ADDRESS_91943] met a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10450].  
Definition  of Major Bleeding Events (Schulman  and Kearon 2005) 
1. Fatal bleeding, and/or 
2. Symptomatic  bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial,  intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarterial or pericardial, or intramuscular with 
compartment syndrome, and/or  
3. Clinically  overt bleeding leading to transfusion  of ≥ 2 units of packed  red blood cells or 
whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 2.0 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) within 24 hours

Definition  of Clinically  Relevant  Non-Major Bleeding Events 
Clinically  relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria  for 
major bleeding but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had 
clinical consequences for a patient.  
Definition  of Minor Bleeding Events 
Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically 
relevant, non-major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae,  or 
gingival bleeding on brushing teeth.  
If the subsequent  test confirms the initial test result, then monitoring  frequency  and dosing 
should be adjusted as recommended in Table 2.

Consider more frequent monitoring if 
additional  risk factors for bleeding are 
present.‡ 
‡ Additional  risk factors for bleeding include age > 60 years, receiving anticoagulant  or antiplatelet  medicinal 
products, and/or prior history of major bleeding events.  
* It is strongly recommended  that, unless  corticosteroids  are contraindicated,  the patient receives glucocorticoid 
therapy to reverse the platelet decline as recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by [CONTACT_10536]-dose steroids.  Treatment guideline s for immune thrombocytopenia ( Provan et al. 2010 ) recommend  
dexamethasone  40 mg daily for 4 days every 2 to 4 weeks for 1 to 4 cycles; prednis(ol)one  0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day  for 
2 to 4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day  for 7 days (Note: patient may  require continuation 
with oral steroids after methylprednisolone).  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91945] Results 
In the event of a persistent  elevation that is observed over 2 consecutive  weeks, for either of the 
2 criteria below, dosing  of a patient with Study  Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) may  be stopped 
temporarily:  
1. Serum creatinine  increase that fulfills all of the following  criteria: ≥ 0.3 mg/dL 
(26.5 μmol/L) and ≥ 40% above baseline creatinine  values and > ULN (refer to definition 
of Baseline in Section 8.6) 
2. Proteinuria,  dipstick 2 + (confirmed  by [CONTACT_84254] a 
quantitative total urine protein measurement of > 1.0 g/24 hours)  
The possible dosing reinitiation  or follow-up schedule for any events meeting either of these 
criteria will be determined by [CONTACT_84255].  
8.7. Adjustment  of Dose and/or Treatment  Schedule  
Adjustment  of dose and/or schedule is not permitted.  
 
8.8. Discontinuation  of Study Drug 
A patient must permanently  discontinue  study treatment for  any of the following:  
• The patient becomes pregnant. Report the pregnancy  according  to instructions  in 
Section 9.5.4. 
• The patient withdraws  consent. 
• The patient withdraws  from treatment  (but does not withdraw  consent). 
• The patient experiences  an AE that necessitates  permanent  discontinuation  of Study 
Drug. 
• The patient develops laboratory  test abnormalities  that meet any of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84151] 8.6.1, 8.6.2, or 8.6.3. 
• The patient experiences  an AE that necessitates  unblinding  of the Investigator  or 
Sponsor to the patient’s treatment assignment.  
The reason for discontinuation  of Study Drug must be recorded in the electronic  Case Report 
Form (eCRF) and source documentation.  
Patients who discontinue  Study Drug will remain in the study and attend the ET Visit 
(Week 17 visit assessments),  unless consent is withdrawn.  Any patient who discontinues  early 
from the Treatment Period or from the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period should be strongly 
encouraged  to complete follow-up study visits, procedures  and observations  (see Appendix  A). 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91946] be withdrawn  from study procedures  for any of the following:  
• Withdrawal  of consent 
• The patient is unwilling  or unable to comply  with the protocol 
Other reasons for withdrawal  of patients from the study may include the following:  
• At the discretion  of the Investigator  for medical reasons 
• At the discretion  of the Investigator  or Sponsor for non-compliance  
• Significant  protocol deviation 
All efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to 
the date of withdrawal.  All information,  including  the reason for withdrawal  from study, must be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Any patient who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from further 
treatment  and study observation  immediately  upon the date of request. These patients should be 
encouraged to complete the ET study  procedures (Week 17 visit assessments) and observations 
at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix A ). 
For patients withdrawn  for reasons other than withdrawal  of consent, every effort should be 
made to complete the ET study  procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see 
Appendix A ).

requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines.  
Institutional Review Boards/IECs will be notified of any SAE according to applicable 
regulations.  The DSMB will be notified of any SAE as specified in the DSMB Charter. 
In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the Sponsor or designee will evaluate 
the available information and perform an independent assessment of all reported SAEs and 
determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the Study Drug (I SIS 721744 or placebo) is 
causally related to a reported SAE. While the Sponsor may upgrade an Investigator’s  decision, it 
is not permissible to downgrade the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_84152] a S[LOCATION_003]R. 
Appropriate personnel at the Sponsor or designee will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory  reporting.  The Sponsor or designee will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs to regulatory  agencies in 
blinded or unblinded fashion according to local law.  The Sponsor or designee will submit 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Investigators in a blinded fashion.

9.3. Definitions  
9.3.1. Adverse Event 
An AE can be any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding, 
for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
An AE can therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation  of an existing disease (a worsening  in the character, 
frequency, or severity of a known condition)  
• Recurrence  of an intermittent  medical condition  (e.g., headache)  not present at 
Baseline 
• Any deterioration  in a laboratory  value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from Study Drug  
• Events that are related to a protocol-mandated  intervention,  including  those that occur 
prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive proced ures such as 
biopsies) 
9.3.2. Adverse Drug Reaction  and Unexpected  Suspected  Adverse Drug Reaction 
Adverse Drug Reaction  
In the pre-approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, 
particularly  as the therapeutic  dose(s) may not have been established,  adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) are defined as follows:  
All noxious and unintended  responses  to a medicinal  product related to any dose should 
be considered ADRs.  
The phrase “responses  to a medicinal  product” means that a causal relationship  between the 
medicinal product and the AE has been determined by [CONTACT_10548] a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
Suspected  Unexpected  Adverse Drug Reaction 
A suspected  unexpected  ADR is any ADR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent  with 
the applicable product information, e.g., Investigator's Brochure for an unapproved medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
A suspected  adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse 
reaction.

9.3.3. Serious Adverse Event 
An SAE is any AE that, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, meets any of the 
following criteria:  
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening;  that is, poses an immediate  risk of death at the time of the event 
An AE or suspected  adverse reaction is considered  “life-threatening”  if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate 
risk of death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84164] 24 hours to a medical 
facility and does not always qualify as an AE  
• Results in a persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• Results in a congenital  anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the patient 
(whether the patient is male or female)  
• Important medical events  that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do 
not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10462], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the  patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasia s or 
convulsions  that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug 
dependency or drug abuse  
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of an AE 
(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe a ccording to National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]);  the event itself may be of relatively  minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need  to be independently  assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF. 
 
9.3.4. Adverse Events of Special Interest 
For the purpose of this study, severe reductions  in platelet count < 50,000/mm3 accompanied  by 
a major bleeding (MB) event or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) event, or 
platelet count of < 25,000/mm3 independent of a MB or CRNMB event, or any thrombotic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_84153] (AESIs) and  are subject to 15 -day expedited 
reporting by [CONTACT_84257].  
9.4. Monitoring  and Recording  Adverse Events 
Any pre-existing conditions  or signs and/or symptoms  present in a patient prior  to the start of the 
study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91947] of patient safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
(regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours  of the Study Center’s first knowledge  of the event.  The collection of  SAEs will 
begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the end of the patient’s Post -Treatment 
Period, which is defined as completion of  the Week 26/ET Visit.  Serious adverse  events should 
be reported using electronic SAE submission (via eDC) whenever possible.  In situations where 
electronic  SAE submission  is unavailable,  a paper Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be 
completed and a copy should be faxed or emailed to the  Sponsor or designee.  The SAE 
reporting instructions, including the fax number and email address, can be found in the 
Investigator Site File for the study.  
Detailed information  should be actively sought and included as Follow-Up as soon as additional 
information becomes available.  All SAEs will be followed until resolution.  Serious adverse 
events that remain ongoing past the patient’s last protocol -specified follow -up visit will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_10552].  If the Investigator and Sponsor a gree that the  
patient’s condition  is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator  and Sponsor will determine  the 
follow-up requirement.  
 
9.4.2. Non-Serious Adverse Events 
The recording of non -serious AEs will begin after the patient signs the ICF and will stop at the 
end of the patient’s Post -Treatment Period, which is defined as completion of the Week 26/ET 
Visit. The Investigator  will monitor each patient closely and record all observed  or volunteered 
AEs on the eCRF.  
9.4.3. Evaluation  of Adverse Events (Serious and Non-Serious) 
The Investigator’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_84165]: 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  to the Study Drug 
The event’s relationship  to the Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) is characterized  by 1 of the 
following:  
• Related: There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo), e.g., confirmation by [CONTACT_38000] -challenge test  
• Possible:  The event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition, 
concomitant  therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship 
between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration  
• Unlikely/Remote:  An event for which an alternative  explanation  is more likely (e.g., 
concomitant medications or ongoing  medical conditions) or the temporal relationship 
to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration and/or exposure  suggests that 
a causal relationship is unlikely (for reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be 
grouped together with Not Related)  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.0 
ISIS 721744-CS2 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  3 
5 May 2020 
54  
  
• Not Related: The event can  be readily explained by  [CONTACT_102]’s  underlying  medical 
condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator 
believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or 
placebo) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity 
The severity  of AEs and SAEs relating to laboratory  tests and AEs at the injection site will be 
graded based on criteria from the CTCAE Version 5.0, November  2017 (refer to Appendix  D). 
Any AE not listed in Appendix D will be graded as follows:  
• Mild: The event is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_84258]’s 
usual daily activities  
• Moderate:  The event causes the patient more discomfort  and interrupts  the patient’s 
usual daily activities  
• Severe: The event is incapacitating  and causes considerable  interference  with the 
patient’s usual daily activities  
If the event is an SAE, then all applicable  seriousness  criteria must be indicated (criteria listed in 
Section 9.3.3). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Action Taken with Study Drug 
Down-titration of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will not be allowed during the study. 
Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) due to an AE is characterized  by 1 of the 
following:  
• None: No changes made to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration  and 
dose 
• Not Applicable:  AE reported during the Screening  Period prior to Study Drug 
(ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration  
• Permanently  Discontinued:  Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) discontinued  and 
not restarted  
• Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose:  Dosing and/or dosing 
frequency  temporarily  interrupted/changed  or delayed due to the AE and restarted at 
the same dose  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment  Given for Adverse Event 
Any treatment (e.g., medications or procedures) given for the AE should be recorded on the 
eCRF. Treatment  should also be recorded on the concomitant  treatment  or ancillary procedures 
eCRF, as appropriate.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Outcome  of the Adverse Event 
If the event is a non-serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.0 
ISIS 721744-CS2 
Protocol CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment  3 
5 May 2020 
55  
  
• AE Persists: Patient terminates  from the study and the AE continues  
• Recovered:  Patient recovered  completely  from the AE 
• Became Serious: The event became serious (the date that the event became serious 
should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the 
corresponding SAE)  
• Change in Severity (if applicable):  AE severity changed 
If the event is an SAE, then  the event’s outcome  is characterized  by 1 of the following:  
• Ongoing:  SAE continuing  
• Persists (as non-serious AE): Patient has not fully recovered  but the event no longer 
meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE eCRF 
(the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE)  
• Recovered:  Patient recovered  completely  from the SAE (the date of recovery should 
be entered as th e SAE resolution date)  
• Recovered  with Sequelae:  The signs/symptoms  of the reported SAE have improved 
but not completely resolved, and a new baseline for the patient is established since 
full recovery is not expected  
• Fatal: Patient died (the date of death should be entered as the SAE resolution  date) 
• Unknown:  The outcome of the reported SAE is not available,  e.g., patient is lost to 
follow-up 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follow-up of Adverse Event 
Investigator Follow -up 
During the Study Period, the  Investigator  should follow each AE until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the 
patient withdraws consent.  Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be 
related to Study D rug or related to study procedures until a final outcome can be reported.  
Resolution  of AE (with dates) should be documented  on the eCRF and in the patient’s medical 
record to facilitate source data verification.  
Investigators  should follow-up, or support the Sponsor’s  effort to follow up, with all pregnancies 
reported during the study from either the study patient or the female partner of the male study 
patient until pregnancy outcome is available.  
Sponsor Follow-up 
For SAEs and pregnancy cases in patients who have completed or terminated the study, the 
Sponsor or a designee should follow -up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to 
obtain additional  case details and outcome information  (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84166], 
consultant reports, or autopsy reports) in order to perform  an independent medical  assessment  of 
the reported case.  
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91948] results may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
constitute or be associated with an AE.  Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results 
that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment, e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, 
tetany due to hypocalcemia,  or cardiac arrhythmias  due to hyperkalemia.  Whenever  possible, the 
underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs.  
Clinically significant abnormalities will be monitored by [CONTACT_84259].  Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically significant (NCS) by [CONTACT_84260]. Similarly,  laboratory abnormalities  reported as AEs 
by [CONTACT_37724].  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports.  The signed 
clinical laboratory  reports will serve as source document s and should include the Investigator’s 
assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values.  
9.5.2. Prescheduled  or Elective Procedures  or Routinely  Scheduled  Treatments  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057];  the Study Center must document  all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled  (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled)  prior to obtaining  the patient’s 
consent to participate in the study  
• The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely 
scheduled  treatment  was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_10464]’s consent to participate in the study and the 
timing of the procedure or treatment  
• The prescheduled  or elective procedure  or routinely scheduled  treatment  is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
9.5.3. Dosing Errors 
Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) dosing errors (including overdose, underdose, and 
administration  error) should be documented  as protocol deviations.  A brief description  should be 
provided in the deviation, including whether the patient was symptomatic (list symptoms) or 
asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional.  
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing eCRF. If the patient  takes a dose of Study Drug 
(ISIS 7217 44 or placebo) that exceeds protocol specifications and the patient is symptomatic, 
then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section 9.4. 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the d ose 
being studied. An overdose or incorrect administration  of study treatment  is not itself an AE, but 
it may result in an AE. All AEs associated  with an overdose or incorrect administration  of Study 
Drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated AE fulfills seriousness 
criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event).

57  
  
Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the “G uidance for 
Investigator”  section of the Investigator’s  Brochure and contact [CONTACT_10557] 
[ADDRESS_91949] learning of the occurrence of pregnancy.  Follow-up 
information  including  delivery or termination is reported by [CONTACT_84261] ‘Follow-up’ on the 
Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours.  
Payment for all aspects of obstetrical  care, child or related care will be the patient’s 
responsibility.  
Female patients: If a suspected  pregnancy  occurs while on the study (including  the 
Post-Treatment Period), a pregnancy test will be performed.  The patient with a confirmed 
pregnancy will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug.  However, the 
patient will be encouraged to complete th e Post-Treatment Period of the study to the extent that 
study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy.  Regardless of continued study 
participation, the study physician will assist the patient in getting obstetrical care and the 
progress of the pregn ancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., 
delivery, elective termination,  or spontaneous  abortion).  If the pregnancy  results in the birth of a 
child, the Study Center and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical 
records to obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A 
longer follow -up may be required if a newborn child experiences a medical condition.  
Follow-up will be performed  to the extent permitted  by [CONTACT_84262]; e.g., pregnancy ICF may be required.  
Male patients : The progress of the pregnancy of a male patient’s partner should be followed 
until the outcome of the pregnancy  is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous 
abortion).  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may 
follow-up with the mother and may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records to 
obtain additional information relevant to the pregnancy progress and outcome.  A longer 
follow-up may be required if a newborn child experiences  a medical condition.  Follow-up will 
be performed to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_10559]; 
e.g., partn er ICF may be required.  
 
10. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
The sections below indicate the overall structure and approach to the analysis of this study. A 
detailed SAP incorporating these sections below will be prepared separately.  The SAP will 
outline all data handling conventions, including software, and specify additional statistical 
methods to be  used for analysis. The study objectives and endpoints are  listed in Sections 1.1 
and 1.2, respectively.

10.1. Sample Size Considerations  
The study will enroll a total of approximately 24 patients with HAE.  Approximately  18 patients 
with HAE -1/HAE-2 are planned to be enrolled in Part A of the study and, in parallel, 
approximately 6 patients with HAE -nC1-INH are planned to be enrolled in Part B of the study. 
Due to the rarity of HAE-nC1-INH, enrollment  in Part B may be ended early  if Study Centers are 
unable to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact completion of Part A.  Patients with  
HAE-1/HAE-2 (Part A) will be randomized  to SC injections  of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo 
administered every 4 weeks in a 2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo), and patients with  
HAE-nC1-INH (Part B) will be administered  open-label SC injections  of ISIS 721744 80 mg 
every 4 weeks.  
The sample size of 18 patie nts with HAE -1/HAE-2 (12 patients administered SC injections of 
ISIS 721744 80 mg and 6 patients administered placebo) is from clinical considerations for 
sufficient safety and tolerability evaluation.  The primary endpoint is the time -normalized 
number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_91950] 90% power for the primary 
endpoint, considering a 10% missing data or dropout rate for both active treatment and placebo. 
There is no statistical rationale for the s ample size of [ADDRESS_91951] 1 dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  will include all enrolled or randomized  patients. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population  will include all patients in the ITT Population  who are treated 
according to the protocol without any major deviations.  
The PK Population  will include all patients who are enrolled and receive at least 1 dose of Study 
Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) and have at least [ADDRESS_91952] of the study.  Based on its ongoing 
assessment of the safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide 
recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or continuing the study as planned.

10.6. Planned Methods of Analysis 
10.6.1. Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic  and baseline characteristics  will be summarized  using descriptive  statistics by 
[CONTACT_1570].  Patient disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  All patients 
enrolled will be included in a summary of patient disposition.  
10.6.2. Safety Analysis 
The Safety Population  will be used for all safety analyses. 
The safety and tolerability of ISIS 721744 will be assessed by [CONTACT_84185], type, 
severity, and dose -relationship of AEs; vital signs; ECGs; and clinical laboratory parameters. 
Safety results in patients dosed with ISIS 721744 will be compared  to safety results in patients 
dosed with placebo.  
Treatment duration and amount of Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) received will be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_1570].  Patient incidence rates of all AEs will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_84263]  (MedDRA™) system organ class and by [CONTACT_84264]. Tables and/or narratives of treatment -emergent deaths and serious and significant AEs, 
including early withdrawals due to AEs, will also be provided.  
All TEAEs, all TEAEs potentially  related to Study Drug, all treatment -emergent SAEs, and all 
treatment -emergent SAEs potentially related to Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) will be 
summarized.  
Laboratory  tests to ensure patient safety, including  chemistry  panel, complete blood count with 
differential, coagulation panel, and complement, will be summarized by [CONTACT_84221].  These safety variables will also be presented as change and percent change 
from Baseline over time after Study Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) administration, as 
appropriate.  
Vital sign and ECG measures will be tabulated by  [CONTACT_1570].  In addition, the number of 
patients who experience  abnormalities  in clinical laboratory  evaluations  will be summarized  by 
[CONTACT_3148] g roup. 
10.6.3. Efficacy Analysis 
The ITT Population  will be used for all efficacy analyses. The PP Population  will be used for a

[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary endpoint is the time-normalized  number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_91953] errors, and the 2-tailed 95% confidence  intervals for the 
treatment group and placebo group will be presented.  
The Part B data will be summarized  using descriptive  statistics. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary  Efficacy Analysis 
The secondary  endpoints  include the time-normalized  number of HAE attacks (per month) from 
Week 5 to Week 17; the time-normalized number of moderate or severe HAE attacks (per 
month) from Week 5 to Week 17; the number of patients with a clinical response (defined as a  
≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, or ≥ 90% reduction from Baseline in HAE attack rate) by [CONTACT_10585] 17; the number  
of HAE attacks requiring acute therapy from Week 5 to Week 17; cHK levels at Weeks 9 and 17; 
PKK activity  at Weeks 9 and 17; consumption of on -demand medication at Weeks 9 and 17; and 
AE-QoL questionnaire score at Weeks 9 and 17.  
For Part A, the time-normalized number of HAE attacks (per month) from Week 5 to Week 17 
and the time-normalized  number of moderate or severe HAE attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_91954] to the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Continuous vari ables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_1570].  Continuous variables will also be 
analyzed using analysis of covariance  or analysis of variance. The least-squares means, standard 
errors, and the 2 -tailed 95% confidence intervals for the treatment group and placebo group will 
be presented.  
Categorical variables will be summarized by  [CONTACT_84265]. Categorical  variables will be analyzed using a Pearson’s  Chi-square test or 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.  
The Part B data will be summarized  using descriptive  statistics. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory  Efficacy Analysis 
Exploratory  efficacy endpoints  include the number of HAE attack-free patients by [CONTACT_10585] 17 and 
potential exposure response analysis using relevant exposure parameters and biomarkers.  All 
exploratory efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the same methods as described for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
 
10.6.4. Pharmacokinetic  Analysis 
The plasma PK of ISIS 721744 will be assessed following  SC administration.  For all patients, 
Pre-Dose (trough) and Post -Treatment plasma ISIS 721744 concentrations will be determined 
and summarized using  descriptive  statistics. Plasma terminal elimination  half-life will also be 
721744-CS02 Protocol Amendment  05 May 2020 | 1.[ADDRESS_91955] -Treatment follow up ISIS 721744 plasma concentrations, if data 
permits. For patients in the PK sub group, non-compartmental  PK analysis of ISIS 721744 will 
be carried out on each individual patient dataset.  
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  include (but are not limited to) the following:  Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and 
t½. Other plasma PK parameters, as appropriate, may be determined or calculated at the 
discretion of the PK scientist.  
Metabolite  identification  and profiling may be conducted  on select plasma samples. 
Plasma PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Additional details 
regarding  the PK analysis along with immunogenicity  (IM) analysis will be described  in the 
SAP. 
Analysis of potential exposure-response relationship  between biomarkers  and PK measures may 
also be explored.  
Population  PK and PK/PD analyses may be performed  using PK data from this study, and/or

and other AE reports received from the Sponsor or designee, in accor dance with local 
procedures.  
The Investigator  will be responsible  for obtaining  annual IEC/IRB approval/renewal  throughout 
the duration of the study. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_5699]’s  reports, all IEC/IRB submissions  and the 
IEC/IRB continuance of approval must be sent to the Sponsor or designee.  
11.4. Patient Confidentiality  
The Investigator  must ensure that the patient’s confidentiality  is maintained.  On the case report 
forms or other documents  submitted  to the Sponsor or designee, patients should be identified  by 
[CONTACT_10573] (if permitted by  [CONTACT_1769]) and a  patient identification number  only. Documents that are 
not for submission to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict 
confidence by [CONTACT_737].  
In compliance with fe deral and local regulations/ICH GCP Guidelines, it is required that the 
Investigator and institution permit authorized representatives  of the company,  of the regulatory 
agency(s), and the IEC/IRB direct access to review the patient’s original medical recor ds for 
verification  of study-related procedures  and data. Direct access includes examining,  analyzing, 
verifying, and reproducing any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the 
study. The Investigator is obligated to inform and obtain the consent of the patient to permit 
named representatives to have access to his/her study -related records without violating the 
confidentiality of the patient.  
 
12. ADMINISTRATIVE  AND LEGAL OBLIGATIONS  
12.1. Protocol Amendments

10 The AAS questionnaire will  be completed by  [CONTACT_84208] a daily basis (minimum  of 4 daily assessments  per week) for the duration of the study.  Patients will 
be instructed on the use of the AAS during Screening and will record their HAE attacks using the AAS throughout the Screening  Period (daily  during up to  
8 consecutive  weeks) to confirm study eligibility;  patients are required to experience  at least 2 HAE attacks (assessed by [CONTACT_84251])  during the Screening  Period to be eligible for enrollment.  If a patient experiences  a third attack, the patient should  be randomized  as soon as 
possible, assuming all other screening activities have been completed and the patient meets all other eligibility  requirements; in such cases, the Screening 
Period may be shorter than [ADDRESS_91960] -Treatment

visits, site personnel will inquire about any new HAE attack information that was not provided through pati ent contact [CONTACT_36362].  
12 The following details relating to the localization, severity, and course of all HAE attacks that occured since the previous v isit will be collected:  date/time of 
symptom onset; description of symptoms; location of symptoms (pe ripheral angioedema, abdominal angioedema, or laryngeal angioedema); impact of HAE 
attack on activity level; HAE attack severity (mild, moderate, or severe); need for assistance, medical intervention, emergen cy room visit, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
medications  to treat the attack; HAE  attack course, including  if the HAE attack(s) in question was a typi[INVESTIGATOR_84168],  or if there was an  alternative

 1 INTRODUCTION  
This document provides a description of the study organization, study procedures, and the 
plan for the statistical  analysis of the study data. Section 1 discusses study design, objectives, 
and endpoints; Section 2 provides the study procedures; Section 3 provides the detailed plan 
for the statistical anal yses. 
As with any statistical analysis plan (SAP), the  proposed methods and approaches to the  data 
analysis should be viewed as flexible. The statistical  analysis to some degree is iterative since 
so much of the planning is based on statistical and other a ssumptions, which require 
verification.  
1.1 Study Overview  
 
This is a Phase 2a study, will be  conducted at multiple  Study Centers worldwide  to assess the 
efficacy of ISIS 721744 in approximately 24 patients with HAE. Part A of the study will be 
randomized, double -blind, and placebo -controlled; Part B of the study will be open -label. 
The study will be conducted concurrently in 2 parts (Part A and Part B); patients will be 
allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either  HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A 
or HAE-nC1-INH in Part B).  
 
In Part A, approximately 18  patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 will be randomized  to SC injections 
of ISIS 721744 80 mg or placebo in a 2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately 
6 patients with HAE-nC1-INH will be administered open -label SC injections of ISIS 721744 
80 mg. Due to the rarity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended early if study 
centers are unable to enroll sufficient patients; this will not impact the completion of Part  A. 
 
The study will consist of Screening,  Treatment,  and Post-Treatment  Periods. Please refer to the 
Schedule of Procedures in protocol Appendix A . Patients may be  required to attend additional 
visits for monitoring of AEs or abnormal investigation results. The frequency of additional 
monitoring will be determined by [CONTACT_84273].  The length of each patient’s participation  in the study is approximately  8 months, 
which includes an up to 8-week Screening Period, a 12 -week Treatment Period (patients  will 
receive fixed SC doses of Study Drug every 4 weeks during 4 on-site study visits),and  a [ADDRESS_91983] -Treatment Period as determined by [CONTACT_84195] a patient enrolls in the ISIS 721744 - 
CS3 OLE study.  
 
1.2 Objectives  
 
1.2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of antisense inhibitor of 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

ISIS 721744-CS2 CONFIDENTIAL  
6  
  
prekallikrein (ISIS 721744) in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) type 1 (HAE -1), 
HAE type 2 (HAE -2), or HAE with normal C1 -inhibitor (HAE -nC1-INH). 
 
1.2.2 Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary  objectives of  the study are to evaluate safety and tolerability  of ISIS 721744  in 
patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 or HAE with normal C1 -INH (HAE -nC1-INH) and to ev aluate 
the effect of ISIS 721744 on plasma prekallikrein (PKK) and other relevant biomarkers.  
 
1.2.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
The exploratory  objectives  of the study are to evaluate pharmacokinetics  (PK) of ISIS 721744 
(as a total full -length antisense oligonucleotide [ASO], including fully conjugated, partially 
conjugated, and unconjugated ISIS 721744) over time and to assess potential 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) correlations on relevant biomarkers and clinical outcomes, as 
appropriate.  
 
1.3 Endpoints  
 
1.3.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint is the time-normalized  number of investigator -confirmed  HAE attacks 
(per month) from Week 1 to Week 17.  
 
1.3.2 Secondary  Endpoints  
Secondary  endpoints  include the following:  
• The time-normalized  number of investigator -confirmed  HAE attacks (per month) from Week 5 to Week 17  
• The number of patients with a clinical response (defined as a ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, or 
≥ 90% reduction  from Baseline  in Investigator -confirmed  HAE attack rate) by [CONTACT_10585] 
17 
• The number of investigator -confirmed  HAE attacks requiring acute therapy from Week 5 to Week 17  
• Cleaved high molecular  weight kininogen  (cHK) levels  at Weeks 9 and 17 
• PKK activity at Weeks 9 and 17

severity, and dose -relationship of adverse events (AEs); vital signs; electrocardiograms 
(ECGs); and clinical laboratory  parameters.  Safety results  in patients dosed with ISIS 721744 
will be compared to safety results in patients dosed with placebo.  
 
1.3.4 Exploratory  Endpoints  
• The number of HAE attack-free patients by [CONTACT_10585] 17 
• PK parameters, including, but not limited to maximum observed plasma 
concentration  (Cmax), time to Cmax (tmax), area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve (AUC), and half -life (t½) 
• Potential exposure response analysis using relevant exposure parameters  and Biomarkers  
 
1.3.5 Additional  Endpoint  
• The time-normalized  number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed  HAE 
attacks (per month) from Week [ADDRESS_91984] source data into the case report form.  
Laboratory  data will be transferred  electronically  to Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. 
 
2.2 Randomization  & Treatment  Allocation  
Patients will be allocated into Part A or Part B according  to type of HAE (i.e., either 
HAE-1/HAE-2 in Part A or HAE-nC1-INH in Part B). Only Part A will be randomized  and 
placebo-controlled.  
 
Patients will be enrolled and/or randomized (Part A only) at the Week [ADDRESS_91985] been completed  and after the Investigator  has verified that they 
are eligible per the criteria in protocol Sections 5.1 and 5.2. No patient may begin treatment 
prior to randomization (Part A only) and assignment of a unique patient identification 
number. 
 
In Part A, approximately 18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-2 will be randomized via the 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg or 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio (ISIS 721744:placebo).  In Part B, approximately  6 patients with HAE- 
nC1-INH will be enrolled via the IRT system to receive open -label SC injections of ISIS

8  
  
721744 80 mg. Due to the rar ity of HAE -nC1-INH, enrollment in Part B may be ended early 
if Study Centers are unable to enroll sufficient  patients; this will not impact the completion  of 
Part A. 
 
Randomization  information  will be concealed  from the Investigators  and patients until the 
end of the study, with the exception of an emergency situation involving a patient that 
requires unblinding of the treatment assignment.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_91986] 
The study will be conducted in accordance with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and 
Internationa l Conference  on Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines,  the World Medical Association 
Declaration of Helsinki guidelines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of 
Federal Regulations, and all other local regulatory requirements.  
 
2.4 Data Monitoring  
 
2.4.1 Safety Data Monitoring  
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or designee) is responsible for processing all reported adverse 
events (AEs). All serious adverse events (SAEs), reported to Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc. (or 
designee), are reviewed according to standard operating procedures. The medical monitor 
will review all AEs and SAEs on an ongoing basis throughout the study. Ionis 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or designee) will prepare and submit safety reports to the health 
authorities worldwide in accordance wit h local requirements. If it becomes necessary to 
communicate new safety information, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (or designee) will also 
prepare a safety notification letter and transmit it to study site.  
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_91987] (DSMB) will be established  to monitor the 
overall safe conduct of the study. Based on its ongoing assessment  of the safety and tolerability 
of ISIS 721744, the DSMB will provide recommendations to the Sponsor for modifying, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10483]. Details on the safety assessments, frequency of 
review, meeting schedules,  and controlled  access to unblinded  data are outlined in the DSMB 
Charter. 
 
2.5 Data Management  
An electronic  case report form (eCRF) utilizing an Electronic  Data Capture (EDC) 
application will be used for this Study.

2.5.1 Case Report Form Data 
BioClinica (or designee) is responsible for creating the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) data 
entry screens, database and edit checks using definitions  developed  by [CONTACT_81801], 
Inc. Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is responsible  for the review, data  management querying and 
locking of the database.  
Data are single-entered into the EDC system by [CONTACT_84275]. Programmed  edit 
checks (computer logic that checks the validity of the data entered and also prompts for 
missing data that is expected to be entered) are run and automatic queries are generated.  
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. reviews all data for accuracy and  validity and generates 
additional queries in the EDC system when necessary. The data is corrected or an 
explanation  concerning  the query is provided in the EDC system. After all data are entered, 
reviewed (by [CONTACT_84276]) and queried, and all queries 
resolved, the database is locked.  
 
2.5.[ADDRESS_91988] error, interquartile range (25th percentile, 75th percentile), and range 
(minimum, maximum) for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical 
variables will be used to summarize  most data. All statistical  tests will be conducted  using 2- 
sided tests with 5% Type I error rate unless otherwise stated. In view of the exploratory 
nature of this study, adjustments for multiplicity of testing will generally not be used.  
Both central and local lab data will be used in the analyses, including  by [CONTACT_84277], 
figures and  abnormality summary.

Statistical Analysis Plan  Feb 17, [ADDRESS_91989] deviation, 
coefficient  of variation  (CV), geometric  mean, geometric  %CV, median, minimum,  and 
maximum.  
General Presentation  Considerations  
 
The minimum  and maximum  will be reported to the same number of decimal places as the raw 
data recorded in the database. The mean, median, lower quartile and upper quartile will be 
reported to one more decimal place than the raw data record ed in the database. The standard 
deviation will be reported to two more decimal places than the raw data recorded in the 
database. In general, the maximum number of decimal places reported shall be four for any 
summary statistic.  
Categorical data will be s ummarized in terms of the number of subjects providing data at the 
relevant time point (n), frequency  counts and percentages.  Any planned collapsing  ofcategories 
will be detailed in the text and the data displays.  
Percentages will be presented to one decim al place and not be presented for zero counts. 
Percentages will be calculated using n as the denominator.  
P-values greater than or equal to 0.001, in general, will be presented to three decimal places. 
P-values less than 0.001 will be presented as “<0.001”.  
Confidence  intervals will be presented  to one more decimal place than the raw data. 
 
Baseline definition  
 
For platelets, Baseline will be defined as the average of all non-missing pre-dose assessments.  
 
For other assessments,  if there are [ADDRESS_91990]-treatment  Periods 
• For HAE attack endpoints:  
o The on-treatment period spans the time during which the study treatment is 
administered  until earliest date from [ADDRESS_91991]-treatment  period starts on the day after the on-treatment  period and 
ends on the day of the patient’s last contact [CONTACT_10598].  
• For PD (cHK and PKK levels) and AE-QoL: 
o The on-treatment period spans the time during which the study treatment is 
administered  until earliest date from [ADDRESS_91992]-treatment  period starts on the day after the on-treatment  period and 
ends on the day of the patient’s last contact [CONTACT_10598].  
 
 
Analytical  visits 
PD (cHK, plasma proenzyme  activation,  and PKK levels) and AE-QoL data will be mapped to 
analysis visit specified in the table below. The intent of these visit windows is not to align with 
those prescribed for visit scheduling in the clinical study protocol but, rather, based on the 
protocol-defined target study day, to delin eate mutually exclusive windows so that all 
assessments  proximal to a particular  study week can be integrated  to best represent the patient’s 
status during that period of the study. Visits after Week [ADDRESS_91993] -
treatment period (as defined above) will not be included in the PD analyses/summaries, even  
if they occurred within one of the visit windows. If  there are multiple assessments  within a visit 
window, the visit nearest the scheduled  date will be used unless 2 visits are equally near, in 
which case the average will be used.

Drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo).  
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT Population  will include all enrolled or randomized  patients. 
Per Protocol Population  
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population  will include all patients in the ITT Population  who are 
treated according to the protocol without any major deviations.  
PK Population  
The PK Population  will include all patients who are enrolled and receive at least [ADDRESS_91995] 1 evaluable PK sample.  
 
In addition to the above analysis populations,  it is recognized  that some data displays will be 
provided for “All Screened”, “Screening Failures” and “All Randomized” subjects but no 
data analysis will be executed in these populations except for the disposition table that 
includes all screened subjects.  
 
3.1.3 Sample Size Consideration  
The primary endpoint is the time-normalized  number of HAE attacks (per month)  from Week 
[ADDRESS_91996] 2.8 HAE attacks per 
4-month period, then with a 0.05 significance level and using Poisson model, the sample size 
of 18 patients (12 patients administered SC injections of ISIS 721744 80 mg and 6 patients 
administered placebo) will provide at least 90% power for the primary endpoint, considering a 
10% missing data or dropout rate for both active  treatment and placebo. The sample size of  
18 patients with HAE -1/HAE-[ADDRESS_91997] (DSMB) will be established  to provide ongoing, independent  review and assessment  of 
the safety data,  and to safeguard the interests and safety of the participating subjects in the  
study. Analysis of the data for DSMB review will be conducted  according  to the DSMB 
Charter. Because no formal hypothesis testing for safety assessments is planned, multiplicity 
concerns regarding r epeated analyses are not an issue.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Imputing  Missing Start or End Date  and Time  for HAE Attacks 
 
In general, missing start time will be imputed as 0:00 and missing end time will be imputed as 
23:59. However,  the following  rules will be applied for the attacks satisfying  the corresponding 
conditions, in order to conservatively classify the attacks as separate, distinct attacks with at 
least 24 hours in -between: 
• For HAE attacks with a missing start time and a non -missing start date one calendar 
day after the end date of the pre vious attack, the start time will be imputed using the 
end time of the previous HAE attack to ensure there are 24 hours in between the two 
attacks. 
• For HAE attacks with a missing start time and a non -missing end date/time within 24 
hours from the end date/time of the previous attack, the attack should be considered  as 
one attack with the previous attack  
• For HAE attacks with missing end time and a non -missing end date one calendar day 
before the start date of the next attack, the end time will be imputed as the start time of 
the next HAE attack to ensure there are 24 hours in between the two attacks.  
• For HAE attacks with a missing end time and non -missing start date/time within 24 
hours from the start date/time of the next attack, the attack should be considered  as one 
attack with the next attack.  
 
For HAE attacks with a non-missing start date and time and a missing stop date and time: 
• The stop date and time will be imputed as the earlier of the following  two date and time: 
o Start date and time + 48 hours or study completion date and the stop time of  
23:59, whichever is later.  
o [ADDRESS_91999] 24 hours after resolution of the prior attack’s symptoms.  
 
Specifically, there must be at least 24 hours between the stop date/ time of the first event and 
the start date/time of the next event, for the attacks to be considered  distinct. If there is less 
than 24 hours between the stop date/time of the first event and the start date/time of the next 
event, the events will be counted as one attack.  
 
When two or more attacks are combined for efficacy analysis, the parameters of the  attacks 
will be conservatively chosen. The start date and time of the combined attack will take the 
earliest start date and time from the individual attacks; and the end date and time of the 
combined attack will take the latest end date and time of the in dividual attacks. The severity of  
the combined attack will take  the highest severity from the  individual attacks. The primary 
location of the combined attack will be determined by [CONTACT_84278], and by [CONTACT_84279], peripheral attack, and abdominal 
attack. One primary location will be taken; and all the other primary location(s)  and secondary 
locations will be considered as secondary location for the combined attack. The rescue 
medications  and supportive  treatment  for the combined  attack will include all the records from 
individual attacks. Also, the combined attack will be considered as an investigator -confirmed 
attack if any of the individual attack being combined is an investi gator-confirmed attack.  
 
3.2 Demographic  and Baseline Characteristics  and Patient Disposition  
Baseline and demographic  variables will be summarized  descriptively  by [CONTACT_84280] A, overall for Part B, and for each analysis population.  
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics to be presented include age, age category (18 -<40, 
40 to 64, ≥65 years), gender, race, ethnicity, height, weight, BMI, type of genetic mutation.  
 
Age will be calculated as the difference between informe d consent date and patient birth date 
divided by 365.25 and rounded down to the associated integer value.  
 
For race summary, if multiple races are recorded in database, ‘Multiple Race’ will be used in 
the summary table but details records in the listing.  
 
A separate table will be created for HAE history and will include family history of HAE, age 
at onset of angioedema  symptoms,  HAE type, type of attack(s) experienced,  Lanadelumab  use, 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.

period HAE attack rate (attacks/4 weeks), run -in period HAE attack rate group (1 to <2, 2 to  
<3, ≥3 attacks/4weeks).  
 
The run-in period HAE attack rate will be calculated  for each subject as number of HAE attacks 
occurring during the run-in period divided by [CONTACT_84281]-in period multiplied by [ADDRESS_92001] enrollment  and disposition  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_84282] 
A, and overall for Part B.  
 
The summaries  will include: the total number of screened subjects,  the number of randomized 
(Part A) or enrolled (Part B) subjects, the number of subjects in each analysis population  (with 
the exception  of the PK Set), the number of subjects completing  treatment,  the primary reason 
for terminating  treatment,  the number of subjects completing  post-treatment  follow-up, and the 
primary reason for terminating post-treatment follow -up. 
 
3.3 Efficacy Analyses 
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population and Per -protocol population, 
with the former being the basis for the primary efficacy analysis.  
 
3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time-normalized  number of investigator -confirmed  HAE 
attacks per month (defined as 28 days) during the on -treatment period from Week 1 to Week 
17 ([ADDRESS_92002] dose administration),  will be compared  between ISIS [ADDRESS_92003] for treatment 
group (categorical), the time normalized run -in period attack rate (continuous) as a covariate, 
and the logarithm of time in month (days from first dose date to [ADDRESS_92004] dose 
administration  divided by 28) that each subject was observed during the period will be used as 
an offset variable.  
 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted  in the ITT population. 
See Section 3.[ADDRESS_92005] error for each treatment group as 
well as, the  mean rate  ratios relative  to the placebo group and corresponding  95% confidence 
intervals will be estimated. The p -value of Wald -based chi-square test will also be reported. 
The percentage  difference  in mean investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate between ISIS 
721744 80 mg and placebo will be calculated as 100% * (mean rate ratio –1). Similarly, the 
estimated upper and lower confidence limits for the mean  rate ratio can be transformed by  
[CONTACT_18647] 1 and multiplying by 100% t o calculate 95% confidence intervals for the 
percentage change.  
 
Below is the SAS code for the primary analysis: 
 
PROC GENMOD;  
CLASS arm; 
MODEL no_attks = arm baserate / DIST=poisson  LINK=log  OFFSET=logmon  PSCALE; 
LSMEANS arm/ DIFF CL EXP ILINK;

Where: 
arm= treatment  arm (categorical)  
no_attks = number of HAE attacks during  the analysis period 
baserate = normalized  HAE attack rate during the run-in period (continuous)  
logmon = logarithm  of time in month each patient was observed during the analysis period. 
 
 
If one treatment  group has 0 count, Fisher’s  Exact Test will be used for the analysis instead of 
Poisson regression. The odds ratio, corresponding 95% CI, and p -value will be provided.  
 
The following  sensitivity  analyses will be performed  on the primary efficacy endpoint to 
evaluate the robustness of the results.  
1. The primary analysis described above will be repeated in the PPS as a sensitivity 
analysis. 
 
2. The primary efficacy endpoint will be compared between ISIS 721744 80 mg and 
placebo in Part A using a Negative Binomial model. The model will include fixed 
effects for treatment  group (categorical),  the time normalized  run-in period attack rate 
(continuous) as a covariate, and the logarithm of time in month (days from first dose 
date to [ADDRESS_92006] dose administration divided by 28) that each patient was 
observed during the on-treatment  period will be used as an offset variable. The analysis 
will be conducted in the ITT population.

The Part B data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The exact  95% CI for mean 
based on the gamma distribution will be reported.  
 
In addition to the model -based analysis described above, unadjusted monthly investigator - 
confirmed  HAE attack rates from Week 1 to Week 17 (end of the on-treatment  period) as well 
as change and percent change from baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_84283]. The monthly investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate will be calculated for each patient 
as the number of HAE attacks occurring during from Week 1 to Week 17 (end of t he on- 
treatment period) divided by [CONTACT_84284] 28 days. The mean percent change from baseline on HAE attacks by [CONTACT_84285].  
 
The number of investigator -confirmed  HAE attacks per month from Week 1 to Week 17 (end 
of the on -treatment period) will be also summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_24473] (per 28 -day 
interval) and treatment  group and by [CONTACT_9524]. The summary will include the monthly investigator - 
confirmed HAE attack rate, change from run-in period, and percent change from run-in period 
of investigator -confirmed HAE attack rate. Investigator -confirmed HAE attacks will be 
grouped into [ADDRESS_92007] day of the prior interval plus 1 day and end 28 days later.  
 
3.3.2 Analysis of Secondary  Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time-normalized number of investigator -confirmed HAE attacks (per month) 
from Week 5 to Week 17

complete Week 5 ( 29 days) HAE assessments  will be included in the analysis. The logarithm 
of time in month from Week 5 (Day 29) to Week 17 (end of the on-treatment  period) for each 
patient will be used as an offset variable in the model.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time-normalized number of moderate or severe investigator -confirmed HAE 
attacks (pe r month) from Week 5 to Week 17  
It will be analyzed using the same method as described  for the primary efficacy endpoint, will 
be conducted in both ITT and Per -protocol populations. Only patients who complete Week 5 
(29 days) of HAE assessments  will be included in the analysis. The logarithm  of time in month 
from Week 5 (Day 29) to Week 17 (end of the on -treatment period) for each patient will be 
used as an offset variable in the model.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The number of patients with  a clinical response (defined as a ≥ 50%, ≥ 70%, or ≥ 
90% reduction from Baseline in HAE attack rate) by [CONTACT_10585] [ADDRESS_92008] 95% confidence interval (Santner and Snell 1980) will be provided. The 
Fisher’s Exact test p -value will also be reported. The analysis will be conducted in both ITT 
and Per-protocol populations.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Change and Percent Change in cHK and PKK levels at Week 5 to Week 17 
The change and percent change  from baseline  in cHK and PKK levels at each visit during the 
treatment period will be compared between ISIS 721744 80 mg and placebo in Part A using 
the Mixed Effects Model with Repeated Measure s (MMRM) model. The response variable is 
the change or percent change from baseline at post -baseline visit up to Week 17. For patients 
who terminate treatment early, only the data collected up to [ADDRESS_92009] dose 
administration will be included. The  MMRM model will include effects of treatment (ISIS 
721744 or placebo), time (categorical),  treatment -by-time interaction,  and baseline value. The 
analysis will be conducted in both ITT and Per -protocol populations. The unstructured 
covariance  model will be used to model the within patient errors, shared across treatments  and 
small sample adjustments to standard errors and tests will be made following the Kenward - 
Roger approach (Kenward,  M. G. and Roger, J. H. (1997). If there are convergence  problems 
with the repeated measures mixed model, this will be explored. For example, the SCORING=[ADDRESS_92010] 4 iterations. If the convergence problem cannot be r esolved the unstructured  
covariance  matrix will be replaced by [CONTACT_84286] (Type=CS in 
SAS). 
Below is the SAS code for this analysis:

The normality of each parameter will be examined using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] –Wilk test. The non - 
parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will also be performed at each visit as the sensitivity 
analysis. Hodges -Lehmann estimates of the differences between ISIS [ADDRESS_92011] will also be provided.  
 
CHK and PKK levels as well as  the change and percent changes from  baseline over time will 
also be summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765], treatment group and by [CONTACT_9524].  
 
The change and percent change in plasma proenzyme  activation  levels will also be analyzed.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Consumption  of on-demand medication  by [CONTACT_41585] 9 and 17 
The number and percentage  of patients who used on-demand medication  by [CONTACT_10585] 9 (Day 57) 
and by [CONTACT_10585] 17 (end of the  on-treatment period) will be  tabulated by [CONTACT_84283]. On-demand medicat ions will be identified based on manual review.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AE-QoL score at Weeks [ADDRESS_92012] option 2 points, etc. The AE -QoL domain scores and total score are calculated by 
[CONTACT_21734]:  
(Sum of all completed  items) / (maximum  sum of all possible items)*100 
Computation of AE -QoL Total Score  
Example 1: All items were completed (maximum  possible sum: 68 points) 
Sum of all 17 completed  items: 41 points. 
Total score = 100*(41/68)  = 60 (out of a possible 100 points) 
 
Example 2: 2 items were not completed  (maximum  possible sum: 60 points). 
Sum of all 15 completed items: 41 points.  
Total score = 100*(41/60)  = 68 (out of a possible 100 points) 
 
Computation  of Domain Scores (Example:  Fears/Shame)  
Example: Sum of all 6 completed items: 14 points 
Maximum possible sum: 24 points  
Domain Score = 100*(14/24)  = 58 (out of a possible 100 points) 
Remarks 
Since only answered items are included in the computation (and the calculated domain and 
total scores are not raw scores but linear transformations to a 0 -to-100 scale), the calculated 
scores are not or only little influenced by [CONTACT_84287].  
 
An AE-QoL domain score should not be calculated if more than one item is left unanswered 
in that domain. T he AE-QoL total score should not be calculated if more than 25% of items 
(>4 items) are left unanswered.  
The minimal and highest possible domain and total scores are 0 and 100, respectively.  
 
The AE-QoL total score and domain score will be analyzed using the same method as described 
for cHK, will be conducted in both ITT and Per -protocol population.

(no investigator  confirmed  HAE attacks) by [CONTACT_10585] 17 (end of the on-treatment  period) will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_84288]. Patients who discontinued treatment early due to 
lack of efficacy or AEs will be considered  as non-responders  and included in the denominator 
for the calculation of the proportion in the ITT population. Patients who discontinued due to 
other reason will be excluded from analysis. The risk difference between ISIS [ADDRESS_92014] 95% confidence interval 
will be provided. The Fisher’s Exact test p -value will also be reported. The analysis will be

dose of study drug but subsequently appears.  
To determine  the AE as treatment -emergent or  not, if there is no “Formlink”  link, and the  AE 
(start date/time)  occurs on or after the patient’s first dosing date/time,  then the AE is treatment - 
emergent. Otherwise, if the AE (start date/time) occurs prior to the patient’s first dosing 
date/time, then the AE is not treatment -emergent.  
 
If there is a “Formlink” link between two AE records, then we compare them pairwise, and 
consider two cases, where we compare the AE severity (mild/moderate/severe) betw een the 
two records in the pair. We chronologically  order the 2 records (by [CONTACT_84290]) and refer to 
the “first” and “second” AE.  
 
Case 1: The first AE record in the pair occurs before first dosing, and the second AE 
record occurs after first dosing.  
If the AE severity of  the second record is worse than that of  the first record, then only 
the second AE is deemed as a TEAE. Otherwise,  neither record is considered  as TEAE. 
 
Case 2: Both AE records in  the pair occur after first dosing. 
If the AE severity on the second record is worse than the severity on the first record, 
then count both records as treatment -emergent.  But, if the severity improves,  then only 
count the first record as treatment -emergent.  
When counting the total number of treatment -emergent events, events linked together 
through change in severity will still be counted as separate events.  
 
All TEAEs identified  based on the rules above will be summarized  in the event number 
analysis. 
The most conservative approach will be used to determine if the event occurs after the 
treatment. For example, if the onset date or resolution date of an AE is prior to the first study 
treatment date, it will be considered to have occurred prior to the study  period. If the onset or 
resolution date of an AE is a partial date with only month or year available or complete 
missing, then the event is assumed to be within the study period unless the year is prior to the 
year of the first study treatment  date, or if in the same year, the month is prior to the month of 
the first study treatment date.

summarized. Discontinuations due to  AE at the injection site will be summarized separately.  
Percentage of injections leading  to those events will be summarized by [CONTACT_84293]. Additionally, percentage of injections leading to events will be 
summarized  by [CONTACT_60142],  severe severity and overall discontinuation  of study drug due to AE

QTcF = QT / (RR) 1/3, where RR= 60/VR 
QTcB = QT / (RR) 1/2, where RR= 60/VR 
For the continuous variables above, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard error, standard 
deviation, median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, minimum and maximum) of the results at 
each study visit, as well as the changes and percent changes  from Baseline to each study visit, 
will be presented  in summary tables; for the categorical  responses  to overall interpretation,  the 
results and the associated  findings at each visit will be summarized  by [CONTACT_33335].  
 
All the safety ECG data collected will be listed. 
 
3.4.[ADDRESS_92020] dose of study medication. Partial 
or missing medication  start date or end date will be imputed by [CONTACT_84303]: 
 
Start date: 
• If year, month and  day are all missing then assign the  date of first dose of Study Drug 
• If month and day are missing and year is:

summarized by [CONTACT_84304], preferred name [CONTACT_19731] [CONTACT_84305].  
 
3.4.8 Angioedema  Activity Score 
The AAS consists of 5 questions as well as an opening question. A score between 0 and 3 is 
assigned to every answer field. The question scores are summed up to an AAS day sum score, 
7 AAS day sum scores to an AAS week  sum score (AAS7), and 4 ASS week sum scores may 
be summed up to an AAS 4 -week sum score (AAS28). Accordingly, the minimum and 
maximum possible AAS scores are 0 -15 (AAS day sum score), 0 -105 (AAS7), and 0 -420 
(AAS28). Missing scores will be imputed using the LOCF method.  
 
The opening question may be used to count the number of angioedema affected days during 
the AAS documentation period b ut has no score.

3.5.1 Plasma Concentration  Data of Total Full Length Oligonucleotides  
Plasma concentrations  of ISIS 721744  (ISIS 721744  eq.), along with the scheduled  (nominal) 
and actual samples times (i.e., time  from SC dosing)  will be listed (when applicable)  for each 
patient, by [CONTACT_1570], nominal dose, and day. In addition, percent differences between 
scheduled and actual sampling times will also be listed for all patients. Percent differences 
between actual administered dose and nominal dose will also be listed.  
 
Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be indicated by 
“BLQ”. For the purpose of calculating typi[INVESTIGATOR_10476] (n, mean, SD, %CV, 
geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) for plasma 
concentrations, all BLQ values will be set to zero. Mean plasma concentrations that are BLQ 
will be presented  as “BLQ”, and the SD and %CV will be reported as not applicable.  Summary 
statistics of the ISIS [ADDRESS_92023]  and/or 
biostatistician,  samples may be excluded from descriptive  statistics if there are large deviations 
between scheduled and actual sampling times,  or large deviations between actual dose and 
nominal dose.  
 
ISIS 721744 eq. plasma concentration versus time (actual) profiles for each patient that 
received ISIS 721744 active treatment, as well as the mean (± SD or SE) plasma 
concentrations  versus time (scheduled)  profiles, will be presented  graphically  on linear and 
semilogarithmic scales. At the discretion of the pharmacokineticist and/or biostatistician, 
samples may be excluded from the mean plots if there are large deviations between 
scheduled and ac tual sampling times.  
 
3.5.2 Plasma Pharmacokinetic  Parameters  
The plasma PK of ISIS 721744 (as total full -length oligonucleotides) will be assessed 
following SC administration. Non -compartmental PK analysis of ISIS 721744 (total full - 
length oligonucleotides)  will be carried out on each individual  subject data set using Phoenix 
WinNonlin version 8.0 or higher (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). For 
calculation of PK parameters, all BLQ values will be set to zero. The plasma PK parameters 
for ISIS 721744 -eq. will be calculated based on actual sampling times. The plasma PK 
parameters to be calculated or determined (when applicable) are listed in Table 1. Other 
plasma PK parameters, as appropriate, may be determined or calculated at the discretion of 
the PK scientist.

Plasma pharmacokinetic  parameters  will be summarized  using descriptive  statistics (n, mean, 
SD, %CV, geometric mean, geometric %CV, median, minimum, and maximum) by 
[CONTACT_1570], nominal dose, and day. Additionally, the relationship between dose and 
plasma exposure parameters (C max and AUC) of total full -length ASOs (ISIS 721744 -eq.) 
will be evaluated using linear -regression analysis of the  log-transformed mean data. Lastly, 
the relationship between individual subject trough data at selected time points and plasma 
exposure parameters (C max and AUC) will also be evaluated.  
 
3.5.3 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic  Exposure -Response  Analysis 
 
Exposure -response correlations  may be explored graphically  between plasma exposure (AUC, 
Cmax, Ctrough, as appropriate), and selected PD measures and outcomes, as well as other 
relevant biomarkers (such as plasma prekallikrein (PKK), etc.). In addition, the relatio nship

Population  PK and PKPD analysis may be performed  using the PK and PD data from this 
Study, and/or combined  with other ISIS 721744  clinical PK data later in the development 
timeline. 
 
3.4.5 Immunogenicity  (IM) Analysis 
 
Immunogenicity (IM) analyses will be conducted in the Safety Population.  Samples 
collected pre -dose on Days 1, 29 and 57 and anytime on Days 15, 113, and 176, including 
early termination samples for IM assessment, may be analyzed for anti -ISIS 721744 
antibodies (ADA). In addition, plasma samples collected at other t ime points (for PK 
purposes) may also potentially be evaluated if deemed of further interest and warranted by  
[CONTACT_84306].  An evaluable sample will be designated ‘IM positive’ based 
on both positive screening  and confirmation  assay results (i.e., confirmed  positive result), and 
otherwise will be deemed ‘IM negative’. Sample IM results (screen positive/negative, 
confirmed positive/negative or unevaluable, and when applicable, titer of anti -ISIS 721744 
antibodies) before, during, and after t reatment with study drug (ISIS 721744 or placebo) 
(sample IM status) will be listed by [CONTACT_10566]. The sample ADA incidence  
(number) and incidence rate (percent) at each evaluated study time point will be determined 
and appropriately summarized by [CONTACT_84307], positive, and unknown status.  
Furthermore,  titer over time will be also appropriately  summarized  (using descriptive 
statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%), and range by [CONTACT_10566].  
 
Study subjects’ overall ADA status will be assigned ‘IM positive’ status if they have at least 
one confirmed positive sample result at any time during the treatment or post -treatment 
evaluation per iods. Study subjects will be assigned ‘IM negative’ status if all evaluated IM 
sample results during the treatment  and post-treatment  evaluation  periods are IM negative and 
they have at least one evaluable IM result collected post study drug treatment. Oth erwise, a 
study subject will be assigned ‘unknown’ IM status. Furthermore, subjects with positive overall  
ADA status will be further classified  into different ADA  types based on their baseline ADA  
status and change in ADA titer post treatment  as described  below (Shankar et al., 2014): 
• Treatment -Emergent  ADA: sum of treatment -induced ADA and treatment -boosted 
ADA as described below:  
o Treatment -Induced ADA: ADA developed de novo (seroconversion) 
following  biologic drug administration  (i.e., formation  of ADA any time after 
the initial drug administration in a subject without pre -existing ADA, i.e., 
baseline negative ADA)  
o Treatment -Boosted ADA: pre -existing ADA that were boosted to a higher 
level following biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial 
drug administration  the ADA titer is greater than the baseline titer by a factor 
of 8-fold or more

• Treatment -Unaffected  ADA: pre-existing ADA that were not affected (boosted) 
following biologic drug administration (i.e., any time after the initial drug 
administration the ADA titer is 4 -fold or less)  
• ADA type would be not applicable  (NA) if the subject overall ADA status is 
negative. 
•  
Other subject level IM parameters  to be calculated/defined  may include but not limited to: 
• Subject ADA Status at Baseline: "Positive"  if the subject has Week 1 Day 1 pre-dose 
sample (baseline) tested as confirmed positive; "Negative" if the subject has Week 1 
Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) tested as confirmed negative; "Unknown" if the 
subject has Week 1 Day 1 pre -dose sample (baseline) unevaluable.  
• Onset of ADA: i.e., the first day ADA positive sample observed,  will be calculated 
by: [CONTACT_10640] “positive” sample  IM status - first dose date +1  
• Last Positive ADA Study Day: the last positive ADA sample observed from the start 
of study drug treatment and will be calculated by: [CONTACT_10641] 
“positive” sample IM status - first dose date +1  
• Last IM Sampling Study Day :the last ADA sample collected from the start of study 
drug treatment  and will be calculated  by: [CONTACT_10642] - first dose 
date +1 
• Peak titer: the highest titer observed for the subject 
• Time to peak titer: the time to reach peak titer will be calculated  by: 
[CONTACT_10643] - first dose date +1  
• Total number of ADA Positive Samples: the total number of ADA samples being 
confirmed positive for the subject  
• Total number of ADA Samples evaluated:  the total number of ADA samples being 
collected and analyzed successfully with reportable results for the subject  
 
Other immunogenicity data analysis may be conducted (e.g. classification as transient or 
persistent  status for IM positive subjects) if there are a sufficient  number of subjects with 
transient IM status. Transient and Persistent ADA definitions are defined below: 
Transient ADA response will be defined as:  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at one sampling time point during the 
treatment or follow -up observation period (excluding the last sampling time point, 
which will be considered  persistent  unless shown to be undetectable  at a later time) or 
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment (including  follow-up period if any), where the ﬁrst and last ADA-positive 
samples (irrespective  of any negative samples in between) are separated  by a period 
less than [ADDRESS_92026]’s last sampling time point is ADA -negative.

Persistent  ADA response will be defined as: 
• Treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more sampling time points during the 
treatment  (including  follow-up period if any), where the ﬁrst and last ADA-positive 
samples (irrespective  of any negative samples in between) are separated  by a period 
of 16 weeks or longer or  
• Treatment -induced ADA detected only at the last sampling time point of the study 
treatment  period or at a sampling time point with less than [ADDRESS_92027] level ADA prevalence, incidence, and positive ADA response being transient or 
persistent (if applicable) will be calculated as the number and the proportion (percent) of the 
study population during the study period by [CONTACT_10566]. Subjec t level IM parameters 
(as described above) will be listed by [CONTACT_10644], and also 
appropriately summarized (using descriptive statistics) as median, quartiles (25% and 75%) 
and range, by [CONTACT_10566].  
 
In addition t o PK assessments (Section 3.5.2), selected safety (Section 3.4) and PD 
assessments (Section 3.6) may be further stratified by [CONTACT_84308] (i.e., subject IM 
status being positive, negative or unknown) and presented in tables and/or graphically, as 
deemed appropriate or warranted by [CONTACT_84309], medical 
monitor, and/or biostatistician. Other stratifications (e.g., based on antibody titer, onset of 
ADA, etc.) of selected PK, efficacy and safety assessments  may also be performed  if deemed 
warranted  at the discretion  of the pharmacokineticist,  medical monitor, and/or biostatistician.

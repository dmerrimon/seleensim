1.1 SYNOPSIS  
 Title:  An Integrated Two -Way Communication and Near -Real -Time Sensing 
System to Detect and Modify Daily Inactivity among Adults Over Age 60  
 Grant Number:  5P30AG048785 -07 Study Description:  The objective is to test if Companion, an Integrated Two -Way 
Communication and Near -Real -Time Sensing System, improves and 
sustains overall daily free -living activity and sedentary behavior in 
adults  over 60 y. The central hypothesis is that Companion will improve 
overall daily free -living activity and sedentary behavior in adults> 60 y 
and thereby [CONTACT_54155] . Objectives*: 
 Primary Objective:  Determine if Companion improves free -living activity 
and sedentary behavior and sustains this change in adults  >60y.  In this 
RCT (n=46),  both treatment and control groups will engage in a 16 -week 
supervised exercise program and then be followed -up after 24 weeks.1,2 
Companion will be deployed in the treatment group (n=23) only. P rima ry 
outcomes are daily total and bouts of physical activity and sedentary 
time.  
Exploratory  Objective: Explore if supplementing supervised exercise with 
Companion further improves and sustains cardiometabolic health, body 
composition, cognition , and psychosocial outcomes . Endpoints*:  
Primary Endpoint:  Physical activity and sedentary time : Daily total and 
bouts  
Exploratory  Endpoints:  Anthropometrics; Plasma glucose ; HbA1C ; 
Insulin ; Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]; Lean and fat mass; Physical function; Muscular and 
aerobic fitness; Cognition ; perceptions of competence related to health 
behavior ; Autonomy support (from companion) ; Autonomous 
motivation (for physical activity) ; Relatedness (to the Companion) ; 
General satisfaction.  Study Population:  N= 46 , gender - NA, age>60 y , demographic group - older adults ; general 
health status - health y; geographic location - [LOCATION_011] and surrounding 
neighborhoods.  Phase* or Stage:  1A Description of 
Sites/Facilities Enrolling 
Participants:  The Human Performance and Exercise Science (HPES) Laboratory  is 
located in the Behrakis  Health Science Center at Northeastern 
University, which will be the sole site for the study. Participants who do 
not prefer to have their measurements conducted at their residence 
will come to the lab to have measurements completed. T he study is not 
intended to include sites outside of the [LOCATION_002].

Intervention /Experimental 
Manipulation : The study intervention consists of wearable sensors integrated with the 
smartphone to develop a behavior -aware, virtual “Companion” that  
uses a “human -in-the-loop” approach to enable meaningful two -way 
communication. Companion builds rich models of typi[INVESTIGATOR_54134] 
(CS-EMA) to deliver intervention components and behavior c hange 
strategies using socially engaging, contextually salient, and tailored 
text-message conversations in near -real-time. The duration of the 
intervention is 4 months . 
 Study Duration*: Estimated time (in months) from when the study opens to enrollment 
until completion of data collection  is 6.5 months . Participant Duration:  Time for each individual participant to complete all study -related tasks  
is 6.5 months . 1.2 SCHEMA

among adults>60y, and is most common in aging research .5-[ADDRESS_57881] (60 min, ~1 
to 3 times/week) and ineffectiveness in changing behavior outside weekly se ssions.8 Additionally, 
adults>60y compensate for increased exercise by [CONTACT_54156] b ehavior outside training 
sessions, which attenuates positive gains in health from supervised exercise.10,13 -19 Independent of 
physical activity, reducing sedentary time improves cardiometabolic and functional health in 
adults>60y.20,21 Thus, feder al guidelines recommend that older adults move more and sit less during the 
day.22 Strategies to motivate adults>60y who participate in supervised programs to be more active and 
sit less outside structured weekly training sessions are necessary.  
Technologies including weara bles and smartphones have great potential to promote daily positive 
behaviors in adults>60y.23 Nonetheless, a significant research gap is that “such technologies rarely 
integrate meaningful two -way communication ,24” whic h allows an interventionist to successfully engage 
an adult via an intelligent, context -sensitive dialogue to problem -solve and motivate change.[ADDRESS_57882] communication interventions (e.g., text message and internet -based strategies) have limited 
meaning fulness due to an inability to appropriately time the communication and tailor it based on 
ongoing or recent  behavior.  
Awareness of: (i) ongoing or recent behavior (from sensors), (ii) situational contexts of the behavior, (iii) 
past conversation, and (iv ) the adult’s preferences (# ii, iii, and iv gathered via two -way communication) 
will help in generating meaningful discourse that allows the creation of an adaptive intervention at a 
level that was not previously possible.  We have integrated wearable sens ors with the smartphone to 
develop a behavior -aware, virtual “Companion” that uses a “human -in-the-loop” approach to enable 
meaningful two -way communication. Companion builds rich models of typi[INVESTIGATOR_54135] (CS -EMA) to deliver intervention components

5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals  who do not meet the 
criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting /not meeting  one or more 
exclusion /inclusion  criteria , respectively  will not be enrolled  in the study . 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRU ITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Anticipated number of people to be screened =56; Women and Minorities= at least 50 and 20% 
respectively; Anticipated number of people to be enrolled =46; Women and Minorities= at least 50 and 
20% respectively;  
Participation in this study will be sought using flyers (see attached flyer) and email (see attached 
recruitment email template) to identify interested individuals. We will identify potentially eligible 
Northeastern employees from University department’s online staff directories and obtain individual 
email addresses from employee directories to contact [CONTACT_29569]’s directly in seeking participation in our 
study using the aforementioned recruitment email and flyer. Recruitment materials (email and flyer) will 
include the self -inclusion criteria. Should the conditions not apply to individuals who are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], he 
or she may exclude himself or herself without the need to reveal his or her reasons to the researchers. 
Recruitment emails will be sen t a second time a week later if there is no response on the initial invite. 
People who meet the self -inclusion criteria and express interest in further information will be asked to 
set up a time to meet briefly at their Northeastern office /home/virtually with the researchers.  
This strategy is appropriate because Northeastern University has over [ADDRESS_57890] recruiting efforts at these institutions as well, 
which are all less that ¼ mile from NU’s campus.  Additionally, we will reach out to senior centers  in 
[LOCATION_011] and surrounding areas and other resources including social media and listservs that are publicly 
available.  
The targeted dist ribution of the subjects’ racial and ethnic makeup is anticipated to be successful given 
the demographic distribution in the city of [LOCATION_011] based on estimates obtained from [LOCATION_002] 
Census bureau. According to these data, the distribution of minoritie s in the general population in 
[LOCATION_005] is 47.4%, Hispanic or Latino of any race is 19.7%, Black or African American alone is 
25.3%, American Indian or Alaska native is 0.3%, Asian alone is 9.6%, and those identifying as being of

Research   11 two or more races is 5.1%. White adults are the majority at 52.6%. The proportion of women in the city 
of [LOCATION_011] is 51.9%.  
Participants may receive up to $120 in remuneration, consisting of $[ADDRESS_57891] of residence. Payment will 
be provided after completion of the study, either after the month -6 follow up  follow -up or at an earlier 
point should the participant drop out of the study prior to moth 6 follow up , consistent with the 
measurement  completion criteria. The incentive is appropriate and will not be viewed as coercive.

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANI PULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
The Companion : Companion is based on Self Determination Theory (SDT) and the application of 
Motivational Interviewing (MI) to creatively use information on behaviors, attitudes, and environmental 
contexts to create user -Companion interactions that are tailored to participant needs.  SDT addresses 
cognitive and affective factors in human motivation and posits three innate psychological needs that 
form the basis for optimal self -motivation: competence, relatedness, and autonomy.[ADDRESS_57892] psychological integration.33,34  
Next, we describe Companion’s technological components, their integration, and integrated function: 
(1) Continuously worn wirel ess ActiGraph ® wrist sensor capture raw motion data. (2) These data are 
transmitted hourly to a backend. (3) Motion data are processed immediately at the backend using 
validated machine learning algorithms to characterize data as physical activity (e.g. walking or other) or 
sedentary.  (4) Processed data are visualized by a health coach using a backend interface that temporally 
displays estimated behavior types.  (5) Research assistants  will enquire about major automatica lly detected 
behaviors (e.g. movement >10 min; sitting >20 min) to determine context (e.g. walk during lunch; in a 
weekly meeting) using CS -EMA. ( 6) They can also choose to determine behavior context of any other 
automatically detected behavior. ( 7) These automated and manual records will inc rementally yield a 
reliable visual model of major habitual daily behaviors at the backend. Such information will be richer than 
what was previously available to an interventionist. (8) Based on the model, coaches will use the CS -EMA 
two-way communication a pp to intervene and promote prescription component delivery at opportune 
times (i.e., near -real-time) to help develop routines.  
Supervised Exercise Program : For the first 16 weeks, all participants will engage in ~45 to 60 min of 
aerobic, strength, flexib ility and balance training, twice/week.29,35 Participants will either visit 
Northeastern’s Exercise Science Lab for supervised personal training  or engage  virtually over Zoom 
during the training session . The lead trainers will be an exercise physiologist or a trained graduate 
student. After the session, the trainer and participant will outline goals and prescription plan for the 
days prior the next training session and those to be performed by [CONTACT_54160]. The plan

Protocol <#CompRoy1>   27 April 2021  
NIH Protocol Te mplate for Behavioral and Social Sciences 
Research   12 will be based on guideline s from the American College of Sports Medicine.36,37 Supervised training 
sessions for the two groups will be scheduled on different days and allocation of participants to a trainer 
will be at random.  
Treatment Group : This group will receive the Companion. Communication during weeks 1 to 4, will focus 
on gatheri ng information on the participant’s motivations, preferences, habits, contexts, and usual 
behavior patterns to build a typi[INVESTIGATOR_54137]. We expect a decreasing level of 
change in behavior models that are built using information ac crued incrementally over these 4 weeks.23  
Companion will monitor ongoing and recent behavior, communicate with the participant (if necessary) 
to deli ver contextually salient intervention strategies. Additionally, there will be a fixed Companion -
initiated communication in the early evening (~4 to 6 pm) to discuss the achievement of that day’s goals 
and prescribe strategies to achieve pending goals.  
The nature of the first communication the next morning will be based on participant performance 
during all waking hours of the preceding day - e.g.,  encouraging, problem -solving. This is possible 
because the participant will be instructed to continuously wear the wrist device, which stores motion 
data in its internal memory . These data  will be downloaded to Companion and analyzed.  
Regular interaction will enable a corresponding incremental personalization of communication based on 
knowledge of each participant’s communication style and personality. Similarly, such frequent 
interaction will also enable an incremental knowledge of the  participant’s changing physical ability and 
activity preferences, which will facilitate a corresponding increase in personalizing activity prescription.    
Control Group : This group will not receive the Companion, which will be the only difference with th e 
treatment group. I.e., the control group will receive standard treatment – the supervised training 
program and an exercise prescription for those days when they are on their own. This will be done on 
the two days when control group participants meet face -to-face with the trainer for supervised training.  
Primary Outcomes : Total duration and number of bouts of: (i) light and moderate -to-vigorous physical 
activity and (ii) sedentary behavior measured over a period of one week using accelerometry.38,39 Week -
long measures will be made at baseline, and weeks 16 and 24.  
Exploratory Outcomes : Cardiometabolic health: Plasma glucose, HbA1C, insulin, and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Body 
composition: lean and fat mass. Physical function. Muscular and aer obic fitness. Cognition.42 Perceptions 
of competence related to health behaviors. Autonomy support (from companion). Autonomous 
motivation (for physical activity). Relatedness (to the Companion) . General satisfaction.

Research   16 1. Resting heart rate and blood pressure : Heart rate and blood pressure will be measured using an 
automatically inflatable blood pressure arm cuff and monitor. These measures will be conducted in 
triplicate after a rest of 5 minutes between each measure.  
2. Anth ropometrics : Height and weight will be measured using a stadiometer and a standard digital 
weight scale, respectively, and circumferences will be measured by a trained research staff member 
using a measuring tape (in triplicate).  
3. Body composition : Whole body percent fat and lean mass will be measured using Bioelectrical 
Impedance (BIA) and will be conducted by [CONTACT_7628]. During the test, the participant will 
step bare feet on an electronic scale and hold handheld conduction electrodes . A weak electric 
current will flow through the body and the voltage is measured in order to calculate impedance of the 
body and thereby, the % of body fat and lean mass. The test will be completed within [ADDRESS_57897] is similar to steppi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a weighing scale.  
4. Blood glucose and lipid profiles:  We will measure this using finger -stick blood analyses with a 
CardioChek Plus device (PTS Diagnostics). The CardioChek Plus is a certified fast, accurate and efficient 
portable analyzer capable of obtaining a full lipid profile and glucose readings in 90 seconds from a 
finger stick strip blood sample (15 – 40 micro Liters). The participant’s blood will not be stored, as the 
finger stick analyses are immediate, and the mea suring strips are discarded appropriately after the 
test.  
5. Cognitive tests:  The participant will complete a computer -administered test that measures various 
aspects of his or her cognitive abilities (attention, mental skills, memory, and processing speed).  
6. Physical function tasks:  The participants’ pattern of walking (Gait), endurance, strength and balance 
will be evaluated by a series of performance assessments, which are safe and practical. These 
assessments mimic daily activities. Details of these perfor mance assessments are as follows:  
(i) Gait: the participant will be asked to walk at his or her usual pace on a 4 -meter course twice. The 
researchers will time each of these walks with a stopwatch.  
(ii) Endurance : the participant will first be asked to pe rform a series of chair stands. Beginning from a 
sitting position, the participant will be asked to stand up and then sit down five times in a row, as fast 
as he or she can, without using his or her arms to help.  
(iii) Strength : the participant will be as ked to squeeze a hand -held device to determine the maximum 
force he or she can produce with each hand repeating the test three times for the left and right hands.  
(iv) Balance : the participant will first be asked to stand in different positions while keep ing his or her 
balance first with eyes open and  then  with eyes closed. The tester will demonstrate what to do and 
will be nearby [CONTACT_54163].  
7. Muscular and Aerobic Fitness: We will assess the participant’s fitness with a  series of short 
assessments explained below. A trained exercise physiologist will spot and supervise all exercises to 
ensure safety and proper technique. All testing procedures will be preceded with proper warm -up and 
instructions to minimize any risks. D etails of these assessments are as follows:  
(i) Muscular endurance: We will assess the endurance of the participant’s lower and upper body by 
[CONTACT_54164]. For the upper body we will do the 
Standard Push Up t est where participants will perform as many pushups as possible. For the lower 
body we will use the Repetitive Squat Test where the participant stands with feet 15 cm apart, squats 
<Protocol Title: Companion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]>   Version <2020.9.23>  
Protocol <#CompRoy1>   [ADDRESS_57898] the number 
of repetitions. The participant is free to terminate the tests at any moment either upon voluntary 
exhaustion or lack of desire to continue.  
(ii) Aerobic Fitness - We will assess aerobic fitness using the [ADDRESS_57899] 
surface for a period of 6 min. The total distance walked during this duration is measured using a 
measuring wheel.  
8. Other: (i) [ADDRESS_57900] a 
virtual 30 -min face -to-face counseling session with the researchers on: i) benefits of reducing 
sedentary behavior and increasing physical activity, and ii) various strategi es to decrease workplace 
and home sedentary behaviors and initiate a physically active lifestyle.  
(ii) Participants in the lifestyle physical activity intervention group will have a virtual 60 -min face -to-
face counseling session via a HIPAA complaint ZOOM  session. This session will include the same 
components received by [CONTACT_54165] 30 -
min of conversation to further personalize his or her physical activity prescription plan and create 
goals relate d to physical activity and sedentary behavior lifestyle choices. During this time the 
researcher will ask the participant in the lifestyle physical activity intervention group questions about 
his or her schedule, preferences, health -related behaviors, and other behaviors related to work 
schedule, hobbies/leisure interests, family dynamics, home and work environment, means of daily 
transportation, etc.  that can be used to help support the participant towards achieving his or her 
physical activity and sedenta ry behavior lifestyle goals.  
(iii) After study completion, participants will be asked to complete a follow -up interview in person 
during the end of study follow -up (month 6 ). The interview will take no longer than 15 -20 minutes. 
The conversations may be r ecorded only with the participant’s permission. Once the audio recordings 
are transcribed, the audio recordings will be immediately destroyed.   Table 2. Self -completed Measures (1 – 1.5 hours)  Measure  Baseline  Month 4 follow up  Month 6 follow up  General Health and

questionnaire that assesses a participant’s feelings of competence about engaging in physical activity.  
2. Short Health Care Climate Questionnaire : This questionnaire has 6 items that assess a participant’s 
perceptions of the degree to which the companion is supportive of autonomy; i.e., that the 
Companion considers the participants perspective and provides appropriate and meaningful fe edback 
and opportunities for choice.  
3. Exercise Self -Regulation Questionnaire : This is a 31 - item self -report to measure the ability of the 
participant to regulate behavior to achieve one’s goals  
4. Basic Need Satisfaction in Relationships Scale : This scale ad dresses need satisfaction in general in 
one’s life. It has 21 items assessing the three needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness.  
5. Diet: The participant will report frequency and portion size of foods consumed during the past month 
from a list of 70 commonly consumed food items on a questionnaire.   
6. Activity Monitoring : physical activity measurement will be conducted in two ways.  
o Firstly , using a thigh worn monitor. This measurement will be conducted for a period of 7 -days at 
baseline and after 4 and  6 months. For this measurement the participant will wear 1 small lightweight 
(≈ 0.5 ounces) activity monitor (activPAL3TM, PAL Technologies, Glasgow, [LOCATION_006]; product specs:

researchers will download the data from the devi ces upon collecting them from the participants. The 
researchers will go to the participant’s office/home to collect these.  
o Secondl y, during the entire duration of the study, including the three [ADDRESS_57903] sensor (≈

https://www.actigraphcorp.com/cpiw/ ). These d evices will be worn on the non -dominant wrist on a 
watchstrap.  
Participants in the general exercise intervention group will receive a new GT9X monitor every [ADDRESS_57904] enough battery life to measure physical activity. The 
researchers will go to the participant’s preferred location (office or home) to provide a new sensor. 
These wrist sensor data will not be transmitted wirelessly. The researchers will download the data 
from the devices upon collecting them from the particip ants.  
o Participants in the lifestyle physical activity intervention group will receive an Insight watch that is 
capable of passively uploading motion data so that the researchers may get an understanding of his or 
her daily movement patterns. This informati on is confidential and will be used for research purposes 
only. No other data besides data about the participant’s movement is gathered using any of the 
sensors. The researchers will come to the participant’s office or home at the beginning of the study to  
install the data capturing systems (i.e., data transfer hubs). The decision on the location to install the 
hub (i.e., home vs office) will be determined in consult ation with the participant. The location will be 
where the participant spends the most part of the week during the waking day . These data hubs are 
small devices that require a power source connection to communicate wirelessly with the device the 
participant will be wearing and relay data to the researcher. The researchers will uninstall the data 
hubs following completion of study participation either after the month [ADDRESS_57905] that the device has a low ba ttery (battery life is approximately 
2-3 weeks), the participant will be prompted to schedule a time to receive a new device from the 
researchers. The researcher will go to the participant’s office or home to collect the monitor and 
return it charged by [CONTACT_3433] e next day to commence the daily physical activity measurement.  
o We will encourage participants in both groups to wear the sensors as much as possible so that: 1) we 
may be able to understand the differences in daily/weekly physical behavior change effects between 
the two intervention approaches, and 2) we may be able t o tailor daily recommendations of 
participants in the lifestyle physical activity intervention group to maximize and maintain his or her 
gains and to help meet his or her goals. Participants may remove the sensors for brief intervals 
throughout the day (e. g., for showering). The researchers may provide participants in the lifestyle 
physical activity intervention group with retrospective feedback of his or her physical activity 
measurements via text -message frequently (4 to 7 times a day at intervals of 1 to  4 hours between 7

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS  
Adverse (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be defined per guide lines from the Office of Human 
Research Protections (OHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services.  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, whether or not it is causally related 
to the study.  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS  
A serious adverse event is any experience that results in any of the following outcomes: death, is life 
threatening, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.

Research   21 8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN  ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated.  
 Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usua l activity or to affect clinical 
status.  
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to significantly affect clinical status.  
 Life Threatening: The participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it 
occurred.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELA TIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPU LATION  
All AEs will have their relationship to study intervention or study participation assessed with a level of 
specificity appropriate to the study design. The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relations hip to study 
intervention (drug, biologic, device , behavioral ) is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor 
in determining what is or is not re corded  in the study. Describe the method of determining the 
relationship of an AE to a study intervention . If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is 
an AE, the event should be re corded .  Some protocols may use a binary assessment (related/not related); 
others may have a scale of relatedness.  Evaluation of relatedness must consider  etiologies such as natural 
history of the underlying disease, concurrent illness, concomitant therapy, study -related procedures, 
accidents, and other external factors.  In a clinical trial, the study intervention must always be suspect.  
The Investigator will also assess the relationship of any adverse event to study, based upon available 
information, using the following guidelines:  
 0 = Unlikely: No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified.  
 1 = Possible: Tempora l association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however, 
involvement of the study procedures cannot be excluded.  
 2 = Probable: Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but not likely.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The safety office r in conjunction with the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_54140] e if an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will 
be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study procedures . 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQ UENCY FOR EVENT ASSE SSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
All adverse events that are both serious and unexpected will be reported by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_54141]’s, NIA PO and to the Safety Officer, within 48 hours of the study's k nowledge of SAE.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
 
 Primary Endpoint(s): Daily total and bouts of physical . 
 
The treatment group using Companion will show greater improvements in daily activity and sedentary 
behavior outcomes than controls after 16 and 24 weeks . Alternatively, our null hypothesis is that there 
will be no difference in the treatment group  for daily activity and sedentary behavior outcomes  after 
16 and 24 weeks.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Sample size is based on change in HbA1C after 16 weeks of training in adults >60 y (n=22). We used a 
health outcome variable to compute sample size to examine the translational effect of behavior change 
due to Companion on the health of adults >60 y. In our data, partial η2 (effect size) for the interaction 
effect between group and time (pre – 16 week) equaled 0.[ADDRESS_57910] size. With 
alpha of  .01, power of 0.85, two groups, 3 repeated assessments, and an estimated inter -correlation 
between assessments of 0.5, the required sample is 39; we will recruit 46 participants. Hypothesis testing 
for all outcomes will entail an intent -to-treat two -taile d design with a type I error of 0.05.

primary outcome. Models will be  adjusted for covariates and the baseline value of the outcome variable 
where necessary. Post -hoc pairwise comparisons for primary outcomes will be adjusted for multiple 
testing using Bonferroni corrections . Results will be presented as Least -squares means (LSMEANS) with 
95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes and confidence intervals will be  calculated for all comparisons.23,[ADDRESS_57912]  sensitivity analyses where missing out come data attributable to random

NIH Protocol Te mplate for Behavioral and Social Sciences 
Research   28 Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 
Informed consent  --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process as well as 
the completed consent documents.  This review will evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice , 
accuracy, and completeness.  Feedback will be provided to the study team  to ensure proper consenting  
procedures are followed .  
 
Source documents  and the electronic data --- Data initially captured on source documents (see Section  
10.1.[ADDRESS_57917] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ) will ultimately be entered into the study database .  To ensure 
accuracy site staff will compare a representative sample of source data against the database,  targeting 
key data points in that review.  
 
Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in 
Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_57918] Training and Tracking .  
 
Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review protocol deviations on an ongoing basis and will 
implement corrective actions when the quantity or n ature of deviations are deemed to be at a level of 
concern.  
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_31236], source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_103] /funding agency , and inspection by [CONTACT_3482].

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSI BILITIES  
 
Data collection will be  the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the 
site investigator . The investigator will be  responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completenes s, legibility, 
and timeliness of the data reported.  
 
All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data.   
 
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_54150]/ enrolled in the study.  Data recorded  on an 
electronic form derived from source documents will be consistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents .

Protocol <#CompRoy1>   [ADDRESS_57920] agree to having his or her study exit interview audio recorded, the recording will be 
destroyed immediately after the interview has been transcribed.  
Physical activity data collected from wearable sensors in the lifestyle physical activity intervention group 
will be uploaded to a secure cloud -based storage system (CentrePoint, ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL), 
which will allow authorized study personnel to securely and remotely access the data. The CentrePoint 
system leverages  existing cloud -based technologies to provide a robust, scalable solution that implements 
industry best practices. CentrePoint utilizes Microsoft Azure’s cloud computing platform for hosting 
sites/services, data processing, subject/study management, and da ta storage, and uses AWS Relational 
Database Service (RDS) for data analytics.  
Using WhatsApp for daily text -message based communication will ensure that the subjects’ 
conversations with the researchers remain secured and only visible to them and the resea rchers. This is 
made possible by [CONTACT_54172]'s end -to-end encryption, which is automatically available to all users of the 
app. Many messaging apps only encrypt messages between the sender and the receiver, but 
WhatsApp's end -to-end encryption ensures that on ly the sender and the person he or she is 
communicating with , can read what is sent, and nobody in between, not even employees of WhatsApp. 
This is because messages are secured with a lock, and only the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_54151]. For added protection, every message sent on WhatsApp has its 
own unique lock and key. All of this happens automatically . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION  
Study documents will be retained until at least [ADDRESS_57921] elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of the study interve ntion  or as per IRB guidelines .  
 
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
A protocol deviation is defined as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol. The noncompliance 
may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a r esult of 
deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.20 Noncompliance, subsections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 
It will be  the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance to identify and report 
deviations within 7 working  days of identification of the protocol deviation. All deviations will be 
addressed in study source documents, reported to the funding agency . Protocol deviations will be sent to 
<Protocol Title: Companion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]>   Version <2020.9.23>

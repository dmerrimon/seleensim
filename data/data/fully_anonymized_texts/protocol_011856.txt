Page 9 of 75 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
1.1. Overview 
 
This Phase 2A study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel-group, 6-
site, trial of 8 weeks of daily dosing with 10 mg of CERC-501 (LY2456302) that is 
intended to test whether we can establish Proof of Concept (POC) that kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_162223] (KOR) antagonists engage neural circuits involved in mediating the reward 
response. This will be specifically determined by [CONTACT_460976]-501, a relatively 
selective KOR antagonist,  increases ventral striatal activation in response to reward-
predicting cues. We are attempting to establish POC in this study in order to determine 
whether there is a sufficient basis for pursuing future work evaluating whether KOR 
antagonism has therapeutic effects on clinical and behavioral measures of reward-related 
functioning, a domain of function that is impaired in many patients with Mood and 
Anxiety Spectrum Disorders. 
 
The primary outcome measure which is being used to establish POC is neural activation 
within the ventral striatum during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task, as assessed 
with fMRI (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004, 2008a, 2009; Treadway et al., 
2012; Stoy et al., 2012; Ossewaarde et al., 2011; Knutson et al., 2008). This study also 
includes a number of secondary and exploratory measures to assess various domains of 
reward-related function including: the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), a self-
report assessment of global reward function (Gilbert et al., 2002; Snaith et al., 1995); the 
Probabilistic Reward Task (PRT), an objective behavioral assessment of the capacity to 
learn from rewards (Barr et al.,  2008; Bogdan and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2006, 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7295]., 2005, 2007, 2008a; Vrieze et al., 2013); the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task 
(EERT), a behavioral measure of the extent to which an individual is motivated by 
[CONTACT_329795] (Treadway et al., 2009, 2012a,b); the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale 
(TEPS), a self- report measure that assesses anticipatory pleasure (‘wanting’) an d 
consummatory pleasure (‘liking’) (Gard et al., 2006; Stanford et al., 2011);  a visual 
analogue scale (VAS) rating of hedonic respone; an additional measure of the 
engagement of neural circuits mediating the hedonic response, resting qEEG current 
density measures of delta power (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004); and self-
ratings of the reward response to stimuli in terms of ratings of affective responses to cues 
and feedback during the Monetary Incentive Delay Task (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2009). All of 
these are exploratory measures except the SHAPS and the PRT, which have previously 
been shown to be modulated by [CONTACT_460977], affected by [CONTACT_174120], associated with striatal 
function, predictive of clinical outcome and anhedonic symptoms, and improved with 
antidepressant therapy (Bogdan et al., 2011; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2005, 2008a,b, 2009; 
Santesso et al., 2008; Vrieze et al., 2013a,b; Di Giannantonio and Martinotti, 2012; 
Martinotti et al., 2011; Wacker et al., 2009). Other measures included in this study are: 
assessment for adverse effects, the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire 
(CPFQ), and traditional anxiety (Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety [HAM-A]) and 
depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D] measures, which are being 
evaluated in exploratory analyses to provide information regarding changes in depression 
and anxiety severity with treatment (Hamilton 1960, 1967; Fava et al., 2009).

Page [ADDRESS_589274] significant 
limitations (Rush, 2007; Denys and de Geus, 2005). There is a need to develop new 
treatments for people with these disorders. Many research studies carried out in animals 
and a few preliminary studies carried out in humans suggest that medications which 
block kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (KOR) have potential for being effective new treatments for 
patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders (see below).  These medications have 
shown particular promise for improving one important type of difficulty experienced by 
[CONTACT_460978], which is an impairment in reward-related function. In this study we will test 
the hypothesis that KOR antagonism is a promising means of improving anhedonia in 
patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. We will do so by [CONTACT_460979] (POC) that a relatively selective KOR antagonist, 
CERC-501 (LY2456302; see Investigator Brochure), engages neural circuits involved in 
mediating reward-related function in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders 
with anhedonia. We are attempting to establish POC in this study in order to determine 
whether there is a sufficient basis for pursuing future work evaluating whether KOR 
antagonism has therapeutic effects on clinical and behavioral measures of reward-related 
functioning. 
 
In addition to being a relatively selective KOR antagonist, CERC-501 is also well-suited 
for this study based on its pharmacologic and safety profiles (see Investigator Brochure). 
The 10 mg dosage of CERC-501 was chosen for evaluation because of preclinical 
studies, single and multiple ascending dose studies in humans, a single-dose PET study of 
KOR occupancy (Zheng et al., 2013), and pupi[INVESTIGATOR_460899] (see Investigator Brochure). The following 
sections include details of the rationale for this study. 
 
1.2.1. KOR Antagonism Promising Target for Treating Mood and Anxiety 
Disorders 
There is an extensive set of pre-clinical studies suggesting that KOR antagonists are 
likely to have therapeutic effects in those with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. This 
includes studies indicating a role of the kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_460900]. 
 
A number of studies indicate that the kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_460901]. An important aspect of stress-related pharmacology is the 
dynorphins, a group of opi[INVESTIGATOR_460902] (Bruchas et al., 2009). Evidence suggests that stress leads to anxiety by [CONTACT_87479]1 
receptor activation of dynorphins in the basolateral amygdala which then bind to KOR 
(Bruchas et al., 2009).  Place aversion and social avoidance occurring with repeated stress 
is mediated via dynorphin activation in ventral striatum, an effect which can be mimicked 
by [CONTACT_460980] (Land et al., 2009; Schindler et al., 
2012). KOR antagonists also block stress-related impairment in elevated plus maze 
spontaneous exploration (Peters et al., 2011).

anxiolytic effects. Prodynorphin knockouts (prodynorphin is the precursor protein for 
dynorphins) and KOR antagonists have been found to have anxiolytic-like effects in the 
novelty-induced hypophagia test, the defensive burying tests, the elevated plus maze test, 
fear-potentiated startle test, open-field test, and light-dark test (Carr and Lucki, 2010; 
Knoll et al., 2011; Wittmann et al., 2009). 
 
A larger literature suggests that KOR antagonists are likely to have anti-depressant 
effects and may prevent the depression-like consequences of stress. Dynorphin mediates 
the dysphoric aspects of stress via binding to KOR and this effect is prevented by 
[CONTACT_460981] a KOR antagonist (Land et al., 2008). The 
depression-like behaviors caused by [CONTACT_35234], uncontrollable stress, and social-
defeat stress are mediated by [CONTACT_422610][INVESTIGATOR_460903] (McLaughlin et al., 2006; Knoll and Carlezon, 2010). KOR antagonist treated 
mice and KOR knockout mice show a reduction of stress- induced depression-like 
behavior (McLaughlin et al.,  2006; Knoll and Carlezon, 2010). Stress has also been found 
to trigger KOR activation of dorsal raphe neurons which project to nucleus accumbens 
and decrease dopamine release thereby [CONTACT_460982] 
(Lemos et al., 2012). 
 
More generally, rodent studies show that administering KOR antagonists or knocking out 
the prodynorphin gene leads to antidepressant-like effects as assessed by [CONTACT_460983] (via nucleus 
accumbens and hippocampal mediated mechanisms), whereas KOR agonists have 
depressogenic effects in conjunction with decreasing nucleus accumbens dopamine 
release (Reindl et al., 2008; Shirayama et al., 2004; Carlezon et al., 2006; McLaughlin et 
al., 2003; Mague et al., 2003; Todtenkopf et al., 2004; Chartoff et al., 2012; Chartoff et 
al., 2009). 
 
Perhaps the best recognized effect of KOR antagonists in animal models is to prevent the 
development of anhedonic-like states. The literature suggesting that KOR antagonists 
have such effects speaks to the potential of these agents to have therapeutic effects on 
anhedonia in humans, which is a core symptom of mood and anxiety disorders that cuts 
across diagnostic boundaries. In this regard, there is evidence that KOR stimulation 
inhibits dopamine release in the striatum (nucleus accumbens and caudate) and induces a 
negative mood state (Bruijnzeel, 2009). Consistent with this model, a series of studies 
indicate that KOR agonists decrease phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens 
and increase intracranial self-stimulation (a model of anhedonia), whereas KOR 
antagonists have the opposite effect, increasing nucleus accumbens dopamine release and 
decreasing self-stimulation (Ebner et al., 2010; Muschamp et al., 2011; Carlezon et al., 
2006; Maisonneuve et al., 1994). Further, KOR agonists block cocaine’s anti -anhedonic 
effect on intracranial self-stimulation (Tomasiewicz et al., 2008) and block the 
reinforcing/rewarding effects on drugs of abuse (Wee and Koob, 2010), whereas, giving a 
KOR antagonist prior to cocaine withdrawal prevented anhedonic-like intracranial self-
stimulation responses (Chartoff et al., 2012). 
 
Although data in humans on the effects of selective KOR antagonists are lacking, 
preliminary data from humans are consistent with the animal data in suggesting that this

Page [ADDRESS_589278] were 
found to improve with buprenorphine (a KOR antagonist and partial mu agonist) 
treatment (Nyhuis et al., 2008). Findings of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_460904] [ADDRESS_589279] (simulated kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_460905]) 
indicate that this combination had a significant antidepressant effect (Ehrich, 2012). 
 
Together, the available data provide a compelling indication that KOR antagonists are 
likely to have therapeutic effects in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. 
These data point to the adverse effects of stress and particularly anhedonia as therapeutic 
targets of interest with these agents. 
 
1.2.2. Rationale for Studying Effects of KOR Antagonist on Anhedonia 
We chose to focus on anhedonia as an endpoint for this study because: 1) the available 
data suggest that anhedonia is the dimension of mood and anxiety spectrum disorders that 
is most likely to be improved by [CONTACT_460984] (see above); 2) anhedonia is associated 
with measurable neurobiological mechanisms which can be studied with available 
methodologies that could be used to establish POC in terms of engagement of relevant 
neural circuitry (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004, 2009; Treadway et al., 2012; 
Stoy et al., 2012; Ossewaarde et al., 2011); and 3) anhedonia allows us to accomplish our 
goal of studying an important aspect of dysfunction that cuts across mood and anxiety 
spectrum disorders, consistent with the NIMH’s RDoC framework.  
 
The data indicating that KOR antagonists are likely to improve anhedonia are strong 
relative to the data indicating that there will be other therapeutic effects of KOR 
antagonists. As a result, it seems likely that, if there are any therapeutic effects of these 
agents in those with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders, a therapeutic effect on 
anhedonia would be evident. As a result, anhedonia is an appropriate primary endpoint 
for a POC study with a KOR antagonist the treatment of patients with mood and anxiety 
spectrum disorders.  Failure to demonstrate a therapeutic effect of a KOR antagonist on 
the neural circuitry related to anhedonia using a dosage that had been demonstrated to 
have acceptable kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_460906] a reasonable indication to fail 
KOR antagonism as a treatment for mood and anxiety disorders.

Exposures increased approximately proportionally with dose and steady state was 
reached within 7 to 8 days of once per day (QD) dosing. Moderate accumulation of 
CERC-501 (LY2456302) - average accumulation ratio (AUC) across dose groups was 
calculated to be 1.8 (range: 1.8 to 1.9). Degree of accumulation after multiple dosing was 
consistent with the half-life observed after single dose (see Figure 2). Excretion is mostly 
through the urine. 
 
There is no definitive drug-drug interaction study yet. However, the risk of drug-drug 
interactions is currently perceived as relatively low. There was no irreversible inhibition 
of CYP2C8; however, competitive reversible inhibition was observed with inhibitory 
constant (Ki) = 3.7 uM. Given a projected maximum drug concentration at steady state 
(Cmax,ss) = 143 ng/mL (0.34 uM) following multiple dosing at [ADDRESS_589284] dose 
to be tested in Study LAFB, a value of Cmax,ss/Ki = 0.1 indicates the possibility of an 
interaction with CYP2C8 substrates. For this reason, medications that are primarily 
metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) (cerivastatin, paclitaxel, repaglinide, 
sorafenib, and torsemide) will be exclusionary for all studies with CERC-[ADDRESS_589285]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

[IP_ADDRESS] . Nonclinical Safety Pharmacology 
The toxicity profile of CERC-501  (LY2456302) has been characterized in rat, mouse, 
dog, and rabbit through a package of in vitro, repeat-dose (up to 6 months in dogs and 
rats and up to 2 weeks in mice), reproductive and genotoxicity studies and through safety 
pharmacology studies. No adverse effects were observed in dogs at a high dose of 2000 
mg/kg/day. In the 6-month rat study, the only adverse findings were dose-related 
histopathologic changes in the stomach, primarily decreased parietal cells and 
inflammation at all dose levels. Although a NOAEL was not observed, the gastric 
findings were minimal to moderate in severity, not life threatening, and partially 
reversible over a 1-month recovery period. Do se levels of 2000 mg/kg/day in mice, ≥800 
mg/kg/day in rats, or ≥200 mg/kg/day in rabbits exceeded the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) resulting in adverse clinical signs, decreased food consumption and body weight, 
and mortality/euthanasia. Convulsions were also noted after 1 or 2 doses of CERC-501 at 
2000 mg/kg (mice), 1500 mg/kg (rats), or 1000 mg/kg (rabbits). CERC-[ADDRESS_589296] battery of genotoxicity tests. These nonclinical toxicology results 
demonstrate an acceptable safety profile for the proposed clinical study of CERC-501. 
Following 6 months of treatment, the margin of safety (MOS) based on the area under 
curve (AUC) is 196-fold for the dog and 59-fold for the rat, for all effects, excluding the 
stomach findings in rats (Table 5 .3 of the Investigator’s Brochure). A NOAEL for the 
stomach changes in the rat was not established. The MOS for convulsions is 38-fold 
based on Cmax, in the most sensitive species (rabbit), and is ≥38 -fold based on both 
Cmax and AUC for convulsions in a mouse ethanol withdrawal model. In nonclinical 
safety pharmacology studies with CERC-501, there were no effects on the central or 
peripheral nervous systems or respi[INVESTIGATOR_460914] 800 mg/kg. In 
dogs, there was an apparent trend for increased QT and QTc intervals following a single

[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety Data 
In total, [ADDRESS_589298] been exposed to single or multiple doses of CERC-501 
(LY2456302) in 3 completed clinical pharmacological studies (Studies LAFA, LAFB, 
and LAFC). No significant safety concerns were encountered in Study LAFA after 
single-dose administration of CERC-501  up to 60 mg, in Study LAFB after multiple-dose 
administration of CERC-501  up to 35 mg, and in Study LAFC after single-dose 
administration of CERC-501  up to 25 mg. In these studies, there were no serious adverse 
events (SAEs). 
 
In Study LAFA, [ADDRESS_589299], a 47-year-old white male participating in Part 1, was 
discontinued from the study due to a treatment-related adverse event (AE) of mild 
ventricular tachycardia. This subject experienced a mild 5-beat ventricular tachycardia 
approximately [ADDRESS_589300] was asymptomatic during the AE. Follow-up telemetry monitoring for 24 hours 
did not reveal any clinically significant findings; overall, there was no clear dose 
dependency observed, as no ventricular tachycardia was observed after administration of 
a higher (60 mg) dose of CERC-501. 
 
No subjects were discontinued from Study LAFB or Study LAFC. In Study LAFA, [ADDRESS_589301] common (occurring >1 incidence) 
in CERC-501-treated subjects being: headache (6 events), diarrhea (4 events), nausea (3 
events), and anxiety (2 events). Most of the 126 AEs were of mild- to-moderate severity; 
only 2 events (vomiting and flushing), not related to CERC-[ADDRESS_589302] common 
(occurring >1 incidence) in CERC-501-treated subjects being dyspepsia (5 events), 
pruritus generalized (3 events), headache (2 events), diarrhea (2 events), and abdominal 
pain (2). Of note, [ADDRESS_589303] receiving 35 mg 
CERC-501  experienced a total of 24 AEs or more than half of all reported. All AEs were 
of mild severity, with the exception of 1 moderate AE of hemorrhoids, not related to 
CERC-501 , as determined by [CONTACT_093], which occurred after administration of 10 
mg CERC-501. 
 
In Study LAFC, 21 AEs of mild- to-moderate severity were reported by 11 of 13 subjects; 
none of the AEs were considered by [CONTACT_460988]-501. Most 
events were related to the study procedure. 
 
There have been no clinically significant values, changes, or trends in clinical laboratory 
data, with the following exception: [ADDRESS_589304] in Study LAFA experienced mildly elevated 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (>2 times 
the upper limit of normal), which were not considered by [CONTACT_199185], after receiving a single dose of [ADDRESS_589305]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

Page 18 of 75  
Given the results of the 6-month rat study, where there were adverse dose-responsive 
findings in the glandular stomach included parietal cell loss, inflammation and mucus cell 
hyperplasia, FDA expressed safety concerns for the stomach lesions. Minimal to slight 
effects were observed at the low dose. There was no NOAEL. No other adverse effects in 
the rat and no adverse effects in dogs at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. These findings are of low 
risk (nonclinical) and may be species-specific (rat only). Both the FDA Division of 
Psychiatry Products (DPP) and Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction 
Products (DAAAP) agreed that studies in a third species would provide considerable 
weight-of evidence to support the conclusion that the effect was species specific; 
however, there was still concern that CERC-[ADDRESS_589307] 
routine endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_460915]. The FDA concluded that since 
GI findings were only seen in rats (but not dogs), after 6 months of dosing (but not after 1 
month of dosing) and were essentially reversible, the NOAEL/LOAEL provided an 
adequate safety margin for the proposed dose of 10 mg and duration of an 8-week study 
with CERC-501 . The FDA has agreed that an 8-wk POC study in MDD patients can be 
conducted without routine endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_460916].  
 
1.2.4. Rationale for Studying 10 mg Dosage of CERC-501 
In the single-ascending dose study, dose escalation was halted at 60 mg based on PK 
analysis of this dose level. This analysis indicated that the Cmax for CERC-501 
(LY2456302) was close to the 180-ng/mL limit required to maintain a 30-fold MOS to 
the NOAEL for convulsions observed in rabbits. Data from the completed multiple-dose 
study showed that the mean C (CV%) after multiple (14) QD doses of 35 mg was 81 
ng/mL (23%). This is well below the maximum desired concentration of 180 ng/mL. The 
PET study carried out with the Kappa Opi[INVESTIGATOR_460917]2879788 demonstrated 
that single, oral doses of 0.5 mg up to 25 mg CERC-501 penetrated the blood-brain 
barrier, led to specific target engagement, and blocked significantly and in a dose-related 
manner, kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_238299] (Zheng et al., 2013) (See Figure 3). 
Approximately 2.5 hours postdose (“peak scan”), brain kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_460918] 10 mg or more (96.7% receptor occupancy), whereas at 
trough the receptor occupancy was >60%. Sustained and substantial target engagement 
was observed for at least 22.5 hours. 
 
An additional consideration motivating the choice of 10 mg of CERC-501  are potential 
effects on mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (MOR) which may be depressogenic. CERC-[ADDRESS_589308] a 30-fold functional kappa selectivity over mu and delta 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (See Figure 1 ). The potential that CERC-[ADDRESS_589309]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

“minimal” at dosages below 60 mg (See Investigator Brochure).  Based on these data, the

significantly to public health by [CONTACT_460990]: 1) 
expeditiously testing a promising new treatment for mood and anxiety spectrum 
disorders; 2) evaluating a potential target in the brain which could serve as the basis for 
development of additional new candidate compounds for the treatment of patients with 
mood and anxiety spectrum disorders; 3) establishing more expeditious methods for 
evaluating potential new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460920]; and 4) specifically establishing methods for the development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460921], an important RDoC endpoint.

The Primary Objectives  of this study are: 
 Specific Aim 1:   
Establish POC for KOR antagonism by [CONTACT_460991]-501  10 
mg relative to Placebo (PBO) on reward-related neural circuitry in terms of 
ventral striatal fMRI activation during anticipation of reward during the Monetary 
Incentive Delay (MID) Task. 
 
The Secondary Objectives  of this study are: 
 Secondary Aim 1:   
Clinical Anhedonia Measure: To determine if 10 mg of CERC-501 is superior to 
PBO in improving a clinical self-report measure of anhedonia, the Snaith 
Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS). 
 Secondary Aim 2:  
Behavioral Anhedonia Measure: To evaluate the impact of CERC-[ADDRESS_589313] Task (PRT).

(MDD) criteria based on the MINI (subjects with a past history of MDD but who do not 
currently meet diagnostic criteria could be included).  Anhedonia is a core symptom of 
MDD, and one of its diagnostic criteria, but this is not the case for anxiety disorders. As a 
result, we are including a requirement for inclusion of patients with anxiety disorders 
because without such a criterion, we run the risk of only including subjects with 
anhedonia occurring in the setting of MDD, which would result in our being unable to 
distinguish an antidepressant effect which included a beneficial effect on anhedonia from 
an anhedonia-specific effect.  However, because there has been no prior work 
establishing the prevalence of the target subgroup (those who meet our anhedonia entry 
criterion and have an anxiety disorder but do not currently meet MDD criteria) it is 
unclear how difficult it will be to randomize these individuals.   As a result, we will not 
stratify enrollment to ensure a fixed number of subjects of this type as this could 
jeopardize the ability of the study to randomize the total target number of subjects (90) 
and, thereby, impede accomplishing the primary aims.  Instead, we will seek to 
include approximately 33% of the total number randomized (30 subjects) of this type but 
will prioritize meeting the primary aims of the study (randomizing 90 total subjects) over 
this goal .

4. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
4.1. Study Overview 
 
This study will be a six-site randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled, parallel-group 
mono-therapy study to assess the effects of CERC-501 compared to PBO in adults age 
21-65 years with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. We will recruit a total of 90 
subjects, of which 45 will be randomized to CERC-501 and 45 to placebo for 8 weeks of 
treatment. 
 
Following phone screening subjects will come to the research unit/clinic for a face- to-
face screening visit. Subjects who sign informed consent will undergo rigorous screening 
including: a medical, psychiatric, medication, and treatment history, vital signs, physical 
examination, urine drug screen, MINI, clinical diagnostic interview for psychiatric 
disorders, beta-HCG serum pregnancy test (women), ECG,  Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure 
Scale (SHAPS), Visual Analog Scale for Anhedonia, Temporal Experience of Pleasure 
Scale (TEPS), CSSRS, CGI-S, CGI-I and a battery of clinical laboratory tests (See Table 
3 for Schedule of Assessments). All study events, their corresponding dates, and results 
of these examinations will be reported on the corresponding case report forms (CRFs). 
All subjects will be off of all antidepressant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, 
mood stabilizing, muscle relaxant, centrally acting antihistaminergic, stimulant or 
insomnia medications (See Appendix 2) within [ADDRESS_589324]’s treating physician when applicable . 
This plan will be communicated to the subject including a detailed indication of the times 
at which medications are to be decreased, the possible side-effects that they may 
experience with decreases in medication dosage, the possible worsening of symptoms 
they may experience as medication dosage is lowered, and a plan for how to proceed if 
they develop side-effects or symptoms worsen. A study physician will be responsible for 
monitoring subjects during the washout including scheduling assessment visits if needed 
and addressing any side effects or worsening of symptoms that occur. Subjects who 
develop clinically significant adverse effects or worsening will receive appropriate 
assessment and care by a study physician which may include referral for

Page 23 of 75 evaluation/treatment. This plan will be designed so that subjects are free of all excluded 
medications at least 5 half-lives prior to the baseline visit (see Exclusion Criteria above). 
Subjects will also undergo a mock MRI scanning session at this visit. 
 
Subjects will return to the research unit/clinic for a baseline assessment visit up to [ADDRESS_589326] 
the option of having blood collected to be sent to Rutgers for potential genetic analysis or 
other future analysis. Blood will also be collected for tests for assessment for gastric 
adverse events including gastrin and pepsinogen I/II levelsAt the end of this visit, 
subjects who continue to qualify will be randomized to CERC-501  10 mg or placebo in a 
1:1 ratio using IVRS randomization within the EDC. 
 
IVRS Randomization will be carried out using the Simple Internal Randomization Engine 
(SIRE), which is a tool developed by [CONTACT_460992]. SIRE is fully 
integrated with the EDC database. A randomization list in hardcopy will also be kept 
under lock and key by [CONTACT_460993] a back-up should the computer system be down. 
In case of system failure, the statistician will provide the individual dispensing the 
medication at a site with the medication allocation over the phone. It will also allow study 
physicians to obtain the randomization information from the statistician and procedures 
to break the blinding in cases of emergencies. All individuals having interactions with the 
subjects will remain blind to treatment group assignment other than in cases of 
emergencies. 
 
Subjects will then return for treatment visits at weeks 2, 4, [ADDRESS_589327]: Interval 
history, battery of lab tests, Vital signs, physical examination, ECG, SHAPS, TEPS, 
VAS, CCRS, CGI-I, and CGI-S, Adverse Effects Assessment with Patient Reported 
Inventory of Side-Effects (PRISE), and blood will be collected for determination of 
CERC-501 levels.  At the week 4 and week 8 visits blood will also be collected for tests 
for assessment for gastric adverse events including gastrin and pepsinogen I/II levels. 
 
In addition at the [ADDRESS_589328] the option of having blood 
collected to be sent to Rutgers for potential genetic analysis or other future analysis. 
Following this visit study drug will be discontinued and subjects will be instructed to 
return in 4 weeks for a final visit. 
 
At the final visit, subjects will undergo: vital signs, interval history, SHAPS, TEPS, VAS, 
CSSRS, CGI-I, C GI-S and a clinical interview for adverse effects. At the conclusion of 
this visit subject participation in the study will end.

4.2. Recruitment 
 
Subjects will be recruited at each study site. The information collected at that time is used 
simply to rule out any obvious exclusion criteria, such as age and substance 
abuse/medical history, as well as to collect some simple demographic information. If a 
participant is deemed ineligible or decides not to participate in the study, their 
information is destroyed, i.e., shredded. If an individual appears to meet enrollment 
criteria and is interested in participating, a face- to-face interview is conducted by [CONTACT_460994]. A release of information is obtained for review of any available 
historical and clinical data. The nature of the project, procedures, relative risks and 
benefits, and alternatives to participation in the project are discussed with the individual. 
Following this discussion, the individual is given a copy of the consent form to review, 
and any questions are answered. The process of informed consent will be obtained in 
accordance with 21CFR50 and local IRB standards by [CONTACT_460995]. Upon 
obtaining voluntary, written, informed consent, medical and psychiatric screening 
procedures will be used to confirm study eligibility. Documentation regarding the 
informed consent process and the subject’s study participation will be made in the 
subject’s medical record and/or study source documents.   
 
In order to ensure a high rate of enrollment in the proposed study a number of procedures 
will be implemented under the direction of the Contract PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Krystal and implemented 
via the weekly Coordinating Committee (CC) meetings that include all of the Site PIs, the 
DCRI Project Leader, and the Leader of the Assessment/Signal Detection Core for the 
study, Richard Keefe, Ph.D.  As part of this effort, each site will submit a site recruitment 
plan which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_460996]. The 
Committee will discuss each plan and make suggestions for ways to facilitate recruitment 
at each site. Throughout the trial it will be the responsibility of Dr . Krystal or his 
designee, to track recruitment closely at each site and to present these data at the regular 
CC meetings for review. This review will include discussing the recruitment at each site 
in the context of the recruitment strategies they are employing in order to make ongoing 
modifications of the recruitment strategies of slower recruiting sites. This will also 
provide a forum for PIs of sites that are more successful in recruiting to share the 
strategies that have been most effective with the PIs of slower recruiting sites. In general, 
we will attempt to optimize recruitment and retention by [CONTACT_460997], establishing input and PI [INVESTIGATOR_460922]-in, 
adaptive recruitment strategies to address site idiosyncrasies, and adopting 
comprehensive and active community outreach. Assessment of recruitment will be based 
on the rate of enrollment needed to meet our enrollment target. This target requires us to 
enroll [ADDRESS_589332]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589333] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589334] per month for 3 months a thorough evaluation of the site and the factors that 
might be responsible for the under-recruiting of subjects will be carried out. Such sites 
will be discussed with the NIMH Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR)  and 
considered for being dropped from the study. In this case the DCRI, in coordination with 
the NIMH COR,  will need to determine what steps should be taken including assessing 
the wisdom of closing a low enrolling site and initiate a new one.  Likewise, we will 
discuss with NIMH COR the need to add additional site s, if that proves necessary. 
 
It is anticipated that we will enroll twice as many women as men mirroring the gender 
distribution of mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. Because we have geographically 
diverse sites, we anticipate that the study population will have the ethnic distribution of 
the general U.S. population. A strong effort will be made to achieve these racial/ethnicity 
distribution enrollment targets. Each site has experience recruiting minorities through a 
concentrated effort in communities that have high representation of ethnic and racial 
minorities and through advertisements in newspapers and radio stations whose 
readers/listeners are predominantly of specific racial or ethnic minorities. The CC will 
monitor the gender and racial/ethnic composition of the subjects enrolled throughout the 
study to assess whether the planned targets are being met. If not, the CC will work 
together to formulate a plan to address identified problems. 
 
4.3. Screening 
 
Screening Visit: Day -30 to Day -1 (4 - 6 hours) 
Once a subject has signed an inform consent for this study subjects will undergo a set of 
screening tests to determine if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study. 
These screening tests will include: 
 Medical, psychiatric, and medication history

4.5. End of Participation / Early Termination 
 
At the end of the week [ADDRESS_589341]’s health care  will be shared with them and their health care provider if they 
would like this to occur.  Subjects will meet with the study physician and options for 
treatment will be reviewed. Participants will not be informed as to their treatment 
assignment at this meeting. 
In case a subject is lost- to-follow-up, every possible effort must be made by [CONTACT_460998]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589342] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589343] a complete evaluation 
performed at the time of withdrawal that includes all Week 8 procedures EXCEPT fMRI  
(see Table 3 Schedule of Assessments). Subjects will be followed through Week [ADDRESS_589344], Durham NC. The server is named GNEISS. The 
data will stored in \\gneiss\ ct. All data will be stored as SAS version 9 datasets. The 
software is maintained and managed by [CONTACT_252724] (DCRI) 
Information Technology (IT) group.  The Director of Statistical Operations is responsible 
for granting access to the database as per our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). 
Once a year, the Director of Statistical Operations or Associate Director of Statistics 
reviews all trial access permissions and remove any trial access that is no longer 
appropriate. The data will be stored in gneiss for a maximum of 6 years. After six years, 
it will be archived. The Director of Statistical Operations, the Associate Director, 
Statistical Group for Manuscript Analysis (SIGMA) & Faculty and Fellows Affairs, and 
the Lead Biostatistician for the study or designee will approve the archival of the files 
from the DCRI network. The final datasets will be stripped of identifiers prior to release 
for sharing.  
 
Blood samples for mailing to Rutgers for storage for potential genetic or other future 
analyses will be collected at baseline and after [ADDRESS_589345]-MAS sites. A unique in-house RU ID # will be assigned as 
samples are logged into the RUCDRLIMS. This RU ID # for each specimen will be used 
to track the sample throughout processing, transformation and DNA and Plasma 
extraction. This new ID # that is unrelated to sample origin provides an additional level 
of security for maintaining sample anonymity. The FAST-MAS ID # and RU ID # will be 
cross-referenced in the computer database. The Alternate ID # will not be entered into the 
clinical or genetic databases. It will be used solely by [CONTACT_460999] a secondary ID to 
help resolve labeling discrepancies that may occur during sample collection and 
submission.  
 
 
6. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
FAST-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589346] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page 32 of 75 The main potential risks (and burdens) to the subjects can be categorized as follows: 
 
6.1. Risks of Discontinuing Medications for Study Participation 
 
In order to participate in this study all subjects must be free of all antidepressant, 
antipsychotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, mood stabilizing, muscle relaxant, centrally 
acting antihistaminergic, stimulant or insomnia medications (See Appendix 2) within [ADDRESS_589347] by [CONTACT_3486], their 
staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents. The study protocol, documentation, data, and 
all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. All files will be kept 
secure and only authorized research personnel will have access. Only staff members who 
have a need to know personal identifying information will have access to this 
information.  
 
All subject data will be kept strictly confidential, and no subject-identifying information 
will be released to anyone outside the project. Confidentiality will be through several 
mechanisms. First, each subject will be assigned a unique subject number which will then 
be used on all study forms, including the electronic data capture system (EDC). Secondly, 
any study forms, blood samples, or paper records that contain subject information will be 
FAST-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589348] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589349]’s name [CONTACT_461038].  The subject will be identified by a unique 
identifier to maintain subject confidentiality. Information will not be released without 
written permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_5030] (IRB), the NIMH DSMB, the FDA, the government Office of 
Human Research Protections (OHRP) and/or any other government officials, safety 
monitors/committees that may need the information to make sure that the study is done in 
a safe and proper manner, learn more about side effects, and/or analyze the results of the 
study. 
 
All subject data will be kept strictly confidential, and no subject-identifying information 
will be released to anyone outside the project. Confidentiality will be through several 
mechanisms. First, each subject will be assigned an anonymous study unique subject 
number which will then be used on all study forms, including the electronic data capture 
system (EDC). Secondly, any study forms, blood samples, or paper records that contain 
subject information will be kept at the clinical sites in secured, locked areas, and 
identified by [CONTACT_461000]. Once blood is collected, there will be 
no subject identifiers placed on blood samples, only the unique subject number and the 
date of sample collection. Third, access to all subject data and information, including 
laboratory specimens, will be restricted to authorized personnel. In the case of 
computerized data, this restricted access will be assured through user logon IDs and 
password protection. This protects forms from unauthorized view and modifications as 
well as inadvertent loss or damage.  
 
 
 
 
6.4. Risks Associated with Treatment 
 
The most important risk identified in studies carried out to date is a potential risk of 
worsening of peptic ulcer disease in patients with gastric infection with Helicobacter 
pylori. This is based on findings of decreased parietal cells and inflammation in the 
stomach of rats. 
 
In addition, subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastritis will also be 
excluded from participating in the study. 
 
Other risks associated with the study drug include: headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
flushing, anxiety, upset stomach, itchiness, and ventricular tachycardia (rapid heartbeat 
that requires immediate medical attention which was observed in [ADDRESS_589350]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589351] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page 34 of 75 studies).  There is also the possibility that CERC-[ADDRESS_589352] might be depressogenic (Berrocoso et al., 2009; 
Escriba et al., 2004; Kennedy et al., 2006). 
 
In addition to these risks there may be other risks of the study medication which are 
currently unknown as the number of individuals treated with this medication so far is 
limited. 
 
To protect subjects from such unknown risks we will not allow subjects to participate in 
the study if they have: 1) any clinically significant abnormality on the screening tests; 2) 
any clinically significant medical, psychiatric, or substance use-related disorder other 
than a mood and anxiety spectrum disorder. ; 3) excessive alcohol intake or unwillingness 
to stop alcohol consumption for the duration of the study; 4) taken a prescribed 
medication within [ADDRESS_589353] study day, or nonprescription medication except 
vitamins and acetaminophen (up to 4 g/day) within 15 days of starting study drug, or 
need to continue any medication during the study; 5) taken an investigational medication 
within 3 months prior to the start of this study; 6) smoked cigarettes within the last month 
or at any time during the study; or 7) a history of severe allergies or multiple adverse 
drug reactions. 
 
We will further protect subjects from unanticipated risks by [CONTACT_461001] (CSSRS) and 
the CGI-S.  If subjects experience an adverse reaction, appropriate medical care will be 
provided. This may include referral to an appropriate practitioner outside of the study, 
transfer to an Emergency Room, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Subjects will be monitored 
regularly until the adverse reaction is resolved. Unexpected adverse reactions occurring 
during the period of participation in the study or that are relevant to subjects after their 
participation in the study will be communicated to them. All adverse reactions will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_461002]. They will make ongoing 
evaluations of the risks of study participation and can recommend that the study be 
terminated in cases where the risks are deemed to be excessive. 
 
6.5. Risks of Venipuncture 
 
Subjects will undergo venipuncture 6 times during the study. Complications of drawing 
blood from a vein occur approximately 2% of the time and include discomfort at the site 
of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; 
and, uncommonly, faintness from the procedure. 
 
In order to minimize the risks of drawing blood from a vein, sterile technique will always 
be used and these procedures will be carried out by [CONTACT_461003]. 
 
6.6. Risks Associated with fMRI Scanning 
 
The risks associated with fMRI scanning include the development of anxiety inside the 
scanner (occurs in 5-10%) and the possibility of injury due to movement of a magnetic 
FAST-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589354] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589355] a practice MRI scanning session before having any MRI 
scans to help them get used to being inside the MRI scanner. Rarely people develop 
anxiety inside the scanner and decide not to continue in the study. This session will 
provide subjects with an opportunity to make sure they are comfortable with proceeding 
with MRI scanning. 
 
Risks of injury during MRI will be reduced by [CONTACT_461004]. If such risk factors are identified subjects 
would not be allowed to participate in the study. In addition, the area around the MRI 
scanner is kept free of objects that could pose a risk to subjects. 
 
6.7. Risks associated with EEG  and ECG studies 
 
Risks associated with EEG and ECG studies: The risks associated with undergoing EEG 
and ECG studies include skin irritation at the sites electrodes are applied/removed and the 
general inconvenience of having to set aside time to undergo such monitoring. The risk of 
skin irritation will be minimized by [CONTACT_461005]. 
 
6.8. Risks to Those of Reproductive Potential 
 
6.8.1. Females 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks, 
some of which may be currently unforeseeable. In order to protect subjects from this risk, 
pregnant women will be excluded from the study. For all women of childbearing 
potential, a blood pregnancy test will be done and it must be negative before subjects can 
continue in this study. If sexually active, subjects must agree to use appropriate 
contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and for 1 month afterwards. 
Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such as a tubal 
ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier methods (such as a condom or 
diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine device (IUD). Contraceptive 
measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not 
acceptable methods for routine use. If subjects do become pregnant during this study or if 
they have unprotected sex, they will be instructed to inform the study physician 
immediately. 
 
6.8.2. Males 
Participation in this research has the potential to damage sperm, which could cause harm 
to a child that a subject might father while on this study. Such harm may be currently 
unforeseeable. As a result, in order to protect subjects, sexually active male subjects will 
have to agree to use a medically acceptable form of birth control during and 1 month after 
this study in order to participate. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1 ) 
surgical sterilization (such as a vasectomy), or (2) a condom used with a spermicide. 
Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected 
sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. Subjects will be instructed to inform their

subjects for adverse effects throughout their participation in the study. 
 
 
7.1. Parameters to be Monitored 
 
The Site Principal Investigator (PI) or a Co-Investigator (Co-I) at each site will monitor 
all subjects for adverse effects throughout their participation in the study. This will 
include carrying out a clinical interview for adverse events at each visit which will 
consist of asking the subject whether they experienced any new symptoms or changes 
since the last visit. In addition, a series of safety assessments will be carried out and the 
findings reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a Co- I. These safety assessments will include: the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (Posner, 2011), vital signs (height, 
weight, blood pressure, and pulse), physical examination, Beta-HCG serum pregnancy 
test, urine drug screen, complete blood count with differential, electrolytes, 
comprehensive metabolic panel including liver function tests, thyroid function tests, 
urinalysis, CGI-I, and ECG.

8.4. Description of Outcome Measures 
 
8.4.1. Monetary Incentive Delay Task-related fMRI 
 
fMRI during the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) Task will yield the primary outcome 
measure for this study with which we will evaluate whether we can establish POC for 
KOR antagonists by [CONTACT_461008]-[ADDRESS_589360]-related function (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004, 2009; 
Knutson et al., 2008).  We will specifically assess whether CERC-[ADDRESS_589361] with this task (Stoy et al., 2012) and that this measure has been demonstrated to 
be sensitive to changes occurring with antidepressant/anxiolytic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (SSRI and 
SNRI) in small open-label studies including those with major depression and healthy 
controls and a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy controls (Stoy et al., 
2012; Ossewaarde et al., 2011). 
 
The MID fMRI will be obtained on Day 0 (baseline) and after 8 weeks of daily treatment 
with study drug (Visit A4). The test will be carried out as previously described (Knutson 
et al., 2008). The MID task was designed to elicit neural responses to monetary incentive 
anticipation and outcomes. To test the specificity of the findings, both reward and 
penalties will be included. It will be administered in two task runs each of which will 
consist of [ADDRESS_589362]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

that no response is required (n=36; denoted by [CONTACT_461011]). Gain cues will signal the 
possibility of winning $0.00 (n=18; no lines), $0.20 (n=18; one horizontal line), $1.00 
(n=18; two horizontal lines), or $5.00 (n=18; three horizontal lines). Similarly, loss cues 
will signal the possibility of losing $0.00 (n=18; no lines), $0.20 (n=18; one horizontal 
line), $1.00 (n=18; two horizontal lines), or $5.00 (n=18; three horizontal lines). “No 
response” trials (n=36; a triangle) will indicate that the subject should not respond during 
that trial, and instead should wait until the cue signaling the next trial appeared. Trial 
types will be pseudo-randomly ordered within each run, and runs will be counterbalanced 
across subjects. 
 
When subjects are presented with the cue shape they will be instructed to respond b y 
pressing a button when they are presented with a white target for a period of 160-[ADDRESS_589364] on that trial and their total winnings (or losses). 
 
Subjects will undergo at least 10 minutes of training and practice prior to testing. They 
will also see the money that they could potentially win prior to fMRI testing. Task 
difficulty will be based on reaction times collected during practice sessions and will aim 
to allow subjects to successfully press the button during target presentation on incentive 
trials on 66% of the trials. 
 
Scan Acquisition: All scans will be conducted on research dedicated 3.[ADDRESS_589365] software version using an advanced 32-channel RF coil. MR 
compatible video projection system with vision correction lenses, high quality 
headphones and a button box will be used for fMRI task presentation and response 
recording. Physiological monitoring is performed and digitally recorded during all scans. 
 
Resting state connectivity will also be assessed with fMRI for exploratory analysis.

8.4.2. The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)  
 
The Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (Snaith et al., 1995) is a well-validated 14-
item questionnaire used to assess anhedonia. It asks participants to agree or disagree with 
statements of hedonic response i n pleasurable situations (e.g., “I would enjoy my favorite 
television or radio program”). Four responses are possible: Strongly disagree, Disagree, 
Agree, or Strongly agree. Each item on the SHAPS is worded so that higher scores 
indicate greater pleasure capacity. A total score can be derived by [CONTACT_461012]. Items answered with “strongly agree” are coded as “1”, while a “strongly 
disagree” response was assigned a score of “4.”  Therefore, scores on the SHAPS can 
range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to higher levels of anhedonia. 
 
The SHAPS covers four domains of hedonic experience: interest/pastimes, social 
interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink (Snaith et al., 1995). Participants 
completing the SHAPS are instructed to respond based on their ability to experience 
pleasure “in the last few days.”  This scale has shown adequate overall psychometric 
properties in clinical and student samples (Gilbert el al. , 2002; Snaith et al., 1995). The 
SHAPS convergent validity has been supported by [CONTACT_461013], the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire Anhedonic Depression 
subscale, and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule-Positive Affect subscale (Gilbert et 
al., 2002; Snaith et al., 1995). Its discriminant validity has been supported by [CONTACT_461014] (Snaith et al., 1995). The 
SHAPS has satisfactory test-retest validity in healthy participants over an interval of three 
weeks (intraclass correlation coefficient between test and retest: r = .70, p < .001; 
Franken et al., 2007).  Besides being well-validated, the SHAPS is of utility for our study 
because there is an established cutoff for clinical significance. Although this is also true 
for the Anhedonic Depression subscale of the Mood and Anxiety Symptoms 
Questionnaire (MASQ), we wanted a scale that assessed anhedonia and was not 
depression specific or specific to any other disorder given the goal of using it across 
diagnostic boundaries. ROC using the MADRS anhedonia item score (cutoff was 
clinically significant level) as a discriminator suggests that a SHAPS score of ≥ 20 
corresponds to clinically significant anhedonia (Snaith et al., 1995). This was validated in 
[ADDRESS_589367]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589368] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589369] one clinical trial (Di 
Giannantonio and Martinotti, 2012; Martinotti et al., 2011). In a study of alcohol 
dependent individuals, treatment with acetyl-l-carnitine led to statistically significantly 
greater improvement in the SHAPS than placebo by 10 days after initiating treatment 
(Martinotti et al., 2011). In an 8-week trial comparing the effects of venlafaxine XR and 
agomelatine treatment in depressed patients, significant improvement from baseline on 
the SHAPS was observed in both groups with significantly greater improvement being 
found for the agomelatine treated patients (Di Giannantonio and Martinotti, 2012). 
Finally, SHAPS scores among healthy participants have been related to reward-related 
activation within frontostriatal pathways (see e.g., Wacker et al., 2009), providing an 
additional reason for its inclusion in the current study. 
 
The SHAPS will be collected at all study visits. It will be used to screen subjects for 
having anhedonia as part of inclusion/exclusion assessment. It will also be compared in 
subjects receiving CERC-[ADDRESS_589370] Task (PRT) (adapted from Tripp & Alsop (1999)) was 
designed to objectively assess participants’ propensity to modulate behavior as a function 
of reinforcement history. This task has been validated in multiple independent samples 
(e.g., Barr et al., 2008; Bogdan and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2006, 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2005, 2007, 
2008a,b ; Vrieze et al., 2013a,b). Participants will complete two blocks of 100 trials, in 
which they will be asked to determine whether a briefly presented mouth on a cartoon 
face was ‘long’ or ‘short’, and report  their decision by [CONTACT_461015] a computer keyboard (‘z’ or ‘/’). Importantly, the brief presentation time (100 
ms) and the minimal difference in length between the two target stimuli (11.5 vs. 13 mm) 
make it difficult for participants to perceptually distinguish which stimulus is presented. 
Moreover, an asymmetrical reinforcement ratio is implemented across the two blocks so 
that one of the two stimuli (the ‘rich’ stimulus) is consistently rewarded (“Correct!! You 
Won 20 Cents”) three times more frequently than the ‘lean’ stimulus (30 vs. 10 times per 
block). Reinforcement allocation and key assignments will be counterbalanced across 
participants. Participants are instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible 
to maximize monetary rewards, and that not all correct responses will be followed by 
[CONTACT_461016]. In healthy participants, such asymmetric reinforcement schedule has been found 
to induce a systematic preference (response bias) for choosing the stimulus paired with 
more frequent reward (Macmillan and Creelman, 1996 ). Healthy controls are able to 
successfully modulate their behavior based on their experience, resulting in a significant 
response bias for the more frequently rewarded stimulus. In contrast, individuals with 
elevated depressive symptoms (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2005) or MDD (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2008b) 
– specifically MDD subjects with anhedonia (Vrieze et al., 2003) – show a blunted 
response bias, and overall reduced reward learning. Of note, reward learning negatively 
correlated with anhedonic symptoms and predicted them one month later (Bogdan and 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293],  2006; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2005) and predicted the persistence of a MDD 
diagnosis after 8-week antidepressant treatment (Vrize et al., 2013). Moreover, trial- by-
FAST-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589371] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page [ADDRESS_589372]. This impairment correlated with anhedonic symptoms, even after considering 
anxiety and distress symptoms (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301], 2008b ). 
 
Data reduction and analyses: After removing trials with outlier reaction times (see 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301].,  2005 for detail), response bias (log b) will be computed according to the 
following formula: 
 
 
To avoid issues related to having a zero in one cell of the formula, 0.5 will be added to 
every cell of the detection matrix (Hautus and Collins, 2003).  As evident from the 
formula, response bias reflects the participants’ preference for the stimulus paire d with 
more frequent rewards. Reward learning will be operationalized as the change in 
response bias from Block 1 to Block 2 (RB = Response Bias [Block 2] – Response Bias 
[Block 1 ]). 
 
The results of a number of studies provide the rationale for using the PRT in this study. 
This includes a study identifying that PRT score predicts clinical outcome to naturalistic 
antidepressant treatment. In this study, 69 inpatients and 63 healthy controls performed 
the PRT at baseline (i.e., at intake for patients), and patients were administered the task 
again after 8 weeks of antidepressant treatment (Vrieze et al. , 2013 a). Relative to 
controls, MDD patients showed reduced reward learning (F[2,280]=3.53, p=0.03). 
Critically, this blunting was found only in patients with high anhedonia (p=0.007). Of 
note, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were not related to reward 
learning. Also SHAPS scores uniquely predicted reward learning even when controlling 
for depression severity (HRSD scores) and anxiety comorbidity (β=0.33, t=3.08, 
p=0.003). Further, reward learning did not correlate with overall depressive symptoms 
(adjusted Beck Depression Inventory [BDI] score computed without anhedonic items) 
(p>.71) (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301].,  2005). Critically, the link between anhedonia and blunted 
reward learning was confirmed when entering the adjusted BDI scores as a covariate in a 
partial correlation (r=-.38, p=0.008). 
 
Additional findings of interest are that, in healthy controls, reward learning is reduced (1) 
under acute stress (Bogdan and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2006; Bogdan et al.,  2011) and during 
naturalistic stressors (Nikolova et al., 2012); and (2) by a pharmacological challenge 
(single low dose of the D2/D3 agonist pramipexole) affecting DA (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301].,  
2008a). Notably, the deleterious effects of stress on reward learning were largest in 
subjects reporting anhedonic symptoms in daily life (Bogdan and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293],  2006) and 
carrying genetic markers previously associated with depression risk (Bogdan et al.,  2010, 
2011; Nikolova et al., 2012). Blunted reward learning in subjects receiving pramipexole 
was assumed to result from activation of presynaptic DA autoreceptors, leading to 
decreased phasic DA bursts in response to unpredictable rewards. Conversely, reward 
learning was increased by a nicotine patch (Barr et al.,  2008), a manipulation assumed to 
activate mesocorticolimbic DA neurons (Kenny and Markou,  2006). The heritability of 
reward learning is substantial, 48% (Bogdan and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7293], 2009), and reward learning is

8.4.4. Other Efficacy Assessments 
 
Other efficacy assessments carried out in this study to be employed in exploratory 
analyses include resting state delta EEG current density in the rostral anterior cingulate, 
the Visual Analogue Scale for Anhedonia (VAS), The Effort Expenditure for Rewards 
Task (EEfRT), the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS), The Hamilton Rating 
Scale for Depression (HAM-D), The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and 
the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). The VAS-Anhedonia, 
TEPS, and CPFQ are self-report instruments. The EEfRT is a behavioral task. The HAM-
D and HAM-A are clinician administered assessements which will be administered by 
[CONTACT_461017]. The training, assessment, and maintenance of 
inter-rater reliability will be managed by [CONTACT_461018]. Clinical raters, 
neuropsychological technicians, and all staff involved in collection and analysis of 
clinical measures will be blinded to treatment assignment and to clinical status. They will 
have no interactions with subjects other than the administration of the specific tests the y 
are assigned to administer. Raters and patients will complete best-guess forms so that the 
adequacy of the blind can be assessed. Best-guess forms will be used to formally assess 
the adequacy of the blind for patients and raters. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Resting state delta EEG current density in the rostral anterior cingulate  
 
We will obtain resting state, eyes-closed quantitative EEG (QEEG) in order to provide an 
additional, secondary circuit-based measure of hedonic function. We will obtain resting 
state current density using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Magnetic Tomography 
(LORETA) based on evidence that using this method, greater resting EEG delta (1.5- 6 
Hz) current density (i.e., lower brain activity) in the rostral anterior cingulate is correlated 
with higher anhedonia scores with the MASQ anhedonic depression subscale (Wacker et 
al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004). 
 
The recordings will consist of at least [ADDRESS_589376] and bio-calibrations will be performed at the beginning 
of each study. The EEG data will be recorded with subjects in a semi recumbent position, 
with eyes closed in a maximally alert state in a sound-attenuated room with subdued 
lighting. Data collection will occur for 20 minutes ([ADDRESS_589377]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0 
Task Order #: HHSN27100004 Version Date 10/06/[ADDRESS_589378] #: HHSN271201200006I 
 
Page 44 of 75 minutes with eyes opened) following calibration with filter settings of 0.5 and 70 Hz. 
Analysis will be carried out using Low Resolution Electromagnetic Magnetic 
Tomography (LORETA) (see Statistical Analysis Section) to produce estimates of resting 
state EEG delta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate which has previously been 
reported to correlate with a self-rated anhedonia measure (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_460929]., 2004). 
 
The Duke QEEG Core will receive the data collected at each of the sites, and it will 
undergo analysis blinded to subject and study time point and entered manually. The 
studies will first undergo epoch- by-epoch visual artifacting with confirmation by a 
second rater. In cases of discrepancies, a third rater will be employed for resolution. 
QEEG analysis will only be carried out if a minimum of [ADDRESS_589379]-
free data are available. The data will undergo Laplacian transformation to produce 
current density estimates (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004). The current 
density data will undergo spectral analysis via Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) with 
boxcar windowing to generate power estimates in the following frequency bands: delta 
(1.5–6.0 Hz), theta (6.5 –8.0 Hz), alpha1 (8.5 –10.0 Hz), alpha2 (10.5 –12.0 Hz), beta1 
(12.5 –18.0 Hz), beta2 (18.5 –21.0 Hz), beta3 (21.5 –30.0 Hz), and gamma (36.5 –44.0 Hz). 
This will be carried out with the LORETA software, at each voxel (n = 2394; voxel 
resolution = 7 mm3), current density will be computed as the squared magnitude of the 
intracerebral current density within each of the eight frequency bands (unit: amperes per 
square meter, A/m2). Current density estimates will be intensity-normalized to unity and 
log-transformed before statistical analyses. This will be carried out in 2-second segments 
and averaged over the available artifact-free, waking data. These data will be used to 
estimate resting state EEG current density. The primary QEEG outcome will be EEG 
delta current density in the rostral anterior cingulate which has found to correlate with 
self-rated anhedonia (Wacker et al., 2009; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_7301]., 2004). Resting state EEG 
current density power estimates in other frequency bands will be analyzed to evaluate the 
specificity of possible findings. Exploratory analysis for patterns of EEG activity that are 
predictors and correlates of outcome will be carried out using EEG power in all bands 
derived from all of the electrodes, employing principal components analysis (Krystal et 
al., 1995). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Anhedonia Measures  
 
To complement the SHAPS we include 3 secondary anhedonia measures: the Effort-
Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), the Visual Analogue Scale for Anhedonia 
(VAS-Anhedonia) and the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS). These will be 
compared in subjects receiving CERC-501  and PBO in exploratory analysis.  
 
The Effort -Expenditure for Rewards Task  (EEfRT; Treadway et al., 2009) is intended 
to assess the motivation to pursue rewards, one important dimension of reward-related 
function. It has been validated in a study of [ADDRESS_589380] 
anhedonia with the SHAPS (Treadway et al., 2009). The EEfRT was found to be 
correlated with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) anhedonia scale and the Chapman 
anhedonia scale. The EEfRT task is a multi-trial game in which participants are given an 
opportunity on each trial to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to 
obtain monetary rewards. For all trials, participants make repeated manual button presses 
FAST-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

Page 45 of 75 within a short period of time. Each button press raises the level of a virtual “bar” viewed 
onscreen by [CONTACT_2299]. Participants are eligible to win the money allotted for each 
trial if they raise the b ar to the “top” within the prescribed t ime period. Each trial presents 
the subject with a choice between two levels of task difficulty, a ‘hard task’ and an ‘easy 
task.’ Successful completion of hard-task trials requires the subject to make [ADDRESS_589382] to make 30 button presses, using the 
dominant index finger within 7 seconds. For easy-task trials, subjects are eligible to win 
the same amount, $1.00, on each trial if they successfully complete the task. For hard-
task choices, subjects are eligible to win higher amounts that vary per trial within a range 
of $1.24 – $4.30 (“reward magnitude”). Subjects are not guaranteed to win the reward if 
they complete the task; some trials are “win” trials, in which the subject receive the stated 
reward amount, while others are “no win” trials, in which the subject receives no money 
for that trial. To help subjects determine which trials are more likely to be win trials, 
subjects are provided with accurate probability cues at the beginning of each trial. Trials 
have three levels of probability: “high” 88% probability of being a win trial, “medium” 
50% and “low” 12%. Probability levels always a pply to both the hard task and easy task, 
and there are equal proportions of each probability level across the experiment. Each 
level of probability appears once in conjunction with each level of reward value for the 
hard task. All subjects receive trials presented in randomized order. 
 
All trials begin with a 1-second fixation cross, following a 5-second choice period in 
which subjects are presented with information regarding the probability of receiving 
reward and the reward magnitude of the hard task. Subjects are told that if they did not 
make a choice within [ADDRESS_589383] task for that trial. After making a choice, subjects are then shown a 1-second 
“Ready” screen and then they complete the task. Following task completion, subjects are 
shown a 2 second feedback screen informing them that the task was successfully or 
unsuccessfully completed. If subjects successfully complete the task, then a second 
feedback screen appears for 2 seconds in which subjects are told whether they had won 
money for that trial (reward feedback). In total, easy-task trials take approximately [ADDRESS_589384]-task trials take approximately 30 seconds. 
 
Subjects are told that they will receive a base-rate of compensation for their participation. 
In addition, they are told that two of their win trials will be randomly selected at the end 
of the experiment as “incentive trials,” for which they will receive the actual amount won 
on those trials. Subjects are informed that they have twenty minutes to play as many trials 
as they can. Since hard-task trials take approximately twice as much time to complete as 
easy-task trials, the number of trials that the subject is able to play depends in part on the 
choices that he or she makes. This means that making more hard-task trials toward the 
beginning of the experiment could reduce the total number of trials, which could in turn 
mean that the subject does not get a chance to play high-value, high-probability trials that 
might appear towards the end of the playing time. This trade-off is explained clearly to 
the subject. Importantly, subjects are not provided with any information regarding the 
distribution of trial types. The goal of this trade-off is to ensure that neither a strategy of 
always choosing the easy or the hard option could lead to an ‘optimal’ performance on 
the task. Moreover, the complexity of variables (with varying monetary reward levels, 
probability, and loss of time for future trials), does not lend itself to a formal calculation

Page [ADDRESS_589386] VAS assessment of anhedonia severity which is 
included because it provides a global anhedonia indicator which takes very little time to 
obtain and which was found to be sensitive to change with treatment in a prior placebo-
controlled trial in alcohol dependent subjects (Martinotti et al., 2011). The test consists of 
making a rating on a 100  mm scale in response to the directive: "Make a mark on the line 
below that indicates how much pleasure you experience from food, sexual behavior, and 
meeting friends". At the left end of the scale is the anchor "No Pleasure" and at the right 
end of the scale is the anchor "Extreme Pleasure." 
 
We also include the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale  (TEPS) because it 
provides different information about reward-related function than the SHAPS and has 
been found to be correlated with activation in the key circuits of interest (nucleus 
accumbens and putamen) in Monetary Incentive Delay Task-related fMRI (Stanford et 
al., 2011). The TEPS is an 18-item self-report measurement of anticipatory (10 items) 
and consummatory (eight items) components of anhedonia which consists of a series of 
statements that must be rated according to how accurate they are for the individual (Gard 
et al., 2006). The scale differentiates the role of anticipatory pleasure (‘wanting’) from 
consummatory pleasure (‘liking’).  Both components are currently believed to be relevant 
to measuring anhedonia. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Exploratory Measures  
 
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  (HAM- D) 17-item version (Hamilton, 
1967) will be included in exploratory analysis to provide confirmatory support for 
changes in depression severity with treatment. This interviewer-administered semi-
structured interview is one of the most widely used instruments in depression treatment 
studies. 
 
The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety  (HAM-A) is a rating scale designed to measure 
the severity of anxiety symptoms (Hamilton, 1959). It is widely used in both clinical and 
research settings. The scale consists of 14 items, each defined by a series of symptoms, 
and measures both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and 
somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). It has been demonstrated to 
acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to change (Maier, 1988). Each item is 
scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total score range of 0 –56, where 
<17 indicates mild severity, 18 –24 mild to moderate severity and 25 –30 moderate to 
severe. This instrument will be included in secondary analysis to provide confirmatory 
support for changes in anxiety severity with treatment.  
 
The Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire  (CPFQ) is a 7-item self-report 
instrument was intended to be a brief scale for measuring cognitive and executive 
dysfunction in patients with mood and anxiety disorders (Fava et al., 2009). This scale

Page [ADDRESS_589388] strong internal consistency, good temporal stability and 
sensitivity to change with treatment (Fava et al., 2009). 
 
The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) is a widely administered clinician 
rated global measure of subject overall illness severity.  Subjects are rated on a 1-7 scale 
where 1 corresponds to “Normal, Not at All Ill”, 2 is “Borderline Mentally Ill”, the 
anchor for 3 is “Mildly Ill”, the anchor for 4 is “ Moderately Ill ”, 5 is “ Markedly Ill ”, 6 is 
“Severely Ill ”, and 7 is “ Among the Most Extremely Ill Patients ”.  It will be administered 
at all subject visits.   
 
The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement  (CGI-I) is a widely administered 
clinician rated global measure of the degree of improvement from the initial assessment 
in subject overall illness severity.  Subjects are rated on a 1-7 scale where 1 corresponds 
to “Very Much Improved”, 2 is “Much Improved”, the anchor for 3 is “Minimally 
Improved”, the anchor for 4 is “ No Change ”, 5 is “ Minimally Worse ”, 6 is “ Much 
Worse ”, and 7 is “ Very Much Worse”.  It will be administered at all subject visits.   
 During the course of the trial subjects for whom the CGI-I is greater than 5 
will be removed from the study and appropriate care given,  for safety 
purposes .

9.1.1. Analysis of data/ study outcomes 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Data Management 
All data management activities, including establishing a trial electronic case report form 
and procedures for randomization will be done within the framework of the Duke 
Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and will conform to FDA GCP requirements. 
 
Electronic data validation checks with data entry discrepancy flags will utilized. The 
flags will be triggered by [CONTACT_118547], logically inconsistent values, and values beyond 
limits . Data checks will be automated and occur daily and lead to the generation of 
queries in the EDC system which are communicated to the sites. The sites will then 
review the queries and make appropriate clarifications and corrections. The EDC system 
will also track queries and produce reports of outstanding queries. 
 
As the sites are entering data, on-screen edit checks run real-time to catch missing values, 
out of range values, and logical inconsistencies. These will be specified by [CONTACT_461019] (CDS) working in conjunction with the statistician. The sites will 
be trained on reliably entering data. A final database audit on a representative sample of 
the data will also be carried out.

9.1.2. Planned analyses and statistical methodology to be used 
We will employ “Intention -to-Treat” (ITT) principles. Statistical tests will be performed 
based on a two-sided test at the 5% level of significance. Supporting analyses will also be 
performed. A “per protocol” analysis wi ll restrict the analysis to participants who receive 
minimal exposure to the intervention, have a minimal number of longitudinal evaluations, 
and/or are free of major protocol violations. A “completer” analysis will only include 
participants who completed acute treatment without exiting or prematurely terminating 
from their assigned treatment. Because participants may be removed differentially across 
the treatment arms in these analyses, both approaches are vulnerable to differential 
selection bias and will be interpreted cautiously. 
 
Most of the study outcomes are observed repeatedly at well-defined time-points post-
randomization, so that statistical methods for repeated measures data will be applied. This 
includes the linear model with structured covariance matrices and the mixed effects 
models as implemented in PROC MIXED in SAS. Site will also be included as an 
independent variable in order to account for variability among the study sites. 
 
Covariates in Regression Models: The baseline value of the outcome, centered about its 
sample mean, will be included in each analysis. Otherwise, only age and sex will be 
entered as covariates.

Page 49 of 75  
Missing Values: We will proactively monitor the amount of missing data, and ensure that 
we respond quickly to emerging problems. Statistically, missing data will be addressed 
through the use of mixed models analysis which will be carried out with PROC MIXED 
in SAS.  We will carry out an assessment of the degree to which the structured covariance 
matrix in mixed effects models fits the data.  
 
Other Confounders Arising Post-Randomization: Logistic regression analysis will be 
carried out to investigate: (a) adherence to the assigned study intervention (this will 
include serum levels of study drug and blister pack check data), (b) co-administration of 
psychotropic medications, and (c) discontinuation from the study intervention. First, we 
will determine whether these effects occur differentially across the treatment arms 
suggesting that a differential selection bias may have influenced the results. Then, we 
will investigate whether baseline characteristics are predictive of any behavior. This will 
include demographic characteristics, initial severity as measured by [CONTACT_461020], and clinical characteristics such as diagnoses and medications 
taken at baseline. 
 
Magnitude of the Clinical Effect: To evaluate the clinical significance of the impact of 
treatment on outcome, effect sizes (Hedge’s g) will be calculated as (ME –  MC) / SD 
pooled, where ME represents the adjusted mean of experimental treatment, MC 
represents the adjusted mean of the comparison treatment, and SD pooled represents 
pooling of the standard deviations from within both groups. We will also assess h ow the 
estimated magnitude of treatment effect and the estimated standard deviation deviate 
from those postulated in sample size planning.  
 
fMRI Analysis: The monetary incentive delay task entails three key task phases: 
anticipating making a response, anticipating an outcome, and receiving that outcome. 
Functional brain responses to these three task phases will be identified using a General 
Linear Model based statistical analyses (GLM). Here, a statistical test is carried out 
between the actual data (fMRI time series) and a predicted model (event timings and 
parametric modulations by [CONTACT_461021]). If the fit between the predicted and actual data is 
good, then a relationship is concluded to exist between the actual data (voxel intensity 
values) and task-related factors (anticipation, response, receipt). Having tested the fit at 
the single subject level for each experimental session, the data will be combined into a 
second-level, random-effects, repeated-measures analysis of variance. Statistical 
inferences about task effects will be made after appropriate correction for multiple 
comparisons. Regions of interest or ROIs will be defined with reference to a standard 
brain atlas (that of Talaraich and Tournoux). The fMRI primary analysis (see below) will 
focus on the ventral striatum.  However, exploratory analyses will be carried out with 
other ROIs. Cluster-wise parameter estimates for each condition (anticipation, response, 
receipt) will be extracted for the ventral striatum (and from the other predefined ROIs for 
exploratory analysis) and correlated with receptor occupancies. In this manner our 
regression analyses will be robust to non-independence error.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Analysis 
A mixed effects model analysis will also be carried out for the secondary outcomes of the 
study, SHAPS score and PRT-derived Reward Learning and Response Bias. These 
analyses will test the hypothesis that CERC-501  will: 1) decrease SHAPS score to a 
greater degree than PBO; and 2) increase PRT-derived reward learning and response bias 
to a greater degree than PBO. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exploratory Analysis 
Exploratory mixed effects model analyses will also be carried out with the exploratory 
outcomes of the study. This includes: ventral striatal fMRI activation during anticipation 
of loss during the MID Task; resting state delta EEG current density in the rostral anterior 
cingulate; resting state fMRI connectivity; self-rated affective responses to cues and 
feedback during the MID Task; EEfRT total reward; VAS score; TEPS anticipatory and 
consummatory pleasure scores; HAM -D score; HAM-A score; CGI-S, CGI-I, and CPFQ 
score. 
 
9.2. Power Analysis 
 
A total of 90 subjects will be randomized: [ADDRESS_589393] incomplete data on up to 20% of subjects due to subject drop out or loss 
of data due to factors such as poor scan quality. As a result, we estimate that we will have 
complete data on as few as 72 subjects and as many as 90 subjects. In the section above, 
we outline how we will address the issue of missing data including carrying out analyses 
on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population and employing mixed effect models. If we assume 
the worst case scenario of [ADDRESS_589394] at an alpha value of 0.05, 
power is 80% to identify an effect size of 0.58. For a one tailed t-test at an alpha value of 
0.10 power is 80% to identify an effect size of 0.50. In Figure 4, it is indicate d the effect 
that could be detected with 80% power at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_589395]

10. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION  
 
10.1. Subject Selection 
 
10.1.1. Statement of equitability 
 
Subjects in this study will all be recruited within the vicinity of each of the sites by [CONTACT_461023]. We expect that the racial and sexual distributions of patients enrolled in this 
study will reflect those of the general population in each region. All of the sites have 
experience recruiting minorities through a concentrated effort in communities that have 
high representation of ethnic and racial minorities and through advertisements in 
newspapers and radio stations whose readers/listeners are predominantly of specific racial 
or ethnic minorities. 
 
10.1.2. Justification for exclusion of children 
 
Children (those under age 21) will not be included in this study because insufficient data 
are available with CERC-501 in adults to judge potential risk in children. 
 
10.1.3. Justification for exclusion of other vulnerable subjects 
 
Because the aims of this study can be achieved with individuals who are not members of 
vulnerable groups (those who lack capacity for consent, prisoners, pregnant women etc.), 
we will not have to include any vulnerable subjects.

Page [ADDRESS_589401] agree to use appropriate contraceptive measures for the duration of the study and for 
1 month afterwards. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical 
sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or hysterectomy), (2) approved hormonal 
contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or injections), (3) barrier 
methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or (4) an intrauterine 
device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after 
unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use. If subjects do become 
pregnant during this study or if they have unprotected sex, they will be instructed to 
inform the study physician immediately. 
 
Participation of sexually active men has the potential to damage sperm, which could 
cause harm to a child that a subject might father while on this study.  As a result, in order 
to protect subjects, sexually active male subjects will have to agree to use a medically 
acceptable form of birth control during and 1 month after this study in order to 
participate. Medically acceptable contraceptives include: (1) surgical sterilization (such 
as a vasectomy), or (2) a condom used with a spermicide. Contraceptive measures such as 
Plan B (TM), sold for emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods 
for routine use. Subjects will be instructed to inform their partners of the potential for 
harm to an unborn child and that they should immediately inform the study doctor if 
pregnancy occurs. 
 
10.1.5. Qualifications of Investigators 
The overall principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_420480]. Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS. He is 
highly experienced in serving as the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_208166]-site and multi-site 
clinical trials with patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders. This includes 
those employing fMRI scanning as will be carried out in the current study. Each one of 
the site PIs was selected because they too are highly experienced in serving as PIs for 
studies of patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders and they themselves or 
those at their site also have experience and expertise in carrying out the assessments that 
will be carried out in this study. 
 
11. ANTICIPATED BENEFIT  
 
Subjects may not receive any direct benefit from participating in this study. There is a 
small possibility that we may detect an unrelated medical condition during the procedures 
conducted in this study which could have health benefits for some individuals. Some 
individuals may experience improvement in their symptoms through participation in the 
study, though some are likely to remain the same or get worse. However, the drug will 
not be available to subjects after the study concludes. The information that we get from 
this study may help us to better treat future patients with mood and anxiety disorders. 
 
The available treatments for patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders have 
significant limitations. This study has the potential to take steps to address these

disorders; 2) evaluating a potential target in the brain which could serve as the basis for 
development of additional new candidate compounds for the treatment of patients with 
mood and anxiety spectrum disorders; 3) establishing more expeditious methods for 
evaluating potential new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460920]; and 4) specifically establishing methods for the development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460921], an important endpoint.

The risks of the study are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefit described in 
Section 11.  
 
13. CONSENT DOCUMENTS AND PROCESS  
 
13.1. Consent Procedures 
 
All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension 
of the purposes, procedures and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent 
form and ask questions regarding this study prior to signing. 
 
14. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
14.1. Data and Safety Monitor 
 
Data and safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_461002] 
(DSMB). The NIMH DSMB functions include, among many, the assessment of interim 
data to determine whether the treatment interventions show a clear risk when compared 
with placebo. The main purpose of the NIMH DSMB is to assess safety of the 
interventions by [CONTACT_461024] r 
among study participants receiving the intervention compared to the participants 
receiving placebo treatment. Data will be reviewed every [ADDRESS_589403]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

Page [ADDRESS_589405] after the study commen ces, the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_460930] a full report to the NIMH DSMB members and 
the study biostatistician, summarizing recruitment, patient status and safety data for the 
study to be reviewed at that DSMB meeting including SAE reports. These reports will be 
prepared illustrating patient status and safety data. Patient status reports will summarize 
the number of subjects screened, eligible, randomized, treated, and completing the study -
- by [CONTACT_461025]-date. Detailed tables will be provided on reasons for 
ineligibility, and reasons for early termination of enrolled subjects. Safety reports will 
include summary data on all subjects experiencing the emergence or worsening of any 
adverse event (including abnormal laboratory values) during the course of a study, and 
during each study phase (screening, treatment, follow-up) -- each relative to the number 
of subjects in that phase. More detailed reports will provide information on the specific 
types of adverse events experienced, and the number that constituted Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) or led to termination from the study. Details of all SAEs occurring during 
a study will be provided to the DSMB for review of the nature and outcome of each SAE, 
as well as that all appropriate follow-up and required reporting was done in a timely 
manner. Tabulation and descriptions for protocol deviations will also be included in the 
report. 
 
In addition to reviewing these data, the DSMB will also review procedures for ensuring 
that data are collected and analyzed per protocol privacy and that subject confidentiality 
is being maintained. 
 
The DSMB will also carry out an overall assessment of the risk-benefit ratio of the study 
based on the available data. If there is a concern that the risks might outweigh the 
benefits, then enrollment will be suspended pending a more detailed review. However, if 
it is clear that the risks outweigh the benefits, then they will recommend permanently 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
 
15. QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
15.1. Program Management Committee 
 
The Program Management Committee (PMC) will have primary responsibility for 
Quality Assurance Monitoring for this study. This committee will be chaired by [CONTACT_461026]-Chaired by [CONTACT_461027]-MAS PI, Andrew Krystal, MD, MS. 
This committee will also include several teams: 1) Site Management – this includes a 
Clinical Research Associate (CRA), who, along with the Project L ead will have primary 
site management responsibility; 2) Data Management – this includes the Lead 
Biostatistician,  and the Program Manager of electronic data system (EDC) and data 
management group ; 3) Assessment/Signal Detection – Richard Keefe, Ph.D. will lead 
oversight of assessments and quality of data collection; 4) Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) – Allen Song, Ph.D. will lead oversight for ensuring the quality of MRI methods, 
MRI data collection, and MRI data analysis.

Page 55 of 75 15.2.  Quality Assurance Plan 
 
The PMC will meet regularly via teleconference (weekly from the beginning of study 
start up until the end of the study) to provide operational leadership to ensure that the 
study is implemented and managed efficiently and effectively and to oversee Quality 
Assurance. In this effort, they will work collaboratively with the NIMH Program Team. 
The Quality Assurance Plan includes the PMC carrying out the following key activities. 
 
15.2.1. Monitoring and Managing Study Timelines 
One of the most important responsibilities of the PMC will be to monitor study timelines 
by [CONTACT_461028].  The 
PMC will be responsible for collecting ongoing data on whether milestones are being 
met. [CONTACT_38459] will then lead forming a strategy to address problems in meeting 
recruiting or other milestones and will work directly with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_460931]. 
 
15.2.2. Monitoring for Protocol Deviatio ns 
Another important function of the PMC will be to monitor for protocol deviations. These 
will be identified via review of electronic case report by [CONTACT_461029]. In addition each site will report all protocol deviations to the Site 
Management team.  The PMC will monitor the protocol deviations and institute plans for 
addressing ongoing problems/deficiencies where needed. 
  
15.2.3. Site Training 
Site Training will take place in a number of steps. This will include training from the Site 
Management team on many study procedures, training from [CONTACT_295323] on completing 
subject assessments, training from [CONTACT_461042] on MRI procedures, and EDC training (see 
following section). The procedures to be carried out at the sites will be reviewed. This 
will also be the case for requirements for training of staff and documentation that those 
carrying out tasks for this study have the appropriate training documented. 
 
[CONTACT_295323] will implement processes that he and his group have developed for rater 
training and data quality review to promote the collection of high quality data. These 
processes will be employed in this FAST-MAS study and are outlined below: 
 
a. Develop a protocol-specific guide for the MINI, HAM-D, HAM-A and C-SSRS. 
b. Provide all testing materials to the sites. 
c. Pre-screen 2 raters per site, including assessing the sites for their rater 
training/credentials, extent of rater experience, and experience with clinical 
populations, and experience with the specific instruments used in this study. 
d. Implement training procedures, including preparations for training, sending 
protocol-specific procedures, and providing access to clinical rating training 
videos for raters to review prior to the investigator’s meetings.  
e. Individual certification of at least one rater per site. 
f. Review of testing procedures by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Keefe via a presentation to the site 
investigators. 
g. Either in-person or phone training and certification for all raters.

15.2. 4. Site Electronic Data Capture (EDC) System Training 
The Data Management team w ill conduct a web-based training on the EDC systems for 
site personnel. The site teams will enter data in the training environment during the 
training session, ask questions, and receive feedback on their work. In addition to the 
training session, the Data Management team will be available on a continuing basis to 
assist site personnel over the phone with questions related to remote data entry. 
Throughout the trial, for new study coordinators training will be delivered via a web-
based program and telephone. 
 
15.2.5. Research Ethics Training 
The C C will ensure that a ll faculty, clinical staff having direct patient contact, and all 
personnel involved in site and data management involved in this study will meet human 
subjects training requirements.  
 
15.2.6. Ongoing Site Management/Monitoring 
Ongoing Management/Monitoring of each site will be carried out by [CONTACT_461030], and a Clinical Research 
Associate (CRA). Site Management will include both on-site and in-house monitoring, 
routine communication with the site personnel, and collection of site-related data and 
documents. A particular focus will be to work with the site on effective recruiting 
strategies. The CRA will also provide ongoing monitoring of the recruitment at the site 
and report this to the FAST-MAS PI [INVESTIGATOR_460932]. 
The CRA will carry out the same type of monitoring and trouble-shooting with protocol 
implementation and quality of adherence to study procedures. [CONTACT_295323] and the Signal 
Detection team will also play an important role in ongoing monitoring in order to 
maintain high quality in study assessments. Their activities will include: 
 
a. Monitoring frequency of assessments carried out by [CONTACT_216117].

(PRISE) .  In addition, a series of safety assessments will be carried out and the findings 
reviewed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_12749]- I. These safety assessments will include: the Columbia 
Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) (Posner, 2011), vital signs (height, weight, blood 
pressure, and pulse), physical examination, Beta-HCG serum pregnancy test, urine drug 
screen, complete blood count with differential, electrolytes, comprehensive metabolic 
panel including liver function tests, thyroid function tests, urinalysis, the Clinical Global 
Impression – Improvement (CGI- I), the Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-
S)and ECG and EEG ( obtained at baseline, at the end of 8  weeks of daily treatment with 
study drug).  In addition, because gastritis was noted in some of the rats administered 
CERC-[ADDRESS_589410] of collecting blood at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of double-blind 
treatment from which gastrin and pepsinogen I/II levels will be determined.    
 
These data will be used to assess for adverse event type, severity, expectedness, and 
causal relationship to study drug as defined below. 
 
16.1.1. Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of the study drug in a subject whether or not considered drug related. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of the drug. Any change in clinical status, ECGs, laboratory tests, 
physical examinations, etc., that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_461031]. 
 
16.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
An SAE is any adverse event where any of the following is the case: 
 Is associated with death. 
 Is life-threatening: Places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event as it occurred. This includes suicide attempts. It does not include an AE 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 Causes persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions. 
 Is associated with inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]. 
 Is associated with a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, o r 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition above. This determination is based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_460933] (e.g., if either believes it is serious, it mus t be considered 
serious).

Page 58 of 75 16.1.3. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
The determination of adverse event severity will be made by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_460934]-I. The 
severity of AEs will be graded using the following definitions:  
 Mild:  Participant is aware of symptoms or has minor findings, but tolerates them 
well and no or minimal intervention is required 
 Moderate : Participant experiences enough symptoms or findings to require 
intervention 
 Severe:  Participant experiences symptoms or findings that require significant 
intervention or is life threatening (participant is at immediate risk of death from 
symptoms or findings that require aggressive medical management) 
 
16.1.4. Assessment of Causal Relationship to Study Drug 
The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-Investigator will rate the causal relationship of any adverse event to the 
study drug using the following: 
 Not related : There is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational 
product and the adverse event 
 Unlikely related: An AE that has some possibility of being related to the study 
drug but this possibility is remote.  
 Possibly related : An AE that has little or no relationship to the study drug and 
there exists a more likely alternative cause 
 Probably related : An AE that is likely to be related to the administration of the 
study drug and an alternative cause less likely when compared to the study drug 
 Definitely Related : An AE that has a strong temporal relationship to the study 
drug. AE will recur with continued or repeated use of the study drug, and 
another cause is unlikely or less likely 
 
16.1.5. Expectedness of Adverse Event 
Any adverse event, the specificity, nature, or severity of which is not consistent with the 
investigator brochure will be considered an unexpected AE. AEs that are expected based 
on the investigator brochure consist of peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, headache, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting, flushing, anxiety, upset stomach, and itchiness.  
 
16.2. Documentation of Adverse Events 
All events determined to be an AE, based on physical examination, laboratory findings, 
or other means, will be recorded. Each AE will be entered into the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_261959]. The investigator will provide date of 
onset and resolution, assessment of severity, intensity, and frequency, action(s) taken, 
changes in study drug dosing, relationship to study drug, and outcome. When additional 
relevant information related to an AE becomes available, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749]-I will record 
follow-up information according to the same process used for reporting the initial event 
as described above. They will follow all Adverse Events until resolution or they no 
longer believe that it is clinically significant. AEs ongoing at the time of the last dose of 
study drug will be followed up for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the 
participant’s safety , until they are resolved, or until it is determined by [CONTACT_461032]. All women of childbearing potential will be instructed to 
notify the Investigator if they become pregnant at any time during the study or within [ADDRESS_589412]-MAS KOR Phase 2a Study Protocol Version 6 .0

Page 59 of 75 associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the mother or fetus/child will be recorded in the 
EDC system. 
 
16.3. Reporting of Adverse Events 
Any SAE entered into the EDC system will generate automatic notification to the DCRI 
Safety Surveillance Team. The DCRI Safety Surveillance Team will review all SAEs at 
the time they are reported and immediately report them to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Krystal.  [CONTACT_38459] or his designee will be responsible for notifying the NIMH Contract 
Officer’s Representative (COR) , NIMH DSMB and Cerecor within 1 – [ADDRESS_589414]. Krystal or his designee will be responsible for 
forwarding written IND Safety reports (for those events identified as serious, related and 
unexpected) to the NIMH COR, NIMH DSMB, Cerecor,  the site PIs, and the Duke IRB 
within 7 days (fatal/life threatening) and/or 15 days (for all other event determined to 
meet expedited reporting criteria).  
 The individual site principal investigators will be responsible for reporting SAEs 
occurring in subjects at their respective sites to their local Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB) per local IRB reporting requirements.  
 
[CONTACT_38459] or his designee will be responsible for notifying the FDA in a written IND 
safety report of  all SAEs determined to meet expedited reporting criteria within 7 days 
(for fatal/life threatening events) and/or 15 days (for all other event determined to meet 
expedited reporting criteria) per [ADDRESS_589415] be reported to the DCRI within the same timelines as a serious 
adverse event.  The pregnancy will be recorded on the appropriate pregnancy form and 
will be followed until final outcome. Any associated AEs or SAEs that occur to the 
mother or fetus/child will be recorded on the appropriate AE or SAE eCRF form and 
processed accordingly.  The DCRI Safety Group will notify the NIMH COR, NIMH 
DSMB, and Cerecor of any pregnancy occurring during the study within the same 
timelines as a serious adverse event.  The site principal investigators will be responsible 
for notifying the respective IRB of any pregnancies occurring at their sites. 
 
In addition, [CONTACT_38459] or designee will promptly report to the NIMH COR, NIMH 
DSMB and the site principal investigators any unanticipated problems that are not 
adverse events within 1 –2 business days of becoming aware of an unanticipated and life 
threatening problem or within 15 days of  becoming aware of all other unanticipated 
problems.  Unanticipated problems are any event that is: unexpected in nature, frequency 
or severity; related or possibly related to participation in the research; or suggest that the 
risk of harm to subjects is increased.  
 
Expected or non-serious adverse events will be reported to the NIMH COR, NIMH 
DSMB prior to each Board meeting.

FDA approved treatment available by [CONTACT_461033]. 
 
 Alternative treatments and procedures.  In some, cases patients will have failed 
or partially responded to conventional treatment. Their main alternative to 
participation will be treatment with another traditional treatment which includes 
antidepressant or anxiolytic medication, and/or psychotherapy, a newer form of 
treatment such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), or a more 
intensive form a treatment like ECT. The risks and benefits of the alternatives are 
those of the possible treatments. 
 
18. CONFLICT OF INTEREST  
 
18.1. Distribution of NIH Guidelines 
 
NIH guidelines on conflict of interest have been distributed to all investigators.

[ADDRESS_866450] phase, adaptive immune responses are protective and lead to mild 
disease.  However,  if immunity  is impaired  or otherwise  deficient,  severe cases are associated  with 
Lymphopenia and a cytokine storm at which point the  immune response is maladaptive and leads 
to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) and pulmonary failure.2,3 
COVID -19 is a Coronavirus that is similar  to the pathogen  (SARS -CoV)  which  caused  the SARS 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_647181] 2002-2003. Research into SARS-CoV demonstrated the potential role of TMPRSS2 in the pathogenicity of that disease and in particular the link to pulmonary manifestations. Previous work has shown that the SARS S (spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]) protein is proteolytically processed by [CONTACT_7566]2. SARS S is cleaved into several fragments upon coexpression of TMPRSS2 (cis- 
cleavage) and upon contact [CONTACT_647212] S- expressing cells and TMPRSS2 -positive cel ls 
(trans -cleavage)
4. SARS S protein is associated with inhibition of antibody mediated 
neutralization  of the virus,  and thus promotes  viral spreading.  TRMPSS2  is also a coreceptor  for 
SAR -CoV (with ACE2), and is thus associated with SARS-CoV infectivity, shedding, and 
resistance to protective antibodies. Like SARS, SARS- CoV -2 has been shown to use the ACE2 
and TMPRSS2 receptors for cell entry.5 
Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor that is currently approved in Japan for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis and reflux  esophagitis.  It exhibits anti TMPRSS2  activity  in cell line studies
3. 
Camostat  successfully abrogated SARS S cleavage, inhibited cell entry, and decreased viral 
replication.  
There  is currently  no proven therapy for COVID-19 infection.  Multiple  trials  are currently  active, 
with multiple agents having shown some promise based on small case series. These include hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.  
A key national priority  in the current pandemic as well as for the individual patients  is to decrease 
the need for ICU admissions and ventilator support. Current projections estimate a national shortage of over 19,000 ICU beds and 31,000 ventilators at the peak of the infection
6. In a case 
series of 138 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647182]- CoV -2 pneumonia in Wuhan, 26% required 
admission to the ICU2. Therefore,  any intervention  that can lessen  the need  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_647183].  
Remdesivir has recently received emergency use authorization from the US FDA as a treatment 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647184] -19. In its letter authorizing emergency use, 
the FDA describes remdesivir  as “a direct acting  antiviral  drug that inhibits  viral RNA  synthesis.” 
Based  on review  of the topline data from  the randomized, double- blinded,  placebo -controlled trial 
conducted by [CONTACT_18127] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and from the [COMPANY_009]-sponsored open- label trial that 
evaluated different durations of remdesivir ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), it is reasonable to believe that the 
known and potential benefits of RDV outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug for the 
treatment of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249122] -19.”7 The EUA is based on preliminary  
7 
7  
  
 
data from  the National Institute of Allergy  and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  sponsored Adaptive  
COVID -19 Treatment  Trial  (ACTT)  indicate  that patients  who received  remdesivir  had a median 
time to recovery of 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received placebo(p<0.001). 
The mortality  rate was 8.0% for the group receiving remdesivir  versus  11.6% for the placebo 
group (p=0.059)8. 
 
Other drugs that are frequently used for patients admitted with COVID -[ADDRESS_866451] of care (SOC) treatment will increase the proportion of 
patients alive  and free from  respi[INVESTIGATOR_628607]  28 in SARS -CoV -2 as compared  to 
SOC treatment with placebo.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives include the following:  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_866452] inhibition with Camostat mesilate combined with SOC  treatment will increase the proportion of 
patients alive  and free of ventilator use or ECMO  at Day 28 as compared  to SOC 
treatment combined with placebo.  
2.2.2 To determine if the combination of Camostat mesilate combined with SOC 
treatment  will result  in a decreased  mortality  rate at 28 and 56 days as compared 
to SOC treatment combined with placebo. 
2.2.3 To determine if time to clinical improvement is reduced in patients receiving SOC  treatment  combined with Camostat  mesilate  as compared  to SOC  treatment 
combined with placebo. 
2.2.4 To determine if Camostat  mesilate  combined with SOC  treatment  is associated 
with overall improved clinical status at Days 14 and 28 as compared to SOC 
treatment combined with placebo.  
2.2.5 To determine if Camostat  mesilate  combined with SOC  treatment  is associated 
with a reduced length of stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647185]. 
2.2.6 To determine if Camostat  mesilate  combined with SOC  treatment  is associated 
with reduced duration of: 
a) mechanical  ventilation  or ECMO  use, 
 
b) non-invasive ventilation  or high- flow oxygen use, and 
8

c) supplemental oxygen use as compared  to SOC  treatment  combined  with 
placebo.  
2.2.7 To compare  the safety  and toxicity  profile  of Camostat  mesilate  combined with 
SOC treatment as compared to SOC treatment combined with placebo.  
2.2.8 To determine if treatment  with Camostat  mesilate  combined  with SOC  treatment 
is associated with decreased incidence of thrombotic events and bleeding 
complications as compared to SOC treatment combined with placebo.

The sponsor/sponsor-investigator is responsible for notifying  FDA and all participating 
investigators in a written safety report of any of the following: 
• Any suspected  adverse reaction  that is both serious and unexpected.  
• Any clinically  important increase in the rate of a serious  suspected  adverse reaction  over 
the rate stated in the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
• Any findings from  laboratory  animal  or in vitro  testing  that suggest  a significant risk for 
human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
• Any findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analysis of multiple studies, or 
clinical  studies,  whether  or not conducted under an IND and whether or not conducted  by 
[CONTACT_456], that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug.  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  
Any untoward me dical  occurrence associated  with the use of a drug in humans,  whether 
or not considered drug related. 
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event  for which  there  is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused  the 
adverse event.  
 
Expedited  Reporting  
Events reported  to sponsor within  [ADDRESS_866466]  
Events that would  not typi[INVESTIGATOR_647191], 
but that for a specific protocol are being reported via expedited means in order to facilitate the review of safety data (may be requested by [CONTACT_15927]).  
 
8.1 Adverse Event Characteristics 
 
CTCAE  term (AE  description) and  grade: The descriptions  and grading scales found 
in the revised  NCI Common  Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version  
5.[ADDRESS_866467]  access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
 
 
a. Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine  part of every  clinical  trial. 
 
b. Identify the grade  and severity  of the event  using the CTCAE  version 5.0. 
 
c. Determine whether the event is expected  or unexpected (see Section  8.2). 
 
d. Determine if the adverse event  is related  to the study intervention  (agent, treatment or 
procedure) (see Section 10.3). 

[ADDRESS_866468]  be reported  as an expedited  report.  If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 8.4).  
 
f. Determine if other  reporting  is required  (see Section  8.5). 
 
g. Note:  All AEs reported  via expedited mechanisms must  also be reported  via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 8).  
 
Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event 
used for medical  documentation  and scientific  analysis and is a single  MedDRA  Lowest 
Level Term (LLT).  
NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined  by [CONTACT_647222],  is NOT  the same  as serious 
AE which is defined in the table in Section 8.4. 
 
8.2 Expected  vs. Unexpected Events  
 
Expected  events - are those described  within  the Section  11.0 of the protocol,  the study 
specific consent form,  and the  investigator  brochure,  (if an investigator brochure  is not 
required, otherwise described in the general investigational plan). 
 
Unexpected  adverse  events or suspected  adverse reactions  are those not listed  in Section  
11.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, or in the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed); if an investigator 
brochure is not required  or available,  is not consistent  with the risk information  described 
in the general investigational plan.  
 
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned  in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class  of drugs but have  not 
been observed with the drug under investigation. 
 
 
8.3 Assessment  of Attribution  
 
When  assessing  whether  an adverse event  is related  to a medical  treatment  or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated  - The adverse event  is clearly NOT  related  to the agent(s). 
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical  treatment  suggest  there  is evidence to indicate  a causal relationship 
between the drug/device and the adverse event.

8.5.1 Unanticipated  Problems  Involving Risks  to Subjects  or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885])  in 
general, include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms  of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol- related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research  protocol  and informed  consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
 
2. Related  or possibly related  to participation  in the research  (in this guidance 
document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the 
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_182821]); and 
 
3. Suggests that the research  places subjects  or others at a greater  risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized. 
 
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of the 
physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In other cases, 
unanticipated problems place  subjects or others  at increased  risk of harm,  but no 
harm occurs. 
 
 
8.5.2 Submit via appropriate Case  Report  Forms  the following AEs experienced  by a 
patient and not specified in Section 8.5:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grade  1 and 2 AEs deemed  possibly, probably, or definitely  related  to the 
study treatment or procedure. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grade  3 and 4 AEs regardless  of attribution  to the study treatment  or 
procedure  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Grade  5 AEs (Deaths)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_866472] obtain consent from the pregnant woman and the newborn infant’s 
parent  or legal  guardian  before any data collection  can occur. A consent  form  will need  to 
be submitted to the IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy occurs. If informed consent is 
not obtained, no information may be collected. In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion the  mother is  the patient. In cases where 
the child/fetus  experiences a serious  adverse event other than fetal death,  the child/fetus 
is the patient. 
 
NOTE: When submitting ACCRU Adverse Event Report reports for “Pregnancy”, 
“Pregnancy  loss”,  or “Neonatal  loss”,  the potential  risk of exposure of the fetus  to the 
investigational agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section. Include any available medical documentation.

11.0 Drug  Information  
 
11.1 Camostat  mesilate  (Foipan®):  
 
11.1.1  Background: Camostat mesilate is a serine protease inhibitor that is currently 
approved in Japan  for pancreatitis and reflux  esophagitis. Camostat  mesilate  acts 
promptly on kinin formation, fibrinolytic, coagulation and complementary systems to immediately inhibit enzyme activities and their abnormal increases. 
For the purposes of this study, camostat mesilate also exhibits anti - 
transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) activities. It can also void severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (SARS) S cleavage, inhibit cell entry and decrease 
viral replication.  
11.1.2  Formulation: Camostat  mesilate  is available  as a 100 mg film coated  tablet.  Each 
tablet also contains hydroxypropylcellulose, carmellose  calcium, magnesium 
stearate, polyoxyethylene (105) polyoxyethylene (5) glycol, and lactose hydrate.  
11.1.3  Preparation  and storage:  Camostat  mesilate  are packaged in bottles  of 28 tablets. 
The recommended storage condition for camostat mesilate film coated tablets is 
15° to 30°C. 
11.1.4  Administration:  Camostat mesilate tablets should be taken by [CONTACT_647227] [ADDRESS_866478] be held while on continuous tube feedings. 
 
 
11.1.5  Pharmacokinetic information:  
 
Absorption: After  a single  dose of camostat  mesilate  at 200 mg, Tmax  values 
were 40 minutes with a maximum of 87.1 ng/mL 
Protein  binding: Protein  binding to human serum  was 25.8- 28.2%  
 
Metabolism: Carboxylate ester moiety of camostat mesilate is hydrolyzed to an 
active metabolite 4 -(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate, which is further 
hydrolyzed to 4-guanidinobenzoic acid. Camostat mesilate is mainly hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_647228] 4- (4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetate by [CONTACT_647229] 
(in vitro). Camostat mesilate and its metabolite 4 -(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy 
phenylacetate did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and 
CYP3A4 (in vitro). 
Half-life elimination:  Mean  half- life is 100 minutes  +/- 40 minutes.  
 
Excretion: Urinary  excretion  rates at 5-[ADDRESS_866479] administration  were  20% and 
0.8%, respectively, and little was further recovered in urine during later periods. 
11.1.6  Potential  Drug  Interactions:  Camostat  mesilate  did not appreciably inhibit 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (in vitro).

11.3 Remdesivir  (GS-5734, Veklury®) ) 
 
11.3.1  Background: Remdesivir is a nucleotide prodrug that is intracellularly 
metabolized into an analog of adenosine triphosphate that inhibits viral RNA 
polymerases and has broad  activity  against  members  of the filoviruses  [i.e. Ebola 
virus, Marburg virus, CoVs (SARS- CoV, MERS -CoV) and paramxoviruses 
(respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345], Nipha virus, and Hendra virus)]. 
11.3.2  Formulation: Remdesivir for Injection, 100 mg, is a preservative- free, white to 
off-white  or yellow lyophilized solid  containing 100 mg of remdesivir.  It requires 
reconstitution and then further dilution prior to administration by [CONTACT_5204]. The inactive ingredients are 3 g betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium and may include hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. 
 
 
Remdesivir injection contains 100 mg/20 mL (5 mg/mL) as a sterile, 
preservative- free, clear, colorless to yellow solution in a single -dose clear glass 
vial. It requires dilution prior to administration by [CONTACT_5204]. The inactive ingredients  are 6 g betadex  sulfobutyl ether  sodium,  Water  for Injection, 
USP, and may include hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH 
adjustment.  
11.3.3  Preparation  and storage:  Remdesivir  for Injection should be stored  refrigerated  at 
at 2˚C  to 8 ˚C [36 ˚F  to 46 ˚F] prior to use.  
 
There are differences in the way the two formulations are prepared. 
Carefully  follow  the product -specific preparation instructions  below. 
Remdesivir for Injection 100 mg lyophilized powder is to be reconstituted with 19 mL of Sterile Water for  Injection. Immediately shake the vial for  30 seconds. 
Allow the contents of the vial to settle for 2 to 3 minutes. A clear, colorless to 
yellow solution,  free of visible  particulates,  should results.  If the contents are not 
completely dissolved, repeat the process of shaking for 30 seconds and allowing 
contents to settle for 2  to 3 minutes. Following reconstitution, each vial contains 
5 mg/mL remdesivir concentrated solution with sufficient volume to allow 
withdraw of 20 mL (100 mg of remdesivir). 
 
Remdesivir should be diluted into 100 to 250 mL 0.9% NaCL prior to administration by [CONTACT_5204]. Invert 20 times to mix. Remdesivir for 
injection is recommended to be reconstituted and diluted within the same day as 
administration. The prepated infusion solution is stable for 24 hours at room temperature  (20°C to 25°C  [68°F to77°F]) or 48 hours at refrigerated  temperature 
(2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F]).Any unused remdesivir should be discarded. 
28 
28  
  
 
11.3.4  Administration:  Infuse intravenously over 30 minutes.  The infusion time may be 
extended up to 120 minutes. Flush the tubing with 30 mL of 0.9% NaCL post- 
remdesivir infusion.  
11.3.5  Pharmacokinetic information:  
 
Protein  binding:  Remdesivir:  88% to 93.6%; GS-441524: 2%; GS-704277: 1% 
Half -life elimination:  Remdesivir:  ~1 hour; GS-441524: 27 hours; GS704277:  
1.3 hours  
Excretion: Urine: Remdesivir: 10%; GS -441524: 49%; GS- 704277: 2.9%; 
Feces:  Remdesivir: not detected;  GS-441524: 0.5%; GS-704277: not detected  
 
11.3.6  Potential  Drug  Interactions:  Due to potential  antagonism  based  on data from  cell 
culture experiments, concomitant use of remdesivir with chloroquine phosphate 
or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended.  
Drug -drug interaction  trials  have not been  conducted in humans. Remdesivir  and 
its metabolites are in vitro substrates and/or inhibitors of certain drug 
metabolizing enzymes and transporters. The clinical relevance of these 
assessments has not been established.  
11.3.7  Known  potential toxicities:  
 
Common known  potential  toxicities  ≥ 10%:  
Endocrine & metabolic:  Increased  serum  glucose 
Renal: Decreased creatinine clearance  
 
Less common  known potential  toxicities  1-10%:

13.0 Statistical  Considerations  and Methodology  
 
13.1 Statistical  Design  
 
The study design will be a randomized (1:1 ratio), double- blinded, placebo- controlled 
phase II  trial of  264 patients. Randomization will be stratified  based on age (< 65 years 
versus >= 65 years) and disease severity at study entry (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647200]/severe disease). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy  of Camostat  mesilate  in addition to SOC  treatment  as compared  to 
SOC treatment combined with placebo with respect to clinical status on Day 28. The proportion of patients alive AND free from respi[INVESTIGATOR_226284] [ADDRESS_866482] 66 patients (33 treated in the 
treatment  arm and 33 in the control group)  have  completed  the 28 Day  assessment  period. 
Safety analyses will be done to assess occurrence of any differences in adverse events between the treatment arms.  A second interim analysis will occur after 132 patients (66 
in the treatment arm and 66 in the control group) have completed the [ADDRESS_866483] to accrue approximately 20 patients a week  across the clinical trial sites. With 
a total sample  size of 264 and a follow -up duration of 56 days for all  patients,  accrual  will 
require approximately 14 weeks with a total study duration of 22 weeks. The primary 
endpoint will be evaluable after 28 days of follow-up in all patients. 
13.3 Study Endpoints  
 
13.3.1  Primary  Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint will be evaluated based on the number of patients who are alive AND free from respi[INVESTIGATOR_226284] 28 after study entry divided by [CONTACT_647235]. A respi[INVESTIGATOR_647201] 12.0. 
13.3.2  Secondary Endpoints  
 
1.  Proportion of patients alive AND free of ventilator use or ECMO at Day 28: The 
proportion will be evaluated  based  on the number of patients  who are alive  AND free of 
ventilator use or ECMO (clinical status score of 5 or less) at Day 28 after study entry 
divided by [CONTACT_647236]. 
2.  Time to death:  Time  to death  will be measured  as the number of days from  the date  of 
randomization/study entry  until death  date.  Deaths  due to any cause  will be considered  an 
[ADDRESS_866484] to follow -up or withdraws from the study early, or doesn’t experience a 
death event, they will be censored at Day 28. 
3.  Time to clinical improvement: Clinical improvement will be defined as a 2 or more 
point decrease on the WHO ordinal scale (see Section 12.0). Time to clinical 
improvement will be calculated  as the number of  days from  study  entry  until the earliest 
date of clinical improvement as defined above. The number of patients who achieve clinical improvement by [CONTACT_2006] 14 and 28 will be evaluated. In addition, time to clinical improvement will also be assessed.  
4.  Clinical status  at Days  14 and 28: Evaluation of the distribution  of clinical  status 
scores by [CONTACT_647237] 14 and 28. 
5.  Length of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647202]:  This will be defined  as the time from  randomization/ 
study entry until the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Time in the ICU will be described in 
number of days spent receiving ICU care, if applicable.  
6.  Duration of Mechanical  ventilation  / ECMO:  Ventilator  / ECMO  days will be defined 
as the number of days where the clinical status score is equal to [ADDRESS_866485] a baseline score of 6-7 at study entry. Total  number of days will be the sum of 
all reported days, regardless of whether the days occur consecutively or in disjoint 
intervals.  
 
7.  Duration of non-invasive ventilation  / high-flow oxygen: Non-invasive ventilation  / 
high-flow oxygen days will be defined as the number of days where the clinical status score is equal to 5 for those with a baseline score of 5 at study entry. Total number of 
days will be the sum of all reported days, regardless of whether the days occur 
consecutively or in disjoint intervals. 
 
8.  Days  of supplemental  oxygen use: Oxygen days will be defined  as the number of days 
where the clinical status score is equal to [ADDRESS_866486] a clinical status score 
greater than or equal to 4 at study entry. Total number of days will be the sum of all reported days, regardless of  whether the days occur consecutively  or in disjoint  intervals.  
 
9.  Occurrence of adverse events related  to treatment:  Adverse  Events  will be recorded 
and graded according to CTCAE version 5.0 criteria. Occurrence of grade 3 or higher 
adverse events and SAEs will be assessed between arms.  
10.  Development of thrombosis / bleeding complications: Incidence of arterial and 
venous thrombosis or bleeding  complications will be described  in both treatment  groups. 
 
 
13.3.3  Exploratory Endpoint(s)  
 
1. Time to Viral Clearance:  Viral clearance will be assessed at days 1, 7, 14, 28, 56 after 
study entry  and the proportion of patients  having viral clearance  at each of these  days will 
be estimated as the proportion of patients who are documented as having non- detectable  
32 
32  
  
 
viral shedding  divided by [CONTACT_647238]. Serum  and 
nasopharyngeal assays will be used for this analysis.  
13.4 Planned Analyses  
 
Primary  Analysis  
 
Frequency distributions  and chi-square tests will be used to screen  for major  imbalances 
in the two randomization groups for qualitative variables; graphical displays including 
box plots and summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, ranges, etc.) 
will be used for quantitative variables with t -tests (after appropriate transformations if 
necessary to meet the assumptions of the methods).  
 
The primary outcome will include the number of patients who are alive AND free from respi[INVESTIGATOR_226284] [ADDRESS_866487] 
for proportions and a 95% confidence interval will be constructed for the difference 
between arms. Proportions will also be compared using 
Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel tests, 
including the stratification factors of age and baseline disease severity. Multivariable 
logistic regression models will be used to assess the influence of treatment while 
controlling for covariates of interest (gender, symptom onset, comorbidities) along with 
stratification factors.  Primary analysis for this efficacy outcome will include all 
participants who are randomized and received at least [ADDRESS_866488] of making 
different assumptions about the missing observations. 
 
Interim  analyses : Two interim  analyses  will be conducted  after 25% and 50% of patients 
have completed the 28 day study period. The interim analysis will include the below 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_647203] a Lan-DeMets spending function with O’Brien -Fleming boundaries. Occurrence of adverse events will also be evaluat ed at the 
interim analysis.

13.5 Secondary Analyses  
 
1.  Proportion of patients alive AND free of ventilator use / ECMO at Day 28:  The 
proportion will be evaluated  based  on the number of patients  who are alive  AND free of 
[ADDRESS_866489] for proportions and a 95% confidence interval will be 
constructed for the difference between groups. The Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel test will 
be used to include stratification  factors.  Multivariable  logistic  regression  models  will be 
used to assess the influence of treatment arm on while adjusting for other factors of interest.  
2.  Time to death and Mortality rate: The Kaplan -Meier method will be used evaluate 
differences in the distributions of time- to-death between treatment arms. Rates of 
mortality at day [ADDRESS_866490].  
3.  Time to clinical improvement: Time to clinical improvement will be evaluated using 
Kaplan -Meier  methods and Cox regression  models. Rates of clinical  improvement at days 
[ADDRESS_866491] reached day 14 and 28; no clinical improvement at day [ADDRESS_866492] ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated by [CONTACT_647239]- hazards model.  
Covariates of interest will be included in regression models.  
 
4.  Clinical status at Days 14 and 28: The distribution of the clinical status will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_647240] 14 and 28. A proportional odds model with treatment arm and disease  severity  at baseline  as covariates will be used to evaluate whether the odds of 
improvement on the ordinal scale are higher for the treatment arm as compared to  
control.  
 
5.  Length of Stay:  Length of stay will be defined as the time from study entry until the 
time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647204]-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The proportions of patients 
who require an ICU admission will be compared between randomized groups by [CONTACT_647241] Z-test for proportions and a 95% confidence interval will be 
constructed for the difference between groups. In addition, time in the ICU will be 
described in number of days spent receiving ICU care, if applicable. 
6.  Duration of Mechanical  ventilation  / ECMO:  Duration  of ventilator  / ECMO  use will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_647242] a baseline 
score of 6 -7 at study entry. 
 
7.  Duration of non-invasive ventilation / high-flow oxygen: Duration of non-invasive 
ventilation  / high-flow oxygen will be summarized  by [CONTACT_647243] a clinical status score of 5 at study entry. 
34 
34  
  
 
8.  Duration of supplemental oxygen use: Duration of supplemental oxygenation use will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_647244] a clinical 
status score greater than or equal to 4 at study entry.  
 
9.  Occurrence of adverse events related  to treatment:  Analyses for safety  will include  all 
participants who are randomized and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. 
Participants will be grouped according to the treatment to which they were randomized. Events will be summarized  on the basis of the date  of onset  for the event. The maximum 
grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient. Frequency tables 
of adverse events will be constructed based on maximum grade for each treatment arm. 
Overall adverse event rates, rates of grade 3 or higher events and serious adverse events will be compared between treatment groups using Chi- square or Fisher’s exact test.  
10.  Development  of thrombosis / bleeding complications: Incidence of arterial  and 
venous thrombosis or bleeding complications will be described and compared by 
[CONTACT_647245] -square or Fisher’s exact test.  
 
Subgroup analyses  for the primary and  secondary analyses will  examine  the treatment 
effect  across  the following subgroups of interest.  Forest  plots  with odds ratio and 95% 
confidence intervals will be presented along with interaction tests. 
 
• Duration of symptoms  prior to enrollment:  <= Median  versus > Median  number of 
days, • Comorbidities,  presence of Hypertension/CHF/COPD/coronary artery  disease:  Yes 
versus No,  
• Age:  <65 versus >= 65 years,  
• Sex: Female  versus  Male,  
• Baseline severity  of disease:  Mild/moderate  versus  Severe disease 
Exploratory Analysis 
Time  to Viral  Clearance:  Viral  clearance will be assessed  at days 1,7, 14, [ADDRESS_866493] to follow -up or withdrawal  from  the 
study prior  to Day  28 and prior  to observing/experiencing the event  will be censored  at 
the time of their last observed assessment.  
 
For duration of non- invasive ventilation/high -flow oxygen, ventilation/ECMO or 
supplemental oxygen, subjects will be considered to have the event  of interest  until Day 
[ADDRESS_866494] been readmitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
13.6 Sample  Size 
 
Randomization will be done according to a 1:1 ratio. Based on data from Wang et al(9) , 
82% of patients treated with Remdesivir were alive and free from respi[INVESTIGATOR_402786] 28. In the preliminary report of Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in 1059 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], approximately 70% of patients treated with Remdesivir we re alive 
and free from  respi[INVESTIGATOR_628607]  15; Day  28 data are not yet available
(12). Using  an 
expected proportion of 80% for the SOC control arm, this study would require 132 
patients in each arm (total of 264 patients). Sample sizes of 132 in each arm achieves 
80% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 12% for the primary 
endpoint. The proportion in the treatment arm is assumed to be 80% under the null 
hypothesis and 92% under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in the SOC arm is 
80%. The test statistic used is the two -sided Z -Test with unpooled variance. The 
significance level of the test is 0.05 (two -sided).  
 
13.7 Data  & Safety  Monitoring  
 
The study  chair(s)  and the study statistician  will review  the study every  week  to identify 
accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be formed to monitor the conduct of this study 
and for reviewing safety data. 
The DSMB will be comprised of disease experts who are not investigators or involved 
with the study. The DSMB  will review  the study safety  data and interim analysis  based 
on reports provided by [CONTACT_647246]. 
Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_647205]. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_647206]. 
We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in 
consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because 
of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. 
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events 
considered  at least possibly related  to study treatment  (i.e. an adverse event  with  attribute 
specified as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy the following:  
 
•  If [ADDRESS_866495] 10, or 30% or more of patients  thereafter  (in either 
treatment arm) experience a grade [ADDRESS_866496] 
possibly related to study treatment.

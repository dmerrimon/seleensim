Date: 9/6/2018  Page 3 Background and Rationale 
The number  of attention -deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  diagnoses  has increased  
dramatically  in the last decade,  and methylphenidate (MPH)  – a common  medication for ADHD 
– is at risk of being  over-prescribed.  While  some  patients  experience  significant  symptom  
improvement  from MPH,  as many  as 90% of adults  discontinue use within  one year [1]. The 
clinical presentation of ADHD is heterogeneous,  and this heterogeneity  may arise  from 
differences  in the underlying  neurobiology  of ADHD  symptoms.  These symptoms  are believed 
to arise  from either  hypo- or hyperactive dopamine (DA) and/or  norepi[INVESTIGATOR_136277]. This 
etiological  complexity  presents  a challenge  in prescribing  appropriate medication to ADHD 
patients,  but patients  whose  behavioral problems  stem  from DA-ergic  deficits  may gain the most  
benefit  from MPH,  which  indirectly  increases  extracellular  DA in the brain.  However,  there  are 
no noninvasive tools  currently  available that can identify  DA dysfunction,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_545372]. This 
proposal  seeks  to refine  the clinical heterogeneity  of ADHD symptoms  based on a 
neurobiological  mechanism.  
ADHD has been proposed to consist of 2 subtypes,  one subtype consists of disordered 
thought  and action typi[INVESTIGATOR_545373],  and the other  subtype consists of 
decreased motivation  typi[INVESTIGATOR_545374] [ 2]. T here  is direct  evidence that decreased  
motivation in ADHD is specifically related to hypoactive DA function.  In particular,  trait 
motivation scores among  ADHD participants  positively  correlated with biological  markers  of DA 
function [ 3]. However,  obtaining  biological markers  of DA function is expensive,  invasive,  and 
not a feasible diagnostic  tool. There  are also some  well-established behavioral reinforcement  
deficits  of the motivation  subtype,  including failure  to delay  gratification,  impaired response to 
partial  schedules  of reinforcement,  and preference for small  immediate rewards  over larger  
delayed rewards.  However,  delay  discounting/aversion paradigms  have not been  directly  linked  
to DA function in ADHD [ 4], nor do they offer predictions  about  the underlying neurobiological  
mechanisms  of these behaviors.  An excellent  paradigm  of behavioral reinforcement  that 
provides  a theoretically -driven model  of DA function,  and has been  directly  linked  to DA 
function,  is the explore/exploit  trade- off. This paradigm  could be used  to characterize  ADHD 
subtypes  based on DA function;  however,  behavior  on this paradigm  has not yet been  
investigated in the context  of ADHD. 
The explore/exploit  trade -off is a decision between exploiting  a known source of reward 
versus  exploring  the environment  for a new source of reward with potentially  greater  value,  in 
order  to maximize  long-term reward.  This trade- off plays  a fundamental  role in survival  and 
many  species  have been  shown to follow  predictable rules  of reward maximization  [5]. DA 
regulates  the explore/exploit  trade -off by [CONTACT_545382]:  Diminished  DA biases  behavior  towards  exploitation of known rewards,  
whereas  enhanced DA favors  exploration [ 6]. Furthermore,  diminished DA increases  the 
sensitivity  to costs and/or  delays  associated  with obtaining  rewards,  which  is consistent  with the 
reward delay  aversion typi[INVESTIGATOR_545375].  Importantly,  trait- and 
state -based enhancement  of DA function has been shown to increase exploratory  behavior  [6-
8], suggesting that this behavior  could be modulated by [CONTACT_545383] (i.e., trait-based  hypoactive 
DA function)  and MPH  (i.e., state -based enhanced DA function).  
The explore/exploit  trade -off could have vital importance  to psychiatry  as a behavioral 
measure  of DA function  and predictor  of MPH  efficacy; however,  more  research is needed to 
establish the distribution of explore/exploit  behavior  among  ADHD patients  and healthy  controls,  
and to demonstrate  that explore/exploit  behavior  is sensitive  to changes  in brain DA function.  
This proposal  seeks to address  these  points  by [CONTACT_17801]  a paradigm  of explore/exploit

Inattention deficits,  in particular,  have been related  to trait motivation  [3] and will be the primary  
ADHD symptom  of interest.  The 6ABT  will be administered at baseline and during [ADDRESS_713651].  
Specific  Aims  
Aim 1: Relate  explore/exploit  behavior  to ADHD symptomatology.  
Hypothesis  1a: At screening,  nonmedicated ADHD  participants  will make  fewer  exploratory 
choices than controls.  
Hypothesis  1b: At screening,  the number  of exploratory  choices  among  nonmedicated  ADHD 
participants  will negatively  correlate  with inattention symptom  severity  and positively  correlate 
with trait motivation.  
Aim 2: Relate  explore/exploit  behavior  to dopamine function and medication efficacy  
Hypothesis  2a: At testing,  ADHD and control  participants  will make  more  exploratory  choices  
after MPH  compared  to placebo.  
Hypothesis  2b: At testing,  neurocognitive improvements  from placebo to MPH  among  ADHD 
participants  will negatively  correlate  with the number  of exploratory  choices  made  at screening.  
Study  Design and Procedures 
Overview:  This study  has a mixed  between- and within -subject  design.  Participants  are 
young  adults  (aged 18-45) with ADHD and non-ADHD matched  controls.  They  will be recruited 
from locations  around  the community,  consented,  screened  for eligibility,  then scheduled for [ADDRESS_713652]  48 hours  apart.  Thus,  there  will be a total of 3 lab visits  
across  a 3 week  period.  Participants  will be administered 40 mg methylphenidate (MPH)  on one 
study  day and placebo on the other  study  day. They  will complete a battery  of 
cognitive/behavioral tasks  and answer  questionnaires  on both study  days.  
Recruitment/Screening:  We will advertise on internet,  flyers,  and in the newspapers  for 
volunteers  for the study.  Participants  who qualify  over the phone  and are interested in 
participating  will be scheduled for further  screening at the study  site. We are submitting  a HIPAA 
Waiver  for the purposes  of conducting  this phone  screen.  The informed consent  and screening 
session will last approximately  3 hr. All aspects  of the study  will be described and informed  
consent  will be obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_545376].  Breath and urine  samples  will be 
collected in order  to screen for drug use and recent  alcohol  use. Women  of child-bearing 
potential  will undergo urine  pregnancy  testing.  Detailed  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  are described 
below  in the Study  Population section.  ADHD participants  will meet  DSM -IV criteria  for a primary  
diagnosis  of ADHD. The non-ADHD group will be age, education level,  and sex matched to the 
ADHD group  by [CONTACT_545384] . 
During  the informed consent  process  and prior to participation,  participants  will be 
informed  that they will receive drugs  that are commonly  used to treat ADHD (i.e MPH)  and/or  
placebo.  Participants  will be told that the purpose  of the study  is to measure the effects  of 
stimulants  used  to treat ADHD and to see how these  drugs  affect mood and behavior.  Other  
than receiving  this general  information  about  MPH  versus  placebo,  participants  will be unaware 
Title:  MOBE  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_545371] #: 5 
Date: 9/6/2018  Page 5 of the type of drug administered.  Participants  will be given  no instructions  regarding what  they 
are “supposed”  to do or what  outcomes  might  be expected.  
As part of the screening,  all participants  will undergo  standardized diagnostic  procedures  
for ADHD,  including the Conners  Adult  ADHD Rating  Scales  to assess  ADHD  status  (all 
participants)  and the Conners  Adult  ADHD Diagnostic  Interview  for DSM  (prospective ADHD 
participants  only) . Participants  will be administered the MINI  International  Neuropsychiatric  
Interview  to assess the presence of other  Axis I disorders.  The ADHD diagnostic  interview  will 
be administered by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_545377],  under  the supervision of 
the study  physician.  The MINI  will be administered by [CONTACT_45822]  [INVESTIGATOR_545378].  Any answers  given  by [CONTACT_545385] I 
disorder  will be further  reviewed  by [CONTACT_7536].  
Participants  will also complete a physical  examination of their vital signs  (height,  weight,  
pulse,  blood pressure)  and complete a medical  history  to screen for contraindications  for MPH  
administration.  The participants  will also complete a drug use history  interview.  This exam,  
medical,  and drug use history  will be overseen by [CONTACT_7536].  The study  physician will 
follow -up with questions  about  family  history  of heart  disease or other  illnesses  as necessar y. 
Study  days:  Participants  who meet  all eligibility  criteria  will complete baseline behavioral 
tasks (see below)  and some  questionnaires,  and will then be scheduled for their 2 study  days.  
Each  study  day will be scheduled at the same  time of day (either  morning or afternoon).  
Participants  scheduled for the morning  session will be asked  to skip breakfast,  participants  
scheduled for the afternoon  session will be asked  to skip lunch.  A small  meal  will be provided 
(e.g.,  2 granola bars and a fruit cup) for all participants  after capsule administration.  On each  
study  day, participants’  blood pressure and pulse will be measured  and they will fill out a mood  
questionnaire (Positive  and Negative  Affect  Schedule:  PANAS) . Women  will provide a urine 
sample for a urine  pregnancy  test due to potential  increased  risks of stimulant  drug 
administration.  Women  who return a positive  pregnancy  test will be excluded from further  
participation and will meet  with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_545379]. 
Participants  who continue to meet  eligibility  criteria  will be administered  40 mg immediate-
release MPH  (MPH  IR, Ritalin,  [COMPANY_001])  or a matching placebo with 8oz of water  using  a 
double- blind,  counterbalanced design.  Participants  will sit quietly  in a private waiting  room  while  
the drug is absorbed  and eat the provided m eal.  After  60 min, participants  will be administered a 
battery  of behavioral tasks.  Then,  participants  will complete  questionnaires  regarding  mood,  
side-effects,  and drug effects. Additional measurements  of blood pressure  and pulse will be 
taken  approximately  every 60 min after capsule administration  and before  participants  are 
dismissed (4x per study  day).  Each  study  day will last approximately  3 hours.  
Behavioral  Tasks:  
Bandit  Task.  Participants  are shown a computer  screen with [ADDRESS_713653]  decide 
whether  to continue to exploit  the current  machine,  or explore other  machines.  This task takes  
approx imately 15 minutes to complete.  
Patchy  Foraging Task.  Subjects  choose  between 2 targets  on each  trial. Choosing  to 
stay in the current  patch yields  a short  delay  (0.5 s) and reward whose value diminishes  on 
each trial. Choosing  to leave  the patch yields  no reward and a long delay  (travel  time)  whose 
duration is indicated on screen while  participants  make  their selection.  Choosing  this option 
resets  the value of the current  patch.  This task takes  8 min to complete.  
Title:  MOBE  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_545371] #: 5 
Date: 9/6/[ADDRESS_713654]  Task  (EffRT). This task measures  effort- based decision 
making.  On each  trial, participants  choose  between two different  task difficulty  levels  to obtain 
monetary  rewards.  For all trials,  participants  make repeated manual  button  presses  within  a 
short  amount  of time.  Each  button press  raises  the level of a “bar”  viewed onscreen.  If the bar is 
raised to the top within  the allotted time period,  the participants  wins the points  for that trial. 
Each  trial offers  a choice  between two levels  of difficulty:  a “hard”  task and an “easy”  task.  Hard  
task trials  required  the subject  to make  [ADDRESS_713655]  
task trials  could earn between 1.24 and 4.30 points.  However,  the probability  of earning the 
points  for successful task completion is 88%,  50%,  or 12%.  The probability  of earning points  is 
indicated onscreen  at the start of each  trial. At the end of each  trial, participants  are shown 
whether  they completed the task on time or not, and earned  the points  or not. Participants  have 
20 min to play as many  t rials  as they can. 
Motivated Memory  Task  (MMT): This task measures  the effects  of reward motivation on 
expectancy  violation  processing.  The design of this task is based  on the monetary  incentive 
delay  task and is described in detail  in Murty  & Adcock,  Enriched encoding:  Reward motivation  
organizes  cortical  networks  for hippocampal  detection of unexpected events  (Cerebral  Cortex  
2013).  Each  trial consists  of 3 phases:  1) a cue indicating whether  the participant  could earn a 
high ($2) or low ($0) reward,  2) a variable delay  during which  color  images  are flashed on the 
screen 10 or 11 times,  and 3) the formerly  color  image  is presented in grayscale (the target  
image),  which  signals  to the participant  to make  a speeded button  press  to earn a reward.  
During  phase 2: the color  images  are either  control  (all images  are identical)  or expectancy  
violation  trials,  in which  a novel  distractor  image  is presented among  the serial  presentation of a 
color  image.  During  phase 3: participants  will perform  a 2-alternative forced -choice recognition 
computerized memory  task for images  that constituted expectancy  violations  for both the high-
reward and low-reward trials.  This task takes  20 min. 
Conner’s  Continuous  Performance  Task  (CPT).  This task measures  sustained attention 
and inhibitory  control.  Subjects  are asked  to press  a space  bar on a computer  as letters  are 
sequentially  displayed on the computer  screen (unless  an “x” appears).  Subjects  are asked  to 
inhibit  their response  whenever  an “x” appears.  This task lasts approximately  15 minutes.  
The Spatial  Span consists of two parts:  Spatial  Span  Forward and Spatial  Span 
Backward.  For each part, the examiner  taps a series  of cubes  at the rate of about  one cube per 
second.  Following  presentation,  the examinee either  taps the cubes  in the same  order  as the 
examiner  (Spatial  Span  Forward)  or in reverse  order  (Spatial  Span Backward).  For both Spatial  
Span Forward and Spatial  Span Backward,  the test begins  with series  of two cubes  and 
continues  to a maximum  of eight  cubes.  Examinees  are given  two trials  at each series  length,  
and the test continues  until both trials  of a series  length  are failed.  One point  is awarded for 
each trial the examinee answers  correctly.  The maximum  possible score for the Spatial  Span 
subtest  is 32 ([ADDRESS_713656]).  This task takes  up to [ADDRESS_713657] (ANT).  This test measures  different  types  of attention.  At the start 
of each  trial, a cue is displayed onscreen followed  by [CONTACT_545386]  (i.e., horizontal  arrows).  
There  are four cue conditions  and three  flanker  conditions.  The task on each  trial is to classify 
the central  arrow  as either  pointing  left or right.  Participants  respond  using  the computer  
keyboard.  This task lasts [ADDRESS_713658]  that requires  less effort  to obtain.  During  
Title:  MOBE  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_545371] #: 5 
Date: 9/6/[ADDRESS_713659] (between $0 and $20, available for no effort),  and a larger  reward requiring  effort  to 
obtain ($20,  available after typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a number  of words  backward).  The monetary  value of the 
smaller  reward and the effort  (i.e., number  of words)  required to obtain the larger  reward will be 
systematically  varied across  the series  of choices  in order  to determine the participant’s  
indifference  point  (i.e., the point  at which  the larger  reward is no longer  “worth  it” to work  for, and 
the preference  switches  to the smaller  amount.  Participants  will be presented with each pair of 
options  on a computer  screen and will make  their selections  with a button press.  Before  
beginning the task,  participants  will first type [ADDRESS_713660].  The task takes  about  15 minutes  to complete and will only be administered  during  
the Screening/Baseline Day.

Study  Interventions  
Drug  administration : Ritalin  will be used to provide methylphenidate (MPH)  in the 
methylphenidate condition.  MPH  is a mild central  nervous  system stimulant  that blocks  
dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_135421].  Ritalin  was approved by [CONTACT_545387].  In the 
central  nervous  system, 40 mg IR MPH  results  in a peak  dopamine transporter  receptor  
occupancy  (at approximately  70%)  between 1-3 hours  after ingestion.  This 40mg IR dose of 
methylphenidate has been administered to healthy  adults  previously  by [CONTACT_545388] [ 10-13]. 
The UAMS  pharmacy  facility  will prepare the MPH  and placebo capsules  for the study.  The 
matching placebos  will contain lactose.  The drug and placebo capsules  will look identical,  
except  the base of the bottles  will be marked with two different  letters , one denoting  the MPH  
capsules  and the other  the placebo capsules.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_545380],  and will therefore  be able to identify  which  capsule was used if there  
Title:  MOBE  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_545371] #: 5 
Date: 9/6/[ADDRESS_713661]  with the participants  during the experimental visits.  The MPH  and placebo 
capsules  will not be given  to participants  to take home.  These two products  will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_545389].  
Questionnaires  evaluating both participant  and experimenter  judgments  about  the capsule 
condition will be acquired.  Should a participant  report  severe side effects  associated with a high 
dose of MPH  (e.g.,  nausea,  headache)  they will be reminded of their right to withdraw  from the 
study.  Any reports  of unexpected or severe side-effects  will be logged and reported to the IRB 
as adverse effects. Heart  rate, blood pressure,  and side-effects  will be measured approximately  
every  60 min after drug administration  and prior to dismissal. 
Compensation: No compensation is provided for the phone screen  or the screening session 
(including  consenting,  drug screening,  medical  exam,  drug use history , CAARS  questionnaire,  
and MINI ). Prospective participants  who undergo the CAADID interview  will be compensated  
$10/hour . Participants  who are eligible  for the study  will receive $45 for the baseline visit and 
$100 for completing  each  study  day. In addition,  participants  can earn up to $15 on the baseline 
day and up to $20 on each  study  day based  on behavioral  task performance.  Thus,  the total 
compensation for completing all parts  of the study  will be $245-300. Participants  that decide to 
withdraw  from the study  before  completion will be compensated  $20/hour  of participation on a 
pro-rated basis  for the part(s)  of the study  that they have completed.  
Study  Population  
We propose to obtain consent  from 150 individuals  in order  to find 80 eligible  
participants  and obtain useable data from 60 participants  (30 per group).  Prospective 
participants,  ages  18-45, will be recruited from the surrounding area. During  an initial phone 
screen,  they will be given  a brief description of our studies  and will be asked  questions  to 
determine interest  and eligibility.  
Inclusion criteria  for all subjects : 
1) Capable of informed consent  and able to complete all aspects  of the study.  
2) between the ages  of 18-45 
negative urine drug screen for drugs  (other  than those allowed for depression or anxiety)  
and negative breath alcohol  concentration  
Inclusion criteria  for non-ADHD subjects:  
1) do not meet  criteria  for ADHD diagnosis  or any subtype as determined by [CONTACT_545390]  (CAARS)  T-Score  < 55 on Inattentive  Symptoms,  Hyperactive-
Impulsive  Symptoms,  Total  Symptoms  or ADHD Index  subscales  of the CAARS.  
Inclusion criteria  for ADHD subjects  
1) meet  criteria  for a primary  diagnosis  of ADHD,  any subtype,  based on the Conners  Adult  
ADHD Diagnostic  Interview  for DSM -IV and the CAARS.  
Exclusion  criteria  for all subjects : 
1) inability  to attend  all required  experimental sessions 
2) significant  health  problems  (e.g.,  current  and uncontrolled liver,  lung,  or heart  problems,

10) hypertension (If subject  has blood pressure  over 140/90) 
Risks and Benefits  
Women of childbearing potential:  Due to unknown risks and potential  harm  to the unborn  fetus,  
women of child-bearing potential  will be screened with a urine pregnancy  test at the beginning  
of the study.  Positive  pregnancy  tests  are exclusionary.  At each study  day visit, urine pregnancy  
tests  will be administered.  
Undiagnosed ADHD: We will provide comprehensive feedback  to subjects  who have 
undiagnosed ADHD. Appropriate  referrals  will be provided when necessary.  
Methylphenidate Administration:  The most  salient  risk to participants  will be the possibility  of 
side effects  of the MPH.  The most  commonly  reported  side effects  of MPH  have been 
headache,  decreased  appetite,  stomach  ache,  nervousness,  trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  and nausea.  
MPH  is not recommended for people with certain conditions  or taking  some  medications.  
MPH  should not be taken  if the person  is very anxious,  tense,  or agitated;  has glaucoma;  has 
tics or Tourette’s  syndrome,  or a family  history  of Tourette’s  syndrome;  is taking  or have taken 
within  the past 14 days  an anti-depression medicine called  a monoamine  oxidase inhibitor  or 
MAOI;  or is allergic  to any of the inactive  ingredients  found in Ritalin  (D&C Yellow  No.10,  
lactose,  magnesium  stearate,  polyethylene glycol,  sucrose, talc, and tragacanth).  
MPH  use should be supervised by a doctor  if the patient  is taking  any of these 
medications:  anti-depression medicines  including MAOIs;  seizure medicines;  blood thinner  
medicines;  blood  pressure medicines;  and cold or allergy  medicines  that contain decongestants  
(information  from http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm089090.pdf).  
It is important  to note that we will collect  subjective effects  data and vital signs  
throughout  all experimental  sessions  and subjects  will be discontinued from the protocol  if 
significant  adverse events  occur. Moreover,  the study  physician will carefully  screen participants  
for eligibility,  including  health and medication  history,  and will be on site or on call during  all 
visits  and can be consulted regarding  AE’s if they arise.  Based on experience among our 
research  team,  we do not anticipate significant  side events.  
During  t he  study,  the study  physician ([CONTACT_174983])  will be notified if there  is an increase  in 
pulse by [CONTACT_56944] 20 beats  per minute  from that day’s  baseline (i.e., vitals  taken upon  arrival),  
or if the pulse is greater  than 120 beats  per minute and the blood pressure is greater  than 
140/90,  or if the participant  complains  of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814].  If these  symptoms  occur  or persist at the 
end of the study  visit, the participant  may be asked  to remain  in the lab for monitoring.  The 
participant  will be released or referred for treatment  per [CONTACT_174983]’ decision.  
Placebo Administration:  Placebo capsules  will contain powdered lactose  to match  the color  and 
consistency  of the methylphenidate capsules.  Lactose is a sugar  found in milk and dairy  
products.  People  who are lactose  intolerant  may experience gas, abdominal  pain,  diarrhea,  and 
bloating  after ingesting  lactose.  People who are allergic  to lactose  may experience these  
Title:  MOBE  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_545371] #: 5 
Date: 9/6/2018  Page 10  symptoms  as well as swelling  of the lips or throat  and trouble breathing.  For these reasons,  
people who self-report  having  lactose allergies  will not be eligible  for participation.  
Costs  to subjects:  Subjects  will not incur  any costs associated  with participating in the study.  All 
the study  costs, including any procedures  related  directly  to the study,  will be paid for by [CONTACT_10748].  
Confidentiality:  There  is a potential  risk of loss of confidentiality.  Measures  to protect  the 
confidentiality  of study  participants  will be implemented as described in the Data  Handling  and 
Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_147414].  
Benefits:  There  will be no direct  benefits  to the study  participants;  however,  knowledge gained 
from the study  could potentially  benefit  patients  in the future.  
Data  Handling and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_545381], the quality  of the data and the integrity  of the study.  All study  subject  material  
will be assigned a unique identifying  code  or number.  The key to the code  will be kept in a 
locked  file in the principal  investigator’s  office.  Only the study  coordinator  will have access to the 
code and information that identifies  the subject  in this study.  At the conclusion of the study,  the 
data will be permanently  de-identified and retained for seven years  after final reporting or 
publication of the project.  
Data  Analysis 
We base  our sample  sizes  on previous  studies  that have found  within - and between- group 
differences  with sample  sizes  ranging  from 20 to 30 subjects.  Based  on a previous  study  [9], we 
will be adequately  powered to detect  at significant effects  with this sample size. The goal of this 
preliminary  study  is to collect  data to perform  power  analyses  for a larger  project.  The primary  
variable of interest  is exploratory  performance  on the Bandit  task.  Behavior  and self-report  data 
will be analyzed using  SPSS (Chicago,  Ill), with significance set to alpha = .05. We plan to 
compare  ADHD symptomatology  and behavioral performance across all subjects  using  Pearson  
correlations,  and to compare performance  between groups  using  independent -samples  t-tests. 
The interaction between within -subject  differences  in performance  between MPH  and placebo 
and between- subject  differences  in ADHD status  will be investigated using  a mixed -design 2x2 
ANOVA.  
Ethical  C onsiderations  
This study  will be conducted in accordance  with all applicable government  regulations  and 
University  of Arkansas  for Medical  Sciences  research policies  and procedures.  This protocol  
and any amendments  will be submitted  and approved by [CONTACT_545391] 
(IRB)  to conduct  the study.  
The formal  consent  of each  subject,  using  the IRB-approved consent  form,  will be obtained 
before  that subject  is submitted to any study procedure. All subjects  for this study  will be 
provided a consent  form describing this study  and providing  sufficient information in language  
suitable for subjects  to make  an informed  decision  about  their participation in this study.  The 
person obtaining consent  will thoroughly  explain each element  of the document  and outline  the 
risks and benefits,  alternate treatment(s),  and requirements  of the study.  The consent  process  
will take place  in a quiet  and private room,  and subjects  may take as much  time as needed to 
make  a decision about their participation. Participation  privacy  will be maintained and questions  
regarding  participation will be answered. No  coercion or undue  influence will be used in the 
consent  process.  This consent  form must  be signed  by [CONTACT_423],  and the individual  obtaining  
the consent.  A copy  of the signed  consent  will be given  to the participant,  and the informed

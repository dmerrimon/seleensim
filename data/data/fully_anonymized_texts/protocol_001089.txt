Background : Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disease of the central nervous 
system that affects over 2.[ADDRESS_400151] been 
shown to improve quality of life, balance and fatigue in a variety of chronic conditions.2–[ADDRESS_400152] of these practices 
specifically for people with MS.9   
 
Objective : The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of weekly community 
qigong classes for people with MS. A secondary goal is to test the effect of weekly community 
qigong classes on quality of life, balance, and gait for people with MS.   
 
Participants and Design : In this non-blinded randomized controlled feasibility trial, twenty 
adults with any type of MS will be randomized to either a qigong intervention (n=10) or wait-list 
control group (n=10). The intervention group will participate in 60-to-[ADDRESS_400153] a class that is geographically convenient and fits their schedule.  This 
pragmatic design maximizes external validity by [CONTACT_324149]. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment, adherence to 
the qigong intervention, and ability to participate.  Secondary outcomes include validated 
measures of quality of life (PROMIS, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale), balance (the Four

Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400154]), gait (the MS Walking Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and Timed-up and 
Go), and fatigue (PROMIS, Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) collected at baseline and 10 weeks. 
 
Results from this trial will provide preliminary data to seek future funding for a fully powered 
randomized controlled trial of qigong and MS. 
 
A. SPECIFIC AIMS 
 
Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of weekly community qigong classes for people with any type of 
MS. Specific feasibility outcomes include (1) ability to recruit and enroll participants with MS; 
(2) adherence to the intervention protocol as measured by [CONTACT_324150]; 
and (3) ability of participants to take part in qigong exercises.  
 
Aim 2: Assess the ability of weekly community qigong classes (n=10) compared to wait-list 
control (n=10) to improve balance, mobility,  quality of life, and fatigue for people with MS. 
Validated outcome measures will be administered at baseline and immediately post-intervention 
and include quality of life (PROMIS, the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale), balance (the Four 
Square Step Test), gait (the MS Walking Scale, Timed 25-Foot Walk Test, and Timed-up and 
Go), and fatigue (PROMIS, Fatigue Severity Scale). 
 
Because this is a small feasibility study, the data collected are meant to be hypothesis-generating. 
Any clinically meaningful trends toward improvement will justify further exploration of qigong 
for MS. 
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder affecting the central nervous system.[ADDRESS_400155] been shown to slow 
the progression of the disease and help manage symptoms, although they often come with 
adverse side effects ranging from mild to severe (e.g., nausea, vomiting, hemorrhagic cystitis, 
and cancers).11,12 
B.1. SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE STAGES  
Multiple Sclerosis results in damage to the myelin sheath and nerve fibers of the central nervous 
system (CNS). Symptoms vary depending on where in the CNS the damage occurs.  Some of the 
 
 
Protocol Study Title: Qigong for MS 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Angela Senders 
IRB #: 102015 
Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400156] common symptoms of MS include vision problems, muscle weakness, gait dysfunction, 
poor balance, numbness and/or prickling sensations, bowel and bladder dysfunction, fatigue, 
dizziness, vertigo, sexual dysfunction, pain, depression, decreased memory, and decreased 
cognitive ability.13  
There are currently four identified courses of MS, each of which may appear in mild to severe 
form.  These include (1) Relapsing-Remitting; (2) Primary-Progressive; (3) Secondary-
Progressive; and (4) Progressive-Relapsing MS (Table 1).

B.2. EXERCISE AND MS 
Many clinical trials have investigated the relationship between MS and exercise.14–22 A recent 
systematic review by [CONTACT_324152]-Cheung and others found that people with mild-to-moderate 
disability from MS who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise two times per week benefitted 
from increased aerobic capacity and muscular strength.19  The authors also found that exercise 
may improve mobility, fatigue, and health-related quality of life for people with MS.19  Mayo et 
al. recommend that exercise programs for people with MS be “interesting, relevant to the 
individual, and easily implemented across a variety of settings.”21, (p. 2)  When comparing people 
with MS to people without MS, they found  that “people with MS expressed the need to feel safe 
and have clear professional instructions provided on proper techniques, intensity and 
duration .”21, (p.2) These findings suggest that exercise programs that are instructor-led, of

moderate intensity, allow adjustments to individual needs and restrictions, and are intellectually 
stimulating may be well-suited for people with MS. 
B.3. QIGONG 
Qigong is an ancient Chinese movement art developed to promote health, longevity and well-
being.  Qigong exercises often involve a combination of gentle movements, meditation, breath-
work and visualization.  Taiji (also known as tai chi or tai chi chuan), is similar to qigong but 
includes a martial art/self-defense component. Taiji has been described as a “complex multi-
component intervention integrating neuro-musculoskeletal training, breathing, and various 
cognitive strategies (e.g. imagery, focused attention), often embedded within a rich psychosocial 
framework”23 (p.4)  Both taiji and qigong are mind-body exercises commonly taught in structured 
classes.  Both are growing in popularity due to their reported health benefits, safety and low cost.  
    
A number of scientific studies have documented the health benefits of qigong and taiji.  Several 
clinical trials of qigong and/or taiji have found significant improvements in balance and gait, 
2,4,5,24,25 fatigue,6,7,8,26 and quality of life.8  Several studies of Parkinson’s disease found beneficial 
effects from taiji and/or qigong, including improved balance, mobility, sleep, health-related 
quality of life as well as reduced pain.3–[ADDRESS_400157] looked at the effects of qigong on 
fatigue, anxiety and depression in people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), showing 
improvements in these symptoms as a result of qigong practice, along with improved mental 
functioning and telomerase activity.6,7  Two recent studies evaluated the effects of qigong on 
pain reduction for people with fibromyalgia, finding significant improvements in pain, 
psychological health,  and physical function 27,28 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_324132], 
there has been very little published research on the effects of qigong and MS.  One pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
using a sample of 16 people with secondary progressive MS, found statistically significant 
improvements in depression and balance after two-months of one-on-one mindfulness 
taiji/qigong sessions (a total of 6 sessions).[ADDRESS_400158] of one-on-one training sessions may also limit its applicability in the 
real world.

C. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS   
 
C.1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 
 
The proposed randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_324133] (n=20) to attend community qigong classes once a week for 10 weeks.  The primary 
goal is to determine the feasibility of the study process (i.e., recruitment, retention, adherence, 
and pragmatic design).  The secondary aim is to assess effectiveness of qigong for people with 
MS, specifically looking at quality of life, balance, gait performance and fatigue.  Potential 
participants will undergo an initial telephone screening for eligibility, followed by [CONTACT_28920]-person 
visit in which they will review and sign an informed consent form, complete a demographic 
survey, complete the Timed-25-Foot-Walk Test to verify eligibility, and complete baseline 
outcome surveys and tests.  Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to the qigong 
intervention group or a wait-list control group.  The qigong group will be asked to attend [ADDRESS_400159] that they check at each class.  Qigong 
instructors will also keep track of attendance of all study participants.  
Those assigned to the control group will be asked to refrain from qigong, taiji or yoga during the 
10-week trial period.  Following the collection of outcome measures after 10 weeks, the control 
group participants will be given the opportunity to participate in a subsequent 10-week qigong 
intervention. Outcome measures will again be collected immediately after the 10-weeks of 
qigong for the wait-listed control group.  
We chose a pragmatic design to enable participants to 1) select an instructor and qigong style 
they prefer, 2) select a class that fits their schedule, 3) select a class location that is 
geographically accessible, and 4) immediately begin the qigong intervention without waiting for 
other participants to be recruited. We expect these pragmatic benefits to help with recruitment 
and retention of participants. Furthermore, this trial design maximizes external validity by 
[CONTACT_324153].    
 
C.2. SCREENING AND STUDY ACTIVITIES 
 
All study visits will take place at the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) Helfgott 
Research Institute, excluding qigong class, which will occur in separate locations throughout 
Portland.

Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400160] visit.  A standardized telephone script will be used to describe the study and 
determine eligibility.   (See Attachment 2 for copy of telephone script).   If the potential participant 
meets the initial eligibility criteria and agrees to be in the study, he/she will be assigned a study ID 
number and scheduled for Visit 1.   A copy of the consent form will be emailed or mailed to the 
participant for their review at least [ADDRESS_400161] will include 
a description of each qigong style and brief biography of each instructor.  
 
C.2.2. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
Study Visit 1: Screening and Baseline (Week 1 of the study) 
This study visit will take about 90 minutes.  Participants will be asked to do the following: 
 Review and sign consent form.  
 Complete the Timed-25-Foot-Walk Test (T25-FW) to verify eligibility (i.e., ability to 
walk 50 feet without assistive devices). 
 If participants are able to complete the complete T25-FW they will be asked to complete 
the Four Square Step Test, and the Timed-Up and Go.  
 Complete a demographic/physical activity/treatments/medications questionnaire to 
determine baseline conditions and potential covariates. 
 Complete medications log to document all medications/supplements that participant is 
currently taking. 
 Complete on-line surveys. 
 The study coordinator will review the list of qigong classes and instructors with the 
participant, and answer any questions he/she may have about the pre-vetted classes.  
Based on this discussion, participants will be asked to select a class they wish to attend if 
they are selected to be in the intervention group. 
 
Following Study Visit 1, participants will be randomly assigned to the qigong intervention or 
control group by a pre-established randomization scheme with a block size of four. Some qigong 
classes may not be available to join immediately, depending on the class schedule and number of 
participants already attending the class. Thus “Week 2” may not actually begin one week 
following Visit 1, but will begin once the chosen qigong class is able to accept the participant

Weeks 2-11 of the study  
 Participants assigned to the qigong group will attend one pre-vetted 60-90 minute 
community class per week for 10 weeks, and will be encouraged to practice at home.  
 The wait list control group will continue usual activities and care while refraining from 
any qigong, tai chi or yoga. 
 
Study Visit 2 (Week 12 of the study) 
This study visit will take about 60-90 minutes.  Participants will be asked to do the following: 
 Repeat the surveys completed at Visit 1.   
 Repeat the three physical tests completed at Visit 1. 
 Complete medication log follow-up to determine if there have been changes to 
medications/supplements since baseline. 
 Complete an exit questionnaire for those in the qigong group.  
 Wait-list control group members will be invited to join a new qigong group and 
participate in 10 weeks of qigong classes.   
 Wait list control group members who choose not to join the qigong group will be asked to 
complete an exit questionnaire at this visit.  
 
Study Visit 3 (Week 23 of the study – only for control group participants that continue with 
qigong) 
This study visit will take about 60-90 minutes.  Participants will be asked to do the following: 
 Repeat the surveys completed at Visit 1.   
 Repeat three physical tests completed at Visit 1. 
 Complete medication log follow-up to determine if medications have changed since Visit 
1 and 2. 
 Complete an exit questionnaire.

All qigong instructors will be asked to sign a Memorandum of Understanding indicating that 
they comply with the criteria listed above and agree to participate in this study. 
Prior to the beginning of the study, all instructors will participate in an orientation about teaching 
people with MS.  This orientation will include a discussion about their involvement in the study;  
understanding and recognizing common symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_324155]; ways to support 
participants; how to recognize a participant having difficulty or overextending; and how to 
handle adverse events.  
 
C.5. OUTCOME MEASURES FOR MS 
C.5.1. Feasibility Outcome Measures 
Feasibility outcome measures include (1) the ability to recruit and enroll participants with MS; 
(2) adherence to the intervention protocol as measured by [CONTACT_324150]; 
and (3) ability of participants to take part in qigong exercises.  The following table outlines the 
criteria that we will use to assess each of these feasibility outcome measures:

per month)  
Adherence to the Qigong 
Intervention Attendance at a minimum of [ADDRESS_400168]. Participants will track their home practice with a 
practice log that we will provide.  
Ability to Participate Participants will subjectively rate their ability to 
participate in the exit survey.  The student investigator 
will check-in with participants via phone during weeks 
1, 2, and 7 of the 10-week intervention and ask about 
ability to participate. We define “ability to participate” 
as how easily participants feel they can follow along in 
class (i.e., fully able to participate, partially able to 
participate, only a little or not at all).  Because qigong 
is a mind-body movement art, if participants are not 
physically able carry out a movement, they will be 
encouraged to visualize the movement.  This is a 
common practice in qigong.  Psychoneuroimmunology 
studies have shown physical benefits from 
visualization.30 Thus, we consider visualization to be a 
valid form of participation. We will ask participants to 
estimate the proportion of movements that are 
visualized (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) in the exit 
survey, and in their home practice log.   
  
C.5.2. Intervention-Based Outcome Measures 
The following measures were selected based on personal recommendations by [CONTACT_324156], the recommendations of the International Consensus Meeting for a core set of 
outcome measures for use in exercise studies in MS (ICM),31 and previous analyses of the 
 
1 We based this value on a meta-analysis of attrition and adherence rates for exercise 
interventions in which the authors found attrition ranging from 25-50% and an average 
adherence rate of 66%.40

C.5.2.a. Patient Self-Reported Surveys   
Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
Health related quality of life measures are commonly used to assess an individual’s current 
health status, often in relation to a specific disease or treatment, and include patient self-reporting 
measures of physical, emotional and social well-being. For this study, we selected the Patient 
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), a series of free, online, 
patient reported outcome surveys funded by [CONTACT_324157].  This system has 
the ability to perform computerized adaptive tests, which have been shown to reduce survey time 
while maintaining outcomes consistent with conventional surveys.  Senders et al. have validated 
its use for MS patients.32  These authors also found that in addition to providing outcomes that 
correlated highly with legacy surveys, the computerized adaptive tests required less time to 
complete (i.e., 4 minutes versus 15 minutes); reduced missing data; and provided automatic 
scoring that referenced the general population.32  For this study, we selected the following 
PROMIS instruments: global health, physical function, fatigue, anxiety and depression.  Based 
on the findings of Senders et al., completion of all five surveys took an average of [ADDRESS_400170] Scale (MSIS-29) 
 The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29) is a validated core outcome measure for quality 
of life in studies of exercise and MS.31  The MSIS-29 was developed in 2000 as a patient-
administered survey for MS, and includes 20 questions on physical impacts and 9 questions on 
psychological impacts of MS.33 Estimated time to complete: 10 minutes. 
 MS Walking Scale (MSWS-12) 
The MS Walking Scale is a 12-question survey of patient self-reported measure of impact of MS 
on walking ability.[ADDRESS_400171] reliability, internal

on balance and gait. Estimated time to complete: [ADDRESS_400172] Scale (MFIS 16) 
The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale35 has been recommended by [CONTACT_324158] a measure of energy 
and drive.  It is recommended over the Fatigue Severity Scale when conducting a multi-
dimensional assessment of fatigue.31  The survey consists of 21 questions that assess physical, 
cognitive and psychosocial aspects of fatigue.  Estimated time to complete: [ADDRESS_400173] (FSST) 
The Four Square Step Test is a test of a person’s ability to step over objects in four directions. It 
is a common measure of multidirectional mobility for people with MS. Originally developed by 
[CONTACT_324159] 2002, the FSST has been shown to be reliable, valid, easy to score and 
administer.[ADDRESS_400174] in size (Figure 1).  To reduce the risk 
of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_54139] a cane, we will substitute the canes with colored masking tape to delineate the 
squares. The participant starts by [CONTACT_324160] (Square 1) and facing Square 
2. The test starts with the participant steppi[INVESTIGATOR_324134] 2, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_324135] 3, 
steppi[INVESTIGATOR_324136] 4, steppi[INVESTIGATOR_324137] 1, and then moving back in the opposite order 
(4 to 3 to 2 to 1) while being timed. The participant will be allowed to practice this sequence 
once before being timed. He/she will then be asked to complete the sequence as fast as possible

Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25-FW) 
The Timed 25-Foot Walk is a reliable measure of walking ability and is regularly used as an 
outcome measure in studies of people with MS in relation to mobility.[ADDRESS_400177] reaches the end point, he/she 
is asked to turn around and walk back through the course, also while being timed.  Subjects are 
allowed to use devices such as crutches, canes and walkers if needed. The test generally takes 
one to five minutes to complete.  The score given for the test is an average of the time needed to 
complete each of the two trials.  The T25-FW has been shown to have a high inter-rater and test-
retest reliability, as well as good concurrent validity.38 Estimated time to complete: 2-5 minutes. 
Timed-Up and Go (TUG) 
The Timed-Up and Go is a test of muscle function and mobility.[ADDRESS_400178] begins with the participant sitting in an armchair with 
his/her back resting on the back of the chair and arms resting on the arms of the chair. The [ADDRESS_400179]

participant is then asked to stand up and walk 3 m at a comfortable and safe speed, turn around, 
walk back and return to a seated position.  The time that it takes to complete this exercise is then 
recorded.  Estimated time to complete: 2-[ADDRESS_400180] an equal number 
of participants.  Four people will be included in each block: two to the qigong intervention group 
and two to the control group. The creation of the allocation sequence and assignment of groups 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_324161]. Doug Hanes. As this is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the 
student researcher will not be blinded when administering the surveys and physical tests. 
Participants will not be blinded since the control group will not participate in qigong classes.  
 
D.7. DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
Data collected for this study will include basic demographic information (e.g., name, age, gender, 
race, marital status, employment status, number/age of children), as well as current medication use.  
Data will also be collected from validated surveys and physical tests.  All survey data (including 
the exit surveys and instructor surveys) will be administered through the Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) data management system.  Data from physical tests will manually be entered 
into REDCap.  Class attendance log information will be manually entered into REDCap.   
 
 
D.7. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
 
Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics for the feasibility outcomes, including mean 
number of enrollees per month, mean number of classes attended, mean number of hours of home 
practice per week, mean percent participation, and mean percent visualized movements.  For 
effectiveness outcomes, the primary analysis will involve comparing intervention versus control 
group outcome measures using either an independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric) 
test. Additional analyses will include comparing pre- and post-outcome measures for the 
intervention group, as well as comparing pre- and post-outcome measures among the intervention 
plus wait-list controlled intervention group. Analyses of pre/post measures will be done using a 
paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank (non-parametric) test (see Table 2).  In addition to testing for 
significant difference, we will also estimate effect sizes using Cohen’s d statistics, calculated for

either within-group changes with treatment or differences between treatment and control groups. 
Depending on the range of disability in the study, analyses may be stratified by [CONTACT_324162], 
based on disability questions included in the demographic survey.  We will also explore the 
correlation between number of classes attended plus hours of home practice and outcome 
measures.

D.8. POWER CALCULATION AND SAMPLE SIZE  
 
We calculated power for the exploratory analysis of PROMIS Quality of Life (QOL) scores. 
Yost et al. estimated minimally important differences ranging from [ADDRESS_400182] deviations for the PROMIS QOL mental and physical health 
summary scores from Senders et al.32 (4.00 and 3.06, respectively), we calculated that a total 
sample size of 16 (10 per group, minus 20% attrition) would provide 71% power to detect a 
mean increase of 5 in PROMIS QOL mental health and 90% power to detect a mean increase of 
5 in PROMIS QOL physical health. (Power calculated using the University of British Columbia, 
Department of Statistics calculator, http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/ .)

This study involves the use of questionnaires and surveys, physical tests, and an exercise 
intervention.  The following table lists the potential risks associated with this study and how 
each risk will be minimized or addressed:  
 
 Table 5. Potential risks and measures to minimize/address risks. 
Potential Risk How risk will be minimized/addressed 
Breach of confidentiality We will make every effort to protect against the loss of 
confidentiality.  All collection of participant personal information 
will comply with HIPAA regulations.  Confidentiality will be 
assured by (1) assigning each participant a unique identification 
number used in place of names for all study forms and data 
collected; (2) keepi[INVESTIGATOR_324138] a secure, locked file cabinet when not 
in use, which will be accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_324139]; (3) using secure, password protected databases 
REDCap and PROMIS and storing any other electronic data on 
the Helfgott shared drive in password protected folders; (4) 
having all study personnel complete HIPAA training; (5) 
ensuring that participants are not identified by [CONTACT_324163], nor are data presented in such a way that 
the identity of individual participants can be inferred.  
Questions posed in surveys 
and questionnaires may 
seem personal or 
embarrassing to 
participants. We will ensure that participants are made aware, in writing and 
verbally, that they do not need to answer any questions they do 
not feel comfortable answering.  This information will be 
conveyed during the review of the Consent Form, as well as 
when the survey is administered 
Participants may be injured 
during physical tests. All study visits and testing will be conducted by [CONTACT_324164], 
who will be trained to administer these tests.  Cinda Hugos, a 
PT and researcher specializing in MS at OHSU has agreed to 
help train Lita Buttolph on how to administer the physical tests. 
[CONTACT_324170] is also familiar with these tests and can help with 
training.  Lita will ensure that participants are well aware of 
what is required for the test.  She will also allow participants to 
practice a given test prior to timing.  If a participant requires 
additional spotting assistance during the physical test, a testing 
assistant (either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained student assistant) will be

IRB #: 102015 
Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400183] the option of sitting or 
standing during each class.  Qigong instructors will receive an 
orientation prior to the start of the study about working with 
MS patients, including understanding and recognizing common 
symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_324155]; ways to support 
participants; how to recognize a participant having difficulty or 
overextending; and how to handle adverse events.  The qigong 
instructors will encourage all participants to move and work 
within their own range of motion and ability.  Participants and 
instructors will be asked to report any adverse events, and will 
be given the emails and phone numbers of the PI, student 
researcher, and Clinical Investigator.  All adverse events will 
be reported to the IRB.  Participants and instructors will be 
advised to call 911 or seek immediate medical assistance in the 
event of a medical emergency.  
 
 
E.2. SAFETY PROTOCOL 
 
Screening:  The first level of safety is built into the screening procedures via inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.   
 
Participant Check-ins:  The student investigator will make phone calls to qigong group participants 
during Weeks 1, 2, and 7 of the study to check-in with participants and ensure that they feel safe

Instructor Check-in:  All qigong instructors will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_324165], 
study PI, or CI immediately if there are any health and/or safety concerns regarding the 
participants.  We will also request that instructors check-in with each participant at each class to 
ensure they are not experiencing any problems.   
 
Removal from the Study:  In the event that a participant experiences pain, discomfort, injury or 
illness they will be seen by [CONTACT_324166] a case-by-case basis 
whether or not the participant should continue with or be excused from the study.  
 
Privacy:  Privacy in the context of this study includes confidentiality of data and personal 
information in handling and reporting of data as described above.   
 
 
E.3. DEFINING AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events will be reported according to the NUNM IRB Adverse Events Reporting 
Procedure.  Adverse events are defined as follows (http://www.nunm.edu/helfgott-
research/institutional-review-board-research-integrity/irb-adverse-events.php): 
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant that may or may 
not have been caused by [CONTACT_34144].  An AE may be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., abnormal lab finding), symptom (e.g., back pain), or disease that happens during the 
study, whether or not related to the study intervention.  There are 2 types of adverse events:  
Anticipated : Those already included in the protocol and consent form as a potential risk or 
part of the disease being studied. 
Unanticipated: Any serious event (including on-site and off-site adverse events, injuries, 
side effects, deaths or other problems) which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_108417], was 
 
 
Protocol Study Title: Qigong for MS 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Angela Senders 
IRB #: 102015 
Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400185] possibly related to the research procedures, 
including: 
 Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that 
involves risk or has the potential to recur; 
 Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject; 
 Any publication in the literature, safety monitoring report (including Data and 
Safety Monitoring Reports), interim result or other finding that indicates an 
unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio of the research; 
 Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others; 
 Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that cannot be 
resolved by [CONTACT_16133]; or 
 Any other serious and possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_177503]. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-
threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results 
in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or results in a congenital anomaly or birth 
defect. Other important medical events requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent a 
serious outcome are also included.  Specific definitions of SAEs include the following: 
 Death:  An event that results in the death of a subject 
 Life Threatening:  An event, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_156700], would have resulted 
in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  An event that results in an admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324140]. This does not include an emergency room visit or an admission to an outpatient 
facility. 
 Prolongation of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  An event that occurs while the study subject is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324141]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. 
 Persistent or Significant Disability:  An event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a subject.  “Disability” is not intended to 
include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, vomiting 
or accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle). 
 Congenital Anomaly:  An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that results 
in fetal loss.  
 
 
Protocol Study Title: Qigong for MS 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Angela Senders 
IRB #: 102015 
Approval Date: 10/06/16 
22 
 
 Important Medical Event: An important medical event may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324142](s) to prevent 
serious outcome based on medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. 
Severity: Adverse events, but not SAEs , are categorized into four levels of severity: mild, 
moderate, severe, or very severe.  These categories are defined as follows: 
 Mild: Transient and easily tolerated. 
 Moderate: Results in a modification or interruption of the subject’s usual activities or 
care and may require discontinuation of the study intervention 
 Severe: Results in considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities or care and 
may require discontinuation of study intervention. 
 Very Severe: Results in the need for urgent medical care and likely requires 
discontinuation of the study intervention. 
Attribution: The relationship between adverse events and the study intervention should be 
evaluated and graded as none, remote, possible, probable, or highly probable. Clinical 
investigators are responsible for determining the relationship between study intervention and 
adverse events.  
The timeline for reporting AEs and SAEs is as follows: 
Anticipated Adverse Events:  These will be reported in summary form annually to the IRB during 
continuing review, regardless of whether classified as severe or related to the study intervention. 
Unanticipated Adverse Events : Unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB within 10 
working days of the investigators being notified of the event. 
Serious Adverse Events:  Serious adverse events will be reported the IRB within [ADDRESS_400186] visit before any data are collected.  She will meet in a private room with the potential

Approval Date: 10/06/[ADDRESS_400187] their ability to 
participate in future research studies. The student investigator will determine the participant’s 
ability to provide informed consent by [CONTACT_287367]: 
 
 Do you understand what is being asked of you in this study?   
 Do you have any questions for me about what is going to happen? 
 Can you tell me how long you will be asked to be in this study? 
 Could you tell me how long you will be asked to participate in a qigong class? 
 
Once the student investigator feels certain that potential participants clearly understand their 
roles, rights and responsibilities, she will ask them to sign an approved written consent form.  
The potential participant will sign the consent form if they agree to the terms stated. The student 
investigator will retain the signed consent form, and a copy of the signed consent will be 
provided to the participant.  The original copy will be filed in a locked filing cabinet in the PI’s 
office.  
 
E.4. POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS 
 
Participants may or may not receive any benefit from partaking in this study.  
 
E.5. INCENTIVES 
 
Neither Qigong Instructors nor study participants will receive incentives for participating in this 
study.  
 
F. IMPORTANCE OF KNOWLEDGE GAINED  
 
By [CONTACT_324167], this study can help broaden the 
range of possible therapi[INVESTIGATOR_324143].  Results from this trial will provide 
preliminary data, direction and feasibility to seek future funding for a fully powered randomized 
controlled trial of qigong and MS.

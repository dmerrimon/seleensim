Study Title : Pi[INVESTIGATOR_720945] (s):  Christopher J. Edwards  MD 
 
Sponsor or funding source: Department of Anesthesiology at Wake Forest University Baptist 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
Background, Rationale and Context  
Total hip arthroplasty ( THA) remains one of the most successful orthopedic procedures in that it 
can effectively relieve pain and restore function in patients w ith end stage osteoarthritis1.  In an attempt to 
accelerate recovery , many orthopedic surgeons have opted to utilize a d irect anterior approach (DAA) as 
opposed to the more traditional posterolateral approach (PLA).  The literature supports that DAA is 
superior to PLA with regard to lower blood loss, less pain, shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and faster rehabilitation.  
The DAA tech nique involves dissection of muscular planes for insertion of components resulting in less 
tissue damage as compared to PLA2.  For this reason, we are seeing more DAA total hip arthroplasty 
procedures performed at our institution.  
 
Traditionally , we per form Lumbar Plexus blocks  (LPB)  in a manner consistent with that 
described by [CONTACT_720952]. al3 to provide post -operative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty.  This 
technique works well for the traditionally performed PLA in that the hip joint and incisio n site are within 
the analgesic distribution of the LP B.  Conversely, the DAA utilizes an anterior incision that overlies the 
L1 and L2 dermatomes as opposed to the lower lumbar dermatomes of the PLA incision.  The incision 
runs proximal to distal starting  3cm distal to and 3cm lateral to the anterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .4 When 
performing LP B, it has been our clinical experience that  it is rare to achieve analgesia in the proximal 
distribution of the lumbar plexus resulting in  apparent  sparing of the L1 and L2 nerve root  distributions .   
 
The Quadratus Lumborum block (QLB)  is a newer  regional analgesic  technique  that may be as 
effective as LPB at providing pain control following DAA hip arthroplasty.  The QLB as described by 
Børglum  is thought to provide analgesia by [CONTACT_720953] 
T7 through L4 .[ADDRESS_984794] of the auth ors’ knowledge , there has been no 
investigation comparing the efficacy, with regards to post -operative pain management, between LPB and 
QLB.   
 
Analgesic modalities commonly employ primarily  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], however there is increased 
attention in  the liter ature  that supports minimizing opi[INVESTIGATOR_720946] , including post -operative nausea and vomiting, hypoxia, and urinary retention.  In 
contrast, analgesia provided by [CONTACT_720954] a decreased risk of the aforementioned 
complications .[ADDRESS_984795] assess patient pain scores 6 hours after 
receiving a LPB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163] (both are co nsidered a practice standard for our institution)  for 
DAA procedures. We also want to test the presence or absence of pin prick sensation  at the base of the 1st 
toe (L5 dermatome) and the base of the 5th toe (S1 dermatome)  [ADDRESS_984796] sensation at L5 and /or S1 in 
addition to a demonstrable lumbar plexus block would indicate that the pain scores obtained at 6hrs would 
represent analgesia provided by t he lumbar plexus block alone.  
 
Objectives  
The purpose of this study is to collect pi[INVESTIGATOR_720947] a future randomized study, 
comparing a QLB to a LPB for DAA procedures. We will collect pain scores measured on a 
visual analog scale at 6hrs .  Additionally, we will assess for spi[INVESTIGATOR_720948] 
L5/S1 by [CONTACT_720955] .  This will help 
determine if pain scores collected at 6hrs reflect analgesia provided by [CONTACT_720956][INVESTIGATOR_18227].  This data will help us 
determine if 6hrs is a feasible primary endpoint to assess pain scores.   Additionally, assuming 
that spi[INVESTIGATOR_720949] 6hrs , the VAS pain scores obtained will then be used to 
perform a power analysis to determine the necessary study size when comparing QLB to LPB for 
DAA hip arthroplasty.  
 
Methods  
Study staff will visit [ADDRESS_984797] toe (L5) and th e base of the 5th toe (S1), without breaking the skin. 
Patients will be asked if they can feel  “pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107],” touch, pressure, or nothing .    
 
Setting  
All participating patients will receive their surgeries at Davie Medical Center of Wake Forest 
Baptist Healt h.  
 
Subject Selection  
Inclusion  
Patients will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they are at or over the age of [ADDRESS_984798] elective total hip arthroplasty with DAA at Davie Medical Center.  
 
Exclusion  
Patien ts will be excluded if they do not receive a lumbar plexus block  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_720950] a and/or if they have peripheral neuropathy effecting their feet.  
 
Interventions  
Interventions are limited to a pin prick  sensation testing  at the base of the 1st toe and of the 5th 
toe.  
 
Outcomes : 
Outcomes will include  patient pain scores  (rest and with activity)  and the presence or absence of 
pin prick sensation [ADDRESS_984799] Protection  
 Informed Consent  
No informed consent will be obtained as patients will not be prosp ectively enrolled in this 
study , and no patient information will be obtained or otherwise collected.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
The only information taken for  this study will be pain scores  and presence or absence of 
sensation . No patient identification numbers or characteristics will be collected. Patients 
will be referred to by a simple n umber (numbers 1 through 1 0).

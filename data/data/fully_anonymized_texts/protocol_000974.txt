been performed blindly such as embryo transfer. Currently there are limited prospective trials for 
studying the utility of ultrasound guidance for many other procedures. Our objective is to determine the 
utility of ultrasound-guided intrauterine device (IUD) insertion compared to traditional blind insertion at 
an academic health institute where skill level of provider can vary greatly.  The subject and her clinician 
will determine which type of IUD they will receive and all types of IUD’s (copper and progesterone 
containing) will be acceptable for participation in the study.  Our hypothesis is that transabdominal 
ultrasound guided insertion will lead to lower discontinuation rates and greater patient satisfaction.

compared to blind insertion. 
2.2 Previous Data
There are  no preliminary data at this time
2.3 Study  Rationale
Our goal  is to determine the utility of ultrasound guided IUD insertion compared to the traditional blind 
insertion at an academic health institute where the skill level of the provider can vary greatly.  We 
hypothesize that ultrasound-guided insertion will lead lower IUD discontinuation rates and greater 
patient satisfaction.

4.2 Recruitment  process
Women will  be given information on the study at the time of scheduling for the IUD insertion clinic 
appointment, either in the clinic appointment when she is considering IUD or inpatient for those 
considering an IUD postpartum (greater than 6 weeks after delivery). Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_371370]. 
They will have the opportunity to ask questions and if they are interested in participating they will be 
given a copy of the consent form to take home and read. Upon arrival in clinic for IUD insertion, if the 
subject is interested in participating, they will again be counseled about the study and will be given time 
to ask questions and have their questions answered. If they are eligible to continue, informed consent 
will be obtained, and they will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms, traditional IUD 
insertion versus transabdominal ultrasound-guided insertion.

Page 9 of  15 (V.04/27/2017) All interested  women undergoing a scheduled IUD insertion will be screened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_371371].   
Those who meet the inclusion/exclusion will be offered information about the study during their 
clinic visit.  The subject will have the study explained to them in detail by [CONTACT_371372]. The 
subject will be given a copy of the consent form to take home and read prior to their IUD 
insertion visit. The subject will be given information on how to contact [CONTACT_371373]. 
7.2.2 Visit  2 (Consent and IUD insertion)
Consent will  be obtained from subjects at their IUD insertion visit. The investigator will again 
review the study with the patient and any questions the patient has about the study will be 
addressed. After all questions are answered to the patient’s satisfaction written consent will be 
obtained. Demographic information will be collected from each subject.
Subjects will  then be randomized to one of two groups:
Group A:  traditional blind IUD insertion.
Group B:  transabdominal ultrasound guided IUD insertion.
Subjects will  be randomized to either US guided or traditional placement of IUD using 1:[ADDRESS_464548] REDCap  access will access REDCap to carry out the randomization assignment. If no team 
member is  available with REDCap access the Co-PI (Linda Li) will be contact[CONTACT_371374] a randomization assignment.

randomization. If  REDCap is offline and unavailable at the time of randomization, or Linda Li is 
not able  to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], Barb Scheetz at Penn State Hershey Medical Center will have 
randomization assignments on paper as  a backup hardcopy in order to randomize a patient.
Subject in  both groups will fill out a visual analogue score (VAS) before and after the procedure 
grading their pain.
Subjects will  be instructed to call the investigator if they experience any abnormal uterine 
bleeding or problems with their IUD.

7.[ADDRESS_464551] of 376 women who are undergoing scheduled IUD insertion.  We assume a 
discontinuation rate  of 23% at 6 months for the traditional IUD insertion method based on a large study 
of experienced  clinicians inserting IUDs and a large Cochrane review [2, 3].  We project that the 
ultrasound guided IUD  insertion will have half the discontinuation rate, i.e., it will be 11.5% (due to the 
correct placement of the IUD  in the fundus).  A sample size of 338 (169 per group) will provide 80% 
power to  detect a difference in the discontinuation proportions at [ADDRESS_464552] having a significance 
level of  0.05. However, we anticipate 10% subject dropout for this longitudinal study; therefore, we will 
enroll a  total of [ADDRESS_464553]  to the primary outcome of IUD discontinuation [ 4] . An advantage of this 
method is  that it will provide an estimate of the risk ratio and associated 95% confidence interval for this 
prospective study  as well as providing the flexibility to adjust the analysis for potentially confounding 
factors (e.g.,  age at IUD insertion). As a secondary analysis, the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method 
will be used  to assess time from IUD insertion until IUD discontinuation with the comparison between 
the two treatment arms  performed using the log-rank test. For the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the data from 
a specific  subject will be censored at [ADDRESS_464554] dropped out of the study prior to 6 months. We 
plan on  performing an interim analysis to assess efficacy of the intervention around the midpoint of the 
study.

Risk of  Randomization
Ultrasound:  ultrasound is a  safe procedure that uses low-power sound waves. There are no known risks. 
Although ultrasound is a valuable tool, it has limitations. Sound doesn't travel well through air or bone, so 
ultrasound isn't effective at imaging parts of your body that have gas in them or are hidden by [CONTACT_4210].
There is  a risk of incidental findings while performing the ultrasound, these will be noted in the chart 
documentation and followed by [CONTACT_371376]. 
There is  no known risk with transabdominal ultrasound.
Standard of  Care: Discomforts associated with IUD include: placement discomfort, missed menstrual periods, 
cysts on the ovary, headache/migraine, acne, depressed mood, heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, vaginal 
discharge, breast tenderness, nausea, nervousness, inflammation of cervix, vulva, or vagina, pelvic pain during 
period, back pain, weigh increase, decreased sex drive, pain during intercourse, anemia, unusual hair growth or 
loss, skin irritations, feeling bloated, swelling of hands and feet, and expulsion.  Some serious but uncommon 
side effects of IUD include: pelvic inflammatory disease, sepsis, and perforation in the event IUD becomes 
attached to or goes through the wall of the uterus, which may require surgery.
12.[ADDRESS_464556] may experience is greater satisfaction and lower IUD discontinuation rates 
when insertion is performed with the ultrasound guided insertions method compared to the traditional 
blind insertion. 
12.2 Potential  Benefits to Others
Other women  will benefit from the knowledge gained by [CONTACT_371377].  Ultrasound 
guided insertion could lead to more accurate placement of the IUD, less pain, and better satisfaction 
with the procedure.

We are asking  you to be in a research study.
Whether or not  you take part is up to you. You can choose not to take part. You can agree to take part 
and later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you.
This form  gives you information about the research. Please ask questions about anything that is 
unclear to you and take your time to make your choice.
1.   Why is this research study being done?   
We are asking  you to be in this research because you are a woman who has chosen to have an 
Intrauterine Device (IUD)  inserted inside your uterus.  It is sometimes called an IUC or intrauterine 
contraception. 
This research  is being done to find out if ultrasound guided placement of IUD has benefit in long-
term use.  Currently there is little to no data on the use of ultrasound guidance for intrauterine 
device (IUD) placement which is traditionally inserted without visualization of the inside of the 
uterus, where the IUD is to be located.  
Approximately 376  women will take part in this research study at Hershey Medical Center. 
2.   What will happen in this research study?
Before any  study-related procedures are performed you will be asked to read and sign this consent 
document. Refer to Table 1 (below) for a summary of visits/procedures.
Visit 1-Pre-Insertion  Visit:

Page 2  of 9 (v.12/14/2016)consent form  will be reviewed with you. You will be able to take this form home to read.  You will be 
given a contact [CONTACT_371378]. If you are interested in participating you will indicate this at your IUD insertion visit at which 
time you will be able to ask questions and sign the consent form. 
Visit 2 (Consent  and IUD insertion)
Your doctor  will again review the study with you and any questions you have about the study will be 
addressed. At this time, written consent will be obtained. You will complete a demographic form.  You 
will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) at this visit to one of the following two groups:
Group A:  If you are assigned to this group you will have your IUD inserted by [CONTACT_371379]. You have a 1 out of 2 (50%) chance of receiving traditional blind insertion.
Group B:  If you are assigned to this group you will have your IUD inserted along with abdominal 
ultrasound guidance. You have a 1 out of 2 (50%) chance of receiving ultrasound guidance insertion
You will also be asked to complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in order to rate on a scale of 1-[ADDRESS_464564] page of this 
consent form if you experience any bleeding or problems prior to your next visit. 
Visit 3 (4-6  weeks after Visit 2) 
You will  be scheduled for a routine 4-[ADDRESS_464565] had with your IUD. You will be asked to 
complete the Likert scale to indicate your satisfaction so far with your IUD as well as the Visual 
Analogue Scale to indicate your level of pain.
If your IUD is  malpositioned  (not in the proper position), you will be withdrawn from the study and  
a  routine standard of care  work up will be initiated, meaning the IUD will need to be removed. If 
your IUD is properly positioned you will continue in the study.
Visit 4 (Clinic  visit -6 months after IUD insertion)
At [ADDRESS_464566] (and when it 
was removed or lost).  You will have a transvaginal ultrasound, be surveyed for pain, report any 
adverse events (including abnormal uterine bleeding), and you will rate your satisfaction with the 
IUD by [CONTACT_371380].

3.   What are the  risks and possi ble discomforts from being in this research study?   
IUD insertion  risks: The risks of IUD insertion are risks that you would have even if you did not take 
part in this  research. Discomforts and side effects may include placement discomfort, missed 
menstrual periods, cysts on the ovary, headache/migraine, acne, depressed mood, heavy or 
prolonged menstrual bleeding, vaginal discharge, breast tenderness, nausea, nervousness, 
inflammation of cervix, vulva, or vagina, pelvic pain during period, back pain, weigh increase, 
decreased sex drive, pain during intercourse, anemia, unusual hair growth or loss, skin irritations, 
feeling bloated, swelling of hands and feet, and expulsion.  
Some serious but  uncommon side effects of IUD include: pelvic inflammatory disease, sepsis, and 
perforation in the event IUD becomes attached to or goes through the wall of the uterus.
        
Transvaginal Ultrasound risks:  Transvaginal Ultrasounds are a common and usually painless 
procedure, however, there may  be varying degrees of pressure as a wand is inserted and often 
moved around to allow for proper visualization.  There is a risk of incidental findings while 
performing the ultrasound, these will be noted in the chart documentation and followed by [CONTACT_371381]. 
Abdominal Ultrasound  risks: There is usually no discomfort from a pressure as the transducer is 
pressed against  the area being examined. If scanning is performed over an area of tenderness, you 
may feel pressure or minor pain from the transducer.
Other risks:
Risk of randomization: You will be assigned to a study group by [CONTACT_3364]. The study group you are 
assigned to may prove to be less effective than the other study group.
Risk of loss of confidentiality: There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if your information or your identity 
is obtained by [CONTACT_127774], but precautions will be taken to prevent this from  
occuring. The confidentiality of your electronic data created by [CONTACT_371382]. Absolute confidentiality cannot be 
guaranteed.

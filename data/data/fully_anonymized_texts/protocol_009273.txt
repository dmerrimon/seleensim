leading to airflow obstruction with symptoms such as breathlessness, cough, impairment of 
physical activity, and potentially death. Prevalence data in the [LOCATION_002] between 2001 
and 2010 indicated an overall increase in asthma during the period [ Akinbami, 2012 ], and by 
2014, there were 24 million people with asthma [ CDC, 2016 ]. 
 
Inhaled corticosteroids have been widely used as a safe and effective anti-inflammatory 
therapy for the treatment of persistent asthma for many years. Inhaled corticosteroids are 
recommended as the maintenance treatment of choice in treatment guidelines (ie, Global 
Initiative for Asthma [GINA] and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute National 
Asthma Education and Prevention Program [NAEPP]) in all but patients with mild 
intermittent asthma whose symptoms are adequately maintained on short-acting β2 agonists 
(SABAs) alone [ GINA, 2016 ; NAEPP, 2007 ]. 
 
Long-acting β agonists (LABAs) have also been widely used as safe and effective 
bronchodilator therapy for the treatment of persistent asthma for many years, and they are 
also recommended as a maintenance therapy in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids 
[GINA, 2016 ; NAEPP, 2007 ] for patients with moderate to severe asthma who remain 
symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_16866]-dose inhaled corticosteroids and SABAs (as needed). 
 
Symbicort® is approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) as a combination 
product containing a corticosteroid and a LABA and is indicated for the treatment of asthma 
patients 12 years of age and older and for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease including chronic bronchitis and 
emphysema. It is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. It is available as a 
pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) containing a combination of budesonide (80 or 
160 µg) and formoterol (4.5 µg) as an inhalation aerosol and is administered as 2 inhalations 
twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 12 hours apart) [ Symbicort, 2016 ]. 
 
3M Health Care Ltd (3M) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a drug product (3M Inhaler) that is a pMDI 
containing a combination of budesonide (80 µg) and formoterol (4.5 µg) as an inhalation 
aerosol. The 3M Inhaler is expected to be equivalent to the currently available Symbicort 
(referred to in this protocol as Symbicort Reference Inhaler) in terms of reproducibility of 
delivery of both emitted and respi[INVESTIGATOR_44021]. The 3M Inhaler is being

 developed as a generic equivalent of the Symbicort Reference Inhaler in order to provide a 
choice for patients, prescribers, and payers. 
 
This study was designed in accordance with the FDA guidance on budesonide/formoterol

 3.2 Study Design 
This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multidose study 
consisting of a 2-week run-in period followed by a 6-week treatment period using 
budesonide/formoterol delivered by [CONTACT_941] 3M Inhaler or the Symbicort Reference Inhaler and 
compared with placebo. Subjects will visit the study center at a screening, baseline, and 
end-of-treatment visits, and they will receive telephone contacts after 2 weeks and after 
4 weeks of study treatment. 
 
3.2.1 Screening Visit 
Subjects will undergo the procedures outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Section 3.1 ). 
 
Two spi[INVESTIGATOR_44023] 
0400 and 1100 (ie, 4:00 AM and 11:00 AM) (see Section 6.1 ). Subjects cannot have taken a 
LABA within [ADDRESS_46125] taken rescue 
medication within 6 hours of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891]; if these requirements are not met, 
the visit must be rescheduled. If a subject does not meet the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44024] (see Section 4.1.1 ), a repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_44025] [ADDRESS_46126] be conducted at the same time of day 
(±1 hour) as the original spi[INVESTIGATOR_44026]. Subjects who meet the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44027]-in period (provided they meet all other 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria). Additional screening assessments 
outlined in the Schedule of Events do not need to be repeated if they were performed within 
the past [ADDRESS_46127] of washout medications and the 
required washout period for each. Some medications (such as immunosuppressive therapy) 
require more than [ADDRESS_46128] failed screening due to the 
need for an extended medication washout may be subsequently rescreened 1 additional time. 
 
During the screening visit, subjects will be given instructions on how to use the run-in period 
inhaler, and subjects will be informed that compliance to the run-in period inhaler schedule 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46129] 2016  
Page 17  
 will be checked at the baseline visit. Subjects will also be observed and trained until they are 
able to use the run-in medication properly. Subjects will take home a run-in period inhaler for 
use during the run-in period. 
 
Subjects will be given a SABA inhaler (see Section 5.2.2 ) to be used throughout the study as 
rescue therapy for the treatment of acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_44028]. In 
addition, xxx collect diary information twice daily (at home), in the morning and in the 
evening, approximately 12 hours apart, throughout the study (see 
Section 6.2.1 ). Subjects will be observed to ensure that they are able to use the device 
properly. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_46130]. During the run-in period, subjects will receive a run-in period (placebo) inhaler from 
which they will administer 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening, approximately 
12 hours apart). They will xxx collect diary information twice daily throughout the run-in 
period. 
 
3.2.3 Baseline Visit 
Following the run-in period, subjects will come to the clinic for a baseline visit that will 
include 12 hours of serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_31757]; the first predose baseline assessment (ie, 
30 minutes before dosing) must begin between 0400 and 1100 (ie, 4:00 AM and 11:00 AM). 
Note: When setting the start time for the baseline visit, consider that not only does the 
baseline visit include [ADDRESS_46131] predose 
baseline spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891] (ie, 30 minutes before initial dosing). 
 
Subjects will be instructed to not use the run-in period inhaler on the day of the baseline visit 
and, if possible, to not take rescue medication within 6 hours of the start of the baseline visit; 
if a subject is unable to withhold rescue medication, the visit must be rescheduled. 
 
Prior to randomization, study center personnel will calculate compliance with the run-in 
period inhaler schedule using xxx  number of run-in period inhalations used as well as the 
number of rescue therapy inhalations xxx  Study medication, diary, and

Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46132] qualifies to continue in the study. This 
includes performing 2 pulmonary function tests 30 minutes apart to assess FEV 1 (see 
Section 6.1 ). 
 
Qualified subjects will be randomized xxx in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive the 3M Inhaler, the 
Symbicort Reference Inhaler, or placebo, respectively. Following randomization, subjects 
will undergo the procedures outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Section 3.1 ). 
 
Subjects will be given instructions on how to use the treatment period inhalers, xxx. Subjects 
will also be observed to ensure that they are able to use the study medication properly, and 
re-education will be provided as necessary.

information in the diary. 
 
The first telephone contact [CONTACT_44056] 2 (Day 14 ± 2 days), and the second telephone 
contact [CONTACT_44056] 4 (Day 28 ± 2 days). At the baseline visit, subjects will be given 2 
canisters of study medication, clearly labeled as Canister 1 and Canister 2, based on their 
randomized treatment (3M Inhaler, Symbicort Reference Inhaler, or placebo). Subjects will use 
Canister 1 until the Week 4 telephone call visit. At the Week 4 telephone visit, subjects will be 
instructed to switch to Canister 2 beginning with the evening dose on the day of the telephone 
visit and use that canister for the remainder of the study. (If a subject needs to switch to 
Canister [ADDRESS_46134] notify study 
center personnel so that study medication compliance can be calculated correctly.) 
 
Subjects will also be reminded that no study medication should be taken within 12 hours 
(±2 hours) of the start time of their end-of-treatment visit.

rescheduled. Subjects will undergo the procedures outlined in the Schedule of Events 
(Section 3.1 ). 
 
Subjects must bring both canisters of study medication so that study center personnel can 
confirm study medication compliance. Study center personnel will also review the diary 
information and speak with the subject to determine if the subject has had any new AEs, 
changes to ongoing AEs (including discontinuation or exacerbation of an AE), or changes to 
their concomitant medications, whether or not the changes were recorded in the diary. 
 
Subjects who discontinue the study early will attend the end-of-treatment visit upon 
termination. Any ongoing SAE or AE that led to study discontinuation will continue to be 
followed up after the end-of-treatment visit until satisfactory resolution, the investigator 
deems the event to be chronic or not clinically significant, or the subject is considered to 
be stable. 
 
This study will be considered complete when the last subject has completed the last 
end-of-treatment visit or additional AE follow-up as necessary.

5 Study Treatments 
 
5.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive budesonide/formoterol fumarate 
(80 µg/4.5 µg) via a 3M Inhaler, budesonide/formoterol fumarate (80 µg/4.5 µg) via a 
Symbicort Reference Inhaler, or placebo using a 3:3:1 allocation ratio. xxx. 
 
5.2 Treatments  Administered 
The 3M Inhaler, the Symbicort Reference Inhaler, and placebo inhalers (for both the run-in 
and treatment periods) will be supplied by 3M or its designee. The run-in period inhalers will 
be shipped in a separate box clearly labeled for use during the run-in period. Study center 
personnel must not dispense placebo inhalers from the treatment box in place of the run-in 
period inhalers and must not dispense the run-in period inhalers during the treatment period. 
 
The following treatments will be administered during the study: 
 
 Placebo via a placebo inhaler (over the 2-week run-in period, 2 inhalations twice 
daily) 
 
 Budesonide/formoterol fumarate (80 µg/4.5 µg) via the 3M Inhaler (over the 6-week 
treatment period, 2 inhalations twice daily) 
 
 Budesonide/formoterol fumarate (80 µg/4.5 µg) via the Symbicort Reference Inhaler 
(over the 6-week treatment period, 2 inhalations twice daily) 
 
 Placebo via a placebo inhaler (over the 6-week treatment period, 2 inhalations twice 
daily) 
 
Subjects will be instructed to rinse their mouths with water without swallowing after study 
medication administration in the morning and in the evening. 
Of note, the 3M Inhaler and the Symbicort Reference Inhaler include formoterol, a LABA, as 
an active ingredient. Clinical studies have shown that LABA medicines such as formoterol 
increase the risk of death from asthma complications. It is not known whether budesonide, 
the other active ingredient in the 3M Inhaler and the Symbicort Reference Inhaler, reduces 
the risk of death from asthma complications seen with formoterol. 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46152] 2016  
Page 26  
  
5.2.1 Administration of Study Medication 
Symbicort is an FDA-approved medication, and administration information can be found in 
the package insert [ Symbicort, 2016 ]. 
 
At the screening visit, subjects will be provided with detailed instructions on how to 
administer the study medication. They will demonstrate to study center personnel their ability 
to correctly use the product. During the 2-week run-in period, subjects will use a run-in 
(placebo) inhaler. The first run-in dose will be administered at the study center at the end of 
the screening visit. 
 
For the day of the baseline visit, subjects will be instructed not to take their morning dose 
from the run-in (placebo) inhaler prior to attending the visit. At the baseline visit, eligible 
subjects will receive [ADDRESS_46153] (predose) spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891]. 
Subjects will take their morning dose on the first day of treatment in the presence of study 
center personnel. The evening dose of study medication on the day of the baseline visit will 
be taken [ADDRESS_46154] 
6 hours from the target time of the next dose (ie, doses cannot be taken less than 6 hours 
apart). 
 
Subjects will take study medication as directed from Canister [ADDRESS_46155] 
visit at Week 4, at which point they will be instructed to switch to Canister 2, beginning with 
the evening dose on the day of the telephone visit, and they will use Canister 2 for the 
remainder of the study. (If a subject needs to switch to Canister 2 for any reason prior to the 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46156] notify study center personnel so that study 
medication compliance can be calculated correctly.) 
 
The last dose of study medication will be the day before the end-of-treatment visit. When 
subjects are contact[CONTACT_44062] 4 telephone visit, they will be reminded that no study 
medication should be taken within 12 hours (±2 hours) of the start time of their 
end-of-treatment visit and to bring back both canisters to the study center for their visit. 
 
5.2.2 Rescue Therapy 
A SABA inhaler (albuterol HFA pMDI 90 µg) will be provided to subjects by [CONTACT_44063]. 
 
Subjects will record the number of inhalations (puffs used) of rescue medication (albuterol 
HFA pMDI 90 µg) each morning and evening in the diary. The average number of daily 
inhalations over the 7 days before the baseline visit will be the baseline value and will be 
compared with the rescue medication use during the 6-week treatment period. Rescue-free 
days are defined as 24-hour periods with no rescue medication usage. 
 
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbation, including excessive SABA use (see 
Section 6.2.2 ) should be reassessed by [CONTACT_44064]. 
 
If a subject requires rescue medication during the postdose serial spi[INVESTIGATOR_44039], the event will be recorded as an AE and the medication used will 
be recorded as a concomitant medication in the eCRF; the date and time of administration as 
well as the number of puffs will be recorded. These subjects may continue in the study.

6 Study Assessments and Procedures 
Before performing any study procedures, all potential subjects will sign an informed consent 
form (ICF). Subjects will have the opportunity to have any questions answered before 
signing the ICF. The investigator must address all questions raised by [CONTACT_423]. The 
investigator and a witness will also sign the ICF. 
 
As shown in the Schedule of Events ( Section 3.1 ), subjects will have evaluations at 
screening, baseline, Week 2, Week 4, and end-of-treatment (Week 6) visits. The Week 2 and 
Week 4 evaluations are telephone contacts from the study center personnel, during which 
subjects will be queried regarding changes to their concomitant medications and AE 
experiences (new AEs or changes to ongoing AEs [including discontinuation or exacerbation 
of AEs]), whether or not the changes were recorded in the diary. If a subject indicates that 
changes occurred but were not recorded in the diary, the study center personnel will 
re-educate the subject on capturing information in the diary. 
 
At the Week [ADDRESS_46165] spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891]; at the 
end-of-treatment visit, subjects cannot have taken study medication within [ADDRESS_46166] spi[INVESTIGATOR_44040]; if these requirements are not met, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44041]. 
 
At the screening visit, subjects will have [ADDRESS_46167]’s FEV [ADDRESS_46168] 
demonstrate an FEV 1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of predicted normal. Those who fail to meet this

Page 32  
 criterion may present for repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_44042] 7 days. 
 
Subjects who demonstrate an FEV 1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of predicted normal will then be 
administered albuterol 360 µg delivered via a pMDI with a spacer. The reversibility of FEV 1 
will be assessed with a second spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891] 30 minutes (±5 minutes) later. To meet 
the entry criteria, subjects must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV 1 (reversibility of 
14.50% to 14.99% will be rounded to 15%) and a ≥0.2 L increase within 30 minutes 
(±5 minutes) following the administration of 360 µg albuterol delivered via a pMDI. Subjects 
who demonstrate reversibility of FEV 1 ≥10% and <14.5% or those who fail to show an 
increase of >0.20 L within 30 minutes (±5 minutes) of 360 µg albuterol may present for 
repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_44043] 7 days. 
 
xxxxx 
 
At the baseline visit on Day 1 (following the run-in period), the subjects will have a predose 
(30 minutes before initial dosing) spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891], have a time point 0 spi[INVESTIGATOR_1892] (which will be averaged with the first spi[INVESTIGATOR_44044] a baseline 
value), receive their first morning dose of study medication, and have subsequent serial 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_44045]: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing. A 
window of ±5 minutes will be applied through the 3-hour assessment, and a window of

be recorded as a concomitant medication in the eCRF; the date and time of administration as 
well as the number of puffs will be recorded. These subjects may continue in the study. 
At the end-of-treatment visit, subjects will have [ADDRESS_46171] been taken within 12 hours (±2 hours) and rescue medication must not have 
been taken within [ADDRESS_46172] spi[INVESTIGATOR_44046] (±1 hour) as the first predose baseline spi[INVESTIGATOR_1892] (ie, 30 minutes before initial dosing), and the second spi[INVESTIGATOR_44047] 30 minutes (±5 minutes) later; the end-of-treatment FEV 1 value will be the 
average of the 2 assessments.

6.2.2 Adverse Events 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study medication or their clinical significance. 
 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject that is associated with the 
use of a study medication in humans, whether or not considered related to the study 
medication. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_44065]. 
 
A treatment-emergent AE is defined as any event not present before exposure to study 
medication or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency after 
exposure to study medication.  
 
A life-threatening AE or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction is defined as an event that, 
in the view of the investigator or the sponsor, places the subject at immediate risk of death; it 
does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death. 
 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46178] 2016  
Page 35  
 An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is defined as any event that, in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening 
AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study medication caused the AE. For the purposes of FDA safety reporting, "reasonable 
possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
medication and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by [CONTACT_7860]. 
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator’s brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be 
unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s brochure referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator’s brochure 
listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to 
AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator’s brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be assessed beginning at enrollment (date of signed informed consent) 
and up to the end-of-treatment visit. Even though the Investigator does not need to actively 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46179] nonleading question (such as “How have you 
felt since your last visit”) to elicit any medically related changes in their well-being. They 
will also be asked if they have visited an emergency room/urgent care clinic or have been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant 
medication regimens (see Section 6.2.4 ). 
 
In addition to subject observations, AEs identified from any study data (eg, vital sign data, 
laboratory values, physical examination findings) or identified from review of other 
documents (eg, subject diaries) that are relevant to subject safety will be documented on the 
AE page in the eCRF. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  Adverse Events 
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes date of onset, description of AE, investigator-specified 
severity and relationship to study medication, action taken, and date of resolution. Adverse 
events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to 
concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will 
be followed up to adequate resolution. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) will be used to code all AEs. 
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened but does not 
deteriorate will not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded as an AE. 
Any AE that meets SAE criteria ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be immediately (ie, within [ADDRESS_46180] learn about the event) reported on the SAE page in 
the eCRF. The 24-hour safety hotline telephone number and the SAE fax number are located 
on the cover page. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity 
The severity, or intensity, of an AE refers to the extent to which an AE affects the subject’s 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46181] 2016  
Page 37  
 daily activities. The intensity of the AE will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following criteria: 
 
Mild: These events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
subject’s daily activities. 
Moderate: These events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
normal functioning. 
Severe: These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. Adverse events characterized as 
intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study medication is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the 
study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be 
reported. 
 
The relationship or association of the test article in causing or contributing to the AE will be 
characterized using the following classification and criteria: 
Unrelated: This relationship suggests that there is no association between the study 
medication and the reported event. 
 
Possible: This relationship suggests that treatment with the study medication caused or 
contributed to the AE, ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration or follows a known response pattern to the 
study medication, but could also have been produced by [CONTACT_1604]. 
 
Probable: This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with drug administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological 
action of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the drug 
or class of drugs, or judgment based on the investigator’s clinical experience, 
the association of the event with the study medication seems likely. The event 
disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction of the dose of study 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46182] 2016  
Page 38  
 medication. 
 
Definite: This relationship suggests that a definite causal relationship exists between drug 
administration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do 
not appear to explain the event. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-Up of Subjects Reporting Adverse Events 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF. 
 
For SAEs, follow-up information to an initial safety report must be provided by [CONTACT_44066]. Relevant information such as 
discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and medical consultations will be reviewed in detail 
by [CONTACT_44067]. 
 
All SAEs or AEs that lead to discontinuation of study medication will be followed up until 
satisfactory resolution, the investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically 
significant, or the subject is considered to be stable. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_46183]’s eCRF. The minimum 
requirement is that the drug name, dose, and dates of administration are to be recorded (start 
and stop dates). This will include all prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, 
and over-the-counter medications. Any changes in concomitant medications (including 
discontinuations of drugs, changes in dose, and initiation of new medications) will also be 
recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
 
The run-in period will be used to washout prestudy medications and to establish FEV [ADDRESS_46184] of washout medications and the required 
washout period for each; these medications are excluded throughout the study unless 
otherwise noted. Throughout the study, any concomitant medication deemed necessary for 
the welfare of the subject during the study may be given at the discretion of the investigator. 
However, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that details regarding the 
medication, and as necessary withdrawal (see Section 4.2 ), are recorded in full in the eCRF.

7 Statistical Considerations 
Detailed methodologies for the summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this 
study will be documented in a separate document, the statistical analysis plan (SAP). The 
SAP may modify the statistical plans outlined in this protocol; however, major modifications 
of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analyses will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment. 
 
7.1 Endpoints 
 
7.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints are as follows: 
 
 Change from baseline in FEV 1AUC0-12 at Day 1 
 
FEV1 will be measured on Day 1 before dosing (30 minutes before initial dosing), at 
time point 0, and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after dosing for the calculation 
of FEV 1AUC0-12. Details on the calculations of this endpoint will be provided in the 
SAP. 
 
 Change from baseline to the end-of-treatment in FEV [ADDRESS_46191] day of treatment. 
 
7.1.2 Safety Endpoint 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_44069] (percent), severity, and relatedness of AEs and 
SAEs between treatment groups. 
7.2 Sample Size Calculations 
Approximately 1470 adult subjects (18 years of age or older) with asthma are proposed to be 
randomized to the 3 treatment groups in a 3:3:1 ratio (630 subjects per active treatment group 
and 210 in the placebo group). 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46192] 2016  
Page 42  
  
7.2.1 Equivalence 
xxxxx. Sample size calculations are mainly driven by [CONTACT_44070] 1 at Week 6. Equivalence will be defined as the 90% CIs for the 
ratio (test/reference) falling within the (0.80, 1.25) target ratio. The sample size of 567 
subjects in each active treatment group will provide approximately 87.1% power at the 5% 
significance level for the equivalence test of means using two 1-sided tests and assuming a 
true ratio of the means equal to 0.95, coefficient of variance (CV) of 1.00, and equivalence 
limits of the mean ratio of 0.80 and 1.25. 
 
Similarly for the change from baseline in FEV 1AUC0-12 at Day 1 endpoint, using an SD of 
xxx the sample size of 567 subjects in each active treatment group will provide 90.1% power 
at the 5% significance level for the equivalence test of means using two 1-sided tests and 
assuming a true ratio of the means equal to 0.95, CV of 0.95, and equivalence limits of the 
mean ratio of 0.80 and 1.25. 
 
The sample size will be based on the per-protocol set (PPS). Therefore, accounting for an 
approximate 10% dropout rate from the PPS, a sample size of 1470 subjects (630 subjects per 
active treatment group and 210 in the placebo group) is proposed. 
 
Sample size calculations were performed xxx 
 
7.2.2 Superiority 
xxxxx For the change from baseline in FEV 1, the sample size of 630 in the active treatment 
group and 210 subjects in the placebo group will provide more than 99% power to reject the 
hypothesis of equal means at the 5% significance level using a 2-sided 2-sample equal-
variance t test, assuming that the population mean difference xxx 
 
Similarly, for FEV 1AUC0-12, the sample size of 630 in the active treatment group and 
210 subjects in the placebo group will provide more than 99% power to reject the hypothesis 
of equal means at the 5% significance level using a 2-sided 2-sample equal-variance t test 
and using the population mean difference xxx for both treatments. 
 
Power was calculated using xxx for a 2-sample t test assuming equal variance. xxxxx

 7.3 Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses: 
 
Full-analysis set (FAS): The FAS will consist of all subjects who were randomly assigned to 
receive single-blind study medication. All analyses using the FAS will group subjects 
according to randomized treatment. This analysis set will be used to assess the assay 
sensitivity of each active treatment (3M Inhaler and Symbicort Reference Inhaler) compared 
with placebo. 
 
Per-protocol set (PPS): The PPS will consist of all FAS subjects who fulfill all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, are compliant to the study medication schedule (see Section 5.7 ), 
have not taken any prohibited medications, and have no significant protocol deviations. 
 
Per definition, the PPS will only include subjects who received the study medication to 
which they were randomly assigned. This analysis set will be used to assess the therapeutic 
equivalence of 3M Inhaler compared with Symbicort Reference Inhaler. 
Safety set: The safety set will consist of all subjects who received any study medication. All 
analyses using the safety set will group subjects according to treatment actually received. All 
safety endpoints will be analyzed based on the safety set. 
 
7.4 Description of Subgroups to be Analyzed 
No subgroup analyses are planned. 
 
7.5 Statistical  Analysis Methodology  
Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS software Version 9.2 or later. 
 
Summary statistics of the data collected will be provided by [CONTACT_3148] (3M Inhaler, 
Symbicort Reference Inhaler, and placebo). Continuous variables will be summarized using 
the mean, SD, CV, median, minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical variables will 
be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. 
 
Details of the statistical analyses, methods, and data conventions will be further described in 
the SAP.

 7.5.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
In order to claim therapeutic (overall) equivalence of the 3M Inhaler and the Symbicort 
Reference Inhaler, the following results should be demonstrated for both primary endpoints: 
 
 Equivalence of the active treatments means using ratio. The 90% CI for the ratio 
should fall within 80.00% and 125.00% 
 
 Assay sensitivity of each active treatment compared with placebo will be established if 
both active treatment groups are statistically superior to placebo ( P<0.05) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Equivalence 
For each primary endpoint, the equivalence analysis of 3M Inhaler compared with the 
Symbicort Reference Inhaler will be performed using an analysis of covariance. Factors will 
be treatment (3M Inhaler and Symbicort Reference Inhaler) and the appropriate baseline for 
the endpoint. From the least-squares (LS) mean estimates obtained for each treatment group, 
the ratio (3M Inhaler/Symbicort Reference Inhaler) will be calculated. Fieller’s theorem 
[Hirschberg, 2010 ] will then be used to generate 2-sided CIs for each ratio. This analysis will 
be based on the PPS. 
 
The mean of the 2 predose FEV 1 measurements taken at Day 1 will be used as the baseline 
for the FEV 1AUC0-12 assessment. 
The baseline for the FEV 1 endpoint will be calculated by [CONTACT_44071] 2 predose 
FEV1 measurements taken at the baseline visit (Day 1). 
The first FEV [ADDRESS_46195] day of the 6-week treatment period should correspond 
to the same time of day as that used for the baseline measurements (see Section 6.1 ). 
 
The 90% CI for the 2 active treatments (3M Inhaler and Symbicort Reference Inhaler) for the 
primary endpoint should fall within the limits of 80.00% to 125.00% for equivalence to be 
concluded [ FDA, 2015 ]. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Superiority 
Assay sensitivity will be shown if the 3M Inhaler and Symbicort Reference Inhaler are both 
statistically superior to placebo ( P<0.05) with regards to both study primary endpoints. 
3M 
Protocol CSP-07-000034: Amendment [ADDRESS_46196], the analysis will be performed using an analysis of covariance model 
fitted to each primary endpoint. Treatment (3M Inhaler, Symbicort Reference Inhaler, and 
placebo) will be included as a fixed effect. Baseline FEV 1 will also be included as a 
continuous covariate (using the definition appropriate for each endpoint). The LS means will 
be derived for each treatment, and LS mean differences will be calculated by [CONTACT_44072] (3M Inhaler and Symbicort Reference Inhaler) with placebo for each 
primary endpoint. Standard errors and 2-sided 95% CIs will be calculated for LS means and 
LS mean differences. In addition, 2-sided P values will be presented for the LS mean 
differences. The superiority of each active treatment compared with placebo will have been 
demonstrated if the P value for the pairwise comparison is statistically significant at the 
5% level. 
Assay sensitivity will be achieved if both pairwise comparisons (3M Inhaler compared with 
Symbicort Reference Inhaler compared with placebo) are statistically significant at the 
P<0.[ADDRESS_46197] in determining whether the incidence and severity of adverse reactions 
are different among the 3 treatment groups. 
 
7.5.3 Other Analyses 
Summary statistical analyses will be provided for demographics, medical history, risk factor 
variables at baseline, and study medication compliance.

7.5.4 Blinded Sample Size Re-estimation 
A blinded sample size re-estimation may be performed after 30% of the subjects are enrolled 
to check for the sample size assumptions and, if necessary, increase the sample size. 
However, if a sample size re-estimation was to be performed, details would be prespecified in 
a protocol amendment prior to any statistical analysis of the data.

performed, details would be prespecified in a protocol amendment prior to any statistical 
analysis of the data.

Exclusion Criteria #9: 
 
Has a current diagnosis or history of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency 
virus as determined by [CONTACT_44058] , or active tuberculosis as 
determined by [CONTACT_44059] 
 
6.[ADDRESS_46225]’s FEV [ADDRESS_46226] 
demonstrate an FEV 1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of predicted normal. Those who fail to meet this 
criterion may present for repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_44042] 7 days. 
 
Subjects who demonstrate an FEV 1 of ≥45% and ≤85% of predicted normal will then be 
administered albuterol 360 µg delivered via a pMDI with a spacer. The reversibility of FEV 1 
will be assessed with a second spi[INVESTIGATOR_1891] 30 minutes (±5 minutes) later. To meet 
the entry criteria, subjects must demonstrate ≥15% reversibility of FEV 1 (reversibility of 
14.50% to 14.99% will be rounded to 15%) and a ≥0.2 L increase within 30 minutes 
(±5 minutes) following the administration of 360 µg albuterol delivered via a pMDI. 
Subjects who demonstrate reversibility of FEV 1 ≥10% and <14.5% or those who fail to 
how an increase of >0.20 L within 30 minutes (±5 minutes) of [ADDRESS_46227] be conducted at the same time of day (±1 hour) as the 
original screening assessment. Subjects who meet the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44052]-in period (provided they meet all other inclusion criteria and none of 
the exclusion criteria). Subjects who required repeat spi[INVESTIGATOR_44053] 21 days after the initial screening visit (versus approximately 14 days after the 
initial screening visit for subjects who do not require repeat testing). If the subject fails to 
meet all of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_44054] (see 
Section 4.1.1) upon repeat testing, the subject will be considered to have failed screening.

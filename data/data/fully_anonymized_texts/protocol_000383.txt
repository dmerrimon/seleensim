BACKGROUND AND STUDY  RATIONALE  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to US 
and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  (International Conference on Harmonization 
ICHE6), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, and other applicable government regulations and 
Institutional re search policies and procedures. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s of noncompliance will be documented.   
 The purpose of this active comparator study is to evaluate the effect of two different standard care 
approaches to anesthesia care for hip fracture surgery on recovery of ambulation at approximately 60 
days (primary  outcome) and other patient -center ed outcomes measured at 365 days (plus or minus 60 
days) . The two approaches are spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_100122]) and general anesthesia. Our overarching 
hypothesis is that patients undergoing hip fracture surgery with spi [INVESTIGATOR_323108] 60 days and better outcomes across a range of patient -centered 
endpoints compared to patients receiving general anesthesia.  
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
 Hip fracture  is a clinical condition that involves a break 
in the femur (hip bone) near where it attaches to th e 
pelvis (Figure 1). Over 90% of hip fractures occur in individuals aged [ADDRESS_398905] commonly resulting 
from low -energy traumatic injuries, such as falls from 
standing in the context of established osteoporosis, 
chronic illness, or disability. Surgic al treatment, via 
fixation of the fractured bone or partial or total replacement of the hip joint, is indicated for all types of 
hip fractures and approximately 95% of hip fracture 
patients undergo surgery.  
 
Hip fractures occur more than 300,000 times each year 
in the US  and over 1.6 million times  each year  
worldwide. Hip fractures carry  major consequences for 
the individual and society.
6, 7 Within 12 months of 
fracture, 25% of patients die,8, 9 and half of previously 
community -dwelling patients either die or require 
nursing home admission.10 Among patients who survive 
to 12 months, 40% of those who could walk independently before fracture require human assistance 
to walk [ADDRESS_398906]-acute and long-
term care that  carry major costs to society ;14 the 
estimated costs attributable to hip fractures in the US exc eeded $12 Billion in 2005 and will  exceed $18 
Billion by 2025.15 Moreover, t he disability caused by [CONTACT_323190]. In a study of 
patient views on hip fracture, 194 women aged 75 or older read hypothetical scenarios describing a 
“good” hip fracture after w hich they would continue to live independently, and a “bad” hip fracture that 
would require admission to a nursing home. Of women surveyed, 80% stated that they would rather die than experience the loss of independence associated with a “bad”  hip fracture.

Figure 2: Proposed causal pathway linking spi[INVESTIGATOR_323109] -centered end -outcomes after hip fracture.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_323110] (defined below) represent the two standard care approaches to anesthesia 
for hip fracture surgery.23 Basic and clinical research has identified multiple plausible mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_323191][INVESTIGATOR_323111]; nonetheless, major guidelines and 
systematic reviews have identified key evidence gaps 24-[ADDRESS_398908] interventions are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_80454].33 
1.2.1  Clinical Data to Date  
Multiple clinical and laboratory studies provide evidence for 
physiologic effects of general 
and regional anesthesia that 
may plausibly lead to 
differences in important 
downstream patient -centered 
outcomes. These effects are 
summarized in Figure 2.  
 
Pulmonary effects of general 
versus spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]:  
General anesthesia negatively 
impacts lung function by 
[CONTACT_323192],34-36 keep individual lung units (alveoli) open,37, [ADDRESS_398909],  spi[INVESTIGATOR_323112].44-46 Compared to general anesthesia, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_323113]47-49 and lower 
rates  of postoperative pneumonia.48, 50, 51 A recent  large retrospective study by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_323114] a lower odds 
of pulmonary complications with regional anesthesia among 18,159 patients undergoing hip fracture 
surgery (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.75, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.89).52   
 
Effects on pain pathways:  With g eneral anesthesia, intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_323115]; under -dosing of these drugs and inadequate pain control may lead to the development 
of long- term pain by [CONTACT_323193] (“central sensitization”).53-55 
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 5 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398910], potentially  contributing to better short - and long- term pain outcomes.56-58 
 
Effects on cognition:  General anesthesia impairs brain cell (neuron) function by [CONTACT_323194];59, 60 signaling of impulses between neurons;61-64 and systems that balance levels of 
important ions, such as calcium, within neurons.65 General anesthesia has been shown to impair short - 
and long- term memory acquisition.66-69 A 2004 meta- analysis  of seven trials47, 48, 50, 51, 70-72 found lower 
rates of postoperative confusion among patients who received spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] v ersus general anesthesia for hip 
fracture surgery (relative risk (RR),  spi[INVESTIGATOR_323116]: 0.50, 95% confidence interval ( CI): 
0.26 to 0.95).26 Additionally, a  large retrospective study suggested lower rates of cognitive impairment 
with spi[INVESTIGATOR_323117] 6 and 12 months after hip fracture.73  
 
Effects on patient -centered end- outcomes:  Few prospective studies to date have examined differences in 
patient -centered end- outcomes with spi[INVESTIGATOR_323118].   
 
Mortality:  A 2004 meta- analysis of eight small randomized trials of spi[INVESTIGATOR_323119] a lower 30- day mortality with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227] (RR 0.69, 95% CI : 0.50, 0.95) .[ADDRESS_398911] substantial limitations; many were 
completed prior to the 1990’s, and may thus have limited relevance to current practice and the 
methodological quality  of included trials was judged to be low overall.25, 26 More recently,  in a 
retrospective study of 18,159 hip fracture patients, the PI (Neuman) observed significant decreases in the 
adjusted odds of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323120] (OR: 0.71, 95% CI 0.54, 
0.93),[ADDRESS_398912] yielded equivocal results regarding the 
association of anesthesia type with in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]74 or 30- day mortality29 differences.  Importantly, even well -
done non -randomized studies  of anesthesia care for hip fracture patients  are substantially limited by 
[CONTACT_323195] : since patients who receive regional anesthesia tend to be older and sicker than 
those who receive general anesthesia,29, 52, 75 non-randomized studies will tend to underestimate any true 
benefits of spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  
 
Functional endpoints:  To date, the association between anesthesia technique and functional endpoints 
has only been investigated in non-randomized studies. Historical cohort studies have shown inconsistent 
associations between anesthesia technique and locomotion after hip fracture.76,73 As a pi[INVESTIGATOR_323121], we conducted a retrospective (non- randomized) analysis of data collected in the FOCUS 
trial,77, 78 a 47- center trial of t ransfusion management strategies  in 2,016 hip fracture patients. While we 
found that patients who received spi[INVESTIGATOR_323122] (mean age 82.5 years vs. 80.9 years, P<0.001) they were slightly more likely to be alive and 
able to walk independently at 60 days (65.3% vs 64.9%) although this difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.86) .  
 
Evidence gaps:  Major gaps in evidence persist regarding the comparative effectiveness of common 
anesthesia options  for hip fracture surgery. A 2011 systematic review by [CONTACT_323196] “no recent randomized trials were identified that fully address” the clinical effectiveness of regional versus general anesthesia for hip fracture surger y, and found that the available evidence “is old 
and does not reflect current practice.”
25 The 2014 A merican Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons’  guidelines 
for hip fracture care also note that available randomized studies are likely to be outdated and that “future 
research involving appropriately randomized patients may yet delineate whi ch anesthesia technique is 
more appropriate in this patient population.”[ADDRESS_398913] care approaches to 
anesthesia for hip fracture surgery (spi[INVESTIGATOR_323110]) on recovery of ambulation at  
approximately  60 days (primary outcome) and other patient -center ed outcomes measured at up to 
approximately 14 months  (365 days plus or minus 60 days) after randomization. The overarching 
hypothesis  of this study  is that patients who receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_323123] 6 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398914] better outcomes across a range of patient -centered 
endpoints compared to patients who receive general anesthesia.

3.[ADDRESS_398915] Recruitment  
Hip fracture is  an acute condition requiring urgent  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; as such, all subjects will be recruited in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323128]. O rthopedic surgeons 
performing hip fracture surgery at each recruiting site will be contact[CONTACT_323199]. Patients under the care of non-
participating orthopedic surgeons will not be recruited into this study . A list of non -participating orthopedic 
surgeons will be maintained by [CONTACT_323200].

 Site CRCs, Clinical Directors and other appropriate personnel will use multiple strategies  to identify  
potentially eligible patients, potentially including interval calls to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323129], specific 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323130] , relevant attendi ngs, resident s, or physician extender s (physician assistant s or 
advanced practice nurses ); reviews of  inpatient census lists and operating room schedules;  and requests 
to physicians and physician extenders, emergency room personnel, ward clerks and floor nurses to 
contact  [CONTACT_323201] a hip fracture patient is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
For potentially eligible patients, the site CRC, site Clinical Director or other  appropriately  trained study 
staff member will approach t he patient and/or their proxy between the time of diagnosis and the time of 
surgery to explain the study, complete a brief screening evaluation, and obtain informed consent. 
Alternately, members of the healthcare team may initially query patients or their proxies regarding 
potential interest in participation in the REGAIN trial; for interested patients  or their proxies , the study 
team will be contact[CONTACT_323202].   
3.4 Duration of Study Participation  
The planned maximum duration of study participation will be approximately  14 months  from the date of 
randomization  (i.e. 365 days plus or minus 60 days) . Additional data on survival beyond this point may be 
obtained from administrative sources ( e.g. NDI) where available.  
3.[ADDRESS_398916] s are enrolled. It is expected that this approximate 
number of  subjects will be enrolled (i.e. informed consent for participation will be obtained) in order to 
produce approximately 1,600 randomized patients. This estimate is based on an assumption that one in 
three patients (33%) who undergo consent prior to surgery will be found to be ineligible for randomization 
on the day of surgery due to active clinical issues, timing of medicat ion dosing, or clinical assessments by 
[CONTACT_323203] .  
3.6 Enrollment of children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners :  
Children, pregnant women, fetuses, neonates, or prisoners are not included in this research study.  
[ADDRESS_398917] care approaches to 
anesthesia for hip fracture. Study endpoints will be assessed via in- person interview (during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]), medical record review, telephone interview (after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]), and a vital records 
database search.  
4.1.1  Screening Phase  
Subjects will be screened in person by [CONTACT_323204], the site Clinical Director, or other designated study 
staff betw een the time of presentation and the time of surgery. Written informed consent  and HIPAA 
authorization will be obtained in person from patients or their proxies (in cases where patients are unable 
to provide informed consent) by [CONTACT_323204], the site Clinical Director, or other designated study staff. A 
series of questions will be asked of patients or their proxies to determine if the potential subject is within 
the correct age range and to assess other inclusion and exclusion criteria. For potential subjects who may 
be eligible based on these criteria,  written  informed consent will be obtained from patients or (where 
necessary) their proxies.  
 Consenting patients will undergo an interview, to be carried out by [CONTACT_323204], the site Clinical Di rector, or 
other designated study staff,  to collect necessary pre- randomization baseline data. Potentially eligible 
patients will undergo a final pre- randomization screening evaluation on the day of surgery to verify 
eligibility for randomization; since th e assigned anesthesiologist is often not known before the day of 
surgery, and since changes in patient clinical status over time may impact eligibility, this evaluation will be 
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 8 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398918] care spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163]. The study intervention phase will comprise the 
intraoperative anesthesia care epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], with the choice of primary anesthetic modality determined by [CONTACT_323205].   
4.1.3  Follow Up Phase  
The follow up phase will extend from the end of the anesthesia care epi[INVESTIGATOR_323131] 14 
months  (i.e. 365 days +/ - 60 days)  after the date of randomization.   
4.1.4  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment regimens in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization 
will occur  on the day of surgery via an automated algorithm constructed by [CONTACT_323206].  For 
each arm, balanced randomization of subjects, stratified by [CONTACT_3725], gender, and fracture type (intracapsular 
versus extracapsular), will be achieved by [CONTACT_323207] a variable block size.80, 81 
The randomization seed and actual algorithm will be kept by [CONTACT_323208] . Study procedures 
for randomization of subjects are detailed in Section 6.2.1 below.  
4.2 Study Endpoints  
4.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
Independence in walking at 60 days after randomization  (Primary outcome).  The primary outcome 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_109796]/or proxy telephone interview at  60 days after randomization (+/- 30 days ). 
Patients who report being unable to walk 10 feet or across a room without human assistance, or who die 
within 60 days  of fracture will be classified as treatment failures ; patients who require a cane or walker , 
but not human assistance,  will not be classified as treatment failures , although data regarding the need 
for assistive devices will be collected for analysis as a secondary outcome.  This outcome will also be 
assessed by t elephone interview at 180 days  (+/- 45 days)  and at 36 5 days  (+/- 60 days)  where feasible 
for analysis as secondary study endpoint s. 
4.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
Overall health and disability .  Overall health and disability will be assessed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -person patient and/ or 
proxy interview at baseline and by [CONTACT_323209] 60  days (+/ - 30 days) , 180 days  (+/- 45 days) , 
and 365 days (+/- 60 days)  after randomization  via the 12- item World Health Organization Disability 
Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0).82 The WHODAS 2.0 is a patient -reported outcome that 
assesses cognition, mobility, self -care, interpersonal relationships, work and household roles, and 
participation in society. It can be administered in person or by [CONTACT_323210] 5 minutes .83 The 
WHODAS 2.0 is scored on a scale from 0 (no disability) to 4 (extreme disability) f or each of 12 items ; item 
scores are summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0- 48.  The total score is divided by 48 and 
multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage of the maximum disability scor e; disability is classified as 
none (0- 4%), mild (5 -24%), moderate (25- 49%), severe (50- 95%) and complete (96- 100%).83, 84 The 
WHODAS has been validated across multiple conditions,85-90 and has good criterion and convergent 
validity for assessing postoperative recovery at 3, and 6 months , with excellent responsiveness and 
internal consistency (Chronbach’s Alpha > 0.90).91

patients  not residing in long -term nursing homes prior to fracture (93% of all U.S. hip fracture patients) ,92 
the percentage returning home at each time point will be assessed as a secondary outcome.  
  
Chronic pain. P ain symptoms  will be ass essed by  [CONTACT_109796]/or proxy  telephone interv iew at 60 days 
(+/- 30 days),  180 days  (+/- 45 days), and 365 days (+/ - 60 days)  after randomization using the Numeric 
Rating Scale (NRS), by [CONTACT_323212] 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain imaginable); pain items will assess the extent of pain at worst and on average over the past 24 hours, using similar 
wording to selected Brief Pain Inventory items.
93, 94An additional item will query patients as to whether 
they are actively taking prescription medications for pain.  
  
All-cause mortality . Vital status will be assessed via patient and/or proxy telephone interview  at 60 days 
(+/- 30 days),  180 days  (+/- 45 days), and 365 days (+/ - 60 days)  after randomization. Additionally,  a 
National Death Index sear ch will be performed in the final year of the study  for all patients enrolled up to 
that point ; studies evaluating NDI accuracy in determining mortality have reported rates of 83% -98%.95, 96 
 
Cause of death.  Cause of death will be determined via National Death Index search in the final year of 
the study for all patients enrolled up to that point.  
 
Acute p ostoperative pain . Pain during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323132]-person patient and/or proxy  interview  before surgery and daily up to postoperative

[ADDRESS_398924] hesia. The administration of anesthesia will be carried out in the course of routine care by [CONTACT_323218], residents, nurse anesthetists and other appropriately trained and credentialed clinical 
staff at each study site. Prior to study initiation, anesthesia staff will be queried by [CONTACT_323219]- participating anesthesia staff will be 
identified by [CONTACT_38738]. Additionally, Clinical Directors will identify  anesthesia staff who are 
eligible to provide care for study cases; experience-  or skill- based standards for anesthesiologist 
participation in the REGAIN trial will be determined locally based on the judgment of t he site Clinical 
Director  and other study staff . As anesthesia care for patients enrolled in the REGAIN trial will be 
delivered by [CONTACT_323220] a part of their routine job function, participating 
anesthesiologists will not be consider ed part of th e study team unless involved in other aspects of the 
REGAIN trial.  Patients who will be under the care of anesthesia staff at the time of induction of anesthesia 
who are unwilling to participate in REGAIN or who the site Clinical Director has determined to be ineligible 
for participation in REGAIN  will be excluded from randomization.

use standard terminology and do not require specialized techniques , drugs, or monitors  beyond those  
available  and in common use in standard care settings . All participating anesthesia staff will undergo a 
brief orientation to the protocol by [CONTACT_323221]; instructions will be provided that all aspects of 
anesthesia care within the protocol should adhere to national, local,  and individual standards of practice 
for the provision of spi[INVESTIGATOR_241098], including but not limited to:  the location of  block  
administration (OR vs. designated block room);  medication selection and dosing;  decisions to convert 
from spi[INVESTIGATOR_323136] ; postoperative analgesia;  and decisions regarding the appropriate 
duration and number of attempts permitted to perform a spi[INVESTIGATOR_323137].  
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
At the time of randomization, providers will receive instructions regarding anesthesia care similar to the 
statements shown below, allowing for minor wording c hanges or revisions for clarity.  
Provider instructions:  
Treatment arm 1  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_57273]): Please perform a 
single- shot spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163], with 
sedation as needed for block placement and intraoperative 
comfort. Please titrate any 
intraoperative sedation to maintain 
arousability to tactile stimulus or 
voice. Conversion to general anesthesia is permitted if required by [CONTACT_100087]. Please conduct 
all other aspects of anesthesia care, including monitoring, medication select ion and dosing, supplemental 
nerve blocks, and management of intraoperative events as per your usual routine.   
 
For patients randomized to receive spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], treating anesthesiologists will receive instructions 
to document the level of sedation bas ed on the Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale 
(OAAS), a simple, validated measure of alertness among sedated subjects.
2, 3 The OAAS scoring system 
to be used in the REGAIN trial  appears in Table 2.  
Provider instructions: T reatment arm 2 (general anesthesia):  Please perform a general anesthetic. 
Please use an inhaled anesthetic agent for maintenance and use intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_323138]. Airway management may be via endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask airway, or other device as 
dictated by [CONTACT_100087]. Please conduct all other aspects of anesthesia care, including 
monitoring, medication selection and dosing, supplemental nerve blocks and management of 
intrao perative events as per your usual routine.   
5.3 Blinding  
Due to the nature of the study intervention, it will not be possible to blind patients or treating providers 
(anesthesiologists or surgeons) t o treatment assignment .   
As permitted by [CONTACT_323222], we will encourage site staff to perform the 
postoperative day 1- 3 3D-CAM assessments in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_323223](s)  who are responsible for obtaining the 
randomi zation assignment  (see Section 6.2.1, “Randomization”)  and conducting chart review s for adverse 
safety events . Additionally, where appropriate,  patients  will be instructed to not  inform the 3D-CAM  
assessor of the type of anesthesia they received. If this is not possible based on staff availability or site 
resources, we will not require blinded collection of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323139].  
 
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 12 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398927] randomization assignment; unblinding at 
the level of the individual patient will be permitted as needed for making determinations of relatedness for adverse events (see section 8.3 below). Unblinding procedures for the overall study are described below 
in section 8.[ADDRESS_398928] Compliance Monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or CCC staff  will assess the type of anesthesia actually received via retrospective chart 
review, to be completed by [CONTACT_323224], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], or postoperative day 30, whichever comes first. While the type of anesthesia received will be investigated to 
assess for the extent of crossover between study arms, such crossover will not be considered to represent protocol non-compliance, since treatment regimens permit deviations from assigned treatments 
based on clinical rationale. Similarly, for patients randomized to spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], sedation beyond 
arousability to voice or tactile stimulus will not be considered to represent non- compliance, since study 
protocols allow for provider selection and dosing of sedation based on clinical rationale.   
 To assess study performance, data on anesthesia care will be reviewed for each recruiting site af ter the 
first 10 subjects at each site are randomized. Further site- level analyses as to assess safety events and 
protocol implementation will be performed on an as -needed basis.

6.3.4  60-day, 180- day, and 365- day interview s 
Interviews  for all patients  will occur  at approximately 60 days, 180 days, and 365 days after 
randomization . Interviews will be conducted centrally  via telephone by [CONTACT_323240] .  
 CCC staff will call patients and/or proxies using contact [CONTACT_323241] t he time of the baseline 
interview  within the following assessment windows: between 30 and 90 days after randomization (for the 
60-day interview); between 135 and 225 days after randomization (for the 180- day interview); and 
between 305 and 425 days after r andomization (for the 365 day interview) . The listings of patients due for 
follow -up will be generated by [CONTACT_323242].  
 Patients or their proxies will complete a structured telephone interview. Additional ly, where patients are 
providing their own responses to interview items, we will also conduct a brief interview with a proxy 
respondent (if available) during the same call to verify the patient’s response regarding the primary 
outcome (i.e. degree of independence in ambulation).   A proxy respondent or secondary contact 
(previously provided by [CONTACT_102]) may also be contact[CONTACT_323243]/her own response at the time of the follow -up. 
 
Participan ts who are unavailable at the time of the initial attempted contact [CONTACT_323244] -up calls  up 
to five to seven times weekly at variable times over the course of the assessment window; for non-
respondents, CCC staff will place calls  to secondary contacts and reminders  will be  sent via secure e- mail 
and registered mail  where feasible to minimize loss to follow -up.  For patients who cannot be reached 
within the assessment window for a particular interview , a letter approved by [CONTACT_323245]’s and proxy’s address providing CCC contact [CONTACT_323246]/or the proxy with a recommended window of contact.   This process will be repeated once 
every [ADDRESS_398932] passed since the 
date of randomization . All letters will be sent using a method that confirms delivery, either [LOCATION_002] 
Postal Service, FedEx, or a similar carrier. Choice of carrier will be at the discretion of the P I. 
 
Calls will be made during business and evening hours of the patient’s residence. Where  feasible, calls  will 
be audio- recorded with permission for quality assurance; audio files will be kept in digital format on media 
that will be stored in secure, locked cabinets within offices controlled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_323148]. Audio files will be accessed for random audit ing of interviews  and additionally as needed for quality control by 
[CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_323149]. When possible, t he results of t he follow -up interviews will be entered directly 
into the electronic study DMS via the 60, 180, and [ADDRESS_398933] copy forms will be used in the event that study staff are 
unable t o access  the online DMS; data will be abstracted from hard copy forms by [CONTACT_323247].

6.3.5  National death index search  
A National Death Index (NDI) search will be performed during the final year of the study to obtain survival 
and cause- of-death data on all patients enrolled up to t hat point. The following patient -level variables will 
be submitted to the NDI to complete this search where available: f irst and last name, middle initial, social 
security number  (complete or last 4 digits) , month, day, and year of birth, race, sex, and st ate of 
residence.  These data will be mailed to the NDI on an encrypted, password- protected CD -ROM or other 
appropriate digital  media via certified overnight mail.  No more than one individual will have access to 
transmitted data, and all transmitted patient -level data will be destroyed following the completion of the 
NDI search; no patient -level data will be retained at the CDC following completion of the NDI search.  
 
NDI data will be t ransmitted from the US CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics via password -
protected encrypted CD-ROM or similar media to the CRCU  or the CCC or DCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_323150], 
and will be transf erred directly to the DMS by [CONTACT_323248]. Following data transfer, the original NDI disk

7 Statistical Plan  
Statistical analyses using datasets  including identifiable patient data will be carried out on secure servers 
maintained by [CONTACT_323250] (see below); analyses will use standard 
statistical software such as R, SAS, and Stata.   
7.1 Primary  Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study will be death or inability to walk 10 feet or across a room without human assistance at  approximately  60 days after randomization. This endpoint will be analyzed as a 
binary outcome.  
7.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include both bin ary and continuous outcomes and will include but not be limited to:  
• Inability to walk 10 feet or across a room without human assistance at 180 and 365 days  
• Mortality (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 60 -day, 180- day, 365- day) 
• Need for assistive devices for ambulation (60- day, 180-day, 365- day) 
• All cause mortality (via NDI search)  
• Cause of death (via NDI search)  
• SBT score (60- day, 180- day, 365 -day) 
• WHODAS 2.0 score (60- day, 180- day, 365- day) 
• Pain scores at rest and with movement (in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 60- day, 180- day, 365- day) 
• New utili zation of prescription pain medications (in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 60- day, 180- day, 365 day)  
• Satisfaction with anesthesia care (in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Delirium (in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , including presence of delirium and delirium severity score  
• Major postoperative morbidity , including selected inpatient adverse events  (in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
7.3 Sample Size and Power Determination  
Power and sample size.  Our sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome (inability to walk or 
death at 60 days ). Figure  3 shows sample size requirements for 80% power to detect a range of relative 
risks for this outcome between two randomized arms ( α=0.05). The middle line shows t he sample sizes

observed in the 2,100- patient FOCUS trial) ;78 the upper and lower  lines show required sample sizes 
based on the FOCUS 95% confidence limits for this outcome ( i.e., 32.1% and 36.3%).  Our c alculations

Assuming that  the primary outcome occurs in 34.2% of general anesthesia patients our planned sample 
will provide 80% power to detect a relative risk of 0.78 for this outcome among patients receiving spi[INVESTIGATOR_323152] 90% power to detect a relative risk of 0.76. These effect sizes fall within 
the 95% confidence intervals for the effect of regional anesthesia on in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], pulmonary 
complications and postoperative confusion seen in prior retrospective studies29, 52 and randomized trials,26 
and are of sufficient magnitude to justify changes i n practice and policy; while smaller differences could 
exist, effects below this level would be unlikely by [CONTACT_323251]- scale changes in anesthesia 
care.  Additional power calculations indicate that the planned sample will have adequate power to detect 
clinically meaningful differences in secondary study endpoints, including survival, delirium, pain, overall 
health and disability, and changes in cognitive status over time.

7.4.2  Efficacy Analysis  
 
All hypothesis tests will use a two -sided significance level (Type I error) of α  = 0.05. As the primary 
outcome ( inability to walk  or death  at approximately  60 days ) is binary,  the primary analysis will compare 
the proportions  of patients meeting this outcome between groups randomized to spi[INVESTIGATOR_323153]-square tests, stratified by [CONTACT_3725], gender, and fracture type. Secondary analyses will 
use multivariable logistic regression models to control for other covariates such as age, race, and 
baseline WHODAS 2.0 score. Similar approaches will be used to evaluate binary secondary outcomes, 
including mortality  at approximately  180 and 365 days,  return to the prior residence at approximately 180 
and 365 days, occurrence of any major in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323154], and binary pain, health/disability, and 
satisfaction endpoints.  
 
For continuous endpoints  such as overall  WHODAS 2.0 score we will use analysis of variance ( ANOVA)  
adjusted for age, gender, and fracture type. Further adjusted analysis will be perform ed using linea r 
regression adjusting for potential covariate effects;  normalization transformation may be considered if the 
normality assumption is violated.  Standard regression diagnostics, including residual plots, and influence statistics will be used to identify outliers and examine the assumptions. We will provide in the analyses, in 
addition to tests of significance, confidence intervals for treatment effect, and various approaches to assess the robustness of the estimates to nuisance factors.  (IR-6)  Other continuous endpoints such as 
pain and satisfaction score s will be analyzed using similar methods . 
 
Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects (HTE).  For the primary outcome, analyses of treatment effects within 
pre-specified subgroups defined by : (1) fracture type ; (2) gender ; (3) pre-fracture level of overall disability ; 
(4) pre -fracture disability in locomotion; (5)  age category ; (6) baseline cogniti ve status; (7)  surgical 
procedure; (8)  baseline pulmonary disease; (9) baseline cardiac disease; ( 10) nursi ng home versus non-
nursing home residence prior to fracture. Subgroup comparisons  will be conducted if any treatment -
covariate interactions are at least suggestive (p<0.20; HT -3) and sample sizes and numbers of events 
within these subgroups are sufficient for analysis. Secondary outcomes also will be assessed for HTE . If 
there is a treatment difference together with evidence of heterogeneity, the relevant covariates and 
interactions wi ll be added to the relevant  regression models to see if an overall difference still exists. 
Additional pre- specified subgroup analyses will be performed for in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_323155].  
7.4.3  Interim Analysis   
As discussed in S ection 8.6 below (“ Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] ”), we  do not plan to perform interim analyses to test 
for superiority or inferiority of either study regimen with regard to any of the primary or secondary study 
outcomes.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_398937] information collected on defined safety endpoints  as described above in 
Section 4.2.3. (“Primary Safety Endpoints”)  The overall study safety analysis will assess the  rate of all 
combined safety  as well as the rates of individual safety  events.  Reviews of safety data will be performed 
after the enrollment of the first 100 patients, and after accrual of 25%, 50%, and 75% of the study sample. 
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 19 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398938] Population(s) for Analysis  
 
• All-randomized population: The main analysis for the primary outcome will include the all -
randomized population; this population will also be used for the main analysis of select ed 
secondary outcomes including mortality, major intraoperative and postoperative adverse events, 
WHODAS 2.[ADDRESS_398939],  satisfaction with care, location of 
residence, and severity of delirium as assessed by 3D -CAM .  
• Per-protocol population: Secondary analyses for all of the above named- variables will restrict the 
population under consideration to patients who received the initial anesthesia type (i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_323156]) to which they were randomized  
• Randomi zed patients without delirium at baseline: Patients for whom delirium is present prior to 
randomization will not be eligible for inclusion in analyses that examine a binary endpoint 
indicating the presence or absence of new postoperative delirium. As such,  this analysis will 
include randomized patients without a baseline diagnosis of delirium prior to randomization.  
• Randomized patients living at home prior to fracture: Patients not living at home prior to fracture 
will not be eligible for inclusion in analy ses that examine the percentage returning to home at 60, 
180, and 365 days . As such, this analysis will include only randomized patients living at home 
prior to fracture.  
• Randomized patients not requiring assistive devices for ambulation at baseline: Patie nts for whom 
assistive devices were required for ambulation prior to fracture will not be eligible for inclusion in 
analyses that examine binary endpoints indicating whether such devices are required for 
ambulation after fracture. As such, this analysis wi ll include randomized patients without a 
requirement for assistive devices for ambulation prior to fracture.  
• Randomized patients without cognitive dysfunction at baseline : Patients for whom cognitive 
dysfunction is present prior to randomization will not be eligible for inclusion in analyses that 
examine a binary endpoint indicating the presence or absence of new cognitive dysfunction at 60, 
180, or 365 days. As such, this analysis will include randomized patients without cognitive 
dysfunction, as defined b y SBT score, prior to randomization.  
• Randomized patients not requiring prescription pain medicines at baseline: Patients for whom 
prescription pain medicines are required for pain control prior to fracture will not be eligible for inclusion in analyses tha t examine a binary endpoint indicating the presence or absence of new 
need for prescription pain medicines at 60, 180, or 365 days. As such, this analysis will exclude 
randomized patients reporting use of prescription pain medicines prior to fracture.  
• Additional outcome- specific subpopulations : Additional sub- populations will be defined at the time 
of analysis as required for appropriate secondary analysis of key study endpoints.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 Definitions  
8.1.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.   
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or n on-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 
• fatal

• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would

and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though 
should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events identified  during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course of each event 
will be followed unt il resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study intervention or 
participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study intervention or study participation will be 
recorded and reported immediately.

would prompt other action by [CONTACT_116628].  
• Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of severity or frequency, such as:  
– Safety monitorin g indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent than 
initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study is of no 
therapeutic value.  
• Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug used in a research protocol.  
• Breach of confidentiality  
• Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a 
research participant.  
• Incarceration of a participant when the research was n ot previously approved under Subpart C 
and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
• Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved

8.7 Medical Monitoring  
The site Clinical Director will oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will 
include careful assessment and appr opriate reporting of adverse events as noted above.  
8.7.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Data and safety monitoring will be the responsibility of the Study Director/PI (Neuman), the study 
Biostatistician , site Clinical Directors, and a Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) . 
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board   
The DSMB roles, responsibilities, and operating procedures are defined by [CONTACT_323254] ; 
this charter will be initially drafted by [CONTACT_323255]. The DSMB will be composed of [ADDRESS_398948]; who do not 
have subordinate relationships with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_323159]; and who are qualified 
through other experience or training  to review the clinical and research data from the study. The 
selection of the DSMB according to these criteria will enable the protection of subjects and the integrity of 
the dat a through a group which is sufficiently objective yet clinically qualified to fulfill the role. The DSMB 
will be unblinded to subject treatment assignment.  
DSMB Standard Operating Procedures  
The DSMB will  be identified by [CONTACT_978] (Neuman), the Biostatistician , and/or the funding sponsor,  and will 
be invited to serve in this capacity until the conclusion of the study. The DSMB will meet  prior to the 
initiation of enrollment to review the protocol, the DSMB charter and reporting templates. Subseq uent 
DSMB meetings will  review the pr otocol , safety and adverse event data, available outcome data, and 
information on subject accrual and protocol compliance; these meetings will take place within [ADDRESS_398949] care based on 
available research and clinical experience.  
 
Study enrollment and follow up visits will continue during the period of DSMB review and will proceed until 
study completion unless the sponsor  or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_323160] t o the 
conclusion of the study.  
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 24 
Version: A2.3 –  March 29, [ADDRESS_398950] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the abili ty to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study 
period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial . Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial  as appropriate and applicable to the study . 
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  Data will be 
collected using CRFs developed specifically for the REGAIN trial as well as standardized instruments. 
Forms will be made available for completion on paper as well as directly into the electronic data management system. Data will be collected from in- person an d telephone interviews with study 
participants and their proxy, and from clinical information contained in medical records. When possible 
during the follow -up phase of telephone interviewing, data collect ed by [CONTACT_323256]. Hard copy CRFs will be available in case of DMS  
inaccessibility.  
9.4 Data Collection and Management  
Data Collection Procedures.  All data collection procedures for the REGAIN Trial are outlined above in 
Section 6  (“Study Procedures”)  
 Data management procedures.  The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) at the University of Pennsylvania 
will develop a data management system for the collection, validation, storage and management of trial 
data. The data management s ystem will use a combination of tools to perform the following study 
functions:  
 
• Subject tracking –  to monitor screening and enrollment and produce subject visit schedules  
• Eligibility determination and randomization - to evaluate screening data to determi ne eligibility and 
randomize subjects according to the randomization schema provided by [CONTACT_293423]  
• Comprehensive data collection modules to accommodate all types of trial data  
Data management system.  All research data for this trial will be store d in an electronic database that is 
managed by [CONTACT_323257] (CRCU) of the University of Pennsylvania Center for 
REGAIN Trial Protocol   Page 25

 Clinical Epi[INVESTIGATOR_69637] (CCEB). The database will be hosted on secure computing 
servers and will be rest ricted to only those individuals who are authorized to work on the trial. Individual 
user accounts with passwords will be used to restrict access to the database. Specific privilege 
assignments within the database will also be employed to limit the types of functions that authorized 
users can perform to those functions that are appropriate for their role in the trial. Additional measures to 
prevent unauthorized external access to the database environment will be employed using network 
firewall technologies.  
 
The DMS will exist within an appropriate database structure to support the requirements of the DMS and 
to promote data security and integrity. Electronic audit trails of changes to database contents will be 
incorporated into the design and will capture and record those changes automatically. In addition to the 
trial database where actual results will be maintained, a development database will be created. The 
development database is a working environment that facilitates the development, testing, troubles hooting, 
enhancement, and training for the DMS without adversely affecting the integrity of the collected project 
data.  
 CRCU servers exist within highly secure computing environments of the CCEB that are the responsibility 
of the Penn Medicine Academic Co mputing Services group. This group focuses on providing hardware 
and software services, systems administration, business continuity, and security services to research 
projects within the CCEB and other departments in Penn Medicine.  
 
Data Security Measures : The research computing environment has a security component required due to 
HIPAA; federal, state, and research compliance regulations; and CCEB best practices for safeguarding 
research data. T he CCEB secures its logical network using virtual private net work (VPN) protocols and 
network address translation (NAT) protocols layered on top of the single logical virtual local area network 
(VLAN ). The VPN protocols provide encrypted “data in motion” protections and “fire- walled” connections 
between each of the physical network segments of the logical network. Applying VPN/VLAN encrypted connections allow all internal CCEB data to “tunnel through” and traverse the University’s physical 
networks as needed, while maintaining security at the logical CCEB network lev el, thus ensuring the 
privacy of the CCEB data and the availability of the data to only CCEB managed resources and users.  
 
In addition to the VLAN and VPN technologies, the CCEB network utilizes the NAT protocols to provide 
private network addressing with in the logical CCEB network. This additional precaution ensures that all 
network protocols running into or out of the logical CCEB network are essentially “proxy” connections that 
are only passed through one of several CCEB firewall devices. Providing a pr oxy service allows the 
CCEB to monitor, log and control all data and network protocols coming into and going out of its logical 
network.  
 
The physical building environment for supporting the computing environments required by [CONTACT_323258]-located within a formal data center facility that is managed by [CONTACT_323259]; Penn 
Medicine and Information Systems and Computing personnel. The data center also has uninterrupted 
power supply (UPS)/diesel subsystems to ensure that adequate and constant el ectrical power 
requirements are met at all times, even during prolonged power outages. The data center has secured 
and limited physical access and is constructed with walls and doors to prevent break -through efforts 
and/or illegal entry.  
 Data entry. The CRCU will configure a remote data capture (RDC) module to allow remote data entry 
from the participating trial sites. The RDC module will be available to any computer with a persistent 
internet connection and will be run using standard web browser software. The data entry screens will look 
like the data collection forms as closely as possible to allow visual referencing during data entry , 
enhancing accuracy and efficiency . Data entry checks will be included in the entry screen designs where 
appropriate to l imit the opportunity for erroneous entries due to mistypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Such data entry checks would 
include value range comparisons, valid data type checks, required value checks, and skip pattern 
enforcement. This data entry module will be configured for single dat a entry.

 NDI data will be transmitted from the US CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics to CRCU staff or to 
the DCC or CCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_323161]- protected encrypted CD -ROM or similar media by  [CONTACT_9338], and 
will be loaded directly onto the DMS. Follo wing data transfer, the original NDI disk will be stored in a 
locked safe or secure locked cabinet within the CRCU.  
 
Data Quality Module: The CRCU will configure a module to assess data entered in to the database in 
relation to a set of rules that describe expectations for those data items. This set of data validation rules 
will be defined by [CONTACT_323260] [INVESTIGATOR_323162]. 
The module will run automatically to inspect all newly entered or modified data. Clinical site personnel will 
review the results of the data validation and take any required corrective action for invalid data. Queries 
will be recorded and tracked in the data quality module. Corrections identified for individual data items will 
be managed by [CONTACT_145889]. All changes made will be recorded in an electronic audit trail and documented using change control procedures.  
 
The DCC and CCC team s will establish specific training and certification procedures to ensure that all 
study personnel are well trained in the performance of study procedures, data collection and data entry processes  
 
A Manual of Procedures (MOP) will provide detailed instruc tion for the performance of screening, 
enrollment, randomization and follow -up procedures. The MOP will provide instruction in case report form 
completion, and use of the electronic data management system,   
 
Reports Module: The CRCU will develop a set of s tandard reports to clearly illustrate the results of trial 
recruitment efforts  and study events,  and to document any safety concerns that have occurred during the 
study.  Additional reports may be developed where regular feedback is desirable. Such additional reports 
may include data entry timeliness and data quality assessments.  
9.5 Management of audio recordings of 60, 180, and 365 day interviews :  
All post -discharge telephone interviews will be audio- recorded with permission for quality assurance; 
audio file s will be kept in digital format on removable media ( e.g. Flash Drive, DVD -ROM) that will be 
stored in secure, locked cabinets within offices controlled by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_323148]. Audio files will be 
accessed for random auditing of interviews and additiona lly as needed for quality control by [CONTACT_9154]

9.7 Public access plan  
A complete, cleaned, de- identified copy of the final dataset used in conducting the final analyses w ill be 
made available within one year after completion of the study.  The CRCU will remove any patient, site, or 
other sensitive information from the final database to make it suitable for scientific use. This includes removal of all Personal Health Information (PHI) and indirect identifiers that are not listed as PHI but 
could lead to “deductive disclosure” such as comment fields and site numbers. Study specific de-
identification methods will be documented in the final protocol. Documentation regarding the data and 
relevant study details will be provided.  This includes the annotated case report form (CRF); a text file 
outlining the structure, variables and contents of each dataset . The study documentation for this trial will 
include the final protocol, stud y procedures, data collection forms, descriptions of all variable recoding 
performed, and a list and links to all primary publications. Datasets and accompanying files will be 
available on request from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_323164]; key datasets will be archived as appropriate to ensure their 
long-term value and usability .

etc.)  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of appl icable study -related facilities.  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential in spection by [CONTACT_28832].  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulations and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics 
Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal 
approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
11.1 Risks  
 (1) Risk of Randomization. As treatments will be assigned randomly, the process of randomization will 
necessarily carry the associated risks and benefits of the specific type of anesthesia to be used here. 
Both anesthetic regimens to be used in this study are standard of care, with risks and benefits described 
below;  
 
(2) Anesthesia Regimens. R isks for participation in this study do not go beyond those risks typi[INVESTIGATOR_323165] e. Medications typi[INVESTIGATOR_323166] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_100122]) are FDA approved to be used alone and in combination for 
anesthesia. Beyond the study consent, patients will also undergo standard procedural consent to discuss 
the risks and benefits of regional and general anesthesia as per the routine of the local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Risks 
associated with spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]: Occasionally, regional anesthesia does not provide sufficient pain 
relief. In these situations, he/she may receive general anesth esia or intravenous pain- relieving drugs to 
supplement regional anesthesia. The risks of regional anesthesia include, but are not limited to, low blood 
pressure, itching or allergic reactions to drugs, obstruction or cessation of breathing, headache, and v ery 
rarely temporary paralysis, nerve injury, infection or meningitis. Risks of general anesthesia include, but 
are not limited to, nausea and vomiting, awareness under anesthesia, damage to lips or teeth, sore 
throat, headache, eye injury or blindness, infection, transfusion reactions (including excessive bleeding 
and kidney damage), drug reactions (including rash, shock, and cardiac/respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374]), blood clots, 
lung infections, loss of sensation or limb function, paralysis, stroke, or brain injury, heart failure or heart 
attack, and death. Patients will have been screened by [CONTACT_323261];  
 
(3) Confidentiality breach es. Risks of breaches of confidentiality are small but nonetheless possible. 
However, all possible efforts have been taken to ensure the security of study data and minimize the risks 
of accidental disclosure of identifiable data elements, as outlined below .

 11.2 Benefits  
At present, insufficient evidence exists to characterize the comparative effectiveness of spi[INVESTIGATOR_323167]; if a relative difference in comparative 
effectiveness between these two modalities of anesthesia is found in the present study, the potential 
exists that direct benefits of participation could accrue to those patients randomized to a given study arm 
who may have otherwise received a different type of anesthesia. However, research participants may 
also receive no direct benefits from participation in this study. For individuals other than the study participants, the present study has substantial potential to yield benefits to individuals with hip fractures. As stated above, gaps  in knowledge regarding the comparative effectiveness of regional versus general 
anesthesia for improving patient -centered outcomes after hip fracture currently limits efforts to improve 
quality in hip fracture care and has been identified as a key area for hip fracture research by a range of 
stakeholder groups. Our study will address these gaps in knowledge through the first adequately -powered 
prospective study to compare the impact of spi[INVESTIGATOR_323168] -center ed outcomes. Given the use of established and conventional anesthesia treatments in both 
arms of the study, and the potential for this study to benefit a large number of patients with hip fracture, 
we judge the risks to study subjects to be reasonable in r elation to the anticipated benefits to research 
participants and others.  
11.3 Risk/Benefit Comparison.  
Based on the considerations listed above, the study could be considered greater than minimal risk to 
patients. However, the knowledge that may be gained from  the present study may impact the care of over 
300,000 individuals in the US each year and 1.6 million worldwide. Hip fracture represents a critical public 
health concern for older individuals and their families; identification of evidence- based treatments  that 
may improve functional and survival outcomes after hip fracture is critical for improving the quality of hip 
fracture care and reducing the massive burden of death and disability attributable to hip fracture. Moreover, decreasing the burden of disabi lity associated with hip fractures may have positive effects on 
health care resource use among hip fracture patients. By [CONTACT_323262], the present study has the potent ial to yield a 
transformative impact on how hip fracture care is delivered in the US and other countries. Given these 
considerations, the risks to the study subjects, which will be fully disclosed, and managed and mitigated 
to the maximum extent possible t hrough appropriate study procedures and supervision, are reasonable in 
relation to the importance of the knowledge that may result from this study.
   
11.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization   
The site PI, the site Clinical Research Coordinator, or another member of the orthopedic or anesthesia 
team will obtain informed consent and HIPAA Authorization prior to randomization.  The patient will learn 
about the purpose of the study, the study anesthesia regimens, and data collection procedures and timing 
at the time of informed consent . For consenting patients, a note will be  written in the chart to indicate 
completion of consent .  
 
Some patients may be too sick or not competent to give permission to enter the study. In these cases, we will attempt to rec ruit the patient by [CONTACT_323263]. We believe it is appropriate and ethical to recruit these patients into 
the trial because these patients are commonly treated with both general and spi[INVESTIGATOR_323169]. 
Extrapolation of the results from a study excluding seriously ill or cognitively impaired patients may be 
unreliable so it is important that direct evidence be obtained by [CONTACT_323264] y. For 
subjects for whom proxy consent is initially obtained, but the patient regains the ability to control medical 
decisions for themselves by [CONTACT_144632] 3 or the day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (whichever comes first), direct 
written consent will be obtained. For subjects who decline participation at this point, no further data will be 
collected; data collected prior to this point will be retained as per the data management and analysis plan 
outlined above.  
  
For otherwise eligible patients who decline participation, reasons for refusal will be documented.

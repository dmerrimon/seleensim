    STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)  
Title:  A Multicenter, Open Label, Long -Term Safety Study of BHV -3000 in the 
Acute Treatment of Migraine   
Rationale:  Rimegepant is being developed for the treatment of migraine, with a 
specific focus on acute t reatment . Effectiveness against migraine was 
demonstrated in a Phase 2b double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, 
dose-ranging study where rimegepant at 75 mg showed efficacy on all four 
traditional endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia  [1].  
This study is being conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of rimegepant during longer term treatment of patients with 
migraine .  
Target 
Populatio n: The study will recruit male and female patients, [ADDRESS_267359] a one -year history of migraine (with or without aura) 
consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, beta  version  [2]. Patients mus t have 
migraine onset prior to age 50, migraine attacks that last 4 -72 hours (if not 
treated) and have had 2 -14 migraine attacks  of moderate to severe intensity 
per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit. A separate 
group of patients with a  history of 4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month during  the [ADDRESS_267360] participated in BHV3000 -301, BHV3000-
302 or BHV3000- 303 (or another clinical trial with rimegepant) may be 
considered for participation in  this long term safety study if all eligibility 
criteria are met, however participation in this study is not guaranteed.  
Enrollment into this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 
moderate to severe migraine attacks per month (primarily  the pa tients 
from  BHV- 3000- 301 and BHV -3000- 302) for approximately three months. 
After approximately three months,  study enrollment will open  for patients  
with a history of 9- [ADDRESS_267361] a history of 4-14 moderate to severe migraines/month  during the 3 
months prior to the screening visit .  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 28 00 patients will be screened to assign up to 
approximately 2000 patients to rimegepant.  
Of the 2000 patients  assigned to rimegepant , up to approximately : 
Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267362] a history of 4-14 moderate to severe migraine attacks 
per month in the every other day dosing group .  
Objectives:  Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rimegepant.  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the frequency of ALT or AST > 3x ULN  with 
concurrent  elevations in bilirubin > 2x ULN  in subjects treated with 
rimegepant.  
• To evaluate the frequency and severity of h epatic -related adverse 
events and the frequency of hepatic -related treatment 
discontinuations.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate the frequency of subjects with elevated  liver function 
tests (AST, ALT or total bilirubin ).   
• To evaluate the frequency of subjects with ALT or AST  elevations  
> 3x ULN in temporal association with nausea , vomiting, anorexia, 
abdominal pain or fatigue.  
• To explore the contributions of gender, age and exposure to 
rimegepant  to abnormalities in AST , ALT , or bilirubin.  
• To investigate the time on treatment and cumulative exposure 
associated with: (1) hepatic related SAEs  and treatment 
discontinuations; (2) elevations in ALT or AST > 3x ULN  with 
concu rrent  elevations in bilirubin > 2x ULN .

    • To evaluate the number of headache days and severity  of migraine 
attacks while subjects are treated with rimegepant  relative to the 
observational period.  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant  treatment compared to 
baseline on the  20-Item Migraine -Specific Quality of Life 
Questionnaire v 2.1 (MSQ oL). 
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant  treatment compared to 
baseline on the Migraine Preference of Medication (PoM).  
• To examine the scores on the Sheehan Suic idality Tracking Scale. 
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to 
baseline on the Satisfaction with Medication survey.  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to baseline on the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to baseline on the Clinical Globa l Impression – change (CGI-c) scale.  
Study 
Design:  This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability 
of long term use of rimegepant, taken  up to one tablet  per calendar day, in 
patients with migraine.  
The Screening phase includes a screening visit and a [ADDRESS_267363] had 4-14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity 
per month during  the 3 mont hs prior to the screening visit. Enrollment into 
this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 moderate to  severe 
migraine attacks per month (primarily the patients from BHV -3000- 301 
and BHV -3000- 302) for approximately three months. After approximately 
three months, study enrollment will open for patients with a history of 9 -14 
migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the 3 
months prior to the screening visit.  Lastly, study enrollment will open for 
subjects in the every other day dosing group  (4-14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month) .

    Upon the completion of the screening visit,  patients  will be provided an 
electronic diary  (eDiary) to document each day of the [ADDRESS_267364] of care migraine treatment 
received on a paper  diary. After completing the 30  day Observational 
Period, the pat ient will return to the clinic with both diaries for the 
Baseline Visit. At the Baseline Visit, eligibility for continued participation 
in the study will be assessed before study medication will be dispensed . 
After the investigator reviews the results of the baseline laboratory assessments and determines the patient’s continued eligibility, the site staff 
will inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. If eligible for the Long Term Treatment Phase, patients will be instructed that they can take  study  medication at the 
onset of a migraine (of mild to severe intensity). Patients in the 2 -8 or 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraines/month groups will be instructed that they can 
take a maximum of one tablet of rimegepant  per calendar day during the 52 
week Long Term Treatm ent phase  at the onset of a migraine ( of mild to 
severe intensity) .  
Patients in the every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to 
severe migraines/month) will be instructed that they must take one tablet of 
rimegepant every other calendar day. If patients in this group have a 
migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose  with rimegepant , 
they may take a rimegepant tablet  to treat a migraine of mild, moderate or 
severe intensity . Therefore, patients  in this group can take a maximum of 
one tablet of rimegepant per calendar day  for [ADDRESS_267365] of care migraine treat ment taken on a paper 
diary. P atients will also use the eDiary to complete  the P reference of 
Medication (PoM)  questionnaire and the Satisfaction with Medication 
(SM) questionnaire  at specified study timepoints.  
At select study visits, patients will complet e or will be administered  the 
Migraine -specified Quality -of-Life Q uestionnaire v 2.1 (MQoL Q), the 
Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) , Clinical Global Impression – 
change ( CGI-c) scale, and the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale ( S-STS) 
on paper form s, at specified study visits.  
Additional a ssessments and visit schedule are outlined in the procedural 
table in Section 4.3. Procedures include study personnel review of the 
eDiary and paper diary  with the patient , assessment of study medication 
compliance , monitoring of tolerability and safety (including vital signs, 
laboratory tests, and electrocardiography ). Study v isits will be 
Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267366] month and then every 4 
weeks until Week 52 for subjects in the 2 -8 moderate to s evere 
migraine/month group or the 9 -14 moderate to severe migraine/month 
group.  
Study visits will be approximately every two weeks during the first mo nth 
and then every 4 weeks until Week 12 for subjects in the every other day 
dosing group ( those with history of 4- 14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month ). 
Patients will return to the study site at the end of Week 52 (or Week 12 for 
subjects in the every other day dosing group  (history of 4 -14 moderate to 
severe migraines/month) ) (+/- 7 days) for the End of Tr eatment Visit. 
There is a Follow -up Visit 14 days (+/ - 2 days) after the Week 12/52/EOT 
Visit.  
To closely monitor for potential drug induced liver injury, guidance on 
reporting potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) events is provided in 
the protocol. Lab results that meet predefined LFT abnormality criteria as 
DILI should be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE). See Section 
8.1.5, Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI).  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The f requency and severity of adverse events that occu r in at least 5% of 
treated subjects,  the frequency of serious adverse events, adverse events 
leading to discontinuation and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities during the treatment period will be assessed. The frequency 
of AEs, SAEs, AEs leadi ng to discontinuation are determined from case 
report forms, and are tabulated based on the number of unique subjects. The frequency of c linically significant laboratory abnormalities are 
determined from laboratory data, and are also tabulated based on the  
number unique subjects . 
Secondary 
Endpoints:  The frequency of AST or ALT elevations > 3x ULN, concurrently with 
bilirubin elevations > 2x ULN, will be assessed by [CONTACT_222437].  
The frequency of hep atic-related adverse events and hepatic -related 
treatment discontinuations will be tabulated from case report forms and will be based on unique subjects reporting such events. Severity will be 
assessed as the worst severity observed while the subject is on  treatment.

    1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1 Background  
BHV- 3000 (rimegepant, /rih-MEJ -eh-pant/) is a calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) 
receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. A comprehensive  
and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated in an 812 patient Phase 2b 
double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose -ranging trial where migraine 
sufferers received either placebo, sumatriptan (100 mg) or rimegepant  (10, 25, 75, 150, 
300 or 600 mg) (Study CN170003) [1]. A dose of 75 mg was selected as the optimal dose 
for Phase 3 clinical trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and 
there was negligible benefit identified with higher  doses . Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed 
statistically significant comprehensive  efficacy across all four traditional endpoints at 2 
hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable as evidenced by [CONTACT_222438] 24 hr and 48 hr 
showing significant diffe rence from placebo on the corresponding 2 -24 and 2- 48 hr pain 
endpoints . 
1.2 CGRP’s Role in Migraine  
The CGRP receptor is located within pain -signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and 
mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. 
For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are 
elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non -migraine sufferers, and treatment with  anti-migraine drugs 
normalize CGRP levels. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in aborting migraine attacks.  
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the following possible mechanisms:  
• Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to 
CGRP receptors located on mast cells would inhibit inflammation caused by [CONTACT_222439], or the meninges.  
• Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By [CONTACT_222440], CGRP receptor antagonists would inhi bit the 
pathologic dilation of intracranial arteries without the unwanted effect of active vasoconstriction.  
• Inhibiting Pain Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP 
receptors would suppress the transmission of pain by [CONTACT_222441] .

1.3.1  Non-clinical Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  
A series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies were 
conducted with rimegepant in rats, dogs, and monkeys . In addition, rimegepant was 
compared with two different triptans to assess potential to contract coronary vessels.  While sumatriptan and zolmitriptan exhibited progressive contraction of human coronary 
vessels at increasing concentrations, the CGRP receptor antagonist  compounds leading 
up to identification of rimegepant did not induce any changes in the baseline tension in human coronary vessels even at very high  (10 uM)  concentrations.  Rimegepant was 
tested using the identical protocols in dog coronary artery (when viable human tissues 
were not available) and no vessel contraction was observed, in contrast to the triptans 
which again showed progressive concentration -dependent constriction . These data 
provide direct evidence that rimegepant acts without the undesirable  effect of active 
vasoconstriction associated with treatment by [CONTACT_222442].  Please refer to the most current 
version of the Investigator Brochure for further details . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicity of rimegepant  was comprehensively evaluate d in a series of 
single - and repeat -dose oral toxicity, genetic toxicity, phototoxicity, and safety 
pharmacology studies.  Rimegepant  is not  genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential 
for off- target receptor interactions or adverse effects on the cardi ovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
and central nervous (CNS) systems.  Please refer to the most current version of the 
Investigator Brochure for further details .

7.1 CN170003  
Study CN170003 [3] was a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
trial of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine.  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placeb o in the  acute treatment of 
migraine as measured by [CONTACT_222443] (head pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at  
[ADDRESS_267384] -dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying an optimal dose to su pport the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant  (10 mg, 
25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive 
design, whereby [CONTACT_222444] -eighth were

    assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six rimegepant  groups based 
on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat 
one migraine of moderate or severe pain intensity a nd then return to the clinic within [ADDRESS_267385] and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be fully present 
at 75 mg [1].  Th is dose was selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical 
trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and there was negligible 
benefit identified with larger doses, consistent with previous ly published migraine studies  
characterizing the dose -response profiles of acute treatments for migraine [8].   
Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed statistically significant efficacy  across all four traditional 
endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophob ia and phonophobia) which was durable and 
persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate -to-severe migraine pain had no -pain (31.4% p < 
0.0018) or mild-to -no-pain (72.1%  = < 0.0007 ) as compared to placebo (15. 2% and 
51.2%, respectively)  (Figure 1 ).

in the acute treatment of migraines. The selection of 75 mg rimegepant  as the dose for the

that inform PK, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy. In total, the 
current data suggests a favorable benefit -risk profile for rimegepant in the acute treatment 
of migraine attacks.  Efficacy was established in Study CN170003, and the overall 
database suggests a favorable safety profile. Clinical experience with rimegepant has also allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the 
intended therapeutic exposure and intended frequency of use. Rime gepant has been 
assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 
14-days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded 
exposures more than [ADDRESS_267388] ion tests (ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and ALP) and potentially liver related symptoms and signs. Clinicians should  also monitor changes in hematology and other laboratory measures. Please refer to the 
current Investigators Brochure for further information  regarding the clinical safety profile 
of rimegepant.  
1.4 Study Rationale  
Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder characterized by [CONTACT_222445] 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typi[INVESTIGATOR_222428]-sided, pulsating 
headaches of moderate or severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or 
vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light 
(photophobia). The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Burden of Disease 
Study ranks migraine as the thir d most prevalent disease worldwide [9] and the Global 
Burden of Disease Survey [ADDRESS_267389] approximately 15% of the adult 
population in the [LOCATION_002] [10], comprising approximately 33 million adults.  
Approximately 62% of migraineurs have one or more attack per month, and approximately 25% have one or m ore per week  [11].  Approximately 80% of individuals 
are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with 53% reporting 
severe impairment and/or requiring bedrest [12, 13] . Comorbid conditions associated 
with migraine include depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease  [14].

    While there are multiple classes of medications for the acute treatment of migraine, 
considerable unmet need remains, as evidenced by [CONTACT_222446] [9].  In part, this burden is attributed to limitation s of 
current standard -of-care pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are contraindicated for use in over 2.6 
million American migraine sufferers with known cardiovascular disease as well as many others with multiple cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.  The US Prescribing Information 
(USPI) for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with 
increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a stron g family history of 
coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a triptan. 
Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary 
artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vas cular disease or uncontrolled 
hypertension. Even in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product 
labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first 
dose in a medically -supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram immediately 
following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be 
considered for long- term users of triptans who have cardiovascular risk factors. 
According to a recent study published in the journa l Headache, an estimated 2.[ADDRESS_267390], rimegepant, for the acute treatment of migraine that is expected to  address these cardiovascular limi tations.  
As discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , nonclinical studi es show that rimegepant is not 
associated with adverse vasoconstrictive properties that  are thought to cause the serious 
cardiovascular adverse events of the triptan class and does not share a mechanism with 
other agents of cardiovascular concern such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatories 
(NSAIDs) and ergotamine derivatives.  A completed Phas e 2 trial [3] demonstrated the 
efficacy of rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine, with and without aura, at doses of 75 mg and above.   Doses above 75 mg were not associated with clinically significant 
differences in efficacy and therefore 75 mg is the selected dose for Phase 3.    
The open label, long -term safety study proposed herein will further assess the safety of 
rimegepant (75 mg) for the acute treatment  of migraine. This study is being conducted to 
further characterize the safety and tolerability of rimegepant during longe r term treatment 
of patients with migraine. Importantly, it will help define the safety profile of rimegepant 
dosing on an as needed (up to daily basis for a period up to [ADDRESS_267391]  every other day, but not more t han once per calendar day, for a 
period of approximately 12 weeks.

    1.4.1  Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open label evaluation of the safety and tolerability of long term use 
of rimegepant  75 mg tablet  taken as needed  (up to one tablet per day  upon onset of a 
migraine of mild, moderate or severe intensity ) for the acute treatment of migraine  for up 
to [ADDRESS_267392] every other day dosing in 
approximately 200 patients for up to 12 weeks. Up to a pproximately 2000 patients will be 
assigned treatment , in this study .  
1.4.2  Dose Selection Rationale  
Study CN170003 was a double -blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose -ranging trial 
of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine [1].  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the  acute treatment of 
migraine as measured by [CONTACT_222443] (head pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at  
[ADDRESS_267393] -dose using a four point rating scale ( no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10, 25, 
75, 150, 300, or 600 mg).  Randomization made u se of an adaptive design, whereby [CONTACT_222447] -eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the 
remainder were assigned to one of the six rimegepant groups based on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of 
moderate or severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within 7 days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study.  Key entry criteria 
were very similar to those chosen for this clinical  trial. 
A comprehensive  and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be 
fully present at 75 mg but not at lower doses (i.e., 10 mg or 25 mg). This dose was 
selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical trials, given that large r doses (150 
mg, 300 mg, 600 mg) showed a similar efficacy profile and there was no pattern of  added 
benefit in dosing higher , consistent with previous ly published migraine studi es [8].  
rimegepant  at [ADDRESS_267394] efficacy across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, 
patients who previously were experiencing moderate -to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p = 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1%) as compared to placebo (1 5.3% and 
51.2%, respectively). For the 75 mg dose at 2 hr, patients also showed significant 
freedom from nausea (67.4%, p = 0.0074) freedom from phonophobia (52.3%, p = 
0.0001) and freedom from photophobia (41.9%, p = 0.0023) vs. placebo (51.2%, 28.1% and 24.1%, respectively).  The lasting nature of these beneficial anti -migraine effects 
were evidenced by a comparatively similar efficacy profile in the 2 -24 hr measures, 
where rimegepant  at 75 mg produced significant 2 -24 hr sustained pain freedom (27.9% , 
p < 0.0001) and 2- 24 hr sustained pain relief (69.8%, p < 0.0001) vs. placebo (7.4% and 
42.4%, respectively) .

    1.4.3  Other Rationale related to the compound/study  
Prior to initiation of Phase 3, a  Phase 1 crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of  a single dose of the rimegepant tablet in healthy  volunteers  will 
be conducted to ensure PK comparability  with the previously studied capsule (rimegepant   
free-base). The Investigator Brochure will be updated to include these study results when 
available.  
1.5 Research Hypothesis  
Long term treatment dosing with rimegepant , up to one tablet per day,  is safe and well 
tolerated in the acute treatment  of migraine.

Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267395] 5% of treated subjects,  
the frequency of serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation and 
clinically significant laboratory abnormalities during the treatment period will be 
assessed. The frequency of AEs  and SAEs are determined from case report forms, and are 
tabulated based on the number of unique subjects. The frequency of c linically significant 
laboratory abnormalities are determined from laboratory data, and are also tabulated based on the number unique s ubjects . 
3.[ADDRESS_267396] had 4 -14 migraine attack s of moderate to 
severe intensity per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit.  Enrollment 
into this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 moderate to severe migraine 
attacks per month (primarily the patients from BHV -3000- 301 and BHV -3000- 302) for 
approximately three months. After approximately three months, study enrollment will 
open for patients with a history of 9 -14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity 
per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit. Lastly, study enrollment will 
open for subjects in the every other day dosing group (4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month).  
Upon completion of the screening visit,  patients will be provided an eDiary  to document 
on each day of the [ADDRESS_267397] of care 
migraine treatment received on a paper  diary. After completing the 30  day Observational 
Period, the pat ient will return to the clinic with both diaries for the Baseline Visit. At the 
Baseline Visit, eligibility for continued participation in the study will be assessed before 
study medication will be dispensed. After the investigator reviews the results of the 
baseline laboratory a ssessments and determines continued eligibility, the site staff will 
inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. If eligible for the Long Term Treatment Phase, in the 2 -8 or 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraines/month groups, patients will be instructed that they can take 
study medication at the onset of a migraine (of mild to severe intensity). Patients can take 
a maximum of one tablet of rimegepant  per day during the 52 week Long Term 
Treatment phase  at the onset of a migraine (mild, moderate or severe intensity) .  
Patients in the every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month) will be instructed that they must take one tablet of rimegepant every 
other calendar day, regardless of whether or not the patient has a migraine. If patients in 
this group have a migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, 
they may take a rimegepant tablet to treat a migraine of mild, moderate or severe 
intensity. There fore, patients in this group can take a maximum of one tablet of 
rimegepant per calendar day  for up to [ADDRESS_267398] of care 
migraine treatment taken on a paper diary. P atients will also use the eDiary to complete

    the P reference of Medication (PoM)  questionnaire and the Satisfaction with Medication 
(SM) questionnaire  at specified study timepoints.  
At select study visits, patients will complete or will be administered t he Migraine -
specified Quality -of-Life Questionnaire v 2.1 (MQoL Q), the Migraine Disability 
Assessment (MIDAS), Clinical Global Impressions-change  (CGI-c ) scale, and the 
Sheehan Suicid ality Tracking Scale ( S-STS) on paper forms, at specified study visits.   
Additional a ssessments and visit schedule are outlined in the procedural table in Section 
4.3. Procedures include study personnel review of the eDiary and paper diary with the 
patient , assessment of study medication compliance, monitoring of tolerability and safety 
(including vital signs, laboratory tests, and electrocardiography). Study v isits will be 
approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 4 weeks until 
Week 52 for subjects in the 2 -8 moderate to severe migraine/month group or the 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraine/month group.  
Study visits will be approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 
4 weeks until Week 12 for subjects in the every other day dosing group (those with 
history of 4 -14 moderate to severe migraines/month).  
Patients will return to the study site at the end of Week 52 (or Week 12 for subjects in the 
every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to sever e migraines/month))  (+/- 
7 days) for the End of Treatment Visit. There is a Follow -up Visit 14 days (+/ - 2 days) 
after the Week 12/52/EOT Visit.  
To closely monitor for potential drug induced liver injury, guidance on reporting 
potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) events is provided in the protocol. Lab results 
that meet predefined LFT abnormality criteria as DILI should be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE). See Section 8.1.5, Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) .

 4.3.1  Screening  Visit / Observation Period  (30 days)  
Approximately [ADDRESS_267402] sign informed consent. After 
informed consent, patients will be enrolled in the IWRS system. The patient’s migraine history 
and medical history will be col lected at the Screening Visit.  All patients will continue to use 
their migraine prophylactic or standard of care medications during the [ADDRESS_267403] of care treatment s taken during the Observation Phase on a 
paper diary. After completin g the 30 day Observation  Phase, patients will return to the clinic,  
and both their eDi ary and paper diary will be reviewed for completeness .   
If the patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may enter the Long Term Treatment 
Phase.  
4.3.2  Long Term Treatment  Phase ( 12 weeks or 52 Wee ks) 
Once completing the Screening/Observational Period, patients will return to the study site for the Baseline Visit. Patients who continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and have been 
compliant with the eDiary  may enter the Long Term Treatment Phase. At the Baseline Visit, 
patients will be dispensed study medication and will be instructed they cannot take study 
medication until baseline laboratory results confirm study eligibility. After the investigator 
reviews the results of the baseline labor atory assessments and determines the patient’s 
continued eligibility, the site staff will inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. This contact [CONTACT_222451]’ s medical record.  
There are two different dosing schedules in this study. If eligible, patients in the 2 -8 moderate 
to severe migrains/month and 9 -14 moderate to severe migraines month groups will be 
instructed that they can take study medication  at the o nset of a migraine  (of mild  to severe 
intensity) . Patients  will also be instructed that they can take a maximum of one tablet of 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 54 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 rimegepant  per calendar day during the Long Term Treatment Phase  at the onset of a migraine 
(mild, moderate or severe intensity) .  
Patients in the 4 -14 moderate to severe migraines/month group will be instructed that they must 
take one tablet of study drug every other  calendar  day, regardless of whether they have a 
migraine  on that day or not . If patients in this group have a migraine on a day that they are not 
scheduled to dose with rimegepant, they may take a rimegepant tablet  to treat a migraine of 
mild, moderate or severe intensity . Therefore, patients can take a ma ximum of one tablet of 
rimegepant per calendar day  for 12 weeks . 
The electronic patient diary will be completed by [CONTACT_222452] .  
Patients will also use the eDiary to complete  the Preference of Medication (PoM) and 
Satisfaction with Medication (SM) questionnaire. The Migraine -Specified Quality of Life 
questionnaire v 2.1 (MSQoL), The Sheehan Suicid ality Tracking Scale ( S-STS), Migraine 
Assessment Disability (MIDAS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI -c) will be completed , or 
administered by [CONTACT_093] , on paper at specified study visits ( Table 1 and Table 2).  
Study v isits will be approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 4 
weeks, until Week 52 ( Table 1). At each visit the eDiary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_222453]. Study drug compliance and concomitant medication use will be 
reviewed (and compared to the eDiary and paper diary  entries) and patient will be dispensed 
additional study drug as needed. Additional safety (including laboratory tests and ECGs) will 
be performed per the schedule outlined in Table 1 and Table 2.  
4.3.3  End of Treatment  (Week s 12 or  52)  
Patients will return to the study at the end of Week 12 or 52 (+/ - 7 days) for review of the 
electro nic diary, assessmen t of medication compliance, assessment  of tolerability and safety 
(including vital signs, laboratory tests,  and  electrocardiography)  (Table 1 and Table 2). 
Patients will  return the unused study medicati on and electronic patient diary to the study site.

should consult with the Sponsor medical monitor to evaluate the need for any additional tests 
prior to re -starting study medication.  
7.3 Blinding and Unblinding  
Not applicable.  
7.4 Treatment Compli ance  
Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug.  Patients should finish a bottle of 
study medication before starting  a new bottle.  Accountability and compliance verification 
should be documented in the patient’s study records.   
Patients must be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed  (see Section 
7.2.2) . Treatment compliance, review of study medication doses reported in the eDiary  and 
through review of returned study medication , should be assessed by [CONTACT_222462]. 
Discrepancies between doses reported in the eDiary, review of study medication and information provided by [CONTACT_222463]. Incorrect or missing 
dosing data and migraine data that are reported in the eDiary w ill be corrected through either a 
Data Clarification Record or a Medication Reconciliation Form. Investigators , should inform  
study participants that  involuntary termination from the study will occur  in cases where non -
compliance is identified.  Study staff  should contact a patient  in between the monthly study 
visits if th e patient  demonstrates non-compliance with the eDiary  and document the contact [CONTACT_222464] , to identify potential lost to follow up patien ts as early as possible.  
Investigators must monitor patients for possible cases of abuse of study medication (patients 
taking study drug for non- therapeutic purposes, e.g. for psychoactive effects such as high or 
euphoria). Investigators should also assess study drug accountability discrepancies ( e.g. missing 
study medication, loss of drug, or non -compliance cases in which more study medication was 
used, as compared to expected). Investigators should obtain more information and explanation 
from patients when there are study drug ac countability discrepancies. See Section 8.1.1.  
Cases of potential study medication abuse or overdose (including cases of non-compliance with study medication dosing instructions or patients who discontinue treatment without returning 
study medication) should be documented in the source record and reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate.  Dosing errors (e.g. accidentally taking 2 tablets in one calendar day) should be 
reported as deviations.

 8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as a ny new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of the investigational product, whether or not considered relate to the investiga tional 
product.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a patient.  In order to prevent reporting bias, patients should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of  one or more AEs.  
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs).   
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
8.1.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria at any  dose:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received rimegepant  
• Other: Important medic al events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one  of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not 
limited to): 
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 78 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
o Potential drug induced liver injury (see Section  8.1.5 ) 
o Abuse or Overdose of medication 
 Potential study medication abuse (including cases of excessive non-compliance with 
study medication dosing instructions or patients who discontinue treatment without 
returning study medication) should be documented in the source record and reported 
as an AE or SAE as appropriate . Investigators must monitor patients for possible 
cases of abuse of study medication (patients taking study drug for non- therapeutic 
purposes, e.g. for psychoactive effects such as high or euphoria). Investigators 
should obtain more information and explanation from patients when there are study 
drug accountability discrepancies  
 Potential study medication overdose is defined in Section 8.1.3  
Definition of Terms  
 Mild: Is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.   The event does not general ly interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate: Is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk  of harm to the subject.  
Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical status, or may 
required intensive therapeutic intervention. 
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of dea th from the 
event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered lif e threatening even though drug induced 
hepatitis can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166504]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222432] (e.g., elective 
surge ry for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267436] be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or out patient setting. When in doubt 
as to whether 'hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222433] (but may be considered non-serious AEs):  
1. A visit t o the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] <24 hours that does not 
result in an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life 
threatening);  
2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent;  
3. Admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure;  
4. Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routine colonoscopy);  
5. Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
and requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care -giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family 
circumstances).  
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience resul ts in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions.  
8.1.2  Collecti on and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specific procedur es.   All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 
period and up to and including the EOT visit. The investigator should report any SAE occurring 
after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specific 
proce dures.   
An SAE report should be completed for any event  where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness.

8.1.5  Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of the initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs as per S ection 8.1.2.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND

 9 STATISTICS  
9.1 General Procedures  
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and 
maximum).   
For the calculation of  descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value 
to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline over time.  
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: protocol deviations; interruptions of study therapy; non-study medications; adverse events; and 
laboratory abnormalities. Thus, for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject.  
9.2 Sample Size  
With a sample size of ro ughly 2000 subjects, and with no events observed, the upper bound of a 
one-sided, 95% confidence interval for zero observations is roughly 0.0015. Hence, this sample 
size is large enough to rule out adverse events that occur at rates greater than [ADDRESS_267439] a greater exposure to the study drug. With this sample size, and no events 
observed, the upper bound of a one -sided, 95% confidence interval for zero observations is 
roughly 0.[ZIP_CODE]. Hence, this sample size is large enough to rule out adverse events that occur at 
rates greater than 37.5 cases per 10,000 patients . 
9.3 Statistical Methods  
9.3.1  Primary Endpoint(s)  
The investigators wi ll determine the intensity of adverse events (AEs) and the relationship of 
AEs to study therapy. The investigators’ terms will be coded and grouped by [CONTACT_222467] (MedDRA) available to the analyst. AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_6657]. If a 
subject had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity 
will be reported.  Tabulations will be made for adverse event s that occur in at least 5% of 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267440] of clinically significant abnormalities. The number of unique subjects with each 
abnormality will be tabulated . 
9.3.2  Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The frequency of subjects that have confirmed values of ALT or AST that exceed 3x  the ULN 
concurrently with confirmed total bilirubin that exceeds  2x the ULN will be tabulated and 
presented with descriptive statistics and exact confidence intervals.  
Both hepatic related AEs and hepatic related AEs leading to discontinuation will be su mmarized 
in a manner similar to that described for the primary endpoint.  
9.3.3  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics are made for treated subjects. A 
separate set of tabulations will be made for subjects  enrolled but not treated.   
9.4 Interim Analysis  
This is an open label study, single -arm, study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability  of 
rimegepant. As such, safety monitoring the primary concern. There is little concern, or opportunity, for inflation of type I (false -positive) error. During the course of the study 
laboratory, safety and exposure data will be monitored on an on- going ba sis. Summaries of 
these data will be produced roughly every [ADDRESS_267441] visit.

 10 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
10.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
Good Laboratory Prac tice (GLP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with 
the recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with 
the exception that registration of such Phase [ADDRESS_267442]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_52194].    
All serious breaches must be reported to Bi ohaven (or designee) immediately.  A Serious breach 
is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the stud or protocol, 
which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the 
patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and 
experience to perform their respective task(s).  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., lose of medical licensure, debarment).   
10.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will not make use of a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC). The study  
medication rimegepant  has been tested and found to be well tolerated .  Safety will be closely 
monitored via oversight by [CONTACT_473] , Sponsor and CRO/designee . Summaries of LFTs 
and AEs will be reviewed roughly every 2 months by [CONTACT_2728]/CRO.  
10.[ADDRESS_267443]/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure and any other 
written informa tion provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the Investigators 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267444]’s further consent must 
be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_6179], prior to subsequently 
obtaining each subject’s consent.  
The Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534]’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendm ents (if any) before initiating the study.  
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.   
10.[ADDRESS_267445] ensure that patients, or, in thos e situations where consent cannot be given by 
[CONTACT_1962], their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they 
volunteer to participate .  
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) 
sample informed consent form which will include all elements required by  
[CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  The sample informed consent form  will 
adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Before the potential subject has undergone any study -related screening procedures, the nature of 
the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the 
subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are answered, but before proceeding further, the subject must read and sign a written 
informed consent form. This signed inf ormed consent form will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_2717]/IEC, revisions to the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, a copy retained in the Study Master File, and the date and time the 
subject signed the form wi ll be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a 
copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.

 If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardian or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient sub sequently becomes capable of making and communicating 
their informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the patient.  
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its representatives 
and regulatory authorities may have direct access to patient records.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of study patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

 If the Investigator withdraws from the study (i.e., retirement, relocation), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be given in writing 
to Biohaven.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the current disposition record of 
investigational product (those supplied by [CONTACT_456]) is maintained at each study site where 
the study drug is inventoried and dispensed.  Records or logs must comply with applicable 
regulations and guidelines and should include:  
1. amount of study drug received and placed in storage area  
2. label ID number or batch number or Kit number as specified for the protocol  
3. amount dispensed to and returned from each patient  
4. amount transferred to another area or site for dispensing or storage if applicable  
5. amount of drug lost or wasted

 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267449] to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within [ADDRESS_267450] be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for appr oval.  
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to the 
protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject 
and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved 
written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.  
 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267451] n is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities with 
clinical study reports according to the applicable regulatory requirements.

 13 STUDY DISCONTINUATIO N  
Both Biohaven and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34615]’s site at any time. Should this be necessary, Biohaven or a specified designee will 
inform the appropriate regulatory authorities of the termination of the study if needed and the 
reasons for its termination, and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_34616]/IEC of the same. 
In terminating the study, Biohaven and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_222434]’ interests.  
 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267452] not be 
disclosed to any person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written 
consent is gained from B iohaven. However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB/IEC personnel, 
Biohaven and its authorized representatives are allowed full access to the records.  
Identification of subjects and eCRFs shall be by [CONTACT_10573], subject  numbers only. Only if required  
by [CONTACT_2371], the subject's full name [CONTACT_34704].  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267453] the health of the people. The 
physician’s knowledge  and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of 
Medical E thics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing 
medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject."  
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects.  
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being  of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267454]’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, ins titutional affiliations of 
the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267455]'s freely-given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well -informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapab le of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included in research unless the research is neces sary to promote the health of the 
population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the  physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the 
review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, 
the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive 
results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports 
of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -[ADDRESS_267456] 
be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the 
physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. 
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of  research, designed to evaluate 
their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

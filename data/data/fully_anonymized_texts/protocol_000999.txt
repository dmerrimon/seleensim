Treatment of  Severe COVID -19 Pneumonia  (CARDEA)  
Protocol Title 
for Part 1 
(closed):  A Randomized Controlled Open -Label Study of CM4620 Injectable 
Emulsion (CM4620 -IE) in Patients with Severe COVID -19 Pneumonia  
Sponsor : CalciMedica, Inc.  
[ADDRESS_626728]. S outh, Suite 307 
La Jolla, CA [ZIP_CODE]  [LOCATION_003]  
Study Phase : 2 
Number of 
Patients and 
Sites : Initially, up to 400  patients with confirmed COVID -19 pneumonia  and 
receiving supplemental oxygen were to be randomized  1:1 to Auxora  
(formerly known as CM4620 -IE) or Placebo  at up to approximately  40 
enrolling sites.  
Auxora  Dose 
and Route  of 
Administration : 2.0 mg/kg  (1.25 mL/kg)  of Auxora  will be administered at 0 hour and 
1.6 mg/kg  (1 mL/kg)  will be administered at both [ADDRESS_626729] Infusion of Study Drug  (SFISD).  
Auxora  will be administered intravenously as a continuous infusion over 
[ADDRESS_626730] of the emulsion without any  active pharmaceutical 
ingredient CM4620. 1.25 mL/kg of Placebo will be admi nistered at 0 hour 
and 1 mL/kg will be administered at both 24 and 48 hours from the SFISD.  
Placebo will be administered intravenously as a continuous infusion over 
4 hours via a bag and tubing compatible with lipid emulsions and using a 
1.2-micron filter.  
Hypothesis:  Auxora , a calcium release -activated calcium (CRAC) channel inhibitor,  
potently blocks the production and release of pro -inflammatory cytokines 
from immune cells, including those elevated by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2 infection 
(e.g.,  IFN-γ, IL-6, IL -17 and TNFα) and may interrupt the cascade of events 
leading  to acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(ARDS)  in patients with severe COVID -[ADDRESS_626731] on CRAC channels of immune 
cells. Lending furthe r support are in  vivo efficacy data showing decreases in  
lung IL -6, TNFα, and myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) mRNA production after 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc

4 treatment with Auxora in animals with experimental acute pancreatitis , a 
known cause of ALI/ARDS , and data from a Phase 2a study in patients with 
acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS with hypoxemia at presentation  
that showed both a reduction in significantly elevate d IL-6 levels and 
improved oxygenation in patients treated with Auxora . 
Auxora  is given intravenously, is distributed into the lung within 2 to 
4 hours of the start of infusion, has a rapid onset of activity with IL -2 
production being decreased by >50% at the end of the infusion, and does not 
appear to have long term immune -modulato ry effects  with recovery of IL -2 
production 24 hours after the end of the infusion . 
Auxora  holds promise as a potential treatment for patients with severe 
COVID -19 pneumonia, especially those with progressive respi[INVESTIGATOR_487719] , and given the lack of effective 
treatments, clinical development was initiated.  
Objectives:  Primary : 
• To assess  the clinical efficacy of Auxora in patients with severe 
COVID -19 pneumonia  
Secondary : 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of Auxora  in patients with  severe 
COVID -19 pneumonia  
• To assess the pharmacokinetic profile of Auxora in patients with severe 
COVID -19 pneumonia

Study Design:  Part 1 was a randomized open -label study that consisted of two arms. In one 
arm, 60 patients who were receiving low flow supplemental oxygen at 
Screening were to randomize 2:[ADDRESS_626737] of care. In the other 
arm, 60 patients who were receiving high flow supplemental oxygen 
delivered using high flow nasal cannula at Screening were to randomize 2:[ADDRESS_626738] 12 patients were dosed  in the low -flow arm . The 
committee recommended continuing the trial unchanged until the next safety 
review committee meeting . After the initial independent safety  committee 
review, the FDA asked for a limitation of further enrollment in the open -
label study and for the study to transition to a blinded, placebo -controlled 
study.  Both arms of Part 1 ceased  further enrollment  and fo llow-up of 
patients enrolled in Part 1 was to Day 30 only.  
Part 2 is a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled study in which 
initially up to 400 patients receiving supplemental oxygen  at Screening, and 
who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, were  
to be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_626739] of care . After a blinded analysis of the mechanical ventilation and 
death rate in the subgroup of patients with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >200 were 
randomized into the study, the number of patients in the subgroup was capped 
at 26 . The study sample size remained 320 for patients with an imputed 
PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200. When enrolling both subgroups, p atients were stratified to 
ensure balanced randomizatio n between the Auxora and Placebo arms.  
The dose of Auxora will be 2.0  mg/kg  (1.25 mL/kg) administered at 0 hour, 
and then 1.6 mg/kg  (1 mL/kg)  at 24 hours and 1.6 mg/kg  (1 mL/kg)  at 
48 hours  from the SFISD . The dose of Placebo will be 1.25 mL/kg 
administere d at 0 hour and then 1 mL/kg at 24 hours and 1 mL/kg at 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
7 48 hours  from the SFISD. The SFISD should occur within 12 hours of the 
patient or LAR providing informed cons ent. The dosing will be based on 
actual body weight obtained at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487721]. As described in the pharmacy manual, there will be an upper limit 
of the absolute dose (volume) of Auxora and volume of Placebo  that will be 
administered for patients weighing more than 125kg.  
A study physician or appropriately  trained delega te will perform assessments 
at Screening, immediately prior to the SFISD, and immediately prior to each 
subsequent infusion. At 72 hours after the SFISD, the patient will be assessed 
every 24 hours (±4 hours) until 240 hours after the SFISD,  then q48 hours 
until Day 30 after the SFISD,  or until discharge if earlier. Patients who are 
discharged before Day 25 after the SFISD will be followed -up at Day 30 
(±5 days)  and Day 60 (±5  days)  for a safety and mortality assessment.  
After the first 50 patients were randomized in Part 2, an Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) evaluated safety data from the study and 
agreed with cappi[INVESTIGATOR_487722] 2/FiO 2 >200 
at 26 and to  continue the study  enrolling only patients w ith an imputed 
PaO 2/FiO 2 <200 . The IDMC will again review the safety data after the 70th 
patient in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 <200 subgroup completes  or discontinues 
from  the study and when the 200th patient in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 <[ADDRESS_626740] 70 
patients in imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626741] completed or 
discontinued from the study. The IDMC will perform the procedure and will 
recommend to  CalciMedica to increase or not increase the study sample size. 
No ongoing study patients will be included in this sample size re -estimation 
procedure. The sample size will be re -estimated to provide  a conditional 
power of 90%, based on the evaluation of the treatment efficacy.  
All patients enrolled in the study should receive care consistent with local 
standard of care. Patients with worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_487723]. All patients 
should receive pharmacological prophylaxis to prevent the development of 
venous thromboembolic disease. The type and dose of prophylaxis should be 
determined by [CONTACT_26269].  
Patients enrolled in the study should  receive dexamethasone , or equivalent 
dose of another corticosteroid,  as standard of care. If patients are not 
receiving dexamethasone at the time of randomization into CARDEA, 
starting dexamethasone during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26596]. If 
the patient is already receiving dexamethasone at the time of randomization,  
dexamethasone should be continued on its established dosing schedule. The 
COVID -19 Treatment Guidelines Panel of the National Institutes of Health 
recommends using dexametha sone (at a dose of 6 mg per day, given  orally or 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
8 intravenously, for up to 10 days) in patients with COVID -[ADDRESS_626742] a similar benefit to dexamethasone. Of note, the 
dose equivalencies for dexamethasone 6 mg daily are prednisone 40 mg, 
methylprednisolone 32 mg, and hydrocortisone 160 mg.  
If patient s are not receiving  remdesivir at the time of randomization  into 
CARDEA , starting remdesivir  during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] . 
If the patient is already receiving remdesivir at the time of randomization, 
remdesivir should be continue d on its established dosing schedule. The 
suggested dose of remdesivir for adults weighing ≥40 kg and not requiring 
invasive mechanica l ventilation and/or ECMO is a single dose of 200 mg 
infused intravenously over 30 to 120 minutes on Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_8206] -
daily maintenance doses of 100 mg infused intravenously over 30 to 
120 minutes for 4 days (days 2 through 5). If a patient does not demonstrate  
clinical improvement, treatment may be extended for up to 5 additional days 
(i.e., up to a total of 10 days).  Auxora and remdesivir should not infuse at the 
same time but should be given sequentially  but may be given in any order . 
Patients may also be considered for the administration of convalescent 
plasma in the study  as per local standard of care . 
Immunosuppressive medications or immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_487724] ( Section  5.3) for list of prohibited medications). The  
use of dextromethorphan is discouraged in patients randomized i nto the study.

Sample Size  
Calculation  In the initial design of Part 2 of the study, 320 patients in the imputed 
PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200 subgroup and 80 patients in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >[ADDRESS_626743] been randomized. A constant recovery rate ratio of 
1.43 was assumed for patients receiving Auxora compared to Placebo in 
both subgroups. In order to provide power of approximate 90% to detect 
a difference in the recovery rate ratio of approximately1.[ADDRESS_626744] at an overall 0.05 alpha level, given the 1:1 randomization,  
it was determined that the study would requi re 330 recovery events. With the 
study length of 60 days, the assessment of time to recovery required a 
sample size of 400 patients.  
The enrollment of patients in the subgroup with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >[ADDRESS_626745] 26 
patients in the subgroup randomized into the study showed a low rate of 
mechanical ventilation or death. This finding was consistent with Part 1 of 
the study where no patients with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >200 required 
mechanical ven tilation or died.  The Part 2 study sample size was then 
reevaluated given that the primary endpoint would focus on the subgroup of 
patients with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200. A two group log -rank test with a 
0.[ADDRESS_626746] 90% po wer to detect a 
difference in the recovery rate ratio of approximately 1.49 in the 320 patients 
with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200 who were randomized 1:1 to Auxora or 
Placebo.  To further ensure that the sample size of 320 patients in the 
imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626747] 70 patients in imputed 
PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626748] completed or discontinued from the study. 
The IDMC will perform the procedure and will recommend to CalciMedica 
to increase or not increase the study sample size. No ongoing study patients 
will be included in this sample size re -estimation procedure.

16 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 COVID -19 
COVID -19 is a disease caused by a novel beta -coronavirus, designated SARS -CoV -2, which is 
in the same subgenus as the severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_7686] (SARS) virus. It was initially 
identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of 
China. It rapi[INVESTIGATOR_41330], resulting in an epi[INVESTIGATOR_487727], followed by a worldwide 
pandemic. Person -to-person spread of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_626757] cases occurring approx imately 4 to 5 days after 
exposure.  
In a report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention that included 44,672 
confirmed infections, 81% of cases were mild and without pneumonia; 14% were severe with 
dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50% lung involvem ent on imaging within 24 to 48 hours; and 5% were 
critical with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, or multi -organ dysfunction The case -fatality rate was 
2.3% with older age being associated with increased mortality. The case -fatality rate in critically 
ill patien ts was 49% ( Wu and McGoogan 2020 ). 
In a report of [ADDRESS_626758] common symptoms of COVID -19 were fever 
(43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and cough (67.8%) ( Guan et al., 2020 ). 
Ground -glass opa city was the most common radiological finding on chest -computed tomography 
(CT), and only 2.9% of patients with severe disease did not have a radiographic or CT abnormality.  
Lymphocytopenia was present in 83.2% of patients upon admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. R isk factors 
for progression of disease were identified in a univariate analysis as age >50, lymphocyte count 
<1500/mm3, and a serum ferritin level >400 ng/mL ( Ji et al., 2020 ). In a retrospective study of 
201 patients with confirmed COVID -19 pneumonia, older age was a risk factor for the 
development of ARDS and for pr ogression of ARDS to death; in this study, 41.8% of patients 
developed ARDS and 21.9% of patients died ( Wu et al., 2020 ). 
Accumulating evidence suggests that a cytokine profile characterized by [CONTACT_487754] 19 disease. Increased IL -2, IL -7, granulocyte -colony stimulating factor 
(G-CSF), interferon -gamma (IFNγ) inducible protein -10 (IP -10; CXCL10), monocyte 
chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1), macrophage inflammatory protein -1 alpha (MIP -1α), and 
TNFα were associated with COVID -19 disease severi ty in one study ( Huang et al., 2020 ); 
elevated IL -6 was noted to be an important predictor for mortality in multiple studies ( Ruan et 
al., 2020 , Wu et al., 2020 ); and a case report of a 50 -year old man who died of COVID -19 
documented an increased concentration of highly proinflammatory CCR6+ Th17 CD4 T cells 
along with CD8 T cells harboring high concentrations of cytotoxic granules ( Xu et al., 2020 ). 
The pathophysiology of lung disease in COVID -[ADDRESS_626759] had 
COVID -19 at the time of the operation ( Tian et al., 2020 ). Pathologic findings from these two 
patients were consistent with the exudative phase of ALI with edema and prominent

National Heal th Commission include the IL -[ADDRESS_626761] the 
lung from injury.  
1.2 Overview of CM4620  
CM4620 is a potent and selective inhibitor of CRAC channels. CRAC channels are composed of 
the pore -forming plasma membrane protein Orai1 and the calcium -sensing ER gating -protein 
STIM1. Low levels of calcium within the ER cause the STIM1 protein to oligom erize and move 
to locations closely apposed to Orai1. When STIM1 binds to Orai1, the Orai1 Ca2+ pore opens, 
permitting entry of extracellular calcium into the cell through the CRAC channel. This process is 
referred to as store -operated calcium entry ( SOCE ) and evidence suggests that SOCE through 
CRAC channels plays a critical role in the degradation  and necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells in 
patients with AP.  
The potential for CM4620 to inhibit CRAC channels was investigated by [CONTACT_487755] (I CRAC) associated with calcium entry through CRAC channels in 
HEK293 cells stabl y expressing recombinant human Orai1 /STIM1 . Cellular recordings were 
performed using the whole -cell patch clamp method. Measurements of I CRAC were made after the 
addition of extracellular 10 mM calcium chloride and subsequent administration of CM4620 at 
concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 µM. CM4620 was able to inhibit I CRAC in a 
concentration -dependent manner, producing a mean 50% inhibition (IC 50) value of 119 nM.  
Rapid and complete inhibition was achieved at 1 µM of CM4620. Evaluations were perform ed to 
further elucidate the site of action of CM4620. A mutation in Orai1 (Orai1 -V102C) is known to 
produce constitutively active CRAC chann els without the need for STIM1 . In this evaluation, 
successive concentrations of CM4620 produced nearly complete inh ibition of the STIM1 -
independent I CRAC, indicating that Orai1 is a major site of action of the compound.

18 1.3 Pre-Clinical Development of CM4620  
1.3.1 Pre-Clinical Safety and Toxicology Studies  
Safety pharmacology studies conducted in rats indicated no CM4620 -induced  adverse effects on 
central nervous or respi[INVESTIGATOR_27441]. Dose -limiting adverse clinical and cardiovascular effects 
were noted in a single telemetered cynomolgus monkey dosed at 25 mg/kg IV with Auxora . 
Cardiovascular data at lower doses (1, 3 and 10 mg/ kg) showed transient, non -dose-related, 
slight -to-moderate increases in systolic/diastolic arterial blood pressures and negative chronotropic  
effects (mild and non -adverse) at all doses and in placebo treated animals.  
Repeat -dose toxicity studies conducted  in both rats and monkeys showed no observable adverse 
effect levels (NOAELs) of 25 mg/kg/day and 3 mg/kg/day, respectively. In vitro genetic toxicity 
studies were negative in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay and weakly positive/equivocal  
in a mic ronucleus assay conducted in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. A subsequent in vivo  
micronucleus study conducted in rats involving two different endpoints (bone marrow micronucleus  
and liver Comet assays) showed no evidence of DNA reactivity. Based on th e results of the 
complete battery of genotoxicity testing, the weight of evidence indicates that CM4620 is neither 
mutagenic nor clastogenic. Hemolysis testing concluded that CM4620 placebo was compatible 
with human plasma and non -hemolytic in human blood.  Specific local tolerance studies to 
examine irritation/inflammation at the injection site were not performed, but no evidence of 
compound -related or vehicle -related local irritation was observed in the repeat -dose toxicity 
studies in rat and monkey. Final ly, in vitro 3T3 results indicated that CM4620 is potentially 
phototoxic, so appropriate precautions are being taken in clinical trials.  
1.3.2 Preclinical Efficacy Studies  
Support for the idea that CRAC channel inhibition could be useful in the treatment of lung  injury 
comes from preclinical data examining the effects of BTP2, a widely used research CRAC channel  
inhibitor, as well as Auxora . BTP2 was shown to attenuate lipopolysaccharide -induced lung injury  
in mice and ventilator -induced lung injury in rats. Usin g a rat model of acute pancreatitis (AP), 
intravenous (IV) infusion of Auxora  was noted to decrease lung myeloperoxidase activity 
(i.e., neutrophil infiltration) and mRNA levels of the pro -inflammatory cytokines TNFα and 
IL-6. Finally, knockdown of Orai1 in mice, which reduces CRAC channel activity, inhibited 
TNFα -induced cytokine expression (including IL -6) and myeloperoxidase activity in lung tissue.  
Potential efficacy of CM4620 in treating acute lung injury was established in three diverse in 
vivo models of AP that cause both pancreatic damage and lung inflammation (TLCS -induced, 
FAEE -induced, and caerulein -induced acute pancreatitis models). Myeloperoxidase activity 
within lung tissue, as well as trypsin activity, myeloperoxidase activity and hist opathological 
indices (edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, vacuolization, and necrosis) in pancreas tissue, 
were all markedly reduced following a single IP dose of CM4620 in the mouse caerulein -induced 
pancreatitis model, two IP doses of CM4620 in the m ouse TLCS -induced and FAEE -induced 
pancreatitis models, and one 4 -hour IV infusion of CM4620 Nanoemulsion (the intended clinical 
dosage form, route of administration and infusion duration) in the rat caerulein -induced 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
19 pancreatitis model. The timing of CM46 20 administration relative to induction of pancreatitis was  
investigated in the TLCS -induced and FAEE -induced pancreatitis models, and the results suggested  
that CM4620 may be more effective in minimizing pancreatic injury and subsequent downstream 
events if it is administered early in the course of disease, although later administration retains 
effectiveness in halting disease progression. The timing of administration for prevention or 
treatment of lu ng injury was not investigated . 
1.4 Clinical Development of Auxora  
1.4.1 Single Ascending Dose and Multiple Ascending Dose Studies  
CalciMedica has conducted two Phase 1 studies of Auxora  in healthy subjects: a single ascending  
dose (SAD) study (CM4620 -101) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study ( CM4620 -102). 
In CM4620 -101 ( Table  1), 32 healthy subjects were enrolled in five groups and randomized in a 
3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of active versus placebo. T he dose levels for each  group are noted 
in Table  1. The dose volume of the emulsion was fixed at 1.3  mL/kg for all subjects  in the SAD 
study groups , and Auxora  or placebo was administered via a 4 -hour IV infusion.  
Table  1. SAD (CM4620 -101) 
Group  Activ e Treatment  Number of Active 
Treatment Subjects  Number of Placebo 
Treatment Subjects  IV Dose Volume 
(mL/kg)  
1 0.1 mg/kg  6 2 1.3 
2 0.24 mg/kg  3 1 1.3 
3 0.48 mg/kg  3 1 1.3 
4 1.0 mg/kg  6 2 1.3 
5 2.1 mg/kg  6 2 1.3 
 
Of the 32 enrolled subjects, there were no serious adverse events (SAE) or adverse events (AE) 
classified as moderate or severe in intensity. There were three  clinical AEs that were all 
classified as mild in intensity. Two of the AEs were considered possib ly related and one was 
considered unlikely or unrelated to study treatment. In each case, no action was taken with 
respect to study treatment because of the AEs. No laboratory abnormalities were observed that 
were considered clinically significant. There were vehicle -related in creases in serum triglyceride 
and cholesterol levels noted in some subjects that returned to baseline within [ADDRESS_626762] on heart rate, 
QTcF, cardiac troponin -T or B -type natriuretic peptide levels.  
In the SAD study ( CM4620 -101), interim non-compartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis 
indicates that CM4620 likely distributes to three compartments.  Plasma concentrations of 
compound rise steadily during the 4 -hour infusion, with T max achieved at the end of infusion 
(4 hours).  After the end of infusion, there is a rapid and prominent distribution phase followed by 
[CONTACT_32021]4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
20 a prolonged period of residual drug levels.  The terminal elimination phase has not yet been fully 
characterized as it appears to be much longer than was anticipated based on pre -clinic al PK data 
in mouse, rat, dog and monkey. Plasma concentrations during the terminal phase are approximately  
5% of C max values and, as indicated above, to date there have been no clinically significant AEs 
reported during this phase. Plasma exposures, defin ed by [CONTACT_12265] 0-24h, appear to be dose -proportional  
and reached a maximum of 6710 ng*h/mL in Group 5, which is 4.3 -fold below the mean AUC 24h 
in monkey at the NOAEL (29,000 ng*hr/mL).  
In the MAD study ( Table  2) of Auxora  (CM4620 -102), subjects in the first group were randomized  
to receive a single dose of active treatment, 0.50 mg/kg, versus placebo for seven consecutive 
days. Eight healthy subjects were  enrolled in the first group, with five receiving active treatment 
and three receiving placebo. One of the subjects received placebo at the maximum  dose volume of 
emulsion, 1.3 mL/kg, for [ADDRESS_626763] to study treatment because of the AEs. No laboratory abnormalities were observed 
that were considered clinically significant.

Subjects in the second group of CM4620 -102 were randomized to receive a single dose of active 
treatment, 1.0 mg/kg, versus placebo for seven consecutive days. Eight healthy subjects were 
enrolled in the second group, with six receiving active treatment and  two receiving placebo for 
seven consecutive days. There were no SAEs and no AEs classified as moderate or severe in 
intensity. There were three AEs that were all classified as mild in intensity. In each case, no action  
was taken with respect to study trea tment because of the AEs. No laboratory abnormalities were 
observed that were considered clinically significant.  
There were vehicle -related increases in serum triglyceride noted in some subjects in both groups 
with levels returning to baseline within [ADDRESS_626764] who 
receive d placebo at the maximum dose volume of emulsion. The rise in cholesterol is believed to 
be due to the release of tissue cholesterol induced by [CONTACT_487756] ( By[CONTACT_487757]., 1962 ), 
was noted in the pre -clinical studies in monkeys, and was reversible with  cessation of dosing. 
There was no evidence of any sustained treatment related increase in systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure. In addition, cardiac function, monitored by [CONTACT_138787] s electrocardiographic recording 
and serial biomarker testing, showed no evidence of any sustained treatment related effect on 
heart rate, QTcF or B -type natriuretic peptide levels.

21 Non-compartmental PK analysis of Group 1 in CM4620 -102 (0.5 mg/kg) indicat es that CM4620 
accumulated in plasma, with a 2.6 -fold increase in systemic exposure (AUC 24h) on Day 7 compared  
to Day 1 of dosing, consistent with modeling simulations.  Cmax accumulated 1.6 -fold (geometric 
mean of 363 ng/mL on Day 7). The geometric mean of  the AUC 24h on Day 7 was 3190 ng*hr/mL,  
which is 9.1 -fold below the NOAEL AUC 24h in monkey (29,000 ng*hr/mL). PK analysis of 
Group 2 in CM4620 -102 (1.0 mg/kg) indicates that CM4620 accumulated in plasma, with a 
2.6-fold increase in AUC 24h on Day 7 compared  to Day 1 of dosing, consistent with modeling 
simulations. Cmax accumulated 1.4 -fold (geometric mean 637 ng/mL on Day 7). The geometric 
mean of the AUC 24h on Day 7 was 6830 ng*hr/mL, which is 4.2 -fold below the NOAEL AUC 24h 
in monkey (29,000 ng*hr/mL). Aft er the end of [ADDRESS_626765] and second phases of the open -label study  described 
below . 
1.4.2 Open Label Study in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis and SIRS  
CalciMedica has conducted a Phase 2, o pen-label, dose -response, multi -center study of Auxora  in 
patients with AP and accompanying SIRS and hypoxemia  (CM4620 -201). One patient was 
randomized having SIRS alone at Screening. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate 
safety and tolerabili ty; the secondary objective was to evaluate efficacy and the PK profile of 
Auxora . 
The study consisted of 2 phases; the Initial Phase consisted of [ADDRESS_626766] 4 Cohorts containing 24 adult male and female patients with AP and accompanying SIRS 
and hypoxemia.  In the Initial Phase, 4 female patients were to be randomized in a 3:1  ratio to 
receive Auxora  + Supportive Care (SC) or SC al one (Cohort 1). Concurrently, 4 male patients  
were to be randomized in a 3:1  ratio to receive Auxora  + SC or SC alone (Cohort 2). Doses were 
to be 1.0 mg/kg on Day1 and 1.4 mg/kg daily on Days 2, 3 and 4 ( low dose regimen ). In the 
Second Phase, 8 female pa tients were to be randomized in a 3:1  ratio to receive Auxora  + SC or 
SC alone (Cohort 3). Concurrently, 8 male patients were to be randomized in a 3:1  ratio to 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
22 receive Auxora  + SC or SC alone (Cohort 4). Planned doses for both Cohorts 3 and 4 were to be 
2.08 mg/kg daily on Days 1 and 2 and 1.6 mg/kg daily on Days 3 and 4 (high dose regimen).  
The decision to start Cohort 3 in the Second Phase was made after CalciMedica reviewed the 
available efficacy, safety and tolerability data from Cohort 1 and discussed  this with the Principal  
Investigator  (PI). At this point, a decision was made to administer patients in Cohort 3 with the 
same dose level and schedule as in Cohort 1, as efficacy was observed in Cohort 1. Cohort 3, 
therefore,  received the same dose level and schedule as Cohort 1 , 1.0 mg.kg on Day1 and 
1.4 mg/kg daily on Days 2, 3 and 4 . The decision to start Cohort 4 in the Second Phase of the 
study was made after CalciMedica reviewed the available efficacy, safety and tolerab ility data 
from Cohort 2 and discussed this with the Principal Investigator . Cohort 4 , therefore,  received 
the original planned dose level and schedule; 2.08 mg /kg daily on Days 1 and 2 and 1.6 mg/kg 
daily on Days [ADDRESS_626767] infusion of Auxora  was started within 6 (up to 8) hours of the patient or LAR providing 
informed consent and was administered as a continuous IV infusion over 4 hours. Subsequent 
infusions were to be started every 24 hours (± 1 hour) from the start of the first infusion. In pati ents 
receiving Auxora +SC (all doses), there were 9 patients of 14 patients (64%) who did not receive all  
4 scheduled doses, 7 of 9 patients because of rapid clinical improvement leading to early discharge  
and 2 of 9 patients because of study drug discontin uation.  Five of 8 patients (63%) receiving the 
low dose regimen+SC and 4 of 6 patients (67%) receiving the high dose regimen+SC did not 
receive all 4 doses of Auxora .

23 The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of Auxora  in patients 
with AP and accompanying SIRS and Hypoxemia . In this study, the low dose regimen+SC and 
the high dose regimen+SC  were well tolerated in patients with AP and  SIRS, with no evidence of 
untoward safety or tolerability findings.  
Treatment -emergent AEs  (TEAEs)  were reported in 7 of 8 patients ( 88%) receiving the low dose 
regimen+SC , 5 of 6 patients ( 83%) receiving the high dose regimen+SC , and 3 of 7 patients 
(43%) receiving SC alone . Severe TEAEs were reported i n 0 of 8 ( 0%) patients receiving the low 
dose regimen+SC, 2 of 6 ( 33%) receiving the high dose regimen+SC , and 2 of 7 ( 29%) receiving 
SC alone.  There were 3 TEAEs in 2 patients lead ing to discontinuation of the study drug. Both 
patients re ceived the high dose regimen+SC . 
Two different TEAE preferred terms were reported in 2 or more patients receiving the low dose 
regimen+SC: Hypokalemia in 2 of 8 patients ( 25%) and Headache in 2 of 8  patients ( 25%). 
Three different TEAE preferred terms were reported in 2 or more patients receiving the high 
dose regimen+SC: Malnutrition, Confusional State and Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_487728] 2 of 6 patients ( 33%). There were no  TEAE preferred terms reported in 
2 or more patients receiving SC alone.  
There was 1 TEAE of Chromaturia in a patient receiving the high dose regimen+SC for which 
the causality was considered Possible. There were no other TEAEs, for which the causality was  
considered Possible, Probable or Definite . 
SAEs were reported in 2 of 8 patients (25%) receiving the low dose regimen+SC, 1 of 6 patients 
(17%) receiving the high dose regimen+SC and 2 of 7 patients ( 29%) receiving SC alone . There 
was 1 death during the study . This patient,  who received the high dose regimen+SC, experienced 
an SAE of Hypoxic -Ischemic Encephalopathy for which the outcome was fatal. The SAE was 
considered severe and the outcome was designated recovered/resolved with sequelae. Causality 
was considered to be Unrelated.  
There were no untoward changes in vital signs, oxygenation, and laboratory values associated 
with treatment with either the low dose or high dose regimen of Auxora .

Pancreatitis  
In Study CM4620 -202, A Pharmacodynamic and Pharmacokinetic Study of Auxora  in Patients 
with Acute Pancreatitis, patients with AP (regardless of the presence of SIRS and/or hypoxemia) 
were administered a single IV infusion of 2.08 mg/kg Auxora  and blood, plasma and serum were 
collected for analysis. It was planned to initially enroll 5 patients and then to enroll an additional 
4 patients as needed. Ultimately, 7 patients were screened for the study, and all 7 enrolled in and 
completed the study. On Days 1 and 2, blood and plasma samples for PD and PK analyses, 
respectively, were obtained 30 minutes after completing the administration of Auxora  and 
24 hours from the start of the administration of Auxora . In patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53481] 5 and  10, 
blood and plasma samples were obtained; if discharged earlier, samples were obtained at the 
time of discharge. After discharge, patients returned to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52965] 30 to provide final 
blood and plasma samples .

7 patients was 42 (29, 54) years. The age range was 38 to 54 years in males and 29 to 35 years in 
females. The weight range was 49.4 to 102.1 kg and the BMI range was 19.3 to 32.2. Of the 
7 patient s, 4 (57%) were black or African and 3 (43%) were white. There were no (0%) Hispanic 
or Latino patients  enrolled in the study . The cause of AP was alcohol in 5 of the 7 patients, 
hypertriglyceridemia in 1 of the 7, and unknown in the other.  
A total of 3 pa tients experienced 7 TEAEs during the study. One (1) patient experienced a TEAE 
of Melena and a TEAE of bursitis, 1 patient had a TEAE of Pancreatitis Acute (which was also 
an SAE), and 1 patient experienced TEAEs of Pneumonia, Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome,  
Pyrexia and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68661] (which was also an SAE).  Of the 7 TEAEs, there were 3 mild, 
2 moderate and 2 severe TEAEs. The 2 severe TEAEs (Pancreatitis Acute and Respi[INVESTIGATOR_487729])  were also SAEs . The causality of the 7  TEAEs to Auxora  was Unrelat ed for 5  TEAEs 
and Unlikely for 2 TEAEs . 
1.6 Rationale for the Study and Selected Doses  
For patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID -19), morbidity and mortality can arise from host 
immune responses. These responses can lead to a “cytokine storm,” which in turn c auses acute  
lung injury (ALI), acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), death, or permanently 
compromised pulmonary function in those who survive. Therapeutic agents that reduce cytokine 
release and ALI/ARDS could be life -saving in patients infected wit h severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV -2), the virus that causes COVID -19, as we ll as other 
infectious agents.  
CalciMedica is developi[INVESTIGATOR_487730],  a calcium release -activated calcium (CRAC) channel 
inhibitor , for the treatment  of patients with acute inflammatory conditions, similar to ALI and 
ARDS. It potently blocks the production and release of pro -inflammatory cytokines from 
immune cells, including interleukin -2 (IL -2), IL -6, IL -17 and tumor necrosis factor -alpha 
(TNFα), interr upting the cascade of events leading to ALI and ARDS. Thus, treatment with 
Auxora  could prevent patients with COVID -19 from developi[INVESTIGATOR_487731] -threatening effects of 
pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade and ALI/ARDS, while further preventing permanent 
pulmon ary tissue scarring.  
Human clinical studies of Auxora  further support the use of the drug to treat ALI/ARDS. The 
evidence for the effect of Auxora  on systemic inflammation is found in the differences in the 
SIRS score, percent of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487732] , and persistence of SIRS in treated versus 
standard of care patients in Study CM4620 -201. Persistent SIRS, defined as SIRS lasting 
continuously for ≥ [ADDRESS_626768] the respi[INVESTIGATOR_487733].  A total of  8 patients 
treated with Auxora  in Studies CM4620 -201 and CM4620 -202 (7 patients and 1  patient, 
respectively) had a maximum IL -6 level ≥150 pg/mL in the first 24 hours, with 2 of the patients 
in Study CM4620 -201 having IL -6 levels greater than 1000 pg/mL. Three (3) patients treated 
with standard of care in Study CM4620 -201 had a maximum IL -6 level ≥150 pg/mL in the first 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March 31, 2021 ) Confidential  
25 24 hours. Treatment with Auxora  decreased IL -6 levels to below 150 pg/mL in [ADDRESS_626769] of care had IL -6 levels that dropped below this 
threshold . 
Results of the PD ex vivo  blood assay of lymphocyte function  in Study CM4620 -202 indicated 
that Auxora  at or near C max inhibited CRAC channel -dependent stimulated IL -2 secretion by 
[CONTACT_140992] y 57%. The inhibitory effect of Auxora  dissipated over the next 1 -2 days, 
demonstrating pharmacological reversal.  This result suggests that long -term immunosuppression 
is unlikely to result from therapy with Auxora . 
The dosing regimen for the current study  includ es 3 consecutive days of dosing. The derivation 
of this regimen comes from both the Phase 1 MAD and Phase 2a studies, in that the dosing 
regimens for the Phase 2a open -label study were chosen based on maximum systemic exposures 
observed in the Phase  1 MAD study that were well tolerated.  Population PK -modeling based on 
critically ill AP patients was performed and confirm ed that the simulated plasma exposures  
(AUC 24hr and C max) with the 3-day dosing regimen  would not cross the established NOAEL  
exposures  in any patient . The  three days of dosing  is expected to  provide robust decreases in 
IL-6 levels  and stabilization of respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219] .

27 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 Study Design  
Part 1 was a randomized open -label study that consisted of two arms. In one arm, 60 patients who  
were receiving low flow supplemental oxygen at Screening were to randomize 2:[ADDRESS_626770] of care. In the other arm, 60 patients who were receiving high flow supplemental oxygen  
delivered using high flow nasal cannula at Screening were to rando mize 2:[ADDRESS_626771] 12 patients were 
dosed in the low -flow arm . The committee recommended continuing the trial unchanged until the 
next safety review committee meeting . After the initial independent safety committee review, the 
FDA asked for a limitation of further enrollment in the open -label study and for the study to 
transition to a blinded, placebo -controlled study. Both arms of Part 1 ceased  further enrollment 
and f ollow -up of patients enrolled in Part 1 was to Day 30 only.  
Part 2 is a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled study in which initially up to 400 
patients receiving supplemental oxygen  at Screening, and who meet all of the inclusion criteria 
and none  of the exclusion criteria, were to be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_626772] of care . After a blinded analysis of the mechanical ventilation and 
death rate in the subgroup of patients with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >200  were randomized into the 
study, the number of patients in the subgroup was capped at 26. The study sample size remained 320 
for patients with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200. When enrolling both subgroups, patients were 
stratified to ensure balanced randomizati on between the Auxora and Placebo arms.  
The dose of Auxora will be 2.0  mg/kg  (1.25 mL/kg) administered at 0 hour, and then 1.6 mg/kg  
(1 mL/kg) at 24 hours and 1.6 mg/kg (1 mL/kg) at 48 hours from the SFISD. The dose of Placebo  
will be 1.25 mL/kg administered at 0 hour and then 1 mL/kg at 24 hours and 1 mL/kg at 48 hours 
from the SFISD. T he SFISD should occur within 12 hours of the patient or LAR providing 
informed cons ent. The dosing will be based on actual body weight obtained at the time of 
hosp italization or screening for the study. As described in the pharmacy manual, there will be an 
upper limit of the absolute dose (volume) of Auxora and volume of Placebo  that will be 
administered for patients weighing more than 125kg.  
A study physician or ap propriately trained delega te will perform assessments at S creening, 
immediately prior to the SFISD, and immediately prior to each subsequent infusion. At 72 hours 
after the SFISD, the patient will be assessed every 24 hours (±4 hours) until 240 hours after  the 
SFISD, then q48 hours until Day 30 after the SFISD, or until discharge if earlier. Patients who 
are discharged before Day 25 after the SFISD will be followed -up at Day 30 (±5 days)  and Day 
60 (±5 days)  for a safety and mortality assessment.  
After the first 50 patients were randomized in Part 2, an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC) evaluated safety data from the study and agreed with cappi[INVESTIGATOR_487734] 2/FiO 2 >200 at 26 and to  continue the study enrolling only p atients 
with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 <200 . The IDMC will again review the safety data after the 70th 
patient in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 <200 subgroup completes the study and when the 200th patient 
in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 <[ADDRESS_626773] udy.

more, or if the temperature exceeds 20° C (68°F), or is below 0°C (32°F), CalciMedica or its 
designee must be notified  as soon as possible . The stability of Auxora and Placebo  has been 
demonstrated to [ADDRESS_626791] and/or designee will be responsible for the preparation and dispensation 
of Auxora  and Placebo . Prior to administration, Auxora  and Placebo both  must be transferred to 
a sterile container a using sterile technique. Specific det ails on how to prepare Auxora  and

tables detailing the selected dose level  and volume  of administration of Auxora and Placebo.  
7.5 Auxora  and Placebo Administration  
Both Auxora  and Placebo  will be administered intravenously over 4 hours at a constant rate of 
infusion. They  will be administered every 24 hours (±1 hours) for three consecutive days for a 
total of 3  doses. The dose and volume  of Auxora, and the volume of Placebo,  that will be 
administered will be calculated using the patient weight obtained at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487741] . A line into a peripheral or central vein may be used for the infusion. The 
peripheral IV should be 20 gauge in size or larger. The peripheral IV or central line port should be  
dedicated  when administering Auxora or Placebo  other t han 0.9% normal saline. Auxora and 
Placebo  are compatible with 0.9% normal saline. The IV tubing used to administer Auxora and 
Placebo  must contain a 1.2 micron filter. The Pharmacy Manual will contain a recommended 
procedure to prime the IV tubing and flu sh the tubing, but this may be adapted to local nursing 
standards. 0.9% normal saline may be used to clear  the line to ensure that the volume to be 
infused ( VTBI ) is completely administered. If the administration of Auxora or Placebo  is stopped 
because of a technical reason, such as failure of the IV site, or IV pump malfunction, the 
administration of Auxora or Placebo  should be resumed when the technical reason is resolved, 
and continued at the same rate until the infusion is completed. The total amount of  time for the 
start of infusion to end of infusion  of Auxora or Placebo  should be recorded.  
CalciMedica may modify at any time the administered doses of Auxora  or volumes of Placebo , the 
days of infusion,  the timing of the infusion and the rate of infusion  based on review of the safety 
and tolerability  data by [CONTACT_31849] . If the administration of Auxora or Placebo  is stopped because 
of a serious adverse event that is considered  to be probably or definitely related to Auxora or 
Placebo , the Medical Monitor must be immediately contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
Although the administration of the infusion should be set up to be completed over four hours, it 
is expected that there will be minor variability based on the equipment used and calibration of 
the equipment.  The accep table infusion timeframe is 4 hours (+/ - 30 minutes).  
7.6 Packaging and Labeling  
Preparation, packaging and labeling of Auxora and Placebo  will be in accordance with current Good  
Manufacturing Practice of Medicinal Products (GMP) guidelines. Medication labels will comply 
with legal requirements for labeling of investigational products in the [LOCATION_002]  and the [LOCATION_006] .

43 9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical event in a patient regardless of its 
causal relationship to study treatment.  An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including any clinically significant medical test abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of study drug , whether or not it is considered related to study drug  
administration. I ncluded in this definition is any newly occurring event or previous condition that 
has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug . 
A medical test abnormality (e.g., laboratory test value, vital sign recording, ECG finding, 
physical examination finding) will be considered clinically significant and consequently recorded 
as an AE only if it meets one of the following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires active intervention  
• Requires interruption or discontinuatio n of study medication  
9.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in an offspring of a patient receiving Auxora  
• Is an important medical event  
The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death 
at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
Important medical events are those t hat may not need any of the criteria defined above; however, 
they may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes  listed in the SAE definition.  
Pregnancy is not considered an AE; however, information will be collected for any pregnancies 
that occur during study drug  administration or the thirty days thereafter. Certain pregnancy 
outcomes will require submission as an  SAE.

Version 8.1 (March  31, 2021 ) Confidential  
44 9.3 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
At every AE/SAE assessment, the patient must be asked a standard, non -directed question, such 
as, “how have you been feeling since your last visit?” to elicit any medically related changes in 
their well -being. In a ddition, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112433].  
9.[ADDRESS_626804] medical events during Screening, should be documented as medical history. 
Documentation shall continue until the patient dies, the patient withdraws consent, or the 
patient’s participation in the study ends. Information to be collected includes:  
• Type of event  
• Date of onset  
• Date of resolution  
• Investigator -specified relationship to study drug  and assessment of severity  
• Seriousness  
• Any action taken  
While an AE is ongoing, changes in the severity (e.g., worsening and improving) should be 
noted in the  source documents, but when documenting the AE, only the total duration and the 
greatest severity should be recorded in the case report form. AEs characterized as intermittent 
require documentation of onset and duration.  
All AEs reported or observed during  the study must be followed to resolution. Or, if not fully 
resolved, until the condition has stabiliz ed, the patient dies , withdraws consent , or CalciMedica  
ends the trial (whichever is first ). 
Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or 
progression of disease states must also be reported. Pre -existing conditions (present before the 
start of the AE collection period) are considered concurrent medica l conditions and should NOT 
be recorded as AEs. However, if the patient experiences a worsening or complication of such a 
concurrent condition, the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators 
should ensure that the AE term recorded  captures the change in condition (e.g., “worsening of…”).  
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory test values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If a  diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded as an AE(s).  
Elective procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) performed to manage/treat conditions that existed 
prior to the patient enrolling in the trial should not be recorded as AEs but should  be documented 
in the patient’s source documents. If a planned procedure is performed early (e.g., as an 
emergency) because the pre -existing condition worsens, the worsening condition should be 
captured as an AE.  
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March  31, 2021 ) Confidential  
[ADDRESS_626805] use the following classification and criteria to characterize the relationship 
or association of study drug  in causing or contributing to the AE:  
• Unrelated : This relationship suggests that there is no association between study drug  and 
the reported event  
• Unlikely : This relationship suggests that there is an unlikely association between study 
drug and the reported event  
• Possible : This relationship suggests th at treatment with study drug  caused or contributed 
to the AE. That is, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study drug  administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug , but 
could have been produced by o ther factors  
• Probable : This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the event 
with study drug  administration exists and, based upon the known pharmacological action 
of the drug, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the dru g or class of drugs, 
or judgment based on the Investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the event 
with study drug  administration seems likely  
• Definite : This relationship suggests a definite causal relationship exists between study 
drug adminis tration and the AE, and other conditions (concurrent illness, 
progression/expression of disease state, or concurrent medication reaction) do not appear 
to explain the event  
9.[ADDRESS_626806] use the following criteria to rate the  intensity of the AE:  
• Mild : Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional 
activities  
• Moderate : Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
• Severe : Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional activities

• Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safet y 
reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means CalciMedica determines that there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between  the drug and the adverse event (definite, 
probable, possible) regardless of the investigator’s causality assessment  
• Adverse r eaction  means any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a 
subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug 
caused the event  
• Serious, as defined in Section  9.2 
• Unexpected  adverse event or suspected adverse reaction refers to an event or reaction that 
is not listed in the investigator’s brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed  
CalciMedica  or its designee will notify t he FDA of any  unexpected serious suspected adverse 
reactions  associated with the use of Auxora  that are fatal or life threatening  as soon as possible

49 10 STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 General Considerations  
Data summaries and listings will be generated using SAS version 9. 4 or a more recent version  
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  
The statistical analysis plan and/or the clinical study report will provide additional details of the  
analysis, which may include details of missing and, if applicable, unused data, as well as additional  
sensitivity analyses of the primary and secondary variables. The clinical study report will describe  
deviations from the statistical analysis plan, if any.  
The statistical analysis approach will be designed to assess the significance of the prim ary and 
first secondary endpoint  using the Benjamini and Hochberg method  to control the overall trial 
level alpha level . The statistical analysis approach will be descriptive, exploratory and inferential 
for the other secondary and exploratory endpoints . 
10.2 Sample Size  
In the  initial design of Part 2 of the  study , 320 patients  in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200  subgroup 
and 80 patients  in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >[ADDRESS_626812] been randomized. A  
constant recovery rate ratio of 1.43 was assumed for patients receiving Auxora compared to 
Placebo  in both subgroups . In order to provide power of approximate 90% to detect a difference 
in the recovery rate ratio of approximately1.[ADDRESS_626813] at an overall 
0.05 alpha level , given the 1:1 randomization, it was determined that the  study  would  require 
330 recovery events. With the study length of 30 days, the assessment of time to recovery 
required  a sample size of 400 patients . 
The enrollm ent of patients  in the subgroup  with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >[ADDRESS_626814] 26 patients  in the subgroup randomized into 
the study showed a low rate of mechanical ventilation or death.  This finding was consistent with 
Part 1 of the study where no patients  with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 >200  required mechanical 
ventilation or died.  
The Part 2 study  sample size was then reevaluated  given that the primary end point would focus 
on the subgroup of patients  with a n imputed  PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200. A two group log -rank test with a 
0.[ADDRESS_626815] 90% power to detect a difference in the recovery 
rate ratio of approximately 1.49  in the 320 patient s with an imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200 who were 
randomized 1:1 to Auxora or Placebo . 
To further ensure that the sample size  of 320 patients  in the imputed  PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626816] 70 
patients in  the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626817] completed or discontinued from the 
study. The IDMC will perform the procedure and will recommend to CalciMedica to increase or 
not increase the study sample size. No ongoing study patients  will be included in this sample size 
re-estimation procedure. The s ample size  will be re -estimated to provide a conditional power of 
90%, based on the evaluation of the treatment efficacy . The sample  size re -estimation procedure 
CM4620 -204 CalciMedica, Inc  
Version 8.1 (March  31, 2021 ) Confidential  
50 will not allow for a reduction in the planned sample size of 320 for the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200 
subgroup . If the study randomizes 600 patients in the imputed PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤200  subgroup it will 
provide 90% power if the recovery rate ratio  is 1.34. 
10.3 Study Endpoints  
Efficacy endpoints  will include:  
Primary Endpoint  
• Time to recovery  
Secondary Endpoints  
• All-Cause Mortality at Day 60  
• All-Cause Mortality at Day 30 
• Proportion of patients requiring  invasive mechanical ventilation  or dying  during the 60 
days from the  SFISD  
• Proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation during the 60 days from 
the SFISD  
• Differences in outcomes as measured by a n 8-point  ordinal scale  at Day 12 
• Differences in outcomes as measured by  [CONTACT_1629] 8-point ordinal scale at Day 30  
• Number of  Days in the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Number of Days in the ICU 
Tertiary Endpoints  
• Change in PaO 2/FiO 2 
The primary analyses of the  efficacy endpoints will be based on the patients  in the imputed

10.9 Safety  Analysis  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_487763] (hematology and chemistries), and vital signs. Safety variables will be tabulated  
by [CONTACT_487764] . Exposure to study treatments, 
reasons for discontinuation, deaths and causes of deaths will be tabulated. Treatment -emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) are defined as events that first occurred or worsened after the first dose of study 
drug. TEAEs will be mapped to the appropriate System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Summaries will be provided for all AEs, AEs considered related to study treatment, SAE s, and 
related SAEs, AE leading to treatment discontinuation and AE leading to death as follows:

Laboratory test results will be used in the summary. The lower and upper reference range values 
for tests from the laborator ies will be used to grade the lab results to low, normal and high  Shift 
tables will display (1) shift from baseline grade to the worst grade, and (2)  shift from baseline 
grade to the last grade.  
Vital signs will be summarized by [CONTACT_487765].  
Concomitant medication will be coded by [CONTACT_487766], using counts and percentages. Concomitant medications  
are the medications taken with a start date on or after the start of the administration of study 
treatment, or those with a start date before the start of the administration of study treatment and 
a stop date on or afte r the start of the administration of study treatment.  
Descriptive statistics will include mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum 
for guadecitabine and decitabine PK concentrations.

for PK parameters and concentrations.  
The relationship between exposure and response will be assessed based on the PK data and 
efficacy/safety data collected in this study. The methods will include a populat ion PK modeling 
approach using the sparse data collected. The details of population PK modeling and full results 
of the exposure response analyses will be reported in a separate document, and the summary of 
key findings will be included in the clinical stu dy report.  
10.[ADDRESS_626827] 70 patients in  the imputed 
PaO 2/FiO 2 ≤[ADDRESS_626828] completed or discontinued from the study. The IDMC will 
perform the procedure and will  recommend to CalciMedica to increase or not increase the study 
sample size. The conduction power of the time to recovery will be calculated based on the 
conditional power analysis of the time to recovery  by [CONTACT_487767] . Sample size will be r e-estimated at the  interim 
analysis to provide a conditional power of 90%, based on the  interim  evaluation of the treatment 
efficacy.  The study will use  a sequential design with O’Brien -Fleming cri tical boundary  (O'Brien 
and Fleming 1979 ) at the interim analysis  to control type I error.  In case of sample size 
modification, the final critical boundary will be adjusted  to control type I error ( Gao et al., 2008 ). 
Based on the estimated standard error of  0.25 from part 1 data, the relationship between the 
observed recovery ratio at interim analysis and the re -estimated sample size to reach 90% 
conditional power is shown in the following table :

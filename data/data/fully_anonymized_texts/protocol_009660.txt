Study Protocol : A pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] r andomized placebo -controlled cross -over study. Eligible s ubject s with 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_131519]: (1) Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_131520]. Trazodone vs. 
placebo for 2 weeks; the partic ipants were blinded to what medication they were taking. The 
initial dose of Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_131521] 15 mg daily (7.5 mg b.i.d.). Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_131522] 5 mg 
per day at intervals of 2 to 3 days until a maximum dose  of 30mg/day is reached. Trazodone 
was given at 100 mg dose before bed -time. After the two week treatment , a noninvasive nasal 
mechanical ventilation study was repeated to determine the hypocapnic apneic threshold. (2) 
Cross over medication for two weeks was followed by a second noninvasive nasal mechanical 
ventilation study to determine the hypocapnic a pneic threshold followed by [CONTACT_131523]. 
(3) Cross over medication for two weeks was followed by [CONTACT_131524] . For the baseline hypocapnic apneic threshold the nasal 
mechanical ventilati on study obtained from specific aim 1 was used as a baseline.  
Statistical Data analysis:  The primary endpoint i s the CO 2 reserve ( PETCO 2–AT) which is a 
marker to measure susceptibility  to hypocapnic central apnea, defined as the diffe rence 
between average end-tidal CO 2 (PETCO 2) for the control breaths  on room air  and the breaths 
before  the cessation of noninvasive nasal mechanical ventilation . The standard statistical 
package SPSS (Sigmstat , version 3.5) was used for data analysis.  A detailed descriptive 
analysis of all quantitative data was performed involving the summarization of data, and normal 
distribution . The primary analysis was repeated measure  analysis of variance. In the absence of 
normal distribution of data, appropriate non -parametric tests were used.

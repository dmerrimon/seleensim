 2.0 Protocol Synopsis  
Title: Colchicine/Statin for the Prevention of COVID -19 Complications 
(COLSTAT) Trial  
Investigational 
Drug  Colchicine is an extensively studied oral anti -inflammatory agent  with a well-
defined safety profile. Colchicine,  by [CONTACT_389061] -mediated endocytosis has the potential to inhibit SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_487623] 
antiviral properties by [CONTACT_389062] (Mpro) of SARS- CoV-2. 
The combination Colchicine + Rosuvastatin may have a synergetic effect 
to antagonize SARS -CoV-2 infection,  modulate the inflammatory response  
and to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421] (ARDS)  and myocardial injury in COVID -[ADDRESS_487624] been in use for decades for gout and pericarditis ( colchicine) 
and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], coronary disease  (CAD)  and diabetes 
(rosuvastatin/ Crestor ), and  have been  tested in thousands of patients  used 
individually and in combination with a low and well characterized risk profile. 
Colchicine and r osuvastatin  are currently used as standard of care in COVID -
[ADDRESS_487625] ed 
added risk in the population being studied.  
This study is not intended to support a labeling change or advertising claim 
for either drug, and the study will be conducted in compliance with the 
requir ements of Yale University’s IRB review and a research IND. 
Objective  To investigate the safety and efficacy of the combination of Colchicine  + 
Rosuvastatin  added to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC  alone in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388996] -19. 
Study Type This is a prospective 1:1 r andomized open- label  clinical trial  
Study Design  Subjects will be screened within 48 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. Patients with 
real-time reverse transcription polymer ase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) 
confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection and meeting all inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, will be randomized to either Colchicine  + Rosuvastatin  treatment  in 
addition to SOC  or SOC  alone for the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Subjects  will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of two  arms:  
Active treatment : 
In addition to SOC * subjects  randomized t o active treatment will receive:

 • Rosuvastatin : 40mg daily AND  
• Colchicine: 0.6mg twice daily for 3 days then  0.6mg daily  
Note:  Dose adjustment based on  medical conditions and  drug 
interactions  (see section §7.4.1 ).  Subjects previously on chronic statin 
therapy will be eligible for enrollment in the trial, and if randomized to 
active treatment, chronic statin therapy will be discontinued and replaced 
by [CONTACT_389063] [ADDRESS_487626] of Care Controls:   
Subjects  will undergo SOC  treatment determined by [CONTACT_389064] t reatment algorithm for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19.  
*All standard of care treatments for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388997] -CoV-[ADDRESS_487627] practice, local standards of 
care and published guidelines. Subjects will not be permitted to participate in 
other investigational studies.  Methods for ident ifying  drug interactions and 
dose adjustment are listed in section §7.4.1  of the protocol . Drug 
discontinuation is only permitted with documented adverse reactions  (section  
§7.4.3 ). 
Duration of 
Treatment  Treatment will continue for a total of [ADDRESS_487628] after review of all available data 
with the medical monitor and discussion with the investigator if any of  the 
following occur:  
• Any SAE or >  Grade 3 AE is suspected to be related to treatment  
• Any elevation of ALT >5xULN confirmed by [CONTACT_15013] 
• Any elevation of CK >5xULN confirmed by [CONTACT_15013] 
• Severe myalgias suspected related to statin therapy  
• Subjects who develop renal or hepatic impairment and require a 
protease inhibitor or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor shoul d discontinue 
colchicine  
• Subjects who develop new blood dyscrasia including leukopenia, 
granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, aplastic anemia 
should discontinue colchicine

Binary variables will be summarized using frequencies, percentages, and 
sample size for each treatment group. Proportions of subjects  with various 
scores on ordinal scales ( i.e. WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement) will 
be compared between groups using the Chi-squared test for the ordinal  
logistic  regression model  (null hypothesis  states  that the slope coefficients  in 
the model  are the same  across response categories) . As a  secondary

  [ADDRESS_487635] a 30% likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_389006] (ARDS) , acute lung injury  (ALI),  or death,  mediated through a 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS), associated with sys temic inflammation, hemodynamic 
instability, and multiple organ failure. SARS -CoV-2 infection is caused by [CONTACT_389072][INVESTIGATOR_389007]- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Upon 
entering the cells, SARS -CoV viroporins , transmembrane pore- forming viral proteins, may 
induce the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, 
thought to contribute to the development of myocardial injury and ARDS/ALI.3-[ADDRESS_487636] inflammatory response may help reduce COVID -19 
complications as one observational study has demonstrated that treating COVID -19 ARDS 
patients with methylprednisolone significantly reduced mortality.8 
Colchicine is an extensively studied and safe potent oral anti -inflammatory agent that was 
initially extracted from the autumn crocus. Colchicine inhibits tubulin polymerization and 
microtubule formation, which virtually brings to a halt any process that requires intracellular trafficking along microtubules, cell mitosis and cell migration.
9,10 Colchicine downregulates 
multiple inflammatory pathways and modulates innate immunity.9,11 Importantly, colchicine 
interferes with the activation the NLRP3 inflammasome by [CONTACT_389073]3 assembly or 
by [CONTACT_389074] -associated speck -like protein containing a caspase 
recruitment domain.12-14 In addition, colchicine may interfere with SARS -CoV-2 viral 
endocytosis and disrupt the virus exit from  the cell by [CONTACT_389075][INVESTIGATOR_389008].15 Colchicine is currently being studied in multiple clinical trials as a stand -alone 
agent for the treatment of COVID -19 in the inpatient and outpatient setting.16  
Colchicine is currently indicated for the treatment of gout, Behcet's syndrome, familial Mediterranean fever and pericarditis.
17,18 The cardiovascular benefits and safety profile of 
colchicine  in the setting of secondary prevention therapy including high intensity statin therapy  
was demonstrated in two randomized controlled trials (RCTs): the Low -Dose Colchicine 
(LoDoCo) trial for patients with stable coronary disease19, as well as in patients with a recent 
myocardial infar ction in the COLCOT (Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial).[ADDRESS_487637] anti -inflammatory 
effects by [CONTACT_389076] -MYD88 pathways, often upregulated in severe SARS infection and

Rosuvastatin, in particular, may  have direct antiviral properties by [CONTACT_389078] (Mpro) of SARS -CoV-2. Consequent ly, it has been 
postulated that statin therapy may reduce the mortality of  respi[INVESTIGATOR_389009] (MERS) infection and several observational studies demonstrated 
that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389010].
28-[ADDRESS_487638] studied the use of moderate to high dose statin therapy in

usage and a few demonstrated efficacy with regards to various endpoints including mortality or

 incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia31, ICU length of stay32, development of  severe 
sepsis36, and reduction in inflammatory cytokines 37. However only two studies demonstrated 
efficacy with regards to their primary endpoint.31,36 These differences may be because negative 
studies enrolled patients too late in their disease course.  In line with this evidence, statins are 
being used in the treatment strategy of many COVID -19 patients ( de novo use and continuation 
of chronic therapy).38,39 One retrospective study published in a preprint  has also demonstrated 
significant symptomatic  benefit of chronic prior statin therapy in elderly patients infected with 
SARS- CoV-2.40 
4.1.1  Drug Combination Safety  
The long-term safety  of the concurrent use of colchicine and high intensity statin therapy has 
been well established in two RCTs  (>5000 patients total) studying colchicine in patients with 
coronary artery disease with low rates of adverse events – particularly infections, myopathy , and 
rhabdomyolysis  (< 1-3% at 3 year follow -up).19,20 Drug labels for both medications caution that 
use of both drugs can synergistically cause myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients 
with renal impairment. How ever, rates of these events remain low in RCTs and observational 
studies and do not  significantly differ from patients receiving only one of the medications; myositis resulted in withdrawal of <0.5% of patients in LoDoCo trial, there was no serious advers e event of myopathy reported in the COLCOT trial, and in a registry from South Korea 
(2.7% vs. 1.4% ; p=0.3) of patients on colchicine and statin therapy vs. colchicine alone 
experienced myopathy while 0.3% vs. 0.5% experienced rhabdomyolosis.
19,20,41 There is no 
safety data currently available on concurrent use of both medications in COVID -19 patients . 
4.2 Rationale  
To reduce morbidity and mortality associated with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS)  
and myocardial injury in patients with SARS- CoV-[ADDRESS_487639] a combined treatment of 
colchicine and statin in a randomized clinical trial.  
4.3 Drug Description 
Colchicine was approved in the US in 1961 for use in the prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout and familial Mediterranean fever, for which long- term administration is recommended. 
Extensive experience of this drug in clinical practice, established oral dosing and drug- drug 
interactions are well documented in the prescribing information.  
Rosuvastatin is approved to reduce the risk of MI, stroke, revascularization, angina and to reduce 
total cholesterol and LDL- C, TG. There is extensive experience with this drug in clinical practice, 
with established oral dosing and drug- drug interactions are well documented in  the prescribing 
information. Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity reactions, active 
liver disease, pregnancy, or nursing. Myopathy i s increased with use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
and protease inhibitors and requires  dose adjustment  (section  §7.4.1) .  Elevation of liver 
enzymes was reported in 2.3% of cases and resolves with discontinuation. Other reported 
adverse reactions incl ude myalgia, abdominal pain and nausea.

5.0 Study Design  
The Colchicine/Statin for the Prevention of COVID -19 Complications (COLSTAT) Trial is a 
pragmatic randomized open- label study  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combinat ion 
of Colchicine  + Rosuvastatin  in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388988] -CoV-2.  
5.1 Study Design Overview 
Subjects will be screened within 48 hours of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105904]. A total of 466 subjects  with RT-
PCR confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infection meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, will be 
randomized to either Colchicine  + Rosuvastatin  treatment  added to SOC  or SOC  alone for the 
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. SOC will be guided by  [CONTACT_941] Y ale New Haven Health  SARS- CoV-2 
Therapeutics Group. S ubjects will be assessed daily while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389003], biomarker, 
safety, and laboratory parameters based on the YNHH SOC algorithm. Study treatment will be continued for 30 days or until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389011]. The subjects will be 
followed clinically until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] , at 30 days  and 60 days from randomization . After 
discharge follow -up will be by [CONTACT_648]  (Figure 1) . A subset of 50 patients with CEC adjudicated  
suspected myocarditis and new reduced LVE F (>10% reduction)  by [CONTACT_389079][INVESTIGATOR_389012] 6 0 days for assessment

 recommended but not required that they receive a point of care echo if within center’s SOC. Further 
imaging is not mandated and should only occur as clinically indicated.  
*** The SOFA score requires LFTs , creatinine, and an ABG. It should be recorded for every patient 
when appropriate labs are available within a 24 hour period. If and ABG is not available to assess 
PaO2/FiO2 it is okay to substitute using SpO2/FiO2 ratio per prior literature. See definiti ons in Section 
15.1.  
 We will collect serum samples for biobanking. Samples will be obtained at Day 1 prior to treatment 
administration and then every 72 hours thereafter until discharge (see Figure 1. COLSTAT Trial Design). 
All biomarker measurements and subsequent imaging/tests will occur based on SOC at respective center 
and decision of primary team when clinically indicated. However, preferably should occur every 24  hours 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389004] a basic metabolic panel, CBC with 
differential, LFTs, CRP, procalcitonin, D -dimer, and troponin (or CK -MB if not available). Cytokine 
measurement and other labs/imaging will occur according to the SOC of each center.  
1Routine labs should occur per center’s SOC, preferably should occur at least every 24 hours and 
preferably should include at minimum a basic metabolic panel, CBC with differential, LFTs, CRP, 
procalcitonin, D -dimer , and troponin (or CK -MB if not available). BNP, ferritin, LDH, PTT/INR are 
useful parameters that may also be measured based on SOC  and clinical indication when 
appropriate.  
2 Inflammatory panel  per center’s SOC : preferably CRP  and procalcitonin should be measured every 24 
hours.  If Cytokines are measured in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389021]-1, IL-6, and

monitor discontinuations of treatment and the underlying reasons to monitor adverse events attributable to treatment.  
8.1 Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence  associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An adverse event could present as an 
abnormal laboratory finding, abnormal imaging finding or an abnormal clinical finding or symptom . 
8.2 Life-threatening Adverse Event  or Life-threatening Suspected 
Adverse Reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse 
Reaction  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator  or sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event ,  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions ,  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject  and may require medical or surgic al intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  30 
 allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.4 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reason able possibility” means there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.    
For rosuvastatin, these may include (2%)  
• Myalgia  
• Abdominal pain  
• Nausea  
• Headache  
For cochicine, these may include (up to 20%) : 
• Abdominal pain  
• Nausea  
• Diarrhea  
• Vomiting  
• Rash  
• Elevated AST/ALT  
• Myopathy  
 
8.5 Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reactions  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  [ADDRESS_487660] be listed on the patient’s medical record.  All AEs will be characterized by 
[CONTACT_4868]:  
• Intensity or Severity  
• Relatedness  
• Outcome  
• Treatment or Action Taken  
8.6.1  Intensity or Severity  
The following  grades  of the intensity of an adverse event will be used , according to Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.042:  
Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate ; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADL*.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limit ing self care ADL**.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Death  related to AE.  
ADL=Activities of Daily Living ; *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.  
 
8.6.2  Relatedness  
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship to the treatment : 
Not related  
 The cause of the AE is known, and the event is not related to any 
aspect of study participation.  
Unlikely to be 
related  There is little or no temporal relationship to the study drug  and/or a 
more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Possibly related  There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationshi p to the study procedure(s); however, 
follows no known pattern of response , and an alternative cause 
seems more likely or there is significant uncertainty about the cause of the event.  
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  32 
 Probably related  It is likely that the event was caused by [CONTACT_28224].  
The AE has a timely relationship  to the study treatment and follows a 
known pattern of response ; a potential alternative cause, however, 
may explain the event.  
Related  A related  event has a strong temporal relationship and an alternative 
cause is unlikely.  
If the relationship between any adverse event and the use of the investigational drug is 
considered to be possibly or probably related, that event will be classified as an ADE or SAE  
8.6.3  Outcome  
The clinical outcome of the AE or SAE will be c haracterized as follows:  
Death The SAE CRF must be completed for this outcome 
Recovered without sequelae  The patient returned to baseline status  
Ongoing  Patient did not recover and symptoms continue  
Recovered with sequelae The patient has recovered but with clinical sequelae from the event  
Unknown  The patient outcome is unknown 
8.6.4  Treatment or Action Taken  
The treatment or action taken after the occurrence of an AE or SAE will be reported as:  
Interventional Treatment  Surgical, percutaneous or other procedure  
Medical Treatment  Medication dose reduction/interruption or discontinuation, or 
medication initiated for event  
None No action is taken  
8.7 Reporting  
8.7.1  General Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: a) adverse events 
that are serious or life- threatening AND unanticipated (or anticipated but occurring with a greater 
frequency than expected) AND possibly, probably or definitely related t o the drug; and b) other 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. These adverse events or 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710.

9.0 Benefit: Risk Analysis  
9.1 Potential Benefits  
We estimate from  data collected  by [CONTACT_389087]  (including  1,412 COVID -
19 patients ) that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388988] -COV -[ADDRESS_487664] a 48% risk of requiring 
mechanical ventilation,  myocardial injury or death.  Based on prior literature we estimate a 30% 
benefit from the use of Colchicine  + Rosuvastatin  started early dur ing admission. If proven 
beneficial, the enrolled subjects will have a direct benefit in reducing complication rate and other subsequent patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389026] -COV -19 will also benefit from a proven treatment 
of this morbid and sometimes fatal dis ease.  
Because the drug combination Colchicine  + Rosuvastatin  is low risk and cheap, this treatment 
can be implemented early with significant impact on clinical outcomes.  
The trial is expected to make a substantial contribution to medical science and clinic al decision-
making that could benefit future patients with SARS- CoV-2.

10.2 Clinical Events Committee  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC), or Independent Physician Adjudicator, will be responsible for systematic review and adjudication of all primary and secondary safety events as identified in this protocol to ensure uniform classification of events according to pre- specified 
definitions as well as relationship to the drug(s) or combination of drugs versus underlying disease. Clinical experts will be selected based upon their expertise with cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, renal disease and or neurological disease therapeutic areas  as well as their 
expertise and familiarity with the growing body of knowledge regarding SARS -CoV-2. 
  
In order to enhance objectivity and reduce the potential for bias, the CEC members shall be independent of direct treatment of subjects enrolled under this research protocol. The 
methodology for performing these responsibilities shall be developed and outlined in the CEC Charter. Operational provisions shall be established to minimize potential bias.

 DSMB  will therefore monitor discontinuations of treatment and the underlying reasons to monitor 
adverse events attributable to treatment.  
10.3.1  Considerations for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_389027] a recommendation for a temporary hold on enrollment and 
further randomization should any of the following be observed:   
• A two -fold increase in event rates for key events of special interest is seen in the treatment 
arm versus the contr ol arm, or a two- fold increase in serious adverse events overall is 
seen in the treatment arm versus the control arm.  
Key events of special interest for the purpose of D SMB  evaluation include:  
• Elevations in hepatic transaminases  
• Myopathies  
• Myalgia  
• Astheni a 
• Rhabdomyolysis  
• Impaired renal function as evidenced by [CONTACT_389088]  
• Gastrointestinal adverse events including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea  
• Death  
• Thrombosis or thromboembolic events  
The D SMC shall conduct a ful l investigation of potential contributing causes prior to making any 
recommendation for enrollment to resume, a change to protocol, or termination of further enrollment or randomization.  
The DMC reserves the right to make a recommendation for temporary suspension of enrollment 
until circumstances are investigated should the number of deaths reported to the committee in 
an expedited fashion appear higher in the treatment arm than the number reported in the control 
arm or if >[ADDRESS_487669] the following hypothes es:  
Primary Hypothesis:  Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389028] -CoV-[ADDRESS_487670] therapy, the addition of Colchicine + Rosuvastatin  is superior to standard of 
care in reducing the composite outcome of progression to severe COVID -19 disease (as 
defined by [CONTACT_389089] 5 -8 or 6-8 if at score of 5 on admission)  and arterial 
and venous thromboembolic complications  at 30 days.   
Secondary Powered Endpoint: Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389028] -CoV-2 confirmed subjects 
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  [ADDRESS_487671] therapy, the addition of Colchicine + Rosuvastatin  is superior to 
standard of care in reducing the composite outcome of respi[INVESTIGATOR_389029], myocardial injur y or death at 30 days .  
Secondary Hypothesis : Among hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389028] -CoV-[ADDRESS_487672] therapy, the addition of Colchicine + Rosuvastatin  reduces length of stay, 
need and duration of ICU care, myocardial injury, respi[INVESTIGATOR_389030], 
multiorgan failure or death, acute kidney injury, use of Extracorporeal Membrane 
Oxygenation (ECMO) and cytokine, inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers compared to 
standard of care measured at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
To determine the treatment effect in subgroup analysis (test of inter action) and predictors 
of the secondary powered endpoint of mechanical ventilation, myocardial injury or death 
among candidate variables including baseline risk factors, cytokines, inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers. We hypothesize that Colchicine + Rosuv astatin  will have a 
consistent treatment effect across all subgroups.  
Among subjects who develop myocardial injury during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Colchicine + 
Rosuvastatin  compared to standard of care will improve cardiac function and recovery 
based on 30- day post discharge cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

 P2 =  the true rate of composite outcome of mechanical ventilation, myocardial 
injury and death  in the SOC only arm  
The null hypothesis will be tested at a two- sided 0.[ADDRESS_487675]. Superiority will be demonstrated if the true composite primary 
outcome of mechanical ventilation, myocar dial injury and death rates are not equal using the 
two-proportion tests.  
11.2 Analysis Population 
11.2.1  Intention to Treat (ITT) Analysis Population 
The Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis population is defined as all subjects enrolled in the study, by [CONTACT_389092], regardless of the treatment actually received.  
The ITT population will be the primary analysis population for all primary and secondary 
endpoints   
11.2.2  As Treated  (AT) Analysis Population  
The As Treated  (AT) analysis population is defined by [CONTACT_115378], rather 
than the treatment assigned.  
The AT population is the secondary analysis population for all primary and secondary endpoints.  
11.2.3   M As Treated (mAT) Analysis Population  
The mAT analysis population is defined by  [CONTACT_389070], rather than the 
treatment assigned and exclude s all subjects with prior statin therapy.     
The mAT population is an additional analysis population for all primary and secondary endpoints.  
11.[ADDRESS_487676] of superiority of Colchicine + Rosuvastatin  
in addition of SOC compared to SOC alone assessed by [CONTACT_389093] -19 disease (as defined by [CONTACT_389094] s cale scores 5 -8 or 6-8 if patient at score 
of 5 at time of randomization)  and arterial and venous thromboembolic complications  at 30 days.  
The primary endpoint will be evaluated in the ITT population.  A secondary analysis will be 
performed in the AT population.  
The following assumptions were made:  
 Expected rate of the primary outcome of progression to severe COVID -19 disease (as 
defined by [CONTACT_389089] 5- 8) in the SOC alone arm at 30 days= 44.2%  
 Assumes the true rates of  primary  outcome are not equal  between two groups  using the 
two sample proportion tests . 
 2-sided α=0.05  
 Assumes 30% relative reduction in events with Colchicine + Rosuvastatin treatment   
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  [ADDRESS_487677] s (233 per group) will provide at least 80% power to test the primary 
hypothesis assuming a 44.2% event rate at 30 days in the control group, a 30% rel ative reduction 
in events with treatment, a 2- sided α=0.05 and at 10% loss to follow -up at [ADDRESS_487678] of superiority of Colchicine + 
Rosuvastatin  in addition to SOC compared to SOC alone assessed by [CONTACT_389091], myocardial injury and death measured at 30 days.  The secondary 
endpoint will be evaluated in the ITT population. A secondary anal ysis will be performed in the 
AT population.  
The sample size of 466 subjects  (233 per group) will provide 85 % power to test the secondary 
hypothesis assuming a 48% composite event rate at 30 days  in the control group, a 30% relative 
reduction in events with treatment, a 2- sided α=0.05 and 5% loss to follow -up at 30 days.   
11.3.3  Rationale for Assumptions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Control Event Rate for Primary Endpoint  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The primary endpoint event rate at [ADDRESS_487679] comparing dexamethasone use to placebo in 
COVID -19 patients from the RECOV ERY trial the event rate of mechanical 
ventilation and death in patients not requiring mechanical ventilation at  time of 
randomization in dexamethasone arm was 25.6% .43 The rates of 
CPAP/BiPAP/HFNC use in COVID- 19 patients are not well reported but in the 
Remdesivir trial at 15 days 10.7%  of patients were requiring their use.[ADDRESS_487680] improved by [CONTACT_66791]. This is balanc ed by 
[CONTACT_389095]. Per a recent meta- analysis the rate of PE 
and DVT in non -ICU COVID- 19 patients is 10.5% and 7.4%, respectively  with 
about 42% of patients with PE having an identified DVT.45 This m akes the 
composite event rate of DVT/PE approximately 14.8% . The true incidence will 
likely be slightly higher given that some patients in trial will eventually be admitted 
to ICU and rates of DVT/PE are significantly higher in this population. Fi nally, the 
incidence of acute MI and/or is chemic stroke appears to be approximately 1% 
based on a recent registry.46 In total the sum of these event rates is 52.1% . 
Assuming a conservative 15% overlap in events the assumed event rate of 
44.2% in the SOC arm is reasonable.  Expected Contr ol Event Rate for 
Secondary Powered Endpoint  
The secondary powered endpoint (composite of death, myocardial injury, and invasive 
mechanical ventilation) event rate was estimated from data from 1,412 COVID -19 patients 
discharged from the Yale New Haven Heal th System, the system in which this trial will be 
undertaken.  In the system the event rates for the three individual endpoints in the composite are 
death (17%), myocardial injury (48%), and invasive mechanical ventilation (33%). Although rates are not curr ently available for the composite of these three, a conservative event rate of 48% 
was assumed based on the highest individual event rate.

 11.4 Method of Analysis and Reporting 
11.4.1  General Approach  
Superiority  testing for the primary efficacy endpoint ( Proportion of subjects  that progress to 
severe COVID -19 disease by 30 days, as defined by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) 
Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement Scores 5- 8) and powered secondary  efficacy endpoint 
(Composite outcome of mechanical ventilation, myocardial injury and death measured at 
discharge) will be 2 -sided and perfomed at 0.05  significance level . Proportions of subjects with 
various scores on ordinal scales (i.e. WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement) will be 
compared between groups using the Chi -squared test for the ordinal logistic regression model .  
Analysis of all additional secondary endpoint results will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For binary variables, descriptive statistics will include counts, percent ages, and sample 
size for each treatment group; p- values may be presented for hypothesis -generating purposes. 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics include mean, median, standard deviation, 
quartiles, minimum, maximum, and sample size for each t reatment group. Binary variables will 
be summarized using frequencies, percentages, and sample size for each treatment group . For 
time-to-event data, Kaplan- Meier estimates at the indicated time points will be displayed 
graphically.  
Analysis will be condu cted using SAS (version 9.3 or greater), unless otherwise noted. Please 
refer to the formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for additional details.  
11.4.2  Baseline Characteristics  
The following data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented by  [CONTACT_389096]:

 15.0 Appendices  
15.1 Appendix A: Definitions  
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)  
[AKIN classification]  Change in serum creatinine (up to 7 days) compared with baseline48:  
• Stage 1:  
o Increase in serum creatinine to 150– 199% (1.5– 1.99

Acute Limb Ischemia  A rapid or sudden decrease in limb perfusion plus either 1) a new 
pulse deficit, rest pain, pallor, paresthesia, or paralysis; or 2) 
confirmation of arterial obstruction by [CONTACT_389107] (ankle or 
toe pressure), imaging, intraoperative findings, or pathological 
evaluation. Events will be classified per the Rutherford Classification
49 
 
Adverse Event s 
 According to 21CFR312.32:  
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY                                                    
 
  52 
 An adverse event could present as an abnormal laboratory finding, 
abnormal imaging finding or an abnormal clinical finding or symptom.  
 Life-threatening adverse event or life -threatening suspected 
adverse reaction  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
Serious adverse event  or serious suspected adverse reaction   
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of ei ther the investigator  or sponsor , it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event ,  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions,  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death,  be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89401], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the patient or subject  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
Suspected adverse reaction   
Any adverse event  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the adverse event . For the purposes of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse 
event . Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any 
adverse event  caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event  or unexpected suspected adver se 
reaction.   
COLSTAT TRIAL [CIP -TBD (v1.0)]                                                                                             YALE UNIVERSITY

 An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction  is consid ered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator  brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator  brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse 
events  or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the 
investigator  brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under 
investigation.  
As Treated  (AT) Population  As Treated (AT) analysis population is defined by [CONTACT_389108], rather than the treatment assigned.  
The mAT analysis population is defined by [CONTACT_80222], rather than the treatment assigned and excludes all 
subjects with prior statin therapy.  
Bleeding  Defined according to the following BARC definitions50: 
• Type 0 : no bleeding 
• Type 1 : bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause 
the patient to seek unscheduled performance of studies, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or treatment by a healthcare professional; 
may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_15664] -discontinuation of 
medical therapy by [CONTACT_15743] a 
healthcare professional  
• Type 2 : any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (e.g., 
more bleeding than would be expected for a clinical 
circumstance, including bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) 
that does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_487693] one of the following criteria: (1) requiring 
nonsurgical, medical intervention by a  healthcare 
professional, (2) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389044], or (3) prompting evaluation 
• Type 3  
Type 3a  
Over bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to <5 g/dL* 
(provided hemoglobin drop is related to bleed)  
Any transfusion with over bleeding 
Type 3b

  54 
 Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥5 g/dL* (provided 
hemoglobin drop is related to bleed)  
Cardiac tamponade  
Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding 
dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
Type 3c  
Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or 
hemorrhagic transformation, does include intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304])  
Subcategories confirmed by [CONTACT_389109] 
• Type 4 : CABG -related bleeding 
Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h  
Reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of 
controlling bleeding 
Transfusion of ≥5 U whole blood or packed red blood cells within 
a 48- h period (NOTE: cell saver products are not counted)  
Chest tube output ≥2L within a 24 -h period 
• Type 5 : fatal bleeding  
Type 5a  
Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation but clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_195751] 5b  
Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging confirmation  
NOTES:  
Platelet transfusions should be recorded and reported but are not included in these definitions until further information is obtained 
about the relationship to outcomes. If a CABG -related bleed is not 
adjudicated as at least a type 3 s everity event, it will be classified as 
not a bleeding event. If a bleeding event occurs with a clear temporal 
relationship to CABG (i.e., within a 48 -h time frame) but does not 
meet type 4 severity criteria, it will be classified as not a bleeding 
event.  
* Corrected for transfusion (1 U packed red blood cells or 1 U whole 
blood = 1 g/dL hemoglobin)

Death  Classified as cardiac, vascular, or noncardiovascular according to 
the following ARC definitions.51 All deaths are considered cardiac 
unless an unequivocal noncardiac cause can be established. 
Specifically, any unexpected death even in patients with coexisting 
potentially fatal noncardiac disease (e.g., cancer, infection) should 
be classified as cardiac . 
• Cardiac death : Any death due to proximate cardiac cause 
(e.g., MI, low -output failure, fatal arrhythmia), unwitnessed 
death and death of unknown cause, and all procedure-

Myocardial infarction (MI)  The primary protocol definition of myocardial infarction is the Fourth 
Universal Definition52 provided in the Table below, which will be 
adjudicated and classified by [CONTACT_15731].  When 
quantitative troponin is not available CK -MB will be u sed in its place  
In addition, the CEC will also adjudicate PCI -related MI according to 
several alternate thresholds of cTn (3, 10, 35, and 70 × 99th 
percentile URL), and all MI types (except Type 3) will be tabulated 
according to multiples of the 99th percentile URL of cTn as 
recommended by [CONTACT_389112].53  
Definition of Myocardial Infarction52,53 
Criteria for myocardial injury  
The term myocardial injury should be used when there is evidence of elevated cardiac troponin values 
(cTn) with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). The myocardial 
injury is considered acute if there is a rise and/or fall of cTn values.  
Criteria for acute myocardial infarction (types 1, 2, and 3 MI)  
The t erm acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical 
evidence of acute myocardial ischaemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at 
least one value above the 99th percentile URL and at least one of the following:  
• Symptoms of myocardial ischaemia;  
• New ischaemic ECG changes;  
• Development of pathological Q waves;  
• Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality 
in a pattern consistent with an ischaemic aetiology;  
• Identification of a coronary thrombus by [CONTACT_381465] (not for type 2 or 3 MIs).  
Post-mortem demonstr ation of acute athero- thrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted 
myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI.  
Evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute 
athero -thrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI.  
Cardia c death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischaemia and presumed new 
ischaemic ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI.
 
Criteria for coronary procedure -related myocardial infarction (types 4  and 5)  
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) related MI is termed type 4a MI.  
Coronary artery by[CONTACT_15806] (CABG) related MI is termed type 5 MI.

least one o f the following:  
• New ischaemic ECG changes (this criterion is related to type 4a MI only);  
• Development of new pathological Q waves;  
• Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium that is presumed to be new and in a pattern 
consistent with an ischaemic ae tiology;  
• Angiographic findings consistent with a procedural flow -limiting complication such as coronary 
dissection, occlusion of a major epi[INVESTIGATOR_389046], side- branch occlusion- thrombus, 
disruption of collateral flow or distal embolization.  
Isolated development of new pathological Q waves meets the type 4a MI or type [ADDRESS_487695]-mortem demonstration of a procedure- related thrombus meets the type 4a MI criteria or type 4b 
MI criteria if associated with a stent.  
Criteria for prior or sil ent/unrecognized myocardial infarction  
Any one of the following criteria meets the diagnosis for prior or silent/ unrecognized MI:  
• Abnormal Q waves with or without symptoms in the absence of nonischaemic causes.  
• Imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium in a pattern consistent with ischaemic 
aetiology.  
• Patho- anatomical findings of a prior MI.

Pulmonary Embolism (PE)  Pulmonary embolism is a mechanical obstruction of one or more 
branches of the pulmonary vasculature, usually from a clot.  
These must be diagnosed by [CONTACT_389120]:  
- Massive or high- risk: the PE is causing hemodynamic 
instability.  
- Submassive or intermed iate risk: the PE is causing cardiac 
dysfunction with right ventricular strain (echocardiographic 
findings may include right ventricular hypokinesis or dilation, 
tricuspid regurgitation, and/or paradoxic septal movement), 
frequently with elevations in troponin and/or brain natriuretic 
peptide (BNP).  
- Low risk: absence of any signs of massive or submassive PE.

Stroke 48 Diagnostic criteria:  
Acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a focal or global neurological deficit with at least one 
of the following: change in the l evel of consciousness, hemiplegia, 
hemiparesis, numbness, or sensory loss affecting one side of the 
body, dysphasia or aphasia, hemianopia, amaurosis fugax, or other neurological signs or symptoms consistent with stroke  
Stroke: duration of a focal or global neurological deficit ≥24 h; OR <[ADDRESS_487703]; 
OR the neurological deficit results in death  
TIA: duration of a focal or global neurological deficit <[ADDRESS_487704]  
No other readily identifiable non- stroke cause for the clinical 
presentation (e.g. brain tumor , trauma, infection, hypoglycemia, 
peripheral lesion, pharmacological influences), to be determined by [CONTACT_389121] (CT scan or brain MRI), but stroke may be 
diagnosed on clinical grounds alone 
Stroke classification  
Ischemic : an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_196545], spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], or retinal 
dysfunction caused by [CONTACT_389122] : an acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_389053] , intraventricular, or 
subarachnoid hemorrhage 
A stroke may be classified as undetermined if there is insufficient 
information to allow categorization as ischemic  or hemorrhagic .

  According to the NeuroARC definition57: 
Overt CNS Injury : Acutely symptomatic brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] 
(NeuroARC Type 1)  including:  
Type 1.a Ischemic stroke  
Sudden onset of neurological signs or symptoms fitting a focal or 
multifocal vascular territory within the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retina, that: 
1) Persist for ≥24 h or unti l death, with pathology or 
neuroimaging evidence that demonstrates either:  
a) CNS infarction in the corresponding vascular territory 
(with or without hemorrhage); or  
b) Absence of other apparent causes (including 
hemorrhage), even if no evidence of acute ischemia in 
the corresponding vascular territory is detected  
or 
2) Symptoms lasting <24 h, with pathology or neuroimaging 
confirmation of CNS infarction in the corresponding vascular 
territory. Note:  When CNS infarction location does not match 
the transient s ymptoms, the event would be classified as 
covert CNS infarction (Type 2a) and a TIA (Type 3a), but not 
as an ischemic stroke.  
Signs and symptoms consistent with stroke typi[INVESTIGATOR_389054] 1 of the following: focal weakness and/or numbness;  
impaired language production or comprehension; homonymous 
hemianopia or quadrantanopsia; diplopia; altitudinal monocular 
blindness; hemispatial neglect; dysarthria; vertigo; or ataxia.  
Subtype 1.a.H Ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion  
Ischemic str oke includes hemorrhagic conversions . These 
should be subclassified as Class A or B when ischemic stroke is 
the primary mechanism and pathology or neuroimaging 
confirms a hemorrhagic conversion.  
Class A (Petechial hemorrhage): Petechiae or confluent 
petechiae within the infarction or its margins, but without a space- occupying effect  
Class B (Confluent hemorrhage): Confluent hemorrhage or 
hematoma originating from within the infarcted area with 
space- occupying effect  
Type 1.b Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage  
Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389055] (focal or global) 
caused by [CONTACT_389123], intraventricular, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or 
retinal collection of blood, not caused by [CONTACT_389124] 1.c Symptomatic subarachnoid hemorrhage

 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_389055] (focal or global) 
and/or headache caused by [CONTACT_389125], 
not caused by [CONTACT_389124] 1.d Stroke, not otherwise specified  
An epi[INVESTIGATOR_389056]/or 
headache presumed to be caused by [CONTACT_389126], persisting ≥24 h or until death, but without sufficient 
evidence to be classified as either (i.e., no neuroimaging performed)  
Type 1.e Symptomatic hypoxic -ischemic injury  
Nonfocal (global) neurological signs or symptoms due to diffuse brain, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal cell death (confirmed b y pathology or 
neuroimaging) in a nonvascular distribution, attributable to 
hypotension and/or hypoxia 
 Covert CNS Injury:  Acutely symptomatic brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_389057] ( NeuroARC Type 2 ) including:  
Brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], or retinal cell death attributable to focal or multifocal 
ischemia, on the basis of neuroimaging or pathological evidence of 
CNS infarction, without a history of acute neurological symptoms 
consistent with the lesion location  
Subtype 2.a.H Covert CNS infarcti on with hemorrhagic conversion  
Covert CNS infarction includes hemorrhagic conversions . These 
should be subclassified as Class A or B when CNS infarction is the 
primary mechanism and neuroimaging or pathology confirms a 
hemorrhagic conversion.  
Class A (Pete chial hemorrhage): Petechiae or confluent petechiae 
within the infarction or its margins, but without a space -occupying 
effect  
Class B (Confluent hemorrhage): Confluent hemorrhage or 
hematoma originating from within the infarcted area with space-occupying effect
  
Type 2.b Covert CNS hemorrhage  
Neuroimaging or pathological evidence of CNS hemorrhage within the 
brain parenchyma, subarachnoid space, ventricular system, spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232], or retina on neuroimaging that is not caused by [CONTACT_278066], without 
a history of acute neurological symptoms consistent with the bleeding 
location 
Systemic 
Thromboembolism  Acute vascular insufficiency or occlusion of the extremities or any non -
CNS organ associated with clinical, imaging, surgical/autopsy 
evidence of arterial occlusion in the absence of other likely 
mechanism (e.g. trauma, atherosclerosis, or instrumentation).58 When 
there is presence of prior peripheral artery disease, angiographic or surgical or autopsy evidence is requir
ed to show abrupt arterial 
occlusion.

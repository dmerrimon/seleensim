Background and Objectives: This study was designed to compare cosmetic results in   patients 
who have undergone repeat cesarean section through a Pfannenstiel skin incision when using a 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -[ADDRESS_193512] abdominal dressing postoperatively.   
Methods:  Twenty four English and Spanish speaking patients who underwent repeat Cesarean 
Section via Pfan nenstiel skin incision from July 28, 2022 to January 4, 2023 at Eskenazi Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166746], Indiana   were enrolled. Patients were evaluated using the Patient and Observer 
Scar Assessment (POSAS) Scale at two, four and six weeks postoperatively. Heal thcare providers 
were asked to fill out the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale at the patients 
postpartum visit, which was between four to six weeks postoperatively.   
Results: The median patient assessment scale and observer assessment scale (gener al) values 
were higher in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_166747] 2 weeks, 
equivalent at 4 weeks and lower at 6 weeks. There were no differences in the number of 
postoperative wound infections or readmissions, and there was 1 report ed rash due to the 
adhesives in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_166748].   
Conclusion:  Due to low recruitment and low response rate, this study as it currently stands 
cannot evaluate the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -[ADDRESS_193513] abdominal dressing. Becaus e of the 
potential physical and psychological benefit of reducing c omplicated scar formation, further 
studies could be performed with a higher recruitment and follow up that would be able to 
provide information to determine if the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -7 versus   other NPWT  could be beneficial at 
improving patient’s scar satisfaction after a repeat cesarean section.

INTRO/Background:   
 
There are millions of births each year with 32% of women undergoing cesarean sections (C -sections), 
which results in skin scarring.   Repeat C -sections increased by 178% from [ADDRESS_193514] proposed the use of incisional negative pressure 
wound therapy (iNPWT). Although recent studies have shown certain limitations of the use of iNPWT, 
the general consensus remains that iNPWT helps to reduce surgical site complications such as infections 
and dehiscence in non -contaminated surgery. 3-[ADDRESS_193515] reported  beneficial effects of iNPWT on scar development.6, 7 The 
underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be the reduction of lateral wound tension. Excessive lateral 
tension is generally considered to be a factor in pathological scar formation, and reduction of i ncisional 
tension has previously been shown to result in more favorable scar outcomes.13-16 Studies into the 
biomechanical properties of iNPWT demonstrated lateral tension reduction of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], fat, and 
muscle, supporting the hypothesis that negative  pressure reduces sheer tension. In a recent systematic 
review by [CONTACT_166762]., the conclusion was that there is a moderate level of evidence for clinically 
positive effects of iNPWT on scar outcomes in non -contaminated surgery. 7  
 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] 7 dressing consists of a negati ve pressure wound therapy pump (NPWT) connected to an 
absorbent gentle adhesive dressing that is applied to a wound.   When the pump is activated, it acts by 
[CONTACT_166763].   The dressing absorbs this fluid and helps to prevent bacteria  from 
entering the wound.

Thus, this study aims to compare the aesthetic appearance by [CONTACT_166764] (POSAS) scar assessment scale following closed incision negative pressure therapy 
with a PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] [ADDRESS_193517] abdominal dressing in women undergoing repeat cesarean 
sections.   
 
Methods:     
Study design and participants:    
This study was a single site, randomized controlled trial at a teaching hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166749] a repeat cesarean delivery.   Participants   were randomized using 1:[ADDRESS_193518] ab dominal dressing (generally telfa, ABD gauze dressing, 
tegaderm +/ - steristrips)   at the time of cesarean.   The standard abdominal dressing was removed 
approximately on postoperative day (POD) 1 -2 and the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -7 dressing was removed approximately on 
POD 3 -4 (prior to discharge) or at POD7 in the office.   If the patient with a PI[INVESTIGATOR_166750] 7 postoperative days, the PI[INVESTIGATOR_166751]7, in 
accordance with device instructions.   The patients were given rou tine postoperative incision care 
instructions during their inpatient stay, which includes education per OB -GYN residents, attending staff, 
and nursing.   
Participants in both groups were sent electronic POSAS surveys at the two, four and six week postop 
window with primary outcome being aesthetic appearance (cosmesis) at six weeks.   Observers 
(healthcare providers) were asked to complete a POSAS survey at the postpartum visit (~4 -6 weeks 
postoperative) to rate scar quality.  Participants   were offered compens ation with a $[ADDRESS_193519] 
for participants who completed the requested follow up in the study.   These were provided by [CONTACT_166765].

Data Collection:   
 
The Patient Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) rates 6 variables: scar -related pain, itching, color, stiffness, 
thickness, and irregularity. Each parameter is scored on a [ADDRESS_193521] imaginable scar. The sum of the 
6 individual parameters ranges from 6 (normal skin) to 60 (worst scar).  
 
The POSAS patient survey was e -mailed to participants  at the two, four, and six -week time intervals and 
data collected and stored via REDCap. Participants were sent each survey up to 3 times until a response 
was logged. If they did not respond electronically, each patient was then called up to 3 times. The P OSAS 
observer survey was completed and collected at the time of the patient interview (routinely a 
postpartum visit). The observer (MD/DO /NP seeing the patient) was also asked to upload a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166752]. Baseline patient characteristics including maternal age, BMI, and 
number of prior cesarean sections were abstracted from the EMR.    
 
Randomization and blinding:   
One half was randomly assigned to receive iNPWT  versus the contralateral control side. An online block 
randomization tool was used for the within -patient allocation. Randomization of dressing was disclosed 
in the sealed envelope and revealed to the surgical team just prior to  proceeding to the operati ng room. 
Blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention  
 
Study outcomes:   
The primary study outcome was to compare aesthetic appearance and patient satisfaction at [ADDRESS_193522] dressing group vs. the PI[INVESTIGATOR_166753].  
 
Statistical Considerations  
We planned to enroll approximately 100 women with a previous C -section.   If approximately 20% drop -
out by 6 weeks, then with N = 80 (40 per group), we will have 80% power to d etect a .[ADDRESS_193523] pi[INVESTIGATOR_141106] C -section scars which used this instrument (Ekin et al., 
2018), the effect sizes for the Patient, Observer, and Total POSAS were ES = 1.18, 1.03, and 1.15, 
respectively.   Also, the pooled SD was 7.[ADDRESS_193524] 
a similar SD in this measure; we will be able to detect approximately a 5 -point change (0.7 x 7.2) in 
Patient POSAS.   Thus, we should have adequate power to detect meaningful improvements in scar 
assessment.   
 
Statistical Analysis:   
Charac teristics of the study population were summarized using descriptive statistics.   24 patients were 
recruited and enrolled in the study. Out of these 24, only 3 patients that responded to all three (2-, 4- 
and 6 - week) POSAS surveys. 15 patients responded to the 6 week assessment  survey, which was the 
primary outcome of this study. For t his reason, statistical  analysis that would provide a statistically 
significant value was unable to be performed.

Patient demographics:  
In total, [ADDRESS_193525] between July 2023 and January of 2023. A total of 15 
participants completed the primary study outcomes measures (on scar quality and patient -reported 
outcomes) and were included for analysis. The patient demographics are presented in Table 1. The 
median age of the participants was 29.8 years (range 25 –34.5) in the standard dressing group and 34.6 
in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -7 group (range 27 -42). The average prior cesarean sections were 1.4 (range 1 -3) in the 
standard dressing group and 1.7 (range 1 -3) in the  PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -[ADDRESS_193526] experienced any problematic scarring previous to surgery (e.g., hypertrophy and/or keloid). Most 
of the included patients were Caucasian (87.5%).

Discussion/Conclusions:   
In this study, we assessed the influence of incisional negative pressure wound therapy on scar 
development and patient satisfaction with their cosmetic outcome. We performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_166757]. Generally, t he results of this study showed a potential 
small difference in favor of iNPWT in patient -reported outcome measures with a lower score on the 
POSAS score at 6 weeks  and a lower observer score and overall score of the scar at 4 -6 weeks 
postpartum. These outcomes could not be analyzed for any sort of statistically significant values due to 
the low recruitment and even lower patient follow up and response rate despi[INVESTIGATOR_166758].   
 Strengths of this study include an even 1:1 block randomization at a single site (Eskenazi 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) with a robust Labor and Delivery unit with a diverse patient population.  Limitations of this 
study include a small sample size and low patient follow up response rate, which  yielded data that was 
unable to be analyzed for statistical significance. In statistical considerations in study design, we 
expected a 20% drop -out by 6 weeks. However in our study, we had a 35%  drop out rate (no response in 
any of the three surveys), and  only 12.5% of  patients filled out all 3 weeks of the surveys. 42% of 
patients  did not attend their scheduled postpartum visit at the [ADDRESS_193529] is difficult to assess in an open -label 
study. Additionally, the questionnaire used consisted of multiple sub -questions that equated to an 
overall score, which has the potential to result in false significant outcomes based on multiple testing 
and the non -linear conversion table from absolute value to the 0 –100 scale. Lastly, only one patient 
questionnaire (POSAS) was used in this study.   
 Moving forward, to be able to attempt to achieve a recruitment value to be able to analyze for 
statistical analysis, it would be prudent to attempt to include a larger population of patients. At Eskenazi 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_166759], two languages were not inclusive enough for adequate recruitment in t his study  in 
the short amount of time that recruitment was open . It would be extremely  beneficial for recruitment to 
be able to include languages such as Haitian  Creole in addition to Spanish and English. In the literature, 
other clinical studies on iNPWT on scar outcomes present a variety of scar outcome measures such as 
the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS),  Stony Brook Scar Evaluation Scale (SBSES),  Visual Assessment Scale 
(VAS),  Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and the BIS (Body Image Scale) were used . It could be use ful to 
incorporate  more scales to ensure that there was not a false interpretation of scar outcomes by [CONTACT_166767].  
In conclusion, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_166760], but di d show a lower overall score in the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -[ADDRESS_193530] abdominal 
dressing group at the 6 week mark  for both patients themselves and for observers. Because of the 
potential physical and psychological benefit of reducing complicated scar formation, further studies 
should  be performed with a higher recruitment and follow up percentage that would be able to provide 
information to determine if the PI[INVESTIGATOR_609] -7 or other NPWT could be beneficial at improving patient’s scar 
satisfaction after a repeat cesarean section.

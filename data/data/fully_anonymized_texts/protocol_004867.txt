Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 4 (146)Section 4.1 , Overall design;
Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Methods for assigning 
treatment groups –revised percentage of subjects targeted to have ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl at 
enrolment from at least 30% to approximately 35%.  T his allo ws to better explore the effect of 
tezepel umab in both the ≥ 300 eosinophils/ µL and < 300 eosinophils/ µL groups.
Section 4.1 , Overall design –Added “When the target percentage of subjects for the 
eosinophil subgroup in a region is reached, consideration will be given to closing the 
IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that subgroup, which may  be done ei ther overall or within a 
specific regio n. Once a subgroup is closed, subjects in the screening/run -in period in the 
closed subgroup will not be allowed to be randomized and will be screen failed .” To describe 
the approach for subgroup closure per region. 
Section 5.1 , Inclusion criteria , removed criterion #15 –“Non -sterilized males who are 
sexually  active wit h a female partner of childbearing potential must use a condom pl us 
spermicide fro m Day [ADDRESS_400838] not donate or bank sperm during this sam e time period.”  
To align with the revised IB.
Section 5.2 , Exclusion criteria # 6 –revised criteria to add in restrict ions related to the usage 
of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_96612] “ Current sm okers or subjects wit h smoking history  ≥10 pack- years and 
subjects using vapin g products, including electronic cigarettes. Former smokers with a 
smoking history  of <[ADDRESS_400839] 6 months prior to visit 1 to be eligible.” To clarify the required timeframe 
forstoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] e -cigarettes prior to screening since its use is prohibited during the study .
Section 5.2 , Exclusion criteria # 17 –reduced the timeframe for subjects who have been 
treated with bronchial thermoplast y from 24 to 12 mo nths prior to visit 1. T his allows 
sufficient time for any  safety  issues related to performing this procedure, (for example asthma 
exacerbations which occur within 1 -2 months after the procedure), to resolve and for efficacy 
related to the procedure to stabilize.
Section 5.4 , Screen failures –Replaced “Incorrect Enrolment” with “Screen Failure” to align 
with the proper documentation of the disposit ion of the screen failed subjects within the 
eCRF.  
Section 5.5 , Re-Screening –clarified the treatment by [CONTACT_324674]. The revised text reads: “Subjects with 
clinically significant infect ion, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_324618] -in sho uld be screen failed but may be 
re-screened 2 weeks after complet ion of the therapy.” To clarify  the ty pe of treatm ent for a 
clinically significant infect ion that would require the subject to be screen failed. 
Section 5.5 , Re-Screening –Added “If the t imeframe between Screening and re -screening is 
more than 30 days, then all Visit 1 assessments should be repeated.” To reduce the risk of not

screening, if init ial screening visit 1 was more than 30 days ago.
Secti on6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability – Dose preparation steps –Added 
that a 2 m L sterile sy ringe can be attached to a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle during 
IP dose preparation and subsequent ly used for IP administration. This change allows for use of 
a 2 mL sy ringe in addit ion to 3 mL sy ringe because i t meets the requirements for IP dose 
preparati on and dosing.
Section 6.2 , Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose prepara tion steps –clarified 
that the vial labels alo ng with the vials can be discarded immediately post IP preparation as 
per si te’s SOP. 
Section 6.2 , Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose administration –Removed 
wording “The subject, in the opi [INVESTIGATOR_871], is experiencing an acute or emerging 
asthma exacerbation” from the list of scenarios when IP should not be administered. An 
exacerbation per se is not a contraindicat ion for IP administration. Reasons for not 
administering IP are well covered by [CONTACT_324675].  
Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Ensuring blinding –
removed “bi omarker” fro m the following laboratory  personnel  that will  have access to the 
rando mizat ion list. The reason for this change is that the laboratory  does not require the 
rando mizat ion list for performing bio marker sample analysis.
Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Ensuring blinding –
Clarified that no other members of the study  team , other than those listed earlier within this 
section, will have access to the rando mizat ion list unt il after the primary database lock.
Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Methods for unblinding
–replaced “pharmacists” with “Study  Coordinator(s)” to clarify that the Study  Coordinators i n 
addition to the Investigator will be provided access to unblin ding the treatment. This change 
allows alignment with the IXRS setup for this study.
Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Methods for unblinding
–replaced “unt il database lock” with “until prim ary database l ock after l ast subject com pletes 
week 48.” To accommodate a planned addit ional database lock once the last subject completes 
treatm ent phase (week 48).
Section 6.5 , Table 6 –Restricted Medications -Short -acting beta -agonists (SABA) –Added 
“Only albuterol/salbutamo l is allowed to be used as a rescue medicat ion during the study , 
except duri ng exacerbations.” Since OCS titration criteria and ePRO alerts are based on 
salbutamo l use as rescue medication, the same ty pe of  SABA shoul d be used in a ll subjects.
Section 6.5 , Table 7 – Prohibited Medications –Added “Ephedrine (e.g. in antitussives or 
muco lytics) -Not allowed fro m visit 1, during run -in and optimizat ion phase, throughout the 
entire treatm ent peri od (even if the subject has discontinue d IP) until the fo llow up visi t week 
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6 (146)60.” The reason for this change is to ensure consistency in standard of care and GINA 
guidelines. 
Section 6.5 , Table 7 – Prohibited Medications –Added “Opi[INVESTIGATOR_324619] (e.g. in ant itussives) -
Not allowed from visit 1, during run -in and optimization phase, throughout the ent ire 
treatm ent peri od (even if the subject has discont inued IP) until the fo llow up visit week 60.” 
The reason for this change is to ensure consistency with standard of care and GINA 
guidelines.
Sectio n 6.5.2 , Rescue medicine –Added “Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of 
any asthma symptoms is not allowed fro m enrolment (Visit 1) and throughout the study  
durati on. Prophylact ic use o f SABA (e.g. prior to planned exercise) or any  other use than to 
curb worsening of asthma symptoms should be documented in medical notes and entered in 
the eCRF. Any such use of SABA must not be recorded in the Asthma Daily Diary. ” This 
change further clarifies that regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma 
symptoms is not allowed and that the occasional prophylact ic use of SABA is not to be 
recorded in the eDiary .
Section 7.1 , Discontinuation of study treatment –Under “Development of any  study  specific 
criteria for di scont inuat ion, any malignancy”, added the fo llowing statement “except subjects 
who develop basal cell carcino ma or localized squamous cell carcino ma of the skin, provided 
that the m alignancy is excised and determined to have clean margins.” This change allo ws 
subjects who have had excis ion of their lesions, which is considered curative, to continue 
study  treatm ent. 
Section 7.1.1 , Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment;
Section 8.3.10 , Disease under study –Replaced “termination” with “Discont inuat ion of 
Invest igational Produ ct” to reflect the corresponding eCRF module tit le. This change allows 
alignment with eCRF design. 
Section 7.3.2 , Discontinuation or suspension of entire study and site closure –Updated the 
title of this sect ion and added addit ional co mments about site closure. The rati onale for this 
change i s to specify  the condi tions for closure of sites during and after study  com pletion.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , OCS Dose Titration – OCS dose titration in the optimization phase –Dosing 
interval  corrected from  “10-30 m g” to “>10 -30 m g”.  To ensure consistency  with Table 8.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Criteria for OCS dose reduction during the optimization and reduction phase
–Added “It is at the discret ion of the Invest igator to continue with the OCS down- titration 
even if the criteria for OCS reduction have not been met. Such a decisio n must be just ified and 
docum ented in the source notes and captured in the eCRF. This deci sion must be notified to 
the [COMPANY_008] study  physician within 2 business days.” This allows the Invest igator the 
opportunit y to continue down titrating OCS, if clinically indicated. This change recognizes 
that the Invest igator will balance their concern about si de effects rel ated to OCS use and the 
patient’s clinical status.

Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 (146)Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Exacerbation management –Maintenance phase –Replaced “induct ion” wit h 
“maintenance” to correct the ty pographi cal error in the CSP.
Section 8.1.5 , Fractional exhal ed nitric oxide (FENO) –Removed the wording “which will be 
recorded as “Yes or No” in the eCRF” from the sentence “Subjects will be asked whether they  
have had a respi[INVESTIGATOR_324620] 2 weeks prior to measurement.” This change aligns 
with the eCRF design.
Section 8.2.4 , Vital Signs –Revised text to specify that the pulse rate will be obtained before 
blood pressure only if the manual measurement technique is used. This is to reflect that when 
the autom ated device is used the pulse and blood pressur e measurements are taken 
simultaneously . 
Section 8.2.4 , Vital Signs –Removed “in degrees Celsius” as the units of body temperature 
measurement. This is to accommodate the local guidelines as some regions may not be 
measuring in degrees Celsius.
Section 8.2.6 , Glucocorticoid toxicity index –Revised the text to “Scoring should be 
perform ed as per SoA, using the rando misation assessment as the baseline.” This is to clarify 
that the first assessment of GTI is at the randomisation visit. 
Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_400840] –Added “systemic” in front of ant iviral 
medicat ions. The revised text reads: “Requiring treatment with systemic antiviral medicat ions, 
intravenous ant ibiotics or medicat ions for helmint h parasi tic infect ion”. To clarify  that 
infect ions treated with local ant ivirals are not considered as adverse events of special interest.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Paternal exposure –Removed “ Male subjects shoul d refrain fro m fathering a 
child or donating sperm during the study  and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) fo llowing the last 
dose.” To align with the revised IB.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Paternal exposure –Added “ in the Pregnancy Report Form” to clarify where 
outcom e of all pregnancies will be reported. This change aligns wit h eCRF design.
Section 8.4.2 .2, Paternal exposure –Added “Consent fro m the partner m ust be obtained 
before the Pregnancy  Report Form  is completed.” To clarify that consent is being obtained 
from the pregnant partner prior to complet ing the Pregnancy Report Form.
Section 9.4 , Statis tical Analyses –Added “There will be two DBLs in this study. The primary 
DBL will be conducted after last subject completes Week 48, and the final DBL will be 
conducted once all pat ients have completed the last safet y follow-up visit (Week 60). All 
analys es of the primary  and secondary  object ives will be performed based on the primary 
DBL data . Following the primary DBL, data summaries created will be presented as an 
addendum to the CSR .” This provi des clari ty around timing of database locks and primary 
analysis evaluat ion.

CHANGES REQUIRED DURING THE COVID- 19 PANDEMIC
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29 (146)Please Note: Changes below should only be implemented during the COVID -[ADDRESS_400862] ices, and to minimize risks to data integrit y. Where allowable by  [CONTACT_122593], ethi cs 
committees and healt hcare provider guidelines (e.g. hosp ital policies), these changes include:
The opti on of  home visit s including home administration of Investigat ional Product (IP) performed by a qualified Healt h 
Care Professio nal (HCP). Addit ional information rel ated to the visit can be obtained remotely by  [CONTACT_324679]/or vi deo 
conference. The rationale for this change is to minimize the risk of subjects missing scheduled IP administration and visit 
assessments due to inabilit y/unwillingness to visit the site during the COVID -19 pandemic.
Remote vi sits (phone call and/or video conference) to replace on -site visi ts, if subjects cannot attend the visits at the study  
site, at an al ternate si te or have ho me visits. The rationale for this change is to ensure that assessments and co llection of
inform ation cont inue for visit s that cannot be done at the site, at an alternate site or at the subject’s home.  This will reduce 
the risk of subject exposure to COVID -19.
Decisio n on OCS dose based on remote interview of subject, eDiary data, and if applicable, ho me vis it physical examination 
and vital signs. The rationale for this change is to ensure optimal OCS dose for asthma control and to reduce the subject ris k 
of exposure to COVID -19.
Subjects aimed to transit ion to the extensio n study  D5180C00018 to continue par ticipat ion in the safety  follow-up visit(s) 
(Week 54, Week 60) unt il the on -site (or al ternate si te) extensio n study  rando mizat ion and IP administration can be 
conducted. The rationale for this change is to ensure randomization/first IP administration in t he extension study  
D5180C00018 can be performed at the site (alternate site) and to increase the chances o f subjects transit ioning to the 
extensio n study .
Re-consent will be obtained remotely  and/or verbally  if allowed by l ocal and regi onal guidelines. Th e rati onale for this 
change i s to ensure that the subject agrees to the changes implemented due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_400863] risk of exposure to COVID -19.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32 (146)The phase 2b tezepelumab efficacy study  (CD -RI-MEDI9929- 1146) conducted in patients with 
inadequately controlled severe asthma demonstrated a considerable reduction in the annualized 
asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) in subjects using OCS maintenance treatment. 
Thus, i t woul d be val uable to eval uate the abilit y of tezepelumab in r educing OCS use in severe 
asthma populat ion.
Study objectives:
Primary objective: Endpoint/variable:
To evaluate the effect of tezepelumab 
compared with placebo in reducing the 
prescribed OCS maintenance dose in 
subjects with asthma requiring chronic 
treatment with maintenance OCS in 
addition to high dose ICS plus LABA Primary outcome variable: Categoriz ed percent 
reduction from baseline in the daily OCS dose at Week 
48 while not losing asthma control
The categories for percent change from baseline in daily 
OCS dose are defined as:
1. ≥90% to ≤100% reduction
2. ≥75% to <90% reduction
3. ≥50% to <75% reduc tion
4. >0% to <50% reduction
5. no change or any increase
Primary outcome measure: Cum ulative odds ratio vs 
placebo at Week 48
Key Secondary objective: Endpoint/variable:

Study period:
Estimated date of first subject enrolled: Q1 [ADDRESS_400868] completed: Q4 2020
Number of Subjects:
Approximately  152 subjects will be randomized to tezepelumab or placebo (1:1) globally from 
about 65 -75 study  sites. Rando mizat ion will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338].
Treatments and treatment duration:
After the init ial enrolment and confirmat ion of entry criteria all subjects will enter a 2-week run -
in peri od pl us an up to 8 -week optimization phase to establish a minimum effe ctive dose of the 
prescribed OCS. The optimizat ion phase may  be extended to account for treatment of an 
exacerbation to allow for 2 -weeks of a stable OCS dose prior to randomizat ion.
After the OCS optimizat ion phase, subjects who fulfil the eligibilit y criteria will be randomized 
to a 48 -week treatment period. 
There are 3 phases in the 48 -week treatm ent peri od following rando mizat ion where subjects will 
be administered study  drug.
Induct ion phase –from week 0 to week 4 when subjects should remain on their optimized 
OCS dose.
OCS reducti on phase –from week 4 to week 40 when OCS dose reduction should be 
started at week 4 with the possibilit y of dose ti tration every  4 weeks. No down -titration 
after week 36.

With [ADDRESS_400871] imated that, using a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level , 
the power to reject the null hypothesis for the primary  endpoint will be at least 90%, assuming:

 Category  2 (75% -<90% reduction): 10% of subjects
 Category  3 (50% -<75% reduction): 15% of subjects
 Category  4 (>0% -<50% reduction): 15% of subjects
 Category  5 (no reducti on or an increase): 50% of subjects
Subjects who meet the eligibilit y criteria will be rando mized (1:1) to receive either tezepelumab 
210 m g Q4W SC or placebo. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the full analysis set 
(FAS), which consists of all subjects randomized and receiv ing any IP. All subjects in the FAS 
will be included in the main efficacy analyses, including subjects who discont inue IP prior to 
Week 48 (for which every  attem pt will be made to collect data after discont inuat ion of IP up 
until week 48). No need is envis aged to adj ust the pl anned number of rando mized subjects in 
order to obtain an appropriate number of evaluable subjects.
A hierarchical testing strategy  will be implemented to test for superiorit y of tezepel umab over 
placebo in the primary and key  secondar y endpo ints, whilst controlling the overall Ty pe 1 error 
rate at 0.05 (2 -sided), as fo llows:
Percentage reduction category  from baseline in daily  OCS dose at [ADDRESS_400872] not 
losing asthma control  (primary  endpoint)
AAER over 48 weeks (key  secondary  endpoint)
The primary  endpoint in the tezepelumab group will be compared to that in the placebo group 
using a proportional odds (ordinal logist ic regression) model. The response variable in the model 
will be the ordered category  number (1 -5) at Week 48 as def ined above. Treatment and region 
will be included as factors in this model. Baseline OCS dose will be included in the model as a 
continuous (linear) covariate.
Analysis of the key  secondary  endpoint will com pare the AAER over [ADDRESS_400873] over the study  period. Treatm ent, regi on, and 
history  of exacerbat ions (≤2, or >2 in previous 12 mo nths) will be included as f actors i n the 
model. The l ogari thm of the time at risk for exacerbat ion in the study  will be used as an offset 
variable.  
Addit ional sensit ivity analyses will be performed on the primary  and key  secondary  endpoints, 
including analyses to explore the impac t of missing data and early  discontinuat ion from IP.
All safet y variables will be summarized descript ively. The safet y analysis will be performed 
using the safet y analysis set, which consists of all subjects receiving any  IP.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 40 (146)maintenance OCS treatment (Data on file). Other bio logics (mep olizumab and benralizumab) 
have been shown to effect ively reduce the AAER and have also been demo nstrated to enable 
reducti on in daily  OCS dose in severe asthma pat ients requi ring maintenance therapy  with OCS 
(Bel et al  2014 , Nai r et al  2017 ). Thus, there is reason to believe that tezepelumab should be 
effect ive in reducing the dai ly OCS dose in severe asthma patients on maintenance OCS 
treatm ent.
The purpose of the present study  is to dem onstrate the abilit y of tezepelumab versus placebo to

tightness. Alt hough several treatments are available (e.g. ICS, LABA and LAMA), there is a 
clear unmet m edical need amo ng patients with severe asthma.
Biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_324628]. Omalizumab may be 
suitable for a subgroup of patients with proven reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum 
immunogl obulin E (IgE) levels who remain inadequately controlled with ICS pl us LABA 
(XOLAIR US PI 2016 ). Two addit ional bio logics, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have recently 
been approved for severe asthma with an eos inophilic phenotype ( NUCALA US PI 2015 , 
CINQAIR US PI 2016). Biologics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional 
treatment gui delines ( GINA 2017 ) as an add- on treatment to pati ents uncontrolled wi th 
LABA/ICS treatment. 
However, even when using current ly available bio logics, substant ial proporti ons of  patients 
continue to experience exacerbations and may benefit from agents that target different mo lecular 
pathways ( Wenzel 2016 , Froi dure et al  2016 , Swedin et al 2017 ). Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_96634] c opti ons, there is st ill a clear unmet medical need among pat ients with 
severe asthma, independent of IgE status or eosinophil l evel, who are unable to gain complete 
asthma control using currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that i s produced in 
response to proinflammatory  stimuli (e.g., infect ious, allergic and env ironmental  stimuli) and 
traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of inflammatory  responses, and 
can act ivate a broad range of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, 
type 2 innate lympho id cells and ba sophils ( Tedeschi SK et al 2017 , Watson and Gauvreau, 
2014 ). Classically, TSLP may be a crit ical component in the init iation and perpetuation of the T 
helper 2 (Th2) response and the result ing cascade of cytokines associated with Th2 driven 
asthma ( Kaur and Bright ling 2012 ). Asthma is now recognized as a heterogenous disease with 
subsets of patients that do not exhibit Th2 -associ ated di sease ( Wenzel 2012 ). There are em erging 
data that TSLP may also mediate non -allergic (non -T hel per cell 2) inflammat ion (Tanaka et al  
2009 ; Ziegler et al  2013 ). Given that TSLP is an upstream and pleiotropi c cytokine, the bl ockade 
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41 (146)of TSLP is therefore anticipated to have broad impact on the spectrum of inflammatory  
responses seen in asthma.
Tezepel umab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with TSLP 
receptor (TSLPR).
Results of a co mpleted study  in 31 adult subjects with mild atopic asthma (Study  20101183) 
demonstrated that administration of tezepelumab attenuated both the early  and late phase allergic
response and suppressed the expected increase in FENO fo llowing inhalat ion allergen challenge 
(Gauvreau et al 2014). Mul tiple doses of 700 m g IV tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable 
safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic asthma. Based upon these data, MedImmune/AZ have 
conducted a randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, dose range finding study in 
asthmatics who were inadequately controlled wit h medium -orhigh-dose ICS/LABA, with or 
without other controller medications.
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- [ADDRESS_400875] of 3 dose levels 
of tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately  controlled, severe asthma 
(Corren et al 2017 ). Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 rat io to 1 of 3 dose levels of SC 
tezepel umab (280 m g every  2 weeks [Q2W], 210 mg Q4W, or 70 mg Q4W) or placebo (Q2W) 
for [ADDRESS_400876] 1 dose of IP (tezepelumab or placebo). 
Statistically significant AAERR of 61%, 72%, a nd 66% for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 
280 m g Q2W tezepel umab groups, respectively, compared with placebo were observed in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion (p<0.001). Moreover, clinically significant benefits in lung 
funct ion, ACQ -6 and AQLQ+12 were observed. In addition, blood eosinophil numbers and 
FENO were significant ly suppressed. 
After repeated SC administration, mean serum tezepelumab trough concentration increased over 
time and achieved steady -state by  [CONTACT_5875] 12. Tezepelumab exhibited linear P K across the 3 doses. 
A total o f 5 (4.1%) pl acebo subjects and 8 (1.8%) tezepelumab subjects who had no detectable 
ADA at baseline had detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects developed neutralizing ADA in 
the study . The resul ts of this study  did not i dentify safet y signals associated with tezepelumab for 
any dosing regimen. The frequencies of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
similar between the placebo (62.2%) and the total tezepelumab (64.2%) dose groups and a 
majorit y of subjects had TEAE s that were mild or moderate in severit y and not related to 
investigat ional product. Few subjects had TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation o f 
investigat ional product. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated wi th an acceptable safet y 
profile and no safet y signals were ident ified.

over placebo include a clin ically  meaningful  AAERR, an increased FEV 1and an improvement in

Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no safety  signals ident ified in studi es to date. No 
serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic react ions considered related to tezepelumab were 
reported in the Phase [ADDRESS_400877] been detected in the tezepelumab program. Potential risks with tezepelumab will 
be mitigated by  [CONTACT_324680]/exclusio n criteria and cont inuous monitoring of safet y data 
during the stud y. In the present study , measures are taken to mit igate the risk for embry onal, fetal  
and child exposure to tezepelumab.
The benefit/risk assessment for tezepelumab in severe asthma based on the development through 
Phase 2 i s favourable. The future benefit / risk assessment will largely be defined by [CONTACT_324681] m

4.[ADDRESS_400882] of 210 m g Q4W SC of tezepel umab on OCS dose reduction in adult 
subjects wi th OCS dependent asthma. 
The study  will randomize approximately  152 subjects gl obally  in a 1:[ADDRESS_400883] been on a stable dose of between ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 30m g (prednisone o r 
predniso lone) daily or daily equivalent for at least [ADDRESS_400884] ion 5.1.
Eosinophils will be assessed using central lab analyses. Approximately  35% of  the subjects will 
be targeted to have ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl at enrolment. When th e target percentage of subjects for 
the eosinophil subgroup in a region is reached, consideration will be given to closing the 
IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that subgroup, which may  be done ei ther overall or within a 
specific regio n. Once a subgroup is close d, subjects in the screening/run -in period in the closed 
subgroup will not be allowed to be randomized and will be screen failed.
Secti on 6.5(Table 6and Table 7) provi des a list of medicat ion restrict ions and prohibit ions to be 
followed throughout the conduct of the clinical trial.
The study  will consist of a screening/run in period of [ADDRESS_400885] -treatm ent 
follow-up period i s 12 weeks (week 48 -60). During the treatment period, IP will be administered 
SC starting at randomization and cont inue until week 44. IP will not be administered on week 48. 
There are up to 18 visit s from screening to scheduled end of treatment, followed by [CONTACT_141074] -
up visits. 
During the screening/run -in period, the subject must undergo all assessments per Table 1.

Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47 (146)Prior to randomizat ion the subjects must meet all inclusion /exclusion criteria. If a subject does 
not m eet all  inclusi on criteria or meets any  exclusion cri teria as per section 5.1and section 5.2, 
the subject will be screen failed. Further details are specified in section 5.5. 
Subjects who ar e administered IP week [ADDRESS_400886] -treatment follow -up peri od. 
Subjects who prematurely discont inue IP during the study will be encouraged to undergo 
appropriate study  visits/procedures for the full 48-week peri od. Subjects should have an IPD visit 
at [ADDRESS_400887] ion 7.1.1 . Any new treatments that 
are init iated will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Subjects remaining on IP for entire planned treatment period, may be eligible to en roll in the 
extensio n study . These subjects will transit ion to the extensio n study , after com pleting the EOT 
assessments at week 48 and thus they  will not attend the follow -up visits at Week 54 and Week 
60.
4.2 Scientific rationale for study design
This is a g lobal study  designed to evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of a fixed 210 m g dose of 
tezepel umab administered Q4W SC in severe asthma subjects who are on maintenance OCS and 
ICS/LABA therapy , with or wi thout addi tional asthma controller(s). The primary effic acy 
measure will be based on the percentage change from baseline in the prescribed, daily, average 
OCS dose at week [ADDRESS_400888] iveness to maintain asthma control 
without exacerbat ions. This study  has a similar design and endpo ints as previous studies with 
mepo lizumab ( Bel et al  2014 ) and benralizumab ( Nair et al  2017 ). A difference in this study 
design from previous OCS sparing studies is that the duration of the present study  is longer; [ADDRESS_400889].

an exposure- response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using 
popul ation PK/PD methodo logy. The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed based 
on all available data fro m 5 Phase 1 studies (Study 20070620, Study  20080390, Study  2010118, 
Study  D5180C00003, Study  D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study  D5240C00001 and 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929 -1146). The exposure -response analysis was based on the Phase 2b 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146.
Analysis of data fro m the phase 2b study  identified a statist ically significant exposure -response 
against the primary efficacy endpo int of AAER and the pharma co-dynamic endpo int FENO. 
These relat ionships indicate that the dose of [ADDRESS_400891] has co mpleted his/her last scheduled contact.
A subject i s considered to have co mpleted the study when he/she has co mpleted his/her last 
scheduled contact.

to be stored at 2°C to 8°C until used. If there ar e any  defects noted wi th the IP, the investigator 
and site monitor should be notified immediately. Preparation of IP must be performed by a 
qualified person (e.g., pharmacist or study  nurse) at the site.
The IP product does not contain preservat ives and an y unused portion must be discarded. 
Preparati on of  the IP i s to be perform ed asept ically. Total in -use storage time fro m needle 
puncture of the IP vial to start of administration should not exceed [ADDRESS_400915]’s dose, the IP manager will select IP for administration according to the 
kit identificat ion numbers assigned by  [CONTACT_21926]. One vial  of IP will be assigned by  [CONTACT_96752]. 
Dose preparation steps:
1. Allow the vial to equilibrate at room temperature (about 30 minutes to 1 hour). Ensure 
that the vial is adequately protected from light during the warming process. Gently 
swirl the vial to ensure the contents are mixed to a clear, homog eneous so lution. Do 
not shake.
2. To prepare the IP for administration, remove the tab portion of the vial cap and clean 
the stopper with 70% ethyl alcoho l or equivalent. 
3. Attach a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle to a [ADDRESS_400916] be discarde d immediately

into the SC tissue using gent le pressure. The area should not be massaged after injection. It is 
advised that t he site of inject ion of IP be rotated such that the subject receives IP at a different 
anatomical site at each treatment visit. Injection sit e must be documented on the eCRF and in the 
source documents at each treatment visit. In cases when rotation of the injection site is not 
feasible and/or the subject prefers not to rotate injection sites, the reason for not rotating the 
inject ion site shoul d be docum ented in the source documents.

6.3 Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding
Subject enrolment and randomization 
The Investigator(s) should keep a subject screening log list ing of those who have entered pre -
study  screening. The Invest igator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the potenti al subject before any  study  specific 
procedures are performed.
2. Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’) via 
the Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response Syst em 
(IWRS/IVRS).
3. Determine subject eligibilit y. 
4. Assign the eligible subject unique rando mizat ion code via the Interactive Web 
Response Sy stem /Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS).
5. Subjects will be allocated to receive tezepelumab or placebo in a 1 :[ADDRESS_400921] withdraws fro m 
the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion code cannot be reused. Wit hdrawn 
subjects will not be replaced 
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in the separate 
manual.
Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
rando mized or receive study medicat ion. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who 
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 (146)are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study .
If a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly  
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the [COMPANY_008] study physician 
immediately . A discussi on shoul d occur between the [COMPANY_008] study  physician and the 
investigator reg arding whether to continue or discont inue the subject from treatment. Study 
treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safet y 
risk to the subject. In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study  therapy  is judged not to present 
a concern related to safet y and disease management, the rationale for continuing study  therapy  
must be clearly documented. Regardless of what is decided about IP, all rando mized subjects 
shoul d remain in the study  and the subjects should continue to be fo llowed up in accordance with 
defined study  procedures. The [COMPANY_008] study  physician must ensure all decisio ns are 
appropriately  docum ented.
Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially in each stratum  as subjects beco me 
eligible for randomizat ion.
The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a co mputerized 
system  provi ded by  [CONTACT_324684] (AZRand). All subjects will be 
stratified at randomizat ion by [CONTACT_244945] n.
Approximately  35% of  the subjects will be targeted to have ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl at enrolment. 
Therefore, further enrolment of subjects with < 300 eosinophils/μl may be halted to achieve the 
requi red percentage . 
Ensuring blinding 
This is a double -blind study  in which tezepelumab and placebo are not visually  distinct from 
each other. All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding for 
all sponsor and investigational site staff. Neither the subject nor any  of the invest igators or 
sponsor staff who are invo lved in the treatment or clinical evaluat ion and m onitoring of the 
subjects will be aware of the treatment received.
To further prevent unblinding, blood eosinophil, basophils an d monocy te numbers from  the visits 
after randomizat ion visit will be redacted fro m the central  laboratory  reports. In addit ion, FENO 
resul ts will  also be blinded throughout the study . 
[COMPANY_008] site monitor will perform IP accountabilit y. In the event t hat the treatment 
allocat ion for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other study  staff invo lved in the 
management of study  subjects, or needs to be known to treat an individual subject for an AE, the 
sponsor m ust be notified immediately by  [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and if possible, before unblinding.
The fo llowing personnel will have access to the rando mizat ion list:

 those invo lved in the reporting and reviewing the DSMB presentations
The informat ion in the randomization list will be kept f rom other personnel invo lved in the 
conduct of the study  and in a secure location unt il the end of the study.
No other m ember of the extended study  team  at [COMPANY_008], or any  CRO handling data, will 
have access to the rando mizat ion scheme during the conduct of the study  until  after the primary 
database lock.
Methods for unblinding
Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the treatment randomizat ion for each rando mized subject, 
will be available to the Invest igator(s) and  Study  Coordinator(s) at the study  sites from the 
IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be

8.1 Efficacy assessments 
8.1.1 Overview of OCS dose management
During the OCS optimizat ion phase, the minimum OCS dose while maintaining asthma con trol 
(optimized dose) will be reached for all subjects. Asthma control and the criteria for OCS dose 
reducti on are described in sect ion [IP_ADDRESS] . The optimized OCS dose will be kept stable for 2 
weeks prior to randomizat ion and will be considered the baseline OCS dose. 
The baseline OCS dose should be maintained at the same level fro m visit 5 (two weeks prior to 
rando mizat ion) to visit 7 (end of induc tion phase).
OCS dose reduction will co mmence at visit [ADDRESS_400952] ion [IP_ADDRESS] (reduction phase). 
During the reduction phase a minimum stable OCS dose, or complete eliminat ion of requirement 
for OCS, while maintaining asthma control, will be reached for each subject.
If possible, no adjustments should be made to the OCS dose at visit 16 and 17 (maintenance 
period) and until visit 18 (End of treatment).
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 73 (146)[IP_ADDRESS] OCS dose titration
At visit 1 subjects will continue with or be switched to prednisone/predniso lone.For subjects not 
previously receiving prednisone/predniso lone as OCS, the conversio n table shown in 0will be 
used to calculate the equivalent prednisone/prednisolone dose for dose titrations. 
The OCS dose titration will fo llow the same approach for both the optimization and the 
reducti on phase. The dose of OCS should be reduced if the subject meets the protocol defined 
criteria indicat ing that it is acceptable for the subject to reduce OCS, as described in sect ion 
[IP_ADDRESS] . When a subject does not meet these criteria defining asthma control, the investigator 
shoul d preferent ially increase up one step unl ess the j udgment of the invest igator is to maintain 
the subject on their current dose of OCS, depending on the rationale for not reducing per 
schedule. The OCS dose changes and their reasons must be documented in the source 
docum entati on and recorded in the appropriate eCRF form.
OCS dose titration in the optimization phase
In the OCS dose optimization phase, dose titration should begin at visit 2. 
Baseline readings to be used for dose titrations in the optimization period will be the mean of
measures (morning PEFs, SABA use and night time awakenings) collected between visit [ADDRESS_400953] on -site for visits 3 and 4.  OCS dose reductions can occur at 2 -week intervals 
according to the titration schedule ( Table 8). In the dosing interva l >10 -30 m g prednisone or 
predniso lone per day , the change in daily dose is 5 mg, whereas in the interval 7.5- 10 m g, the 
corresponding reduction is 2.5 mg.

eInvestigator will provide detailed rationale in eCRF for not reducing the OCS dose.
fInvestigator will provide detailed description, in the eCRF, of the signs/symptoms of AI for not reducing the

It is at the di screti on of  the Investi gator to continue with the OCS down -titration even if the

in the source notes and captured in the eCRF. This decisio n must be notified to the [COMPANY_008] 
study  physician wit hin 2 business days.
When a decisio n is made to not reduce th e OCS dose according to the reduction algorithm, the 
reason(s) for not reducing OCS must be documented in the source notes and captured in the 
eCRF. Depending on the rationale for not reducing per schedule, the invest igator should

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76 (146)subject on their current dose of OCS. This will be defined as the optimized OCS dose for the 
optimizat ion phase and the visit must be combined with Visit 5. Once the optimized OCS dose 
isreached, no further OCS dose reductions should be performed during the optimization 
phase. The subject should be maintained on that OCS dose until rando mizat ion (Vi sit 6). 
Subjects who do not meet all o f the criteria for continuing OCS down titration spec ified in Table 
10during the reduction phase, should preferent ially be returned to the previous effective OCS 
dose (i .e. the higher dose level prior to not meeting the down -titration cri teria) after they  have 
returned to their baseline level o f asthma control established prior to the randomizat ion visit. 
However, depending on the rationale for not reducing per schedule, the investigator may  decide 
to maintain the subject on the OCS dose at which the down -titration cri teria were not m et. 
Further dose reductions, during the reduction phase, can be considered in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960] (further reductions will fo llow the scheduled titration, see Table 9). The 
decisio n and reason must be captured in the eCRF.
Throughout the reduction phase, subjects should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency  (AI). When subjects reach a prednisone/predniso lonedose of 5 m g/day  the 
investigator should inform them o f the signs and symptom s of AI and provide them a steroid 
card informing healt h care providers that the subject may  need addi tional corti costeroi ds in case 
of medical emergencies. In evaluat ing subjects for OCS dose reductions to below 5 mg/day the 
investigator should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of AI. The recommended init ial dose 
reducti on from 5 mg/day shoul d be to 2.5 m g/day .After 4 weeks at this OCS dose another 
reducti on to 0 m g/day shoul d be considered. However, if, in the judgment of the invest igator, 
OCS dose reduction should be more gradually  tapered, dose reductions of 1 to 1.25 mg/day  
every [ADDRESS_400960] dose strength is not available in the country  the daily  dose to 
be administered could be achieved by [CONTACT_324690] . Daily  dose will be the average of 2 
days. See 0for help dosi ng < 5 m g in relat ion to tablet strength. Subjects with a final daily OCS 
dose >0 and ≤5 mg who are unable to reduce their OCS dose further due to AI, should be 
specified in eCRF.
8.1.2 Asthma exacerbations –Assessment and management
During the study , an asthma exacerbat ion will be defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms 
(defined below) that leads to any  of the fo llowing:
A tem porary  bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids (at a dose at least 1 level higher than the 
current ti tration step) for at l east 3 consecutive days to treat symptoms of asthma worsening; a 
single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3- day 
bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids. Note: Per protocol up titration of OCS dose to 1 level 
higher (as described in Table 9) is not considered an exacerbat ion event per se.
An emergency  room  or urgent care visit (define d as evaluat ion and treatment for <24 hours in 
an emergency department or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic 
corticosteroi ds (as per the above).
An in-patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094] (defined as admission to an inpatient facilit y and/or evalu ation 
and treatment in a healt hcare facilit y for ≥ 24 hours) due to asthma.
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]

worsening happens to be coincident with a scheduled visit window. A copy  of the m edical  record 
shoul d be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at non -study  sites (e.g., by  [CONTACT_324693]/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and details entered into the specific eCRF (EXACATE) 
module in a timely fashio n. Changes in conc omitant m edicat ion due to exacerbation must be 
recorded in the appropriate module o f the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation management during the run -in period
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbat ion during the run -in period may remain in the 
study . After the treatm ent of exacerbat ion, the subject should preferent ially be pl aced on an OCS 
dose one step (or more if considered necessary  by [CONTACT_3170]) higher than the dose they 
were on when the exacerbat ion occurred, unless the judgment of the invest igator i s to maintain 
the subject on their current dose of OCS. They  should be on a stabl e OCS dose for a period of 2 -
weeks before beginning the optimization phase.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation management during the optimization phase
If a subject experiences an asthma exacerbat ion during optimizat ion phase, OCS dose reduction 
shoul d stop. After the treatm ent of exacerbation, the subject should preferent ially be pl aced on an 
OCS dose one step (or more if considered necessary by [CONTACT_3170]) higher than the dose 
they were on w hen the exacerbation occurred, unless the judgment of the investigator is to 
maintain the subject on their current dose of OCS. The optimizat ion phase could be extended to 
allow for the subject to be on a stable OCS dose for 2 weeks prior to randomizat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS] Exacerbation management during the treatment period
Those who experience an exacerbation after randomizat ion may remain on the IP at the 
Invest igator’s discret ion. 
Induction phase
If a subject experiences an exacerbat ion during the induction phase, start of OCS dose reductions 
may be delayed. After the OCS bolus/burst to treat an exacerbat ion is complete, the subject may 
be returned to one step (or more if considered necessary by [CONTACT_3170]) higher than the OCS 
dose they  were on when the exacerbat ion occurred or the invest igator may decide to maintain the 
same OCS dose. 
The subject’s OCS dose should be stable for at least two weeks before entering the OCS dose 
reducti on phase . 
Reduction phase

Further dose reductions during the reduction phase can be considered in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
Invest igator. However, no further dose reductions should be performed after week 36. 
Maintenance phase
If a subject experiences an exacerbat ion during the maintenance phase, after the OCS bo lus/burst 
is co mplete, the subject may be returned to one step (or more if considered necessary by [CONTACT_1275]) higher than the OCS dose they  were on when the exac erbat ion occurred or the 
investigator may  decide to m aintain the same OCS dose throughout the maintenance phase.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 82 (146)Asthma Symptom Diary
Asthma symptoms will be recorded using the ASD ( Globe et al 2015 ). The ASD comprises 10 
items (5 i tems in the m orning; 5 i tems in the evening). The morning items assess night time 
symptom  severi ty in relati on to wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and 
the frequency o f night time awakening. The evening items assess symptom severit y in relation to 
wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and act ivity limitation since waking. 
Items are scored from “0” (no symptom, no night time awakening, or no activit y limitation) to 
“4” (very  severe symptom , unable to sl eep, or extrem e act ivity limitat ion). A daily ASD score is 
the mean of the 10 items. R esponses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD 
score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. Calculat ion of a daily ASD score requires data fro m the 
evening diary  assessment and the subsequent morning diary assessment. For the [ADDRESS_400970] 4 of the 7

8.2.4 Vital signs
Vital signs (i .e. pul se, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_96683]) will be obtained in 
accordance with SoA. 
Vital signs will  be taken pri or to bl ood drawing, IP administration and, if possible, usual asthma 
controller medicat ion. Subjects should be observed for a minimum o f [ADDRESS_400981] in a quiet setting without distractions (e .g., tel evision, cell  phones).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 (146)8.2.6 Glucocorticoid toxicity index
Glucocorti coid Toxicit y Index (GTI) will be assessed as described by  [CONTACT_310420]  2016
(see Appendix Hfor details). The composite GTI captures commo n glucocorti coid (GC) 
toxicities that are sensitive to differing cumulat ive GC doses over the period of a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_324652] (6 m onths to 3 y ears). The individual items within the GTI are weighted relat ive to each 
other for severit y, and the instrument has the capabilit y of measuring not only worsening of GC 
toxicity over baseline, but al so improvem ent.
The composite GTI measures change in GC toxicit y rather than absol ute GC toxi city in order to 
account for the effects of prior GC therapy . Scoring should be performed as per SoA, using  the 
rando misat ion assessment as the baseline. The GTI items were ranked in order of severit y within 
each dom ain.  The relative weights for each toxicit y item were derived using mult icriteria 
decisio n analysis (MCDA).  MCDA has been used for the creation of mult iple classification 
criteria sets in a variet y of inflammatory  diseases, including rheumatoid arthrit is (Neogi  T et al  
2010 ), systemic sclerosis ( Johnson S R et al  2014 ), systemic lupus ery thematosus ( Tedeschi SK 
et al 2017 ). IgG4 -Related Disease classificat ion criteri a is presently under development (JH 
Stone; personal co mmunicat ion).
The composite GTI will be assessed at the timepo ints given in the SoA. The fo llowing i tems will  
be assessed: BMI, glucose tolerance (HbA1c), blood pressure, LDL, steroid myopathy, skin 
toxicity, neuropsy chiatri c toxi city and Infect ion.

9.1 Statistical hypotheses
The fo llowing two -sided hypotheses will be evaluated in this trial at the 0.05 significance level. 
All other hypothesis testing in this study will be considered explorat ory.
Primary endpoint
H01: Cum ulative odds ratio of percentage reduction category from baseline in daily OCS dose at

versus
H11: Cum ulative odds ratio of percentage reduction category from baseline in daily OCS dose at 
[ADDRESS_401004] not losing asthma control (tezepelumab/placebo) ≠ 1.
For 5 ordered categories, there are 4 possible cumulat ive odds for each treatment group, 
corresponding to the 4 different possible binary  splits, which are defined as fo llows:
• Category  1 versus categori es (2,3,4,5)
• Categories (1,2) versus categories (3,4,5)
• Categories (1,2,3) versus categories (4,5)
• Categories (1,2,3,4) versus category  5,
where the ordered categories for OCS daily dose reduction are i n turn defined as:
• Category  1: 90% -100% reduction
• Category  2: 75% -<90% reduction
• Category  3: 50% -<75% reduction
• Category  4: >0% -<50% reduction

Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98 (146)• Category  5: no reducti on or an increase.
The above hypothesis assumes that the 4 possible odds ratios between the 2 treatments as defined 
above are the same (this is the proportional odds assumpt ion).   
The di rection of superiorit y of tezepel umab is indicated by  [CONTACT_324700] o greater than 1.
Key secondary endpoints
H02: AAER ratio over 48 weeks (tezepelumab/placebo) = 1
versus
H12: AAER ratio over 48 weeks (tezepelumab/placebo) ≠ 1
The di rection of superiorit y of tezepel umab is indicated by  a rate rati o less than 1.
9.2 Sample size determination 
Approximately  152 subjects will be randomly  assigned to study  treatm ent using 1:[ADDRESS_401005] imated that, using a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level, 
the power to reject the null hypothesis for the primary  endpoint will be at least 90%, assuming:
• An odds ratio of 2.75 and the proportional odds assumpt ion (see Sect ion 9.1)
• The proporti on of  subjects in the [ADDRESS_401006] ion with mepolizum ab Study (SIRIUS) ( Bel et al 2014 ). The 
following proportions have been assumed for placebo:
Category  1 (90% - 100% reduction): 10% of subjects
Category  2 (75% -<90% reduction): 10% of subjects
Category  3 (50% -<75% reduction): 15% of subjects
Category  4 (>0% -<50% reduction): 15% of subjects
Category  5 (no reducti on or an increase): 50% of subjects
The minimal detectable odds ratio still being significant with the above assumpt ions is 1.86.
For the key  secondary  endpoint, 76 subjects per group has >80%  power to reject the null 
hypothesis for rate ratios up to 0.39, us ing a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level, and assuming:
A placebo rate of 1.3 exacerbations/year in this study  populati on
A conservat ive assumption on the dispersio n parameter (2.4)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 100 (146)Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979]. A comprehensive statist ical 
analysis plan will be developed and finalised before primary database lock and will describe the 
subject populat ions to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, 
unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary  of the pl anned stati stical analyses of the 
primary  and secondary endpoints. Any deviat ions from  this plan will be reported in the clinical 
study  report.
Frequency and percentages of subject disposit ion and reasons for discont inuat ion of IP will be 
presented. Subjects who prematurely  discontinue the IP will be listed along wit h the reason for 
discontinuat ion. In addit ion, frequency and percentages of withdrawal from  the study  together 
with reasons will be presented.
Dem ographics and subject characterist ics will be summarized by [CONTACT_324702] (for categorical variables) and n, mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, 
median and m aximum (for continuous variables) using the full analysis set.
Relevant medical history /current m edical condit ions will be summarized by  [CONTACT_3227],

Prior and concomitant m edicat ions, categorized according to the WHO Drug Reference List 
dictionary which empl oys the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classificat ion system, 
will be summarized by  [CONTACT_324703]. 
Prior medicat ions are defined as those which stopped before first dose of IP. Concomitant 
medicat ions are defined as those which eit her started or continued after first dose of IP.
Important protocol devi ations will be defined prior to unblinding and summarised by [CONTACT_6490]. Subjects will not be excluded fro m analysis sets on the basis of any  important protocol  
deviat ions. The definit ions of each category  of important protocol  deviat ion will  be fully
specified in the SAP, and may include (but not necessarily limited to): subjects who were 
rando mised to study treatment without fulfilling key entry criteria; subjects who received 
prohibited or restricted concomitant medications while on IP, subjects who received the incorrect

missing, then the baseline will be considered to be missing. For titration of  the OCS dose 
baseline values for optimizat ion phase are calculated fro m completed eDi ary records of a 
minimum o f 10 out of 14 day s before visit 2. Similarly  baseline values for the reduction phase 
will be calculated from a minimum o f 10 out of 14 day s before randomizat ion visit.
Further details regarding baseline definit ions will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.3 Efficacy analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint
The primary  analysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint will quantify the effect of the init ially 
rando mised treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received. This analysis 
will therefore include all available data after treatment discont inuat ion for subjects who continue 
to attend monthly  visits either at si te or b y telephone. Subjects will be encouraged to continue to 
undergo applicable study  related visits/procedures for the full [ADDRESS_401011] not losing asthma control (as per Table 10), by [CONTACT_324704], where percent change 
from baseline is defined as {(final dose -baseline dose} /baseline dose)*100. Percent change fro m 
baseline will then be categorized per the categories in Sect ion 3. 
The final OCS dose is defined based on the prescribed dose, expressed as a dose per day , at week 
48. If the subject is on a fixed daily  dose, then the OCS dose is defined as that prescribed dose. If 
the subject i s on an every  other day  regimen, then the OCS dose is defined as the average amount 
prescribed to be taken each day. 
Further details on deriving the final OCS dose in specific situat ions including asthma 
deteri oration, discont inuat ion from study, and premature discont inuat ion from IP (with different 
options for subject fo llow up), will be specified in the SAP.
The primary  endpoint in the tezepelumab group will be compared to that in the placebo group 
using a proportional odds (ordinal logist ic regression) model. This model will be used to perform 
the stati stical test specified in Sect ion 9.1, and to estimate the treatment effect and its 95% 
confidence interval. The response variable in the model will be the ordered category  number (1 -

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102 (146)5) at Week [ADDRESS_401012] ion 9.1. Treatm ent and regi on will be included as factors in this 
model. Baseline OCS dose will also be included in the model as a continuous (linear) covariate.
Frequency tables of the number and pr oportion of subjects in each of the response categories will 
be presented. Cumulat ive responder (percentage reduction) plots will be presented to aid 
interpretati on of  the primary  analysis. In addi tion, the number and proportion of subjects with 
final dail y oral  corti costeroi d dose >0 and ≤[ADDRESS_401013] stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (van Elteren test).
The consistency o f treatm ent effect across baseline bio markers and demographic variables will 
be evaluated descript ively, given the possible limit ations of  sample size on statistical modelling 
approaches in this trial. Any further requirements for subgroup analysis, and exact definit ion of 
all relevant categories where needed, will be pre- specified in the SAP.
Sensit ivity analyses on the primary  endpo int will be performed, and will be fully  specified in the 
SAP. These may  include, but not necessarily be limited to:
• Analysis which makes provisio n for data to be missing -not- at-random (MNAR) and 
which makes different assumpt ions regarding those subjects who di scont inue treatment or study  
prior to 48 weeks
• The impact of different imputation strategies for the final OCS dose including switching 
to other asthma treatments
• An invest igation into the proportional odds assumption, and if necessary  further analyses 
which make fewer restrictions with regards to this assumpt ion and/or analyses using different 
response category  defini tions 
• Analysis in which addit ional factors or covari ates are included.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoints
The main analysis o f the key  secondary  endpoint (AAER over 48 weeks) will quant ify the effect 
of the ini tially randomised treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received. 
This analysis will therefore include all available data after t reatment discont inuat ion. Subjects 
will be encouraged to continue to undergo applicable study  related visits/procedures for the full 
48-week period even after premature discont inuat ion of IP.
AAER in the tezepelumab group will be co mpared to that seen in t he placebo group using a 
negat ive binomial model. This m odel will be used to estimate the rate ratio and its 95% 
confidence interval. The response variable in the model will be the number of asthma 
exacerbations experienced by a subject over the 48 -week tr eatment period (or shorter duration if 
not fo llowed up for the full 48 weeks). Treatment, region and history  of exacerbat ions (≤2 or >2 
in previous 12 months) will be included as factors in this model. The logarithm o f the time at risk 
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C000 09
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 103 (146)for exacerbat ion in the study  will be used as an offset variable in the model, to adjust for subjects 
having different fo llow-up times during which the events occur. Time during an exacerbation 
and the 7 day s following an exacerbat ion in which a new exacerbat ion cannot occur, will not be 
included in the calculat ion of time at risk for exacerbat ion. 
Descript ive summaries of the AAER will also be presented.
Sensit ivity analyses on the key  secondary  endpoint will be performed, and will be fully  specified 
in the SAP. These may  include, but not necessarily be limited to, similar items considered for the 
primary  endpoint (where relevant).
Rates for the individual exacerbat ion criteria (em ergency room  or urgent care visit s due to 
asthma that required systemic corticosteroids, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324655], or use of systemic 
corticosteroi ds) will be summarized and analysed similarly.
A sensit ivity analysis may be performed where adjudicat ion outcom e of the ER or urgent care 
visits, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_324656].
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of other efficacy endpoints
Binary (responder) endpo ints which support the primary object ive wit h regards to OCS dose 
reducti on will be summarized using frequency  tables. The odds rati o (tezepel umab/placebo) and 
its 95% confidence interval will be estimated for each endpo int from a logisti c regressio n model 
with factors for treatment and region, and baseline OCS dose included as a continuous (linear) 
covari ate.
Other binary endpo ints will be summarized and analysed similarly; these analyses will be 
adjusted for regi on and baseline o f the corresponding endpo int.
Changes fro m baseline in cont inuous variables will generally be analysed using a mixed model 
for repeated m easures (MMRM) model for each endpoint. This model will be used to estimate 
the treat ment effect at Week 48 and its 95% confidence interval. The response variable in the 
model will be the change from baseline at each scheduled post- randomisat ion visit up to and 
including Week 48, and irrespect ive of whether the subject remained on treatmen t and/or took 
other treatments. Treatment, visit, region and treatment by  [CONTACT_324705] i n this model. The baseline o f the corresponding endpoint will also be included in the 
model as a continuous covari ate. Unstructured cov ariance will  be assumed to m odel the 
relationship between pairs of response variables taken at different visits on the same subject. If 
the MMRM model fails to converge with unstructured covariance, the SAP will pre -specify  the 
approach for select ing a sim pler covari ance structure. The Kenward- Roger approximat ion to 
estimat ing the degrees of freedo m will be used for tests of fixed effects derived from the MMRM 
model.
Descript ive summaries of continuous endpo ints will also be presented. Adjusted means fro m the 
MMRM m odel above will be displayed graphically  over time.
Time to first asthma exacerbat ion will be summarised graphically using Kaplan -Meier est imates, 
and analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with factors for treatment and region.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
versio n in force at each database lock. The definit ion of on -treatm ent and on -study  for adverse 
event analyses will be given in the SAP.
The number and perc entage of subjects with on -treatm ent and on -study  adverse events will be 
tabul ated separately by  [CONTACT_324706]. An event that occurred one or 
more times during a period will contribute 1 observat ion to the numerator of the proportio n. The 
deno minator of the proportion will co mprise all subjects in the full analysis set. On -treatm ent 
adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_243696] y/severit y and separately , by 
[CONTACT_20084] y/relatedness (as determined by [CONTACT_3170]). Should a subje ct report the same 
preferred term/system organ class within mult iple intensit y/severit y or causalit y/relatedness 
categori es, the subject’s worst occurrence (most severe/most related) will be tabulated. Serious 
AEs, AEs leading to discont inuat ion from IP, and commo nly occurring AEs will be summarized 
in a generally similar manner. Adverse events, SAEs, AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to 
discontinuat ion of IP will be summarized for each treatment group as applicable. 
An overall summary o f on-treatm ent AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_324707]. 
AEs of Special Interest (AESIs) will also be summarised descript ively by [CONTACT_1570].
Laboratory  data will be summarized by [CONTACT_324708] s (baseline to 
most extrem e post -baseline value) and by [CONTACT_324709] (means, medians, quartiles, ranges). The incidence of clinically notable 
laboratory  abnorm alities will be summarized. 
Vital signs data will be summarized by [CONTACT_324710]. The incidence o f clinically notable vital signs abnormalit ies will be

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 (146)Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information
B [ADDRESS_401034] a causal  
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(e.g.  an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nau sea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre-exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no Study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_103421] 
 Results in persistent or signif icant di sabili ty or incapaci ty.  
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may  require medical  
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject ’s 
death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form  it might 
have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B 4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72917] a serious AE , although the reasons for 
it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, larynge al oedem a). Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_324660]/or surgi cal 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 (146)B [ADDRESS_401035] drug d oes not mean that i t is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophe n) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913]
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
 Adrenal crisis
B 6 Intensity rating scale:
1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
3. severe (incapacitat ing, w ith inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_244986] B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendi x B 2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B 2.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116 (146) Time Course. Expo sure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmacology  and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
 No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_309581], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support a 
re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considere d such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general , that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available da ta including enough information 
to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the case, it is likely 
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orate d due to lack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 8 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther ca uses harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.

Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117 (146)Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.  
 occurred
 was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
 did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
 Dispensing error e.g. medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given 
to the parti cipant
 Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administrat ion
 Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
 Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
 Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS /IWRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one o f 
the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
 Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) e.g.  forgot to take medication
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121 (146)Appendix D Genetics
D 1 Use/analysis of DNA
Genet ic variat ion may impact a subject’s response to therapy , susceptibilit y to, and severi ty and 
progression of disease. Variable response to therapy  may be due to geneti c determinants that 
impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism  of action of the 
drug; di sease aet iology; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. Therefore, where 
local regulati ons and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from
consent ing subjects.
[COMPANY_008] intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to 
medicat ions. Genet ic research may lead to better u nderstanding of diseases, better diagnosis of 
diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery  of new diagnosti cs, 
treatm ents or m edicat ions.  
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical 
character istics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the entire 
geno me. 
The resul ts of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study  report (CSR) or in a separate 
study  summary .
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confident iality.
The samples will be retained while research on tezepelumab cont inues but no l onger than [ADDRESS_401039] of the m ain study .

 Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
 Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in [ADDRESS_401040] ion
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  
Subjects m ay withdraw from  this genetic research at any  time, independent of any decisio n 
concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study . Vol untary  discont inuat ion will not 
prejudice further treatment. Procedures for discontinuat ion are outli ned in Sect ion 7of the m ain 
Clinical Study  Protocol .
Collection of samples for genetic research
The blood samples for genetic research will be obtained fro m the subjects as per SoA. Although 
DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducin g bias through excluding 
subjects who may wit hdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such subjects would be important to 
include in any genet ic analysis. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as 
detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and storage of DNA samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to 
maintain subject confident iality. Sam ples will  be stored for a m aximum  of 15years, from the 
date of l ast subject l ast visit, after whi ch they  will be destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that is 
used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or 
the maximum storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the bloo d either before or at the time of DNA 
extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable only by [CONTACT_33160], unique number. This number is used to ident ify the sample and 
corresponding data at the AstraZene ca genet ics laboratories, or at the designated organisat ion. 
No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person ([COMPANY_008] 
employee or desi gnated organi sations working wi th the DNA).
The link between the subject enrolment/rand omisati on code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at [COMPANY_008] or 
designated organisations. The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for 
analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical  data, all ow regulatory  audi t, and 
permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent.
Ethical and regulatory requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , including this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in Appendix D.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 (146)Informed consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal and the subject may participate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in 
the genet ic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for the 
main study  and the genet ic component of the study. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_324661]. The Principal 
Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the subject 
understands that they  may freely discont inue from the genet ic aspect of the study at any time.
Subject data protection
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by  [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the subject. Regul atory  authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though 
the subject’s medical informat ion and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated in t his study will be stored at a secure system at [COMPANY_008] 
and/or designated organizations to analyse the samples.
[COMPANY_008] and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease ) from this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], academic organisat ions or health insurance co mpanies. This can 
be done by [CONTACT_103472], where they can be combined with the 
resul ts of similar studi es to learn even more about healt h and disease. The researchers can only 
use thi s informat ion for health -related research purposes. Researchers may see summary results 
but they  will not be able to see individual subject data or any  personal  identifiers.  
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a 
suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.
Statistical methods and determination of sample size
The number of subjects that will agree to par ticipate in the genet ic research is unknown. It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated. A Statist ical

comprehensive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. Specific guidance on 
managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Section 7.[ADDRESS_401041] meets potential 
PHL cri teria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are a ppropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study  visit s and other visits including central and all local 
laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visits; for exam ple, PHL cri teria 
could be met by [CONTACT_96724]  a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from  a local 
laboratory .
The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
TheInvesti gator parti cipates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the elevat ions in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_324715] (IMP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review 
and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes.

Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 125 (146)For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the elevations 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory  
data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3×ULN
 AST ≥ 3×ULN
 TBL ≥ 2×ULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a subject meets any o f the PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (and also to the [COMPANY_008] 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilan t for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_19690]
 Com plete the appro priate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
 Determine whether the subject meets PHL criter ia (see Section E 2Definit ions wi thin 
this Appendix for definit ion) by [CONTACT_244995] m all previous visit s

E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126 (146) Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
 Within [ADDRESS_401042] igator will report the case as an SAE 
of Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y 
assessment ‘ yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting
 For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required 
to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion
 The Study  Physician conta cts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree 
an approach for the study  subjects’ fo llow-up (including any  further laboratory  testing) 
and the continuous review of data. 
 Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
 Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and 
appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or 
baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Completes 
follow-up SAE Form as required. 
 Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic
investigat ions as discussed with the Study  Physician. This 
includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit 
shoul d be used.
 Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes 
available 
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s L aw cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether there 
is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_2203], to 
ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorities within [ADDRESS_401043] matter experts as 
appropriate.  
Clinical Study Protocol - 4 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00009
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 127 (146)According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instru ctions bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE:  update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new information (re assessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) a ccording to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.  
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavo idable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the informat ion necessary  
to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be m ade:
 Provi de any further update to the previously  submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for S AE 
reporting. Cont inue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.

G [ADDRESS_401045] inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (e.g. IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for 
defining anaphylaxis for this study  are listed in section 2. A guide to the signs and symptoms and 
management of acute anaphylaxis is p rovided in section 3. Appropriate drugs, such as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], ant ihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat anaphylact ic 
reacti ons must be immediately available at study  sites, and study  personnel should be trained to 
recogni ze and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. 
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase.
G 2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex 
Disease
Anaphylaxis
In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the fo llowing 3 cri teria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the skin, 
mucosal t issue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swo llen lips -tongue -
uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097] (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hy poxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion 
(e.g. hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence).
2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11312] a likely allergen for that 
subject (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (e.g. generalized hives, itch- flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula).
(b) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097] (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced 
PEF, hy poxemia).
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hy potonia [collapse], syncope, 
incont inence).
(d) Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdominal pain, vomit ing).

G 3 Signs and Symptoms and Management of Acute Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially lethal mult i-system  allergic reacti on in which som e or all  
of the fo llowing signs and symptoms occur: 
Diffuse ery thema
Pruri tus
Urticaria and/or angioedema
Bronchospasm
Laryngeal edema
Hypotensi on
Cardi ac arrhy thmias

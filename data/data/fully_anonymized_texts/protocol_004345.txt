4.[ADDRESS_103155] SUMMARY   
 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Patellar tendinopathy (PT) is a common disabling overuse injury that is highly prevalent in sports, 
especially amongst jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_93342]. PT affects 32% of elite basketball players and may lead to 
considerable long- term morbidity , resulting in a negative effect on their career with up to 50% of 
athletes forced to quit their sport. Treatment of PT remains challenging, and no currently available conservative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_93343]. We will conduct a [ADDRESS_103156] a double- blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate if platelet -rich plasma 
(PRP) is effective for treating PT (4- 6).  Clinical (pain and function scores) and biomechanical 
(knee strength) measures will be correlated with disease modification changes assessed using 
conventional and novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) 
techniques.  
 ELIBIGILITY  
This research will target adult s, ages 18 to 39 years, diagnosed with chronic (>3 months) patellar 
tendonitis.   Diagnosis will require a clinical exam ination consistent with PT and/or  MRI or 
ultrasound confirmation of PT.   In addition, 10 healthy/normal subjects who are not diagnosed 
with chronic PT will be enrolled into a control cohort.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  
Sixty -six patients with PT will be randomized to one of three study arms. Subjects in Group 1 
(PRP) will receive a single US -guided (USG) injection of 5 mL autologous PRP into the patellar 
tendon, subjects in Group 2 (DN) will undergo USG dry needling of the patellar tendon, and 
subjects in Group 3 (SH) will undergo a sham control USG dry needling in the subcutaneous 
tissue only (not intratendon) at the level of the patellar tendon. The efficacy of the different 
treatment options will be assessed by [CONTACT_77368]- a nd function- dependent, PT- specific Victorian 
Institute of Sport Assessment Patella (VISA -P) quality of life scores, Tegner activity level scores, 
knee strength measurements, and conventional and novel MRI and US imaging at baseline, 16, 
32, and [ADDRESS_103157] -treatment.  
 
Ten subjects without PT will comprise the healthy/normal or control cohort.  The control subjects will undergo the clinical and biomechanical a ssessme nts and conventional and novel MRI and 
US imaging during a single study visit.  
 REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE   
5 
 With 20 subjects, the expected power of our study based on hypothesized changes over time and 
the pooled SD of the changes in VISA -P scores. To allow for 10% drop out, we will recruit [ADDRESS_103158] common disabling conditions of the knee affecting both 
active individuals and competitive athletes (1, 2). PT is a degenerative tendon condition resulting 
in localized anterior  knee pain affecting the proximal patellar tendon (7). The etiology of pain 
related to this chronic degenerative  disorder remains unclear. The degenerative features of 
tendinopathy, however, are similarly seen in lateral  epi[INVESTIGATOR_32202] (8), plantar fasciitis (9), and 
Achilles tendinopathy (10). The pathophysiology of PT is thought to  be multifactorial, including 
overuse microtrauma, which leads to tendon disorganization and increased  vulnerability to further 
injury and possible rupture (7). Chronic pain from PT is costly to elite athletes by  [CONTACT_93354], forcing early career retirement, and in the later stages of life, adopting a  sedentary 
lifestyle which leads to other chronic diseases such as hypertension and heart diseases (2). Thus,  
finding a reliable treatment option would change the way we approach PT and other chronic 
overuse injuries.  Platelet -Rich Plasma: PRP is an emerging minimally invasive treatment option 
that uses concentrated autologous platelets, rich in healing factors (4- 6). Recent exponential use 
of PRP has been in the area of sports -related tendon overuse injuries (5, 6, 11 -13). Currently, it 
has been estimated that about 100,000 elite  athletes are injected with PRP annually, but the 
frequency of use is likely under reported (14) . The main growth driver came from the media’s 
attention on well- known professional athletes reporting a quicker and durable return to activity 
after PRP rather than foundational evidence- based decisions from a well -designed randomized 
control trial (RCT). Moreover, clinicians are often faced with increasing demand by [CONTACT_93355], ranging from the weekend warrior to the disabled worker, without much leverage to argue 
for or  against its use. There are only two existing but limited two -armed RCTs of PRP that have 
shown equivocal results in chronic overuse injuries (15- 18). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_93344], 
PRP usage has been and will continue to grow exponentially . Therefore, rigorous clinical trials 
are needed to investigate the efficacy of PRP  and to determine if the intervention truly provides 
better improvements in pain and function and enhanced tissue healing when compared to less 
expensive minimally -invasive treatment options.  PRP Mechanism of Action : Platelets are vital in 
initiating the tissue healing process (12, 19). When activated  by [CONTACT_93356], platelet alpha- granules are 
released to incite soft tissue healing (20). PRP augments the native  healing process at the site of 
tissue degeneration through the action of concentrated healing growth factors  such as PDGF, 
VEGF, FGF, and TGF- β1 (12). Fibroblast response and collagen formation occur in the  healing 
response phase with tenocyte development and alignment healing (12). In chronic conditions, such as  PT, few circulating platelets, and therefore low growth factor concentrations, are present, 
especially for  tendons that receive only 30% of a muscle’s blood supply (21). Therefore, delivering 
concentrated healing growth factors may benefit hypo -vascular soft tissue structures such as 
tendons. Small clinical studies have reported that PRP injections for PT decrease pain , increase 
function and have the potential to modify  diseased tendon (15 -18). However, PRP has not been 
[ADDRESS_103159] and assessor blinding. The valuable data gained will significantly add to the knowledge 
base of disease modifying effects of PRP for tendinopathy. Positive findings of PRP compared to  
control would help establish an optimal protocol for the nonsurgical management of PT. In 
addition, no study  has assessed the correlation between novel imaging biomarkers with validated 
clinical outcomes in response to therapy, which would provide a powerful imaging assessment 
tool to objectively monitor tissue healing.  
  3.0 STUDY AIMS/STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose of this research is to find an effective treatment for PT that addresses the underlying 
pathophysiology of tissue degeneration.

3.1.2  To demonstrate treatment -related changes in pathologic imaging features of 
PT using conventional MRI (thickness and T2 signal intensity) and US (thickness, echogenicity, and hyperemia).   
3.1.3  To investigate the relationship between changes in novel quantitative MRI (single -component and bicomponent ultra- short echo- time T2* (UTE -T2*)) and 
US (shear wave speed (SWS), a proxy for elasticity) parameters of PT and 
clinical and biomechanical improvement following treatment.

[CONTACT_93362]. A fter the subject has provided signed consent, any  relevant 
laboratory  tests will be obtained and confirmed prior to final enrollment in the study. 
Any questions will be a ddressed prior to the start of any research procedures  and all 
subjects will be reminded that participation is optional and they can change their mind 
at any time.  
 
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_103163] preferences and capabilities:  
• Electronic signature [CONTACT_93369] 
• Subject will be asked to scan a copy of the entire consent document and email it 
back to the study team.  
• Subject will be asked to take a photo of the signature [CONTACT_93370] a copy to 
the study team.  
• If subjects are unable to provide an electronic copy of the signed consent form, 
they will be asked  to bring a copy of the form to the research visit.  
 5.3 Research Procedures:  Subjects  enrolled in the chronic PT cohorts  will be asked to 
complete four study visits at baseline, 16  weeks, 32 weeks, and 52 weeks.   Subjects 
enrolled in the control cohort will complete 1 study visit. Health questionnaires (VISA -
P Tegner, medication log, side effect log) will be mailed to subjects  diagnosed with 
chronic PT only . A table outlining research visits is below.  The following research 
procedures will be administered:  
 
9 
 5.3.1  Randomization:  The 10 healthy/normal subjects will not be randomized and 
will not receive any injections.  The s ubjects  diagnosed with chronic patellar 
tendonitis  will be randomized to one of three study arms.  Subjects in Group 1 
(PRP) will receive a single US -guided (USG) injection of 5 mL autologous 
PRP using a 22G, 1.5 inch needle and after 20 needle passes  targeting 
hypoechoic and hyperemic  areas within tendon and bone attachment if 
involved. Subjects in Group 2 (DN)  will undergo USG dry needling with 20 
passes using a 22G, 1.5 inch needle targeting hypoechoic and hyperemic 
areas within tendon and bone attachment if involved. Subjects in Group 3 (SH) 
will undergo a sham control USG dry needling with 20 passes using a 22G, 
1.5 inch needle placed in the subcutaneous  tissue  only (not intratendon) at 
the level of the patella tendon.  
5.3.2 PRP Preparation and Administration (randomized subjects only) :  At the 
injection session, a nurse will perform a standard antecubital blood draw 
(15mL ) using a [ADDRESS_103164] the sample in the Arthrex ACP System and spin the blood sample using a t wo-stage spi[INVESTIGATOR_334]: the 1st separates red blood cells from 
platelets, and the 2nd concentrates the platelets to yield approximately 6 mL 
of concentrated, autologous platelet s. This layer of platelet rich plasma will be 
placed in the syringe  by [CONTACT_93363].   Centrifuging will be  repeated 
if des ired concentration level is not achieved, but this has not occurred 
clinically and we do not anticipate inadequate platelet  concentration level. All 
blood and equipment handling will follow universal precautions.  
 Platelet counts from  subjects’ whole blood and PRP processed blood will be 
analyzed. Platelet counts in whole blood vary by [CONTACT_29569]. The o ptimal 
quantity of platelets and growth factors required for tissue healing is not 
known, but a clinically effective concentration has been described as being 
greater than 4 times baseline autologous whole blood platelet concentrations (Marx RE: Platelet -rich plasma: Evidence to support its use. J Oral Maxillofac 
Surg 2004;62:489- 496.). Therefore,  platelet  concentrati on yield may have 
important implications in clinical outcome correlation. In order to validate consistent platelet concentration yields across subjects, we will sample 1mL 
of whole blood (approximately one lab Vacutainer) and an additional [ADDRESS_103165]'s PT .  
[ADDRESS_103166].  
The skin will be cleansed with an alcohol wipe and Hibicleanse. Lidocaine skin  
heals will be placed for local analgesia. The Patellar tendinopathy area will be 
identified using the US 15-6MHz linear array transducer. Under continuous 
US evaluation, 1 mL of the prepared solution will be injected into the diseased area of the PT itself using a 22G, 1.5" long needle. Then, up to 4.[ADDRESS_103167] for 5 minutes. Participants will be 
telephoned after 3 days to enquire about side effects or adverse events.  
Dry Needling (DN) Procedure:  This  is a therapeutic procedure that involves 
the s ame injection procedures under ultrasound guidance as in the PRP group 
but no PRP will be injected inside the patellar tendon.  
Sham (SH) Placebo Procedure: Same needle size is used under ultrasound 
guidance as in PRP and DN groups but  we will not inject PRP nor place needle 
inside the patellar tendon. Rather, the needle will be placed in the soft tissue next to the patellar tendon.  
5.3.3  Blinding  (randomized subjects only) :  Subjects and assessors will be blinded 
to the subject group allocation. Subjects in the DN and SH groups will also undergo phlebotomy to maintain blinding. Subjects will be identified to study 
personnel using a unique study number only and results of the i maging studies 
will be blinded, batched, and evaluated in a randomized manner.  
5.3.4 Clinical and Biomechanical Assessment  (see Appendix A)  - All subjects : The 
clinical symptoms of all s ubjects will be assessed using the validated pain-  and 
function- dependent, PT- specific Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment 
Patella (VISA- P) quality of life score and Tegner activity level scale. Knee flexor 
and extensor muscle isomet ric torque strength will be assessed using an 
isokinetic dynamom eter ( Kiio Sensor ).  Patellar tendon wave speeds will be 
measured with an experimental device during any or al l of: strength tests with 
the Kiio sensor, squats, vertical jumps, walking, and running. The 
walking/running tasks will only be performed with subjects who have experience with treadmill walking/running. The wave speed measurement device will be placed on the surface of the skin. It consists of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_93347] . 
11 
 5.3.5 MRI Protocol:  All subjects will undergo a non -contrast MRI examination of the 
knee on an MR750 3T scanner (G E Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) using an 8-
channel extremity coil.  Subjects  will be in the scanner for approximately 45  
minutes.  
5.3.6 U S Protocol:  All subjects will undergo an US examination of the patellar tendon 
using both LOGIQ E9 (GE Healthcare Waukesha, WI) and Aixplorer 
(Supersonic Imagine, Aix -en-Provence, [LOCATION_009]) imaging systems with a 15-
6MHz linear array transducer. Use of two US imaging sy stems will allow 
comparison of SW S measurements across different vendo r platforms, which 
would be important for repeatability in future large -scale clinical trials. Imaging 
will take approximately 60  minutes total to complete.  
5.3.6 Review of Medical Records  (All subjects) :  
The following information will be collected from the randomized subjects: Patient age, height, weight, history of PT pain, duration of symptom related to PT, past medical history,  past surgical history,  medication history and current 
use, medication allergy . 
 The following information will be collected from the healthy/normal subjects:  
Patient name, height and weight, phone number, lifestyle and health history.

*Randomized subjects only  
 
5.4 Risks 
5.4.1  PRP Preparation and Administration:  The main risk associated with this 
process is temporary pain and swelling during the phlebotomy procedure  to 
collect the sample  and at the injection site  during the treatment phase.  Sterile 
technique will be employed during all phases of this process  which will 
minimize any opportunity for the sample to be contaminated or the 
collection/injection site to be infected . 
5.4.2  MR Imaging:  The risk fr om a non -contrast enhanced MRI exam is minimal and 
is primarily related to claustrophobia and discomfort with positioning.   
Thorough screening will be completed to ensure subjects with 
contraindications to MR are identified.   Only qualified staff will be involved with 
conducting the MR exam.  
5.4.3  US Imaging:  There are no physical risks associated with US imaging.  
5.4.[ADDRESS_103168] speed measurement device.  
 
5.5 Benefits: There are no benefits expected for the study participant.  However, positive  
outcomes from this study would establish an effective non- surgical treatment option for 
PT and demonstrate that disease modification of PRP -treated PT with clinical 
improvements in pain and knee strength is directly related to improvements in the imaging features of the healing tendon.  
 
5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study :  Enrolled patients will be removed from the study in the 
following circumstances:

7.[ADDRESS_103170] of 1996 (HIPAA). Subjects 
will be assigned a unique study number upon enrollment that will be us ed to  label their research 
data in lieu of directly identifiable information.  All subject data collected during participation in the 
study will be kept in a locked file cabinet within a Department of Radiology office or a password-protected database that uses departmental servers and will only be accessible to study team 
members.  Coded  data and images  will be shared with [CONTACT_93372] at [LOCATION_001] 
University.  The Department of Radiology Radius team will serve as the honest broker and will code and share date with NYU . After the study is completed, all data will be de- identified for the 
purposes of research presentations/publications. The study MRI  and US  examinations will be 
archived on the standard clinical PACS system which is password protected behind the UWHC 
firewall.  The study data and records will be maintained for up to [ADDRESS_103171]  deviation (SD) of the 
changes in VISA -
P score  over time 
to be between 15 
and 19 and the  
minimal 
detectable 
change in score 
to be 11.1 (41). Since our subjects will have already  completed physical therapy without  
improvement, we hypothesize that the DN and SH groups will marginally improve and that  the 
PRP group will significantly improve on the order of 3 times the improvement of the  other groups 
over the 1 year foll ow-up period. With 20 subjects,  table 2 shows the expected power of  our study 
based on hypothesized changes over time and the pooled SD of the changes in VISA -P scores.

9.0 FDA Considerations  
9.1 MRI Hardware/Software:  All hardware used to obtain MR images is FDA approved and 
will be used in accordance with the conditions approved by [CONTACT_8415].  The investigational 
software being used in image acquisition is designed to stay within the current guidelines 
for MRI safety, established by [CONTACT_1622].  In addition,  the investigational software 
does not meet the definition of a Significant Risk  Device as outlined by [CONTACT_93364] 
21 CFR 812.3 as being:  
• Intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, 
safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and 
presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject;  
• For a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a subject; or  
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject.  
9.2 PRP Preparation and Administration:  The proposed project requires that autologous 
blood be processed at the time of the procedure visit.  The Arthrex Double Syringe (ACP – Autologous Conditioned Plasma) System is a commercially available centrifuge 
system that allows for preparation of platelet -rich plasma (PRP) from a small sample of 
blood at the patient’s point of care. The Arthrex Double Syringe ACP System has 
received FDA 510K approval (BK070069, Sept 19, 2008) for the purpose of preparing PRP.  
  Platelet -rich plasma meets the FDA’s definition of a biologic, regulated under 21 CFR 
607.3, which covers blood and blood products.  During the processing of autologous whole blood from the patient, platelets are concentrated, but there are not any non -
autologous products added to the PRP which significantly alter the biologic 
characteristics of the PRP cellular elements.  In other words, there are no “activating agents” (e.g., calcium, thrombin) added to the PRP.  
9.3 The US imaging hardware and software are FDA approved devices that are being used in a manner that is consistent with these approvals.  We are asserting that the Kiio sensor 
and software are not consistent with the definition of a significant risk device as outlined 
in section 9.1.

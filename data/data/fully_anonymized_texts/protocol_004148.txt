8 Outcome 
Measurements  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  - The primary effectiveness endpoint is 
alignment of coronal mechanical axis  at 3 months  defined as achieving varus -
valgus alignment less than ±3 ° in the frontal plane after TKA. A review of 
1,376 patients undergoing conventional TKA with manual instrumentation 
showed a 32% malalignment for mech anical axis greater than 3° (Mason).    
This study is designed to demonstrate that the investigational device is 
capable of reducing the malalignment rate by 50%, that is, to 16%.  
Primary Safety Endpoint  - The primary safety endpoint is a composite  safety  
endpoint that includes a number of relevant adverse events identified in a 
literature search, each having an expected incidence ≤2.7%. The sum of 
these relatively rare complications is equal to 7.6%.  The percentage of 
patients with TCAT -assisted implantati on using the TSolution One System for 
TKA experiencing the composite safety event will be compared to 7.6%.  
Secondary Safety Endpoints   
• Bleeding complications are not rare  and will be assessed separately as a 
secondary safety endpoint  based on the incidence of transfusion s 
(allogeneic or autologous) .  
• Complications related to excessive bleeding that require surgical 
intervention will be assessed and summarized as a subset of the bleeding 
complications  above .  
• Other secondary safety end points include the incidence of the individual 
adverse events comprising the composite.  
Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
Effectiveness endpoints are considered secondary for this study and are 
summarized below : 
• Postoperative  function will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_869725] 3, 6, and 12 (if available)  months . 
• Health related quality -of-life will be assess ed by [CONTACT_869726] 12 
(SF-12) Health Survey scores  at 3, 6, and 12 (if available)  months . 
• Post-operative alignment outcomes will be compared to p re-operative 
alignment  goals  at 3 months . 
Success/Failure Criteria  The study success criterion is to simultaneously demonstrate that the 
malalignment rate is less than  or equal to  0.16 (effectiveness endpoint) and 
that the composite safety event rate is less than 0.136 (safety endpoint) 
based on one -sided exact binomial test s with t ype 1 error rate equal to 0.05.  
A p-value ≤ 0.05 for both tests will indicate study success.

9 Hypotheses  IDE Study Arm  
The primary effectiveness hypothesis  for this study is that the probability 
of malalignment for patients undergoing TCAT -assisted implantation using 
the TSolution One System for TKA  is 50% smaller than the reference rate of 
32%, that is, less than  or equal to  16%.  
 
H0: π I ≥ 0.16 (50% of reference rate = 32%)  
HA: π I < 0.16  
In this formulation, π I is the true malalignment probability for the 
investigational device.  
A one -sided type 1 error of α=0.[ADDRESS_1213741] 
software (nQuery  Advisor 7.0, Module POT0x -1), it was determined that 
statistical power to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis is equal to 8 9.3%  with a sample size of N= 103 patients  if the true 
malalignment rate is 0.07 . 
 
The primary safety hypothesis  for this study is that the probability of 
experiencing the composite safety endpoint for patients undergoing TCAT -
assisted implantation using the TSolution One System for TKA  is not 
clinically significantly elevated relative to the historic contr ol value of 7.6% 
for manual TKA. Symbolically, the primary safety hypotheses regarding non -
inferiority relative to historical control may be represented as follows:   
  
H0: π I ≥ πC + δ (clinically inferior safety)  
HA: π I < π C + δ (not clinically inferior safety)  
In this formulation, π I and π C are the true event rates when using the 
investigational device and manual TKA, respectively. As noted above, based 
on a literature review, π c = 0.076.  A non -inferiority margin of 0.0 6 was 
selected.  Therefore, these hypotheses reduce to:  
H0: π composite   ≥  0.076 + 0.0 6 = 0.1 36  
HA: π composite <   0.076 + 0.0 6 = 0.1 36  
A one -sided type 1 error of α=0.[ADDRESS_1213742] 
software (nQuery  Advisor 7.0, Module POT0x -1), it was determined that 
statistical power to reject the non -inferiority hypothesis was equal to 8 2.5% 
with a sample size of N= 103 patients.  
Continued Access Study Arm  
There will be no formal hypothesis testing with the Contin ued Access Arm 
of the study. Patient s will be followed for safety and to gain additional 
information on device use , therefore, no power analysis has been 
performed  to estimate sample size . The Continued Access Arm will enroll up 
to 50 patients.

10 Statistical Methodology  Demographic, baseline, peri -operative and postoperative  characteristics for 
all recruited cases will be assessed from data which is collected on the 
relevant case report forms. Continuous variables included in demographic, 
baseline, peri -operative and postoperative  summaries, will be evaluated 
using descriptiv e statistics  (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum ). Dichotomous and polychotomous variables included in 
demographic, baseline, peri -operative and postoperative summaries, will be 
described as frequencies and percentages at each level of the categorical 
variable.  
The primary effectiveness and safety hypothes es will be tested using exact 
tests for a single proportion with one -sided type 1 error rate set to α=0.05.  
The study success criterion requires rejection of both the effectiveness and 
safety null hypotheses.  
The primary effectiveness endpoint, the safety endpoint  and all secondary 
endpoints including bleeding and the individual components of the 
composite safety endpoint , will each be summarized by [CONTACT_124141], percentages, 
and the upper  bounds of one -sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals 
(CI). Patient function and health related quality -of-life will be described by 
[CONTACT_869727], 3 -month , 6 month, 12 month (if available)  and change 
scores  at each time point  in the Knee Soc iety Scores and SF -12 Health Survey 
Physical and M ental Health Composite Scores (PCS & MCS) , using descriptive 
statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum. The ITT analysis set will be used in primary analys es.  Specific 
analyses may be repeated in a Per Protocol analysis set that requires 
completion of the index procedure and no clinically significant protocol 
violations . 
Continued Access Study Arm  
The continued access study arm will not include any hypothesis testing and 
will not be part of the primary or secondary endpoint analysis. Data from 
the continued access arm will be provided as descriptive statistics, which 
can include  counts, percentages,  mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum and the upper bounds of one -sided 95% exact 
binomial confidence intervals (CI). This will include an analysis of safety, 
patient function , and health related quality -of-life data described by 
[CONTACT_869728],  6 week,  3-month , 6 month, 12 month (if available) 
and change scores  at each time point, as applicable.

12 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background  
End-stage osteoarthritis of the knee is typi[INVESTIGATOR_869712] (TKA) in 
which the articulating surfaces of the distal femur and proximal tibia are replaced with prosthetic 
components.  It is very successful in terms of relieving pat ients’ pain and restoring joint function  
(1), (2), (3).  However, the mechanical alignment of the knee after TKA and the ability to balance 
soft tissue play a major role in th e longevity and success of the implant (4), (5), (6).  It has been 
suggested that errors in surgical technique may be the most common reason for failure of TKAs  
(7), (1), (8).  Thus, one of a surgeon’s goals is to  achieve accurate alignment of the tibial and 
femoral components in the frontal, sagittal, and transverse planes  (9). 
Manufacturers have traditionally recommended positioning the knee implant such that the 
“ideal” mechanical axis  of the knee is restored.  This mechanical axis is defined as a straight line 
passing through the center of the femoral head , the center of the knee joint, and the midpoint of 
the ankle  (10), (11).   Implant manufacturers have developed complex instrumentation sets to 
help achieve this ideal implant placement.  However, every mechanical instrumentation system 
relies on visual inspection and the feel of a surgeon to confirm the accuracy of limb and implan t 
alignment , and implant misalignment is still a problem.  D espi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a surgeon’s best intentions , this 
results in anywhere from 15 -72% of conventional TKA’s having  an error in mechanical axis 
alignment of greater than 3 ° (12), (13).  A misalignment of greater than 3 ° varus -valgus has 
traditionally been considered the threshold past which implant longevity decreases.    Several 
studies have suggested that if the error in varus -valgus alignment exceeds 3° after TKA, the 
patients are more likely to experience increased pain, poor biomechanics, reduced function, and a 
decreased longevity of the implants  (14), (10), (15), (5).  Jeffery et al. (10) has reported that the 
rate of loosening was 24% when mechanical axis alignment error exceeded 3 ° compared to only 
3% when mechanical axis alignment was less than 3 °.  Loosening is the second leading cause for 
revision surgery with 24.1% of revisions being attributed to aseptic loosening (1).  Thus, achieving 
ideal implant alignment with minimal error is essential for long term surgical success.  
A variety of computer assisted navigation systems have been developed to improve alignment 
accuracy , and have resulted in a reduction in alignment errors (16), (17).  However, although 
these navigation systems are successful at aligning the cutting guides, there still exists  an 
inaccuracy that results from the cutting blocks and oscillating jigs used to prepare the bone (18), 
(19). 
To address the issues with imprecise cutting , robotic systems were developed to combine the 
placement and alignment accuracy of navigation with the precision of computer controlled 
machining .  Several systems have been developed specifically to address the implementation of 
TKA by [CONTACT_869729] (20), (21), (22), (23).  The ROBODOC® Surgical 
System,  an earlier, predicate of TSolution One  that has been FDA -cleared for Total Hip  
Arthroplasty  also has an application  intended for assisted TKA .  This system has been  approved in

and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].

13 Korea and other countries outside the US for this intended use has been shown to contribute to 
improved alignment, fewer outliers, and to allow accurate preoperative planning when compared 
to conventional TKA  (24), (25), (26). 
2.2. Investigational Device  
The TSolution One Surgical System consists of a three -dimensional graphical preoperative planner 
and an implementa tion tool for treatment of patients who require a total knee arthroplasty 
procedure.  With application specific tools and software, it provides stereotactic guidance during 
orthopedic surgical procedures by [CONTACT_869730] a surgeon with pr esurgical 
planning and bone preparation.  Surgical application specific modules such as total knee 
arthroplasty are added to the base operating platform.  
The TSolution One  Surgical System platform includes : 
• TPLAN ®: a Preoperative Planning  Workstation  
• TCATTM: an electromechanical robotic arm with a display monitor, operating software, 
tools and accessories  (e.g. , cutters, drapes, irrigation sets, probes and markers ) 
TPLAN  
 TPLAN  is a PC-based workstation with proprietary software 
that enables the surgeon to select appropriate prosthetic 
implant (s) and preoperative ly determine the optimal 
positioning in or on the patient’s bone.  Computed 
Tomography (CT) scan data of the patient’s bone/joint 
provides input to TPLAN .  The TPLAN  software  combines 
seve ral individual scan slices to create patient specific 
three -dimensional images from the CT data.  
TPLAN  allows the surgeon to select an implant model from a library of implant types and sizes.  
TPLAN  displays three -dimensional (3D) views of selected implant  models for computerized 
templating with the patient specific 3D images from the CT data.  The surgeon virtually places the 
implant in the desired position with respect to the patient image data.  In the case of a knee or 
hip arthroplasty, TPLAN  also allow s surgeons to preoperatively measure and determine plan 
characteristics such as Femoral and Tibial Mechanical Axis (FMA, TMA), implant size, shape, 
implant placement, and measure bone cuts for THA and or TKA.  The output from a TPLAN  
planning session provi des TCAT  with the planned implant type, size, shape, orientation and 
position (placement) data.  The output is saved onto data transfer media, which is loaded onto 
TCAT  prior to surgery.

14  
  TCAT  
TCAT  is comprised of an electromechanical arm, 
computer s and electronic control s within the base , a 
display monitor, and a surgeon ’s pendant  control .  The 
electromechanical arm has  5 degree s of freedom (5 -DOF) 
and is  mounted on top of a base which  houses the 
computers and electronic controls and acts as an elevator 
for the arm.  The system is equipped with two bone 
motion monitors (BMMs) , one on each side of the TCAT  
arm, a nd a  digitizer.  The User Interface consists of a 
display monitor, a hand -held pendant fo r controlling the 
arm, operator controls (switches/buttons), and indicator 
lights.  Additional peripheral devices include a Force 
Sensor, Cutter Drive Assembly and Irrigation Pump.  The 
function of the TCAT  is to precisely execute the 
preoperative plan dev eloped by [CONTACT_869731] . 
 
2.3. Investigational Procedure  
Preoperative  CT for TCAT Planning  
A preoperative  CT scan is required to create a 3D model of the patient’s anatomy in TPLAN for 
accurate implant planning, bone resection, and implant placement. A motion rod is scanned with 
the joint to ensure that the patient did not move during the CT scan.  
Preoperativ e Implant Planning Using TPLAN  
Using CT data as an input, the surgeon uses TPLAN to  determine the implant sizing, bone 
resection, and implant placement.  TPLAN allows the surgeon to produce a 3D surface model of 
the bones from the CT data.  The surgeon can then select an implant model from the library of 
510(k) cleared joint replacement implants available in TPLAN and manipulate the 3D 
representations of the implant together with the bone to optimally place the implant within the 
bone.  Once the surgeon is satisfied with the implant size and location, the data is written to 
transfer media for use with the TCAT during surgery.  The transfer media created by [CONTACT_869732], implant data, positioning information, and images to aid in 
regist ration point collection during the surgery.   
 
TCAT Setup & Start -Up Diagnostics  
Prior to each TCAT surgery, various startup diagnostics must be performed to ensure that the 
TCAT system is in proper working order.

15 • TCAT kinematics - The kinematic accura cy of the electromechanical arm is verified using a 
fixture with previously measured reference points upon which TCAT locates points and 
compares them with the measured values.  This test will verify that the electromechanical 
arm is positioning to specifi cations and has not been damaged.  
• Digitizer kinematics – the digitizer is used to locate the 3D locations of points within the 
workspace of the electromechanical arm.  The accuracy of the digitizer is verified prior to 
every procedure.  During diagnostic s, the digitizer is tested against the same kinematic 
fixture in the arm verification above to ensure that the ability of the digitizer to locate 
specific known points on the fixture is within a specified tolerance.  
• Base  lift accuracy – the accuracy of t he base is verified by [CONTACT_869733] 
a post on a standard kinematic fixture at two different base heights to ensure that the 
error between the two measurements is within a specified tolerance.  
• Tool calibration verification – Prior to ma king contact [CONTACT_4490] a patient, the TCAT system is 
covered with a sterile drape to protect both the patient and system during bone 
preparation.  The system performs a test after sterile drapi[INVESTIGATOR_869713] d and calibrated.  
• Arm to digitizer registration verification – The accuracy of the transformation between the 
electromechanical arm and the digitizer is verified during sterile diagnostics to ensure that 
the error is within specification.  
• Digitizer calibration verification – The accuracy of the digitizer with a sterile tip is verified to 
be within the calibrated tolerances required to ensure that the digitized points collected 
are precisely identified to the best ability of this device.  
• Pendant operation - The monitor prompts the users to verify the proper functioning of 
each button upon installation of a new pendant.  After verification, the system may allow 
the procedure to continue.  
• Force sensor operation – The end -effector of the TCA T electromechanical arm is equipped 
with a six degree -of-freedom force sensor.  The accuracy of the force sensor is verified 
using a tool of known weight that is reoriented by [CONTACT_869734].  
• Redundant encoder operation – Each joint of the TCAT arm is equipped with dual positional 
encoders.  This redundant position monitoring system serves as a safety mechanism that 
can continuously monitors the commanded arm position.  During diagnostics, this system is 
tested to ensure its functionality and accuracy.

and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].  
Disclosure to others without written permission from THINK Surgical, Inc. is forbidden.  
16 • Bone motion monitor operation – TCAT is equipped with two bone motion monitors 
(BMMs) that can detect when bones involved in the surgery move after being fixated.  The 
accuracy of the BMMs is verified by [CONTACT_869735], moving the probe through prescribed locations and 
comparing the BMM -determined distances to the electromechanical arm -computed 
distances.  
Start -up diagnostics must be performed prior to anesthetizing the patient. In the event that any of 
the diagnostics tests fails, TCAT notifies the surgeon and prevents the procedure from continuing.   
Surgical Exposure  
The surgeon proceed s with surgical exposure for the TCAT surgery in the same manne r as a 
conventional TKA procedure.   
 
Fixation   
Although the TCAT system incorporates a BMM system to detect motion of the bone, proper 
fixation of the femur and tibia reduce s this motion and keep s surgical time to a minimum.  The 
surgeon fixes the operative joint using a clamp on the femur and pin on the tibia to ensure that 
there is no motion during bone cutting.  Bone motion recovery markers are placed on the femur 
and tibia to recover the 3D loc ation and orientation of each bone in the event of bone motion.  If 
bone motion occurs during registration or cutting, the BMMs will immediately pause the 
procedure and require that the bone be re -registered before the procedure can continue.  
 
Registration  
Registration serves as the link between the preoperative  plan created in TPLAN and the bone 
cutting during surgery performed by [CONTACT_869736].  Once the bone is registered in the coordinate system, 
TCAT can accurately machine the bone according to the predefined surgical plan. TCAT uses an 
accurate point -to-surface tech nique for registration. Once the joint has undergone fixation, the 
surgeon  will use the digitizer to collect points on the bone with respect to the electromechanical 
arm coordinate system . The TCAT software will check to ensure that the registration of the  bone is 
within specifications  before allowing the surgeon to proceed .  
 
Bone Preparation  
The surgeon will ensure  that the soft tissue is properly retracted and the electromechanical arm 
proceeds with cutting of the bone.  During cutting, the OR Display Monitor shows a continuously 
updated graphical representation of cutting progress superimposed on top of the CT data .   
Throughout this process, t he surgeon  remain s in control of the process and can pause, stop, or  
abort the use of TCAT at any point if needed.

17 Implant Fitting & Insertion  
The OR Display Monitor prompt s the surgeon to move TCAT away from the operating table  once 
TCAT has finished preparing the bone .  The surgeon  remove s the recovery markers and fixation 
system and proceed s with implant fitting and insertion in the same manner as conventional TKA.   
 
Joint Closure  
Once the implant components are cemented (if applicable), the surgeon reviews the execution of 
the plan. If satisfactory, the exposed joint is closed per standard of care.  
3. RISK ANALYSIS  
The TCAT system, presented in this clinical protocol, is based on the ROBODOC® Surgical System. 
The ROBODOC® Surgical System was cleared under K072629 for use in total hip arthroplasty 
procedures. The ROBODOC System has had a total knee arthroplasty applic ation that has been 
used extensively outside the U.S. The TSolution One® system incorporates the same operating 
principles and basic design as the ROBODOC® Surgical System but includes upgrades to the 
hardware and software. Thus, it shares, for the most pa rt, similar risks and benefits in its 
technology and use. For total knee arthroplasty procedures, the ROBODOC® Surgical System has 
been used extensively in a clinical setting outside the US.

3.2. Methods to Minimize Risk  
The risks and adverse events associated with general surgery and knee arthroplasty are well 
understood. These risk are generally well mitigated through typi[INVESTIGATOR_869714]. The risk 
associated with a TKA have also improved over time with advances in  technology and surgical 
techniques.  
 
The risks from implantation using the TSolution One® System are described below. In addition to 
the risk mitigation described in the table, subject selection criteria, study methods, evaluations, 
follow -up periods, fa cilities and investigator selection are intended to minimize risk to subjects 
participating. In this study, subjects will be monitored throughout the study (Day 0 to  a maximum 
of 12 months  following the procedure) for the detection of adverse events. Final ly, all subjects will 
be informed of the potential risks through a detailed informed consent.

 Risk Mitigation  
Surgical Delay  
 Navigation systems are known to have an increased operative time 
of anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes (27) (28)  but are not associated 
with an increased risk of infection. No studies have shown that an 
increase in time of only [ADDRESS_1213753] that there may be an increase in time for these 
cases, but in all of the previous studies, this has not resulted in 
adverse patient risk.

19 TSolution One® 
System Specific Risks  
 Risk Mitigation  
Soft Tissue Damage  
 The risk of soft tissue damage is quite similar to  a traditional TKA 
procedure. Labeling and training specifically focus on ensuring 
retraction of ligaments and soft tissue is adequate to provide clear 
access for the cutter. During cutting, the surgeon monitors the 
cutter and can determine if additional s oft-tissue retractions is 
necessary.  
Electrical Shock  
 The TSolution  One® system was tested for electrical safety 
appropriate for an electromedical system and all tests past in 
accordance with IEC [ZIP_CODE] -1: 2005 + CORR. 1 (2006) + CORR. 2 
(2007).  
Overcutting of Bone 
 The TSolution  One® system reduces the risk of overcutting when 
compared to a manual sawing technique. During manual sawing, the 
surgeon is placing the saw through a guide and has nothing to limit 
how far the cuts are made. TSolution One® is designed prepare the 
bone ac cording to the specific implant that is selected. The cutter 
follows a predetermined cut path that only cuts according to the 
implant shape and preclinical testing (PV/TR 16 -070) has verified 
that the system cuts within the specified tolerance.  
Bone Fracture  
 Intraoperative bone fracture during TKA typi[INVESTIGATOR_869715]. The TSolution One® procedure only 
assists with preparation of the bony surfaces and not during 
impaction. Impaction is handled in the same manner as a manu al 
case. Postoperative fractures can occur at pin sites especially in the 
diaphysis. The TSolution One® system has minimized the risk of 
postoperative bone fracture by [CONTACT_869737] a clamp that 
does not result in a hole in the bone and reducing the size of the pin 
required for tibial fixation to 3mm, which greatly reduces the risk of 
postoperative fracture, Furthermore, patients with poor bone 
quality are contraindicated as adequate bone quality is necessary to 
support fixation.

20 TSolution One® 
System Specific Risks  
 Risk Mitigation  
Additional Radia tion 
Exposure  The TSolution One® System does require a preoperative CT scan 
upon which the surgical plan is based. This does expose the patient 
to additional radiation. However, these types of CT scans are 
common to other surgical robotic systems including  the MAKO 
system (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ) and patient specific cutting guide 
systems (Trumatch, Depuy Synthes, Warsaw, IN). The potential 
benefits in terms of accuracy and precision can outweigh the risks 
associated with additional radiation. Without a preope rative CT, 
conventional alignment jigs and navigation systems rely on the 
surgeon’s ability to locate bony landmarks, which has been known to 
show large variability (8). 
 
3.3. Potential Benefits  
There are clear potential benefits to using the TSolution One® system for assistance during TKA. 
With current instrumentation, technical errors frequently occur in the implantation of TKA’s. 
These include errors in implant placement, sizing, alignment of t he femoral and tibial implants, 
bone cutting, and issues with implant to bone fixation. The current system has the potential to 
minimize such errors. Based on preclinical testing and older versions of the system, the TSolution 
One® system excels in terms o f both precision and accuracy when it comes to correctly placing 
the implant. The TSolution One® system improves the surgeon’s ability to align the knee through 
accurate preoperative planning. During surface registration of the bone in surgery, the surgeon  is 
not asked to identify specific landmarks, but rather select a set of points which are collected in 
specified regions of the bony surface. The TSolution One® System makes cuts accurately in all 
planes. These accurate cuts result in an elimination of mis aligned implants clinically as stated in 
the previous section. The method of fixing the implant to the bone is not affected by [CONTACT_869738]® system. Bone cement can still be used after the bone has been machined. In the 
case of cementless implants, be cause TSolution One® machines such precise cuts, the implants 
are likely to be more stable and achieve greater bone -implant fixation since there are minimal 
gaps at the interface.  
 
3.4. Justification of the Clinical Investigation  
Based on the potential benefit s listed above, and the anticipated risks, Think Surgical believes this 
study is justified for the following reasons:  
• The TSolution One® System has undergone extensive non -clinical testing.  
o Software validation has shown the software to be reliable and safe  for use.  
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213756] matter of this material.  It is submitted in confiden ce for a specific purpose 
and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].  
Disclosure to others without written permission from THINK Surgical, Inc. is forbidden.  
21 o A Full System Run -Through demonstrates a functional process that can be performed by 
[CONTACT_11065].   
o Registration Accuracy demonstrates the accuracy of the system.  
o Registration Recovery Accuracy demonstrates the ability of the system to recover during 
the procedure.  
o Implant cutting testing show the ability of the system to make accurate cuts.  
o TKA Usability testing validate the ability of the system to be used in a simulated 
operation with real world user.  
o Electrical Safety Testing demonstrate t esting and compliance with international 
standards.   
o Sterility and cleaning validation demonstrate the patient contact[CONTACT_869739] a recommended protocol.  
o Biocompatibility evaluations show the materi als to be safe for use.  
• The risks identified above have been minimized to the furthest extent possible, through pre -
clinical bench testing, training, and proper labeling. In addition, all patients will be informed of 
the potential risks during the informe d consent.  
• The principles of operation are the same as the ROBODOC system which has been used 
successfully in a clinical setting outside the US for thousands of cases.  
• The clinical protocol is designed to yield valid scientific evidence to support a 510(k ) 
submission.  
• Study subjects are selected according to specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated 
frequently.  
• Think Surgical will closely monitor the study, and adverse events will be recorded and 
reported promptly to Think Surgical.  
Therefore, g iven the information provided throughout this submission, Think Surgical has 
adequately evaluated the safety of the device and put into place adequate clinical controls to 
initiate the start of an IDE study.

22 malalignment f or mechanical axis greater than 3° at 3 months to the rate reported in the 
literature (i.e. 32%) and to demonstrate significant clinical benefit by [CONTACT_869741] 50% (i.e. from 32% to ≤16%).  The safety objective of this study will 
be based on the rate of intra -operative and postoperative  TKA complications , and will compare 
this rate to the rate reported in the literature.  
4.2. Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is to summar ize the distribution of improvements in 
patient s’ self -reported  assessment of postoperative  function and quality -of-life from baseline to a 
maximum of 12 months . Additionally, other pre-operative planning alignment  goals  (e.g. Knee V -V 
Alignment; Femoral J oint Line Alignment Angle; Tibial Joint Line Alignment Angle; Tibial Slope 
Angle) will be compared to the post -operative alignment.  
5. STUDY DESIGN  
This clinical i nvestigation will be conducted as a prospective, non -randomized, multicenter  study. 
Investigator s will recruit patients from patients in the ir practice who require unilateral total knee 
arthroplasty. Patients  will be screened to identify eligible  candidates based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.  A total of one hundred fifteen  (115) patient s 
will be enrolled in the study across the participating sites.  All patient s will sign an informed  
consent form prior to participating in the study. Prior to the investigational procedure, they will 
complete bas eline  surveys of function  and quality of life  and have baseline radiographs . Each 
patient will undergo  robotic -assisted total knee arthroplasty with the TSolution One System. The 
Investigator will  evaluate intra - and postoperative  complications . Postoperative  radiographs will 
be used to measure  limb alignment using a standardized  radiographic evaluation protocol for the 
IDE Study Arm (Attachment K  of the IDE application ).  Each patient  will complete a postoperative  
Knee Society Scor e survey and the SF-[ADDRESS_1213758] two arms:  the IDE Study Arm , and the Continued Access Arm. Once 
enrollment is complete in the IDE Study Arm, subjects will be enrolled into the Continued Access 
Arm.  Up to an  additional 50 patients will be enrolled in this arm.  
The T Solution OneTM Total Knee Arthroplasty Clinical Trial will be conducted in compliance with 
this protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  guidelines , and applicable US regulatory requirements.  
5.1. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint is alignment of coronal mechanical axis at 3 months  defined as 
achieving varus -valgus alignment less than  or equal t o ±3°in the frontal plane after TKA  compared 
to the pre -operative plan . A review of 1,376 patients undergoing conventional TKA with manual 
instrumentation showed a 32% malalignment for mechanical axis greater than 3° (Mason). This

23 study is designed to demonstrate that the investigational device is capable of reducing the 
malal ignment rate by 50%, i.e. to 16%.  
 
Note: The primary effectiveness endpoint will be evaluated utilizing  only the IDE Study Arm. 
 
5.2. Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is a composite endpoint that includes a number of relevant adverse events  
associated with manual TKA that were defined and published by [CONTACT_421145] (Healy et al. 
2011), each having an expected incidence ≤2.7%  based on a literature search  summarized in 
Table 1. The sum of these relatively rare complications is equal to 7.6%.  The percentage of 
patients with TCAT -assisted implantation experiencing the composite safety event will be 
compared to 7.6%  plus a non -inferiority margin of 7.0%.    
Note: The primary safety  endpoint will be evaluated utilizing  only the IDE Study Arm. 
 
5.3. Secondary Endpoints  
Bleeding complications have an expected incidence of 36% for unilateral TKA (Bierbaum et al. 
1999), and are not rare.  These will be assessed separately as a secondary safety endpoint at 
discharge based on the incidence of transfusions required (autologous or allogenic) as a result of 
bleeding.   
Descriptive safety analyses for the incidence of the individual adverse events c omprising the 
composite  will also be performed.  
The secondary endpoints also include a comparison of post -operative alignment outcomes other 
than coronal mechanical axis  to the pre -operative alignment goals , and assessment of 
improvements  in Knee Society Scores and SF -12 Health Survey scores.

medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
 
6.4. Informed Consent   
Eligible patients will be recruited for the study by [CONTACT_11219]/or approved site staff. The 
Investigator or designee will provide e ligible patients with a verbal overview of the study 
procedu res and requirements, including all follow -up visit requirements.  If the patient is willing to 
participate in th e study, they will be asked to review the Informed Consent Form  before the y are 
officially enrolled in the study and  asked to undergo any screening procedures or assessments . 
Each patient will be allowed sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate in the 
study. If they agree to participate, they must sign and date the IRB-approved Informed Consent 
Form  at or prior to the Baseline Visit . A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form will be given to 
the patient  to take home for their records, and the original copy will be filed in the patient ’s study 
records.   
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213765] to their regular 
course of treatment  at the study center . 
 
6.5. Study Enrollment  
Each Investigator shall maintain a  Screening &  Enrollment Log for all primary TKA patients that are 
recruited for the clinical trial and screened for eligibility .  This log will be used to document all 
patients who agree to be screened, including the ones that withdraw consent during the 
screening proc ess or are determined not to meet the  eligibility criteria . If a patient is excluded 
from the study, the reason for exclusion will be recorded on the log.  Patient s who meet the 
eligibility criteria and consent to participate shall be assigned a unique Subject I dentification 
Number that will be captured on the Screening & Enrollment Log  and used to identify them on a ll 
source documents and Case Report Forms  thereafter .  Patients will be considered to be enrolled 
once they have signed the Informed Consent Fo rm and been assigned a Subject Identification 
Number.   Enrolled patients that elect to withdraw consent prior to treatment with the 
investigational device will be considered screen failures under inclusion criteria (e).  
Patients who do not meet eligibility  criteria will have the primary reason for ineligibility captured 
in the study database on the Eligibility Criteria eCRF. No other CRFs will be completed for these 
patients.   
Once enrollment is complete in the IDE Study Arm, subjects will be enrolled into the Continued 
Access Arm.  
7. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Unless otherwise noted, the procedures below apply to both the IDE Study and the Continued Access 
arms of the study.  
7.1. Baseline Visit  (≤90 days prior to Date of Surgery)

and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].  
Disclosure to others without written permission from THINK Surgical, Inc. is forbidden.  
29 Patient eligibility  will be confirmed by [CONTACT_869744]’s demographics, medical history, physical 
exam, and current medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Preoperative Radiographs  
Each patient must have preoperative standing long -leg AP x-rays and standard lateral x-rays of the 
investigational knee per the TSolution One IDE Study Radiographic Evaluation Protocol .   
 
Preoperative CT for TCAT Planning  
A preoperative CT scan will be taken of the investigational knee for preoperative planning in TPL AN per 
the TSolution One IDE  Study  Radiographic Evaluation Protocol . A motion rod will be scanned with the 
joint to ensure that the patient did not move during the CT scan.  If motion is detected during the scan, 
the scan will be repeated.  This scan must b e performed within 30 days prior to the date of surgery.   
 
Surveys  
The following surveys will also be completed at this visit to captur e baseline data related to function  and 
quality of life :  
o Knee Society Score (KSS) – completed by [CONTACT_440936]  
o SF-12 Health Survey – completed by [CONTACT_102]  
o Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) Survey – completed by [CONTACT_102]  (Continued Access Arm only)  
 
Preoperative Implant Planning Using TPLAN 
Following the Baseline Visit, t he Investigator (or designee) will upload the CT data in TPLAN to  determine  
(i) the desired model and size for the femoral implant, model and size for the tibial base plate and initial 
trial thickness of the tibial liner inse rt, (ii) femoral and tibial resection  plan , and (iii) implant positioning .  
The Investigator (or designee) will select an implant model from the library of implants  available in 
TPLAN and will manipulate the 3D representations of the implant together with the bone to optimally 
place the implant within the bone.  Once the Investigator is satisfied with the implant size and location, 
the data will be written to a transfer media for use with the TCAT during surgery.   
 
7.2. Surgical Visit  
Surgical Visit procedures w ill be recorded in the subject’s study records and on the Operative Summary 
& Discharge eCRF.  
Preoperative Labwork  
Standard of care tests will be conducted to prepare the patient  for surgery, including bloodwork to 
assess their preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. This labwork can be collected any time 
within 30 days prior to the day of surgery.  
 
TCAT Setup & Start -Up Diagnostics  
Non -sterile and sterile s tart-up diagnostics will be performed prior to anesthetizing the patient. The 
surgeon will also confirm that a full back -up of manual instruments is available in the OR . If any of the 
diagnostics tests fail, the Investigator will restart the TCAT diagnostics procedure .  
Anesthesia and Surgical Exposure  
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213768] reference points 
on the bone as guided by [CONTACT_869745].

Bone Preparation  
The Investigator will ensure that the so ft tissue is properly retracted and provide confirmation that the 
electromechanical arm may proceed with cutting the  femur and tibia .  During cutting, the OR Display 
Monitor will show a continuously updated graphical representation of cutting progress superimposed on 
top of the CT data.  The Investigator will remain in control of the process and will pause, stop, or abort 
the use of TCAT at any point if needed .  If the patella is to be resurfaced, the Investigator will prepare 
the patella using conventional tools and techniques.  
 
Implant Fitting & Insertion  
Once TCAT has finished preparing the bone, the Investigator will move TCAT  away from the operating 
table , remove  the recovery markers and fixation system and proceed with implant fitting and insertion 
in the same manner as conventional TKA .  Once the Investigator is satisfied with the placement of the 
implants and stability of t he knee, the implants are impacted or cemented as needed .  
 
Joint Closure  
Once the implant components are cemented (if applicable), the Investigator will review the execution of 
the plan. If satisfactory, the exposed joint will be closed per standard of care.  
Operative Summary   
During the immediate postoperative period, the Investig ator’s standard postoperative care procedures 
should be followed. Once the investigational procedure and all post -operative care has been completed, 
the Investigator will document procedure details in the source documents , including but not limited to 
the following:

37 8. STUDY COMPLETION & EARLY DISCONTINUATION  
8.1. Criteria for Study Completion & Early Discontinuation  
For each s tudy arm (IDE and Continued Access) , patient s are expected to remain in the study for 
6-[ADDRESS_1213780] be followed until the adverse event  is resolved, no 
further improvement is expected, or the patient completes study participation and is exited from 
the study.  The Investigator may discontinue a patient  from the study in the event of: 
• Any medical event/condition that presents a health or sa fety risk and prevents the patient  
from continuing in the study   
• Patient ’s failure to comply with protocol requirements  
• Patient  withdrawing their consent  
• Administrative reasons (e.g. Sponsor’s decision to stop the study)  
 
8.2. Documentation of Early Discontinu ation  
In every instance where a patient  is treated with the investigational device and  does not complete 
the study, t he Investigator will document the primary reason for discontinuation in the patient ’s 
records  and on the End of Study eCRF.  
• All patient s are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspecified, and without prejudice.  Ho wever, if a patient  expresses a desire to 
withdraw their consent for the study, the site should attempt to obtain written 
documentation for their study records.  
• For patient s that are discontinued by [CONTACT_737], the Investigator must notify them 
of their discontinuation from the study in writing.  
• For patient s that are lost to follow up, the site staff should document a minimum of three  
attempts to contact [CONTACT_869747] a study vis it prior to considering them lost to follow up.  
 
8.3. Use of Data from Early Discontinu ation Cases  
Study d ata collected previously for patient s who are discontinued from the study by [CONTACT_869748] -up may still be included and used for the study unless the patient  
presents written notification of withdrawal of consent to the Investigator. In the event that a 
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213781] which the Sponsor believes 
signals a safety concern for study participants . The Spons or also r eserves the right to stop the 
study for non -safety related issues,  including but not limited to usability failures.  
Refer to Section 10 .7 (Study Termination) for additional details  regarding study termination 
procedures for any event that leads the sponso r to believe the investigational device presents an 
unreasonable risk to study patients .  
9. STATISTICAL PLAN  
9.1. Determination of Sample Size  for Safety Endpoint  
IDE Study Arm  
The primary safety hypothes is for this study is that the probability of experiencing the composite 
safety endpoint for patients undergoing TCAT -assisted implantation using the TSolution One 
System for TKA  is not clinically significantly elevated relative to the historic control value of 7.6% 
for manual TKA. Symbolically, the primary safety hypotheses regarding non -inferiority relative to 
historical control may be represented as follows:   
  
H0: π I ≥ πC + δ (clinically inferior safety)  
HA: π I < π C + δ (not clinically inferior safety)  
In this formulation, π I and π C are the true event rates when using the investigational device and 
manual TKA, respectively. As noted above, based on a literature review, π c = 0.076.  A non -
inferiority margin of 0.0 6 was selected.  Therefore, these hypotheses reduce to:  
H0: π composite   ≥  0.076 + 0.0 6 = 0.1 36  
HA: π composite <   0.076 + 0.0 6 = 0.1 36  
A one -sided Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the primary safety hypothesis that the 
composite safety event rate is larger than historical control (0.076) plus the non -inferiority margin 
of δ=0.0 6.   That is, the null hypothesis is that the investigational device event rate is 0.1 36 or 
larger and the alternative hypothesis is that this event is less than 0.1 36.  Based on the Sponsor’s 
expectation that the technology is associated with improved outcomes, it was assumed for the 
purpose of sample size determination that that composite safety event rate for patients 
undergoing primary TKA with femoral and tibial prep aration by [CONTACT_869749] 20% smaller than control, or equal to 0.0608.  A one -sided type 1 error of α=0.05 was 
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213782] software (nQuery Advisor 7.0, Module POT0x -1), it was 
determined that statistical powe r to reject the non -inferiority hypothesis was equal to 8 2.5% with 
a sample size of N= 103.   Because of the discreteness of the exact binomial distribution, the power 
curve is not monotonic.  Power for sample sizes of N=102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 1 09, 110, 
111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121 and 122 are 71.9%, 82.5%, 81.8%, 81.1%, 
80.3%, 79.6%, 78.9%, 78.1%, 77.3%, 76.6%, 75.8%, 84.9%, 84.3%, 83.7%, 83.1%, 82.5%, 81.8%, 
81.1%, 80.5%, 79.8%, and 87.6%.  The smallest sample size with  power ≥80% is 103. For sample 
sizes of N=103 and above, power never falls below 75.8%. The minimum sample size for which 
power remains at least equal to 80% at that value for all larger values is N= 113. 
The total sample size to be enrolled is equal to 115 (103 plus 10% for possible loss -to-follow -
up).  
It can be noted that with N= 103, the number (%) of patients experiencing the primary composite 
safety event must be no larger than 8 (7.8%) in order to achieve the primary study success 
criterion.  With 8 of 103 patients experiencing the event, the upper bound of the one -sided 95% 
exact  binomial confidence interval will be 0.1358 which is less than 0.1 36, thereby [CONTACT_869750] a conclusion of no clinically significant increase in the 
incidence of the composite safety endpoint.  
Continued Access Ar m 
There will be no formal hypothesis testing for the Continued Access Arm of the study. Patient s will 
be followed for safety and to gain additional information on device use , therefore, no power 
analysis has been performed  to estimate sample size . The Cont inued Access Arm will enroll up to 
50 patients.  
9.2. Determination of Sample Size  for Effectiveness  Endpoint  
IDE Study Arm  
A review of 1,376 patients undergoing conventional TKA showed a 32% malalignment for 
mechanical axis greater than 3° (13). This proportion will be used as the comparative constant 
proportion for 3 -month follow -up for conventional TKA in this study.    
The p rimary effectiveness hypothesis for this study is that the probability of malalignment for 
patients undergoing TCAT -assisted implantation using the TSolution One System for TKA  is 50% 
smaller than  the reference rate of 32%, that is, 16%.  
  
H0: π I ≥ 0.16 (50% of reference rate = 32%)  
HA: π I < 0.16  
In this formulation, π I is the true malalignment probability for the investigational device.  
A one -sided type 1 error of α=0.[ADDRESS_1213783] software (nQuery  
Advisor 7.0, Module POT0x -1), it was determined that statistical power to reject the null 
hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis is equal to 8 9.3%  with a sample size of N= 103 
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213784] remains above 80% a s long 
as the sample size is 95 patients or larger.   
 
Continued Access Arm  
There will be no formal hypothesis testing with the Continued Access Arm of the study. Patients will 
mainly be followed for safety and to gain additional information on device use , therefore, no power 
analysis has been performed  to estimate sample size . The Continued Access Arm will enroll up to 
50 patients.  
9.3. Analysis Plan  
Demographic, baseline, peri -operative and postoperative  characteristics for all recruited cases  
(both study arms)  will be assessed from data which is collected on the relevant case report forms. 
Continuous variables included in demographic, baseline, peri -operative and postoperative  
summaries, will be evaluate d using descriptive statistics  (N, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum). Dichotomous and polychotomous variables included in demographic, 
baseline, peri -operative and postoperative summaries, will be described as frequencies and 
percenta ges at each level of the categorical variable.     
 
IDE Study Arm  
The primary effectiveness endpoint, the safety endpoint and all secondary endpoints including 
bleeding and the individual components of the composite safety endpoint, will each be 
summarize d by [CONTACT_124141], percentages, and the upper bounds of one -sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence intervals (CI).  
Patient function and health -related quality -of-life will be similarly addressed by [CONTACT_869751], 6-week, 3 -month, 6-month , and 12 -month  (if available)  reported outcomes and change 
at each time point  in the Knee Society Scores and SF-12 Health Survey Physical and Mental Health 
Composite Scores (PCS & MCS), using descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maxi mum. The ITT analysis set will be used in all safety analysis.   Specific 
analyses may be repeated in a Per Protocol analysis set that requires completion of the index 
procedure and no clinically significant protocol violations .   
Intraoperative and immedi ate postoperative complication rates  will be similarly summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
In addition to the above analyses, key safety and effectiveness results will be stratified by [CONTACT_869752] (investigational site, age, gender, and median value of Knee Society Score) 
to confirm that the safety and efficacy of the TSolution OneTM Surgical System  is consistent among 
different subgroup s. 
Continued Access Study Arm  
The continued access study arm will not include any hypothesis testing and will not be part of the 
primary or secondary endpoint analysis. Data from the continued access arm will be provided as 
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213785] deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum and the upper bounds of one -sided 95% exact binomial confidence 
intervals (CI). This analysis will included safety, p atient function , and health related quality -of-life 
described by [CONTACT_869727],  6 week,  3-month , 6-month, and 12 -month (if available)  scores, 
and change in scores  from baseline at each time point, as applicable.  
 
10. SAFETY REPORTING  
10.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  – An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, disease, injury, or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings , surgical complications, etc. ), 
whether related or unrelated to the investigational device or its use .  
Adverse  Device Effect  – This is an adverse  event related to the use of an investigational device.  
Serious Adverse Event  – A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an adverse event which:  
1. Led to a death,  
2. Resulted in life threatening illness or injury*  
3. Resulted in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
4. Resulted in patient  disability or permanent damage or required intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment/da mage  
5. Led to a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
* NOTE: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at a risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
Unanticipated Adverse  Device Effect (UADE)  – An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect is:  
1. Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death is not identified in 
nature, severity, or  degree of incidence in this protocol; or  
2. Any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, 
safety, or welfare of the patient s. 
10.2. Adverse Event Documentation   
Adverse event collection will begin from the time of first incision .  All medical events and conditions 
prior to this time point are to be captured as medical history.  
Observed and reported a dverse events shall be recorded in the patient ’s study records  and on the 
Adverse Event eCRF within [ADDRESS_1213786] include the 
following information at minimum:  
16-PROTO -01, Version Date: [ADDRESS_1213787] matter of this material.  It is submitted in confiden ce for a specific purpose 
and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].  
Disclosure to others without written permission from THINK Surgical, Inc. is forbidden.  
42 • Event Description  
• Date of Onset  
• Date of Resolution  
• Severity  
• Seriousness  
• Relationship to Study Device /Procedure   
• Outcome  
 
Significant new information and updates should continue to be captured in the patient’s records and on 
the Adverse Event eCRF as they become available and the adverse event should be followed until it is 
resolved , no further im provement is expected , or the patient complete s study participation and is exited 
from the study . 
10.3. Assessment of Severity  
Investigators will assess the severity of the adverse event and classify it according to the following 
definitions.  
• Mild : Event/symptom  is transient and well tolerated by [CONTACT_102].  
• Moderate : Event/symptom causes discomfort and interferes with routine activities of the 
patient.  
• Severe : Event/symptom interferes considerably with the routine activities of the patient or 
causes inability t o work.  
 
10.4. Assessment of Relationship to Use of the Investigational Device  
Investigators will assess the potential relationship of the adverse event to the  use of the investigational 
device  and classify the causality of the event according to the following definitions.  
• Definitely Related :  An adverse event that has a strong causal relationship.  An adverse event 
that follows a strong temporal relationship to the use of the investigational device , follows a 
known response pattern, and cannot reasona bly be explained by [CONTACT_718747] ’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
• Probably Related : An adverse event that potentially has a causal relationship.  The adverse 
event has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the investi gational device  and 
alternative etiology is less likely compared  to the potential relationship to the use of the 
investigational device . 
• Possibly Related:  An adverse event that potentially has a causal relationship.  The adverse event 
has a reasonable temp oral relationship to the use of the investigational device  but alternative

and the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_869708].  
Disclosure to others without written permission from THINK Surgical, Inc. is forbidden.  
43 etiology is equally likely compared  to the potential relationship to the use of the investigational 
device .  
• Not Related : An adverse event without any apparent causal relationship.  The adverse event is 
due to the underlying disease state or is due to concomitant medication or therapy not related 
to the use of the investigational device . 
• Unknown Relationship : If the adverse event cannot be determined to have a causal 
relationship, it  will be classified as unknown.  
 
10.5. Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events shall be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the EDC on the Adverse 
Event eCRF within 72 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. The study database will be 
configured to notify the Sponsor of all adverse events that are indicated to be ‘serious’ . Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs)  will trigger the database to send  an email notifica tion to the Sponsor using 
the contact [CONTACT_51259] .

Title of Study: A Multi-Center, Open-Label Biomar ker Study to Evaluate MN-166 (ibudilast) in 
Subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)   
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_901810], MD, MMSc

Island 
Duration of Study Treatment: Screening up to 6 weeks; 
Treatment for 36 weeks; Follow-up at Week 40 for a total duration of 46 weeks.  Phase of Development: 1b/2a 
Study Rationale 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (A LS) is a fatal, neurodegenerati ve disease for which there is no cure.  
  
A substantial body of evidence im plicates the neuroimmune syste m and specifically activated microglia 
in ALS pathophysiology. Activated microglia are detected near t he motor neurons of SOD1G93A 
transgenic mice at [ADDRESS_1264874] is a small molecule macrophage migration inhibitory f actor (MIF) and phosphodiesterase 
(PDE) 4,[ADDRESS_1264875] significan tly suppressed neuronal cell deat h induced by [CONTACT_901867] (LPS) a nd interferon (IFN)-gamma.  Thus , ibudilast-mediated neuroprotection 
is thought to be primarily due to the inhibition of microglia/m onocyte recruitment, modulation of the 
inflammatory response, and rel ease of neurotrophic factors. 
 Numerous PET radioligands have been developed to image activate d immune cells by [CONTACT_901868] (18kDa, TSPO), also called the peripheral benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_32538] (PBR). TSPO is 
highly expressed in both activated monocytes and microglia. Old er generation TSPO radioligands, such 
as [
11C]PK11195, suffer from poor signal-to-noise ratio in the brain. Our tracer, [11C]-PBR28 , binds to 
TSPO with 80times higher specificity, offering a unique opportu nity to study  in vivo 
neuroinflammation due to activat ed microglia and monocytes.

Page 5 of 87 The principal investigators of this study were able to successf ully synthesize and administer [11C]-
PBR28 to over 40 subjects at MGH. We found that [11C]-PBR28 uptake is signifi cantly increased in the 
motor cortices of ALS patients compared to healthy controls, an d that the anatomical distribution of 
increased [11C]-PBR28 binding corresponds to ALS site of weakness onset (i.e ., limb-onset patients 
have more inflammation in the motor cortex and bulbar-onset pat ients have more inflammation in the 
brain stem), and higher levels o f inflammation were correlated with pathological reflexes and worse 
functional status. Thus, [11C]-PBR28 is an ideal biomarker to inform ibudilast target engag ement and 
proof-of-mechanism in patients with ALS. 
Study Objectives 
Primary Objective 
The primary objectives are: 
• to measure the impact of MN-166 (ibudilast) on [11C]-PBR28 uptake in the motor cortices and 
brain stem measured by [CONTACT_28124] (PET) imagi ng at 24 weeks 
• to measure the impact of MN-166 (ibudilast) on several markers of neuro-inflammation 
measured by [CONTACT_901869]. 
 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives are: 
• to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibudilast over 36 we eks  
• to evaluate the effect of ibudil ast on ALS clinical outcomes (A LS functional rating scale 
[ALSFRS-R], slow vital capacity [SVC], strength [measured by [CONTACT_562760] D- Hand-held 
dynamometry]) over 36 weeks.  
STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi-center, open-label study of MN-166 (ibudilast) in subjects with ALS. To be eligible 
subjects must meet the El Escorial criteria of possible, labora tory-supported probable, probable, or 
definite criteria for a diagnosis of ALS. Safety, tolerability,  blood, neuro-imaging biomarkers, and 
clinical outcomes will be collected on all subjects.  Subjects will receive study drug for [ADDRESS_1264876] of a Screening Phase (up to 6 weeks), an  Open-Label Treatment Phase (36 
weeks) and an Off-Treatment F ollow-up Phase (4 Weeks).  
Screening Phase (up to 6 weeks prior to Baseline Visit)  
During the Screening Phase, eligible ALS subjects will sign an informed consent form and the 
following screening assessments will be performed: review of in clusion/exclusion criteria: El Escorial 
ALS Diagnostic criteria, medical  history and demographics, ALS diagnosis history, physical and 
neurological examination, U. Penn upper motor Neuron Burden (UM NB), pulmonary function tests, 
vital signs including height and weight, blood for safety labs including TSPO affinity test,  ECG and 
review and documentation of concom itant medications and therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 
Open-Label Treatment Phase (36 weeks) 
The Treatment Phase will consist of a Baseline visit and 4 subsequent clinic visits at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 
and 36. Telephone follow-ups will occur at Weeks 1, 2, 8, 16, 2 0, 28, and 32.  
At the Baseline visit, subjects will return to the clinic and the following assessments will be 
performed/administered: review of inclusion and exclusion crite ria for continued eligibility, vital signs, 
blood for safety labs and biomarkers, ECG, ALSFRS-R questionnai re, slow vital capacity (SVC),

Outcome Measures 
1. Neuroimaging biomarkers ([11C]-PBR28-PET) including both regions of interest (ROI) and 
voxel-based analyses; 
2. Safety, as measured by [CONTACT_901870], physical 
examination, and standard clinical laboratory tests; 
3. Tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 36-week treatment portion 
of study; 
4. Clinical outcomes: Measured by [CONTACT_191953]-R, SVC, and strength (measured by [CONTACT_35710]).  
5. Blood biomarkers: including analysis of pro-inflammatory cytoki nes. 
Sample Size Justification  
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of the  biomarker. The primary outcome is 
the changes in the ROI in the motor cortex as assessed by [11C]-PBR28-PET. The study PI's previous 
studies comparing mean PBR28 binding in the motor cortices in l imb-onset ALS subjects (1.18 units) 
with matching healthy volunteers (1.064 units) revealed 0.[ADDRESS_1264881] changes in PBR28 uptake after MN-166 treatment. This will also provide more safety and tolerability data on MN-166 for up to 50 mg BID in 
people with ALS.

4.1. Clinical Features and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_901816] (A LS) is a rare degenerative diso rder of large motor neurons of 
the cerebral cortex, brain stem and spi[INVESTIGATOR_901817]1. The incidence of ALS is cu rrently approximately 2/100,0002. The 
lifetime ALS risk is 1 in 600 to 1 in [ZIP_CODE]. Even though the incidence of ALS is similar to 
that of multiple sclerosis, the prevalence is only 4 to 6/100,0 00 (about 25,000-30,000 subjects 
in the [LOCATION_002]), due to the higher mortality rate. Fifty percent of ALS cases die within 
three years of onset of symptom s and 90% die within five years3. The median age of onset is 
[ADDRESS_1264895] cases is unknown4. Age and male gender are the only risk factors 
repeatedly documented in epi[INVESTIGATOR_901818]. No treatment prevents, halts or reverses 
the disease, although the use of  riluzole (FDA-approved therapy  for ALS) is associated with a 
slight prolongation of survival5. Another drug that recently received FDA approval for 
treatment of ALS is Edaravone (Radicava®) and its use is not exclusionary for this study. 
4.2. Role of neuro-inflammation in ALS Pathogenesis 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_901819], a unifying and well-tested  theory of ALS disease 
pathophysiology remains enigmatic4. At the same time, the body of knowledge has expanded 
dramatically as research tools  have improved. Research increasingly implicates neuro-
inflammation as one of the major molecular mechanisms leading t o neuronal death in ALS.  
 
Preclinical evidence: 
Activated microglia are detec ted near the motor neurons of SOD1G93A transgenic mice at [ADDRESS_1264896]-symptomatic survival of these transgenic mice7. In SOD1G93A ALS mice, there is an 
influx of inflammatory blood monocytes (CD14+/CD16-), which are recruited to the CNS and 
mimic the appearance of activated microglia8. In addition, in SOD1G93A mice, peripheral 
blood monocytes (CD14+/CD16-) become activated, demonstrating a pro-inflammatory gene 
profile8. Furthermore, miR-155, a micro-RNA that acts as an upstream re gulator of 
inflammation, becomes upregulat ed in peripheral blood monocytes, and in centr al nervous 
system tissue in these SOD1G93A mice8. Knocking out this gene ameliorates disease in 
transgenic SOD1 mice, as does reducing its expression with an antisense oligonucleotide8-10. 
 
Human studies: 
With relevance to human disease, activated microglia are increased in postmortem brain and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_901820] c ontrols, and the number of 
activated microglia c orrelates positively w ith faster rate of disease progression11. Studies of 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) show increased immune cells, including monocytes/macrophages, and pro-inflammatory cytokines
12-14.

4.3.1. PBR28 PET 
 
[11C]-PBR28 is an inves tigational PET tracer that binds to the tra nslocator protein (TSPO) 
expressed on activated microglia  and astrocytes. The name [CONTACT_35596] e non-radioactive drug is 
PBR. N-Acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine. More than 168 individuals 
received PBR28 (mean dose 2.2mCi/n mol) at MGH and there were no  reported tracer-related 
Adverse Events.   
 
4.3.2. Imaging glial activation in ALS 
 It was found that PBR28 uptake is significantly increased in th e motor cortices in ALS 
patients compared to healthy controls
15 (Figure 1 ). We also demonstrated that the anatomical 
distribution of increased PBR28 uptake corresponds to ALS clini cal presentation; patients 
with limb-onset weakness had higher PBR28 uptake in the motor c ortices and patients with 
bulbar-onset weakness had higher PBR28 uptake in the brainstem15 (Figure 1 ). Furthermore, 
higher PBR28 uptake was strongly  correlated with worse function al status measured by 
[CONTACT_191953]-R and more pathological upper motor neuron signs measure d by [CONTACT_901871] (UMNB) 15.

4.4. MN-166 (ibudilast) 
Ibudilast is a small molecule tha t crosses the blood-brain barr ier after oral administration16. Its 
potential as a neuroprotective agent is based on in vitro  and in vivo  evidence of its ability to 
reduce microglial activation, inh ibit microglia-monocyte recrui tment to the central nervous 
system (CNS), and trigger the rel ease of neurotrophic factors. Ibudilast has been marketed for 
more than [ADDRESS_1264897] reduces active microglia: 
Ibudilast inhibits the pro-infla mmatory cytokine, macrophage mi gration inhibitory factor 
(MIF) and suppresses mononuclear cell migration to the brain in a dose-dependent fashion17. 
MIF is essential for promoting microglial activation and production of the innate soluble 
mediators IL-1β, IL-6, tumor  necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and induc ible nitric oxide (NO) 
synthase18. The in vivo  suppression of MIF effects inhibits CNS inflammation and reduc es the 
number of active microglia and infiltrating inflammatory macrop hages18. Ibudilast also 
reduces microglial activation and protects against white matter  damage induced by [CONTACT_901872]19. These data suggest that by [CONTACT_901873], ibudilast is a pot ent suppressor 
of both microglial recruitment and activation.  
Ibudilast modulate neuroinflammation: 
In cultures of active microglia , ibudilast inhibits the product ion of the pro-inflammatory 
cytokine TNF-α and of NO in a dose-dependent manner
20,21. Ibudilast also inhibits the 
production of TNF-α by [CONTACT_696159] t hat are activated in response  to viral proteins22. In 
addition, ibudilast reduces mic roglial TNF-α expression, demyelination on histology, and the 
development of clinical symptoms in a rodent genetic model of Krabbe’s neurodegeneraton23. 
Oral administration of ibudilast  reduces the severity of clinic al signs of the autoimmune 
encephalitis (EAE) rodent model of multiple sclerosis in a dose -dependent manner24. In a 
multicenter, double-blin d, phase II trial in patients with rela psing multiple sclerosis, ibudilast 
reduced inflammation measured by [CONTACT_901874], and showed beneficial 
clinical effect on disease disability25. Based on these promising resul ts, ibudilast is currently 
under investigation as a disease-modifying agent for multiple s clerosis ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
 
Ibudilast is neuroprotective: 
The anti-inflammatory effects of  Ibudilast are neuroprotective in several in vitro  models. In 
murine neuron and microglia co-cu lture experiments, ibudilast suppresses neuronal cell death 
that is induced by [CONTACT_901875] (LPS) and interferon 
(IFN)-γ21. These activities were medi cated by [CONTACT_901876] (PDEs)20,26. At the same time, ibudilast increases the production of the 
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, and of neurotrophic factors ( nerve growth factor (NGF), 
glia-derived neurotrophic fact or (GDNF), and neurotrophin (NT)- 421. Further, ibudilast 
protects against glutamate exci totoxicity in cultured hippocamp al neurons27. Ibudilast exerts 
beneficial effects on glial cell su rvival as it protects astrocytes against apoptosis28 and 
prevents kainate-induced excito toxicity in cultured oligodendro cytes29.

these 77 subjects, MN-166 100 mg/d ay has been evaluated as a si ngle dose in 9 healthy 
volunteers and multiple doses for up to 8 days in 9 healthy vol unteers and 9 diabetes 
mellitus patients. Additionally, MN-166 has been evaluated in 3 4 subjects with neuropathic 
pain.  The results of the completed Phase 2 randomized double-blind relapsing-remitting multiple 
sclerosis (RRMS) study suggest that MN-166 at daily doses up to and including 60 mg/day 
appear to be generally safe and w ell-tolerated.  A smaller numb er of subjects have received 
MN-166 at 80 mg/day and 100mg/day; the adverse event profile ap pears to be similar to 
that of the lower doses. The advers e events that appear to be d rug-related based on the 
available data are headache, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia and hy perhidrosis.  In the 
multiple sclerosis study, there was a slight dose related incre ase in the percent of subjects 
with headaches and gastrointestin al AEs.  The incidence of naus ea demonstrated a dose-
related increase with the greates t incidence in the 60 mg/day g roup compared to the 30 
mg/day, and placebo groups although the number of subjects expe riencing nausea was 
small. Similarly, the incidence of vomiting followed the same p attern. MN-[ADDRESS_1264903] cases, seemed to resolve over time. These advers e events appear to be 
consistent with the more commonl y reported adverse drug reactio ns reported in the Ketas® 
package insert. MN-166 does not a ppear to cause significant cha nges in blood pressure, 
heart rate or ECGs. No new advers e events appear to occur with long-term exposure. 
Ongoing Studies 
There are currently two ongoing Phase 2 studies to evaluate MN- 166 for the treatment of 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (A LS) and the treatment of multip le sclerosis (MS).  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Study 
The ALS study is currently being conducted under IND 118318 and has enrolled 
approximately 21 patients.  An unbli nded interim analysis was c onducted by [CONTACT_901877], Inc.                                                                        MN-166 (ibudilast) 
MN-166-ALS-[ADDRESS_1264904] been 
reported in 21 subjects (64% of t hese were considered mild and 36% were considered 
moderate). Of the 61 AEs, only 2 were determined to be "possibl y related". All others AEs 
were deemed to be either "unrelat ed" or "unlikely related".  Ad verse events were evenly 
distributed among the two treat ment groups. No clinically significant abnormalities were 
noted on ECG and there were no cli nically significant laboratory abnormalities. The 
recommendation was to conti nue the trial as planned. 
As per the recommendation of the  Division of Neurology Products , this proposed IND is 
being filed to conduct future ALS studies.  
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Study 
As of an interim analysis cu toff date of 05/04/2015, a total of  645 adverse events (AEs) 
have been reported (307 in tr eatment group A, 338 in treatment group B) in 178 subjects. 
No significant trend appears fo r the overall distribution of AE s across the treatment groups. 
When examined by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), there is a trend tow ards significantly more 
AEs in the “Infections” SOC wit h treatment A. However, this tre nd does not appear to be 
due to any particular difference fo r any MedDRA preferred term within this SOC.  
 
Of the 645 AEs, a total of 196 (30 %) have been determined to be  at least possibly related 
to treatment (59 in treatment group A, 137 in treatment group B ). When restricted only to 
the subset of AEs determined to be at least possibly related to  treatment, there is a trend 
towards significantly more rela ted AEs with treatment B (31% of  subjects on treatment A 
with at least one rel ated AE vs. 50% of subjects on treatment B ; RR = 0.62 w/ 95% CI: 
0.44, 0.87). The data suggests that this is primarily due to a trend towards significantly 
more related AEs in the “Gastro intestinal” & “Nervous System” SOCs with treatment B – 
with the overall observed differences primarily due a significa nt increase i n study-related 
“Nausea” (8% of subjects on treatment A vs. 21% of subjects on treatment B; RR = 0.37 
w/ 95% CI: 0.18, 0.76) and a marginall y significant increase in  study-related “Headache” 
(3% of subjects on treatment A  vs. 10% of subjects on treatment  B; RR = 0.34 w/ 95% 
CI: 0.11, 1.02) on treatment B.  
Other Clinical Studies 
There have been [ADDRESS_1264905] udies conducted with MN-166 unde r Investigator-Initiated 
INDs for drug and alcohol addic tion, and medication overuse hea dache.

 4.6. Study Dose Rationale 
The findings from the efficacy endpo ints from the previous Phas e 2 RRMS trial ( MN-166 -
CL-001 ) indicated that patients receiving 60 mg/d MN-166 exhibited si gnificantly reduced 
brain volume loss, reduced progression to persistent black hole (PBH) formation from 
gadolinium-enhancing lesions and extended time to first relapse  vs. patients treated with 
placebo25 (see table below). A dose-respons e effect was evident between the 30 and 60 
mg/d regimens, with 60 mg/d showi ng statistical significance fo r all efficacy measures. 
These study results suggest that MN-[ADDRESS_1264906] that doses of 60 mg/d up to 100 mg/d be suitable to demonstr ate neuroprotective efficacy  of MN-166. 
A summary of daily dose vs. efficacy results across some of the sponsor’s patient trials are presented in the table below.

Note:  A 60 mg/d MN-166 regimen yields steady-state plasma conc . ~75 ng/mL and estimated brain conc. 
~225 ng/mL. Correlates for 80 and 100 mg/d regimens are proport ionally higher.    
 
 For the first clinical trial  with ALS subjects (MN-166-ALS-1201 ), 60 mg/d MN-166 was 
selected for the following reas ons: 1)  60 mg/d was administere d to patients in the RRMS 
trial and found to be generally safe and well-tolerated; 2) the  safety and tolerability of MN-
166 given as an adjuvant to riluz ole had not been previously ev aluated and, 3) MN-[ADDRESS_1264907].  For these 
reasons, it was decided that a more conservative dose regimen w as to be implemented.  
Recently, however, the safety a nd tolerability of MN-166 were e valuated in the ongoing 
progressive MS and ALS trials with recommendations from the ind ependent safety 
monitors to continue the dosing r egimens and the trials, overal l. In April 2015, an interim

MN-166-ALS-[ADDRESS_1264908] 21 subjects (n =[ADDRESS_1264909]; n =7 placebo ) who had completed 3 months 
of study drug treatment in the M N-166-ALS-1201 study.  It was reported that there was no 
trends or signs of increased he patotoxicity in these subjects who were administered MN-
166 with riluzole. Moreover, no trend s or signs of increased incidence of adverse events or 
laboratory value changes were repo rted from the interim safety analysis of the ongoing 
Phase 2 progressive MS trial utilizing up to 100 mg/day.  
 Collectively, the safety and efficacy findings from the complet ed and ongoing trials make a 
compelling case for administ ering up to 100 mg/d MN-166 to ALS patients in this study.

 6.1. Screening Phase (up to 6 weeks prior to Baseline Visit) 
 
During the Screening Phase, a total of up to 6 weeks will be allowed to complete the 
screening assessments.   
Subjects will be approached f or study participation and upon signing an informed consent 
form, the following assessments will be performed: review of in clusion/exclusion criteria: 
medical history including review of prior and current medicatio ns, physical and neurologic 
examination, height, body weight, a nd vital signs (sitting). An EMG report will be 
documented and an ALSFRS-revised questionnaire will be administ ered.  Safety labs 
(chemistry, hematology, and serum  pregnancy test), 12-lead ECG, slow vital capacity and a 
manual muscle strength test will be conducted; an ALSAQ-[ADDRESS_1264911] a diagnosis of  ALS as defined by [CONTACT_901878]-Revised research 
diagnostic criteria for ALS (c linically definite , clinically pr obable, probable-laboratory 
supported). 
6.1.2. Open-Label Treatment Phase (36 weeks) 
 During the Open-label Treatment Phase, subjects will return to the clinic at Baseline, and at 
Week 4, Week 12, Week 24, and W eek 36 (end of study drug dosing ).  Telephone follow-
ups will occur at Weeks 1, 2, 8, 16, 20, 28, and 32 (see Table 1 Schedule of Assessments).   
At the Baseline Visit, subject s who have completed all of the s creening assessments and 
continue to meet eligibility criteria will have their baseline assessments performed.  Subjects will take their firs t dose of study medication (30 mg MN-166) on the evening of 
the Baseline Visit (Day 1).  O n the morning of Day 2, all subje cts will begin a 3 capsule 
BID dosing regimen and will remain on 60 mg/d through Day 14. Beginning on Day 15, all 
subjects will increase dosing to 5 capsules BID regimen. After Day 15, subjects who 
experience intolerable side-effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vo miting) may reduce their dose 
to either 4 capsules twice a day (80 mg/d) or 3 capsules twice a day (60 mg/d) in discussion 
with the site investigator. The  daily dose of ibudilast may be divided and taken three times 
per day if needed to improve tolerability. At the end of the fi rst [ADDRESS_1264912] maintai n their then-current  daily dose of study medication (6 capsules per day, 
8 capsules per day, or 10 capsules per day).  
Subject with intolerable side-effects (e.g., nausea, diarrhea, vomiting) may discontinue the 
study drug at any time at the i nvestigator’s  discretion.

TSPO affinity test : venous blood will be drawn from all participants at Screening i n order 
to have them genotyped for the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism  in the TSPO  g e n e  
(rs6971). About 10% of humans show low binding affinity to PBR2 831. A recent study has 
demonstrated that the rs6971 polymorphism predicts PBR28 bindin g affinity in human 
platelets31. Since the low-affinity binder phenotype is consistent across all tissues within 
the same person, testing for the  Ala147Thr polymorphism can be performed to predict low 
affinity for PBR28 in all organs, including the brain32. High or Mixed affinity binders

 8.3.3. Prohibited drug for “f lexible arm” subjects 
The following medications are prohibited prior to and during st udy participation for the 
flexible arm subjects:  
• cimetidine, cyclosporine, droneda rone, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], probenecid, q uinidine (with the 
exception of Nuedexta, which will be allowed with more frequent  ECG 
monitoring), ranolazine, rifam pin, ritonavir, tipranavir, retig abine, and mexiletine.  
 
8.4. Treatment Compliance 
Compliance will be monitored clo sely at each visit. Subjects wi ll be instructed to bring all 
unused study medication with them to each visit. Compliance wil l be assessed by [CONTACT_901879] (per cap sule count) by [CONTACT_901880] a visit period an d multiplying by 100. All 
subjects will be reminded of the  importance of strict complianc e with taking study 
medication for the effectiveness of treatment and for the successful outcome of the study. 
Subjects who miss more than 25% o f scheduled doses over the cou rse of the study or take 
more than 125% of the scheduled doses will be considered noncom pliant and may be 
discontinued from the study per investigator’s judgment.    
8.5. Randomization and Blinding 
Subjects will not be randomize d in this study. All subjects wil l receive MN-166 (ibudilast). 
 
8.6. Dosing Guidelines 
8.6.1. Treatment Phase 
Capsules containing MN-166 (10 mg) will be used. At the Baselin e Visit (Day 1), subjects 
will be instructed to take [ADDRESS_1264920] 14 da ys and 5 capsules twice a day  thereafter (or as directed by 
[CONTACT_10670]) once in the mor ning (e.g., between approximately 6-9 AM) and once in the 
evening (e.g., approximately 12 h later, which would be approximately 6-9 PM), by [CONTACT_1966]. 
The investigator may also choose to administer the total daily dose of study medication on 
a three-times a day regimen t o help reduce side effects.  
If a subject forgets to take their AM or PM study drug dose at the assigned time (between 
6-9 AM and PM), subjects will be allowed to take their medicati on up to 12 PM or 12 AM, 
respectively.  Beyond this time, s ubjects will be instructed to  skip the dose and take the 
next dose at their regul arly scheduled time.  
MediciNova, Inc.                                                                        MN-166 (ibudilast) 
MN-166-ALS-[ADDRESS_1264921] requiring this manipulat ion. The PIs or licensed 
physician Sub-Investigator may r educe the dosage of study drug or discontinue the study 
drug in its entirety for AEs thought to be related to the study  drug or for other reason 
during the trial (the reason f or, and dates of suspension or do se reduction must be 
documented).  If the AE is mild or moderate, the dosage may be reduced until the event 
improves.  The PIs may then choose to resume the higher dosage or maintain the subject at 
a reduced dosage. If the event is  serious or lif e threatening, and deemed to be definitely 
drug related, the study drug will be discontinued immediately.  Study subjects must remain 
off the study drug permanently. Subjects may not resume study d rug.  All AEs will be 
followed to resolution. 
8.6.3. Dose Interruptions 
Laboratory tests should be repeat ed within two weeks after any of the following laboratory 
values are met: 
• AST or ALT or ALP or T.bil >3x upper limit of normal (ULN) 
• GGT > [ADDRESS_1264922]  
• Cre > 1.[ADDRESS_1264923] 
• White blood count <2500/mm3 
• Platelet count <75,000/ mm3 
If, after repeat testing, the laboratory value is still outside  the above limits, then the subject 
should stop study medication. While dosing is withheld, subject s will continue tests and 
assessments according to the schedule defined in the protocol ( and may also undergo 
additional assessments to evaluate the laboratory abnormality a s per the Investigator’s 
standard practice). In addition, subjects must have the abnormal laboratory result rechecked 
at least every 2 weeks (rechecks will be run at th e local labor atory) until resolution or 
stabilization of the  laboratory value. 
After laboratory values return w ithin normal limits, resumption  of study treatment is to be 
considered on a case by [CONTACT_901881] t he Independent Safety 
Monitor.  
8.6.4. Subsequent Additional Lab oratory Abnormalities 
Subjects who subsequently devel op the same abnormal laboratory value at any other time 
must permanently discontinue dosing with study treatment (i.e.,  only one dosing 
interruption is allowed for the  same lab abnormality). However,  subjects who subsequently 
experience a different laborator y abnormality can have study tr eatment withheld again for a 
different laboratory abnormality. However, only two dosing inte rruptions are allowed for 
each subject. Any subject who experi ences a third abnormal labo ratory tests as defined in 
the section above ( Section 8.6.2 ) must permanently discontinue study treatment.

consent process and sign the c onsent document. A copy of the si gned and dated informed 
consent (in a language in which the subject is fluent) is requi red to be given to the subject. 
If a subject withdraws consent, data colle cted up to the time o f discontinuation will be used 
to evaluate study results.

able to verbally describe the be nefits and risks associated wit h this study and what other 
treatment alternatives are ava ilable (as described in the conse nt form). Only subjects who 
provide informed consent, as assessed and documented by [CONTACT_14520], will be 
enrolled. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Medical History  
A medical history obtained by [CONTACT_32816] [INVESTIGATOR_901824] l isted on the Form FDA 
1572.   [IP_ADDRESS]. Prior/Concomitant Medication Review 
Site study staff will record all medications taken for ALS and all current medication within 
1 month prior to screening visit i n the CRF. Also, the followin g parameters will be 
recorded for all concomitant medications: drug name, route of a dministration, total daily 
dose, unit, frequency, start/st op dates, indication, and whethe r the medication was started 
after last dose of study medica tion.  The concomitant medications will subsequently be 
coded using the World Health Organ ization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD).   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Physical/Neurological Examination 
The physical exams must be perf ormed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_901825] (physician, 
physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) listed on the Form  FDA 1572. Clinically 
significant changes from the sig ning of the informed consent form (ICF) should be 
captured as AEs in the CRF. 
A complete physical examinati on includes the following assessme nts: general appearance, 
head, eyes, ears/nose/throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, h eart, abdomen, and 
musculoskeletal. If the subject  is discontinued for any reason,  every attempt should be 
made to perform a final physical  and neurological examination. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Vital Signs, Height, and Weight  
 
Vital signs, including systolic  and diastolic blood pressure, p ulse rate (radial

Clinically significant findings f rom the screening report must be captured in the medical 
history.  Any clinicall y significant changes compared with screening must be captured as 
an AE in the CRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neuroimaging 
Subjects will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) / PBR28 Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET) twice during the course of the study. The goal  of these scans is to 
measure activated microglia in study participants before treatm ent and after several weeks 
of treatment. The first scan will occur between the Screening a nd the Baseline visits ( off 
treatment), after subject eligibility has been confirmed by [CONTACT_901884] O affinity binding assay. The 
second scan will occur between the Week 12 and Week 24 visits ( on treatment). 
Neuroimaging will be performed at the MGH Martinos Center for B iomedical Imaging.  
Subjects will be asked to lie still in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_901826] e duration of the study, which 
will take approximately 90 min.  
 Each PET scan will include one administration of [
11C]-PBR28 (up to 15mCi, which is 
equivalent to ~3.7 mSv), injected intravenously with a slow bol us over a 30s period. The 
catheter will be flashed post-in jection of with 0.9% saline solution. Dynamic data will be 
collected over approximately [ADDRESS_1264931]-collection.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pulmonary Function Test 
Pulmonary Function Testing includes Slow Vital Capacity (SVC).  
Slow Vital Capacity (SVC): The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be 
determined, using the upright slow VC method. The SVC can be me asured using 
conventional spi[INVESTIGATOR_901827] h ave had a calibration check prio r to subject testing.  A 
printout from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_901828].  Three SVC trials are required 
for each testing session, howev er up to [ADDRESS_1264932] SVC  is 10% or greater for the fi rst [ADDRESS_1264933] 
trials are recorded on the CRF.

ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating s cale (ratings 0 to 4) used 
to determine subjects' assessment of their capab ility and indep endence in [ADDRESS_1264934] items. The advantages of 
the ALSFRS-R are that the cate gories are relevant to ALS, it is  a sensitive and reliable tool 
for assessing activities of da ily living function in those with  ALS, and it is quickly 
administered.  With appropriate  training, the ALSFRS-R can be a dministered with high

MN-166-ALS-[ADDRESS_1264935] be NEALS certified. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Upper Motor Neuron-Burden (UMN-B) 
 
The Penn Upper Motor Neuron-Burde n (UMN-B) is the total number of pathological UMN 
signs on examination including path ologically brisk biceps, sup inator, triceps, finger, knee 
and ankle reflexes, and extensor plantar responses assessed bil aterally and brisk facial and 
jaw jerks (9).  The scale is a combination of Ashworth, Reflexes, and Pseudobulbar Affect 
scale (Range score: 0 to 32).  
The UMN also includes scoring of  the Center for Neurologic Stud y-Lability Scale (CNS-
LS), a 7-item self-report scal e that assesses pseudobulbar affe ct (PBA) by [CONTACT_901885][INVESTIGATOR_1865] s (laughing or crying) and the Ashworth Spasticity 
Scale, a standard measure for sp asticity that has been used in numerous ALS clinical trials 
to assess spasticity due to upper motor neuron dysfunction in A LS.  Data is generated from 
the clinical exam and scored from [ADDRESS_1264936] extreme spasticity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Blood Biomarkers 
Subjects will also be asked to provide blood samples for biomar ker analysis per Schedule 
of Assessments. These blood samples will be stored in a sample repository.  These samples 
will be used for biomarker research.  All samples will be label ed with a code.  The code 
will not include any identifiable information.  Any analysis pe rformed on these samples is 
for research purposes only.  Using a bar coding and scanner sys tem, each sample aliquot 
will be catalogued for future reference.  In the electronic dat a capture system, sample 
number and location will be cross-referenced to the clinical in formation. All samples will 
be linked to GUID and may be sto red using the Global Unique Ide ntifier (GUID) to 
identify the sample. 
Unused samples will remain in the biorepository for future rese arch. There is no scheduled 
date on which the samples will be destroyed.  Samples may be st ored for research until 
they are used, damaged, decayed or otherwise unfit for analysis . Subjects have the option 
of declining participation in t his portion of the study at any time by [CONTACT_636409].  However, it will not be possible to destroy samples that 
may have already been used.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Strength Measurement (HHD) 
Changes in strength will be meas ured using HHD (hand-held dynam ometry), a non-
invasive device that allows measur ements of isometric strength in muscle groups of the 
arms and legs. It has been direc tly validated against maximum v oluntary isometric 
contraction (MVIC) in ALS patie nts, and shown to change at a similar rate with variability 
MediciNova, Inc.                                                                        MN-166 (ibudilast)

variability that was extremely s imilar as well. The only time a t which correlation between 
HHD and MVIC broke down was at extremely high strength levels, an area not likely to be 
a problem in an ALS clinical tri al. HHD equipment is inexpensiv e and it takes less than [ADDRESS_1264938] of both upper and lower extremities. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a qualified designee listed on Form FDA [ADDRESS_1264939] ass ess the severity and 
relationship to study medication for all AEs (see Section  11.2). 
All observed or volunteered AEs reg ardless of treatment group o r suspected causal 
relationship to the investigati onal product(s) will be recorded  on the AE page(s) of the 
CRF.  
The PI, sub-investigator (SI) and members of the clinical research team are responsible for 
identifying adverse events and re porting them to RN coordinator . 
 
For all AEs, the Investigator  must pursue and obtain informatio n adequate to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess wh ether it meets the criteria f or classification as an SAE 
(see Section  11.2) requiring immediate notificatio n to the Sponsor or its designated 
representative.  
For all AEs, sufficient info rmation should be obtained by [CONTACT_118555]. The Investig ator is required to assess cau sality and indicate that 
assessment on the CRF. For AEs wit h a causal relationship to th e investigational product, 
follow-up by [CONTACT_901886] s sequelae resolve or stabilize 
at a level acceptable to the I nvestigator, and Sponsor concurs with that assessment.  
Adverse events (serious and non-serious) including all Suspecte d Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) should be recorded on the CRF from the date of informed 
consent until the end of their participation in the study (i.e. , the subject has discontinued or 
completed the follow-up visit). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Evaluations 
Laboratory evaluations will include the tests listed in Appendix [ADDRESS_1264940] result and reviewed by P I, SI, RN coordinator daily;  if a clinically significant 
laboratory result is identified upon reporting, it will be revi ewed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_901829].

 11. ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered 
a medicinal (inves tigational) product a nd which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatmen t. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including a clinic ally significant abnormal laboratory fi nding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the us e of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medic inal (investigational) product. Adverse events may include 
the onset of a new illness and the exacerbation of pre-existing  conditions. 
Other untoward events occurring i n the framework of a clinical study are also to be 
recorded as AEs (e.g., those occu rring during treatment-free pe riods, including screening or 
post-treatment follow-up periods) , in association with study-re lated procedures and 
assessments. 
In this study, symptoms of progr ession/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ progression, 
will be recorded as adverse even ts. The following measures of d isease progression will not 
be recorded as adverse events eve n if they worsen: ALSFRS-R. Th ese measures will be 
recorded and analyzed separately.  
11.2. Assessment of Adverse Events 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_261967], relationship with study 
medication, and whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE, requiring 
immediate notification to t he Sponsor or designee (see 
Section  11.5). These assessments 
will be made in accordance with the standard ratings detailed i n the following sections. 
11.2.1. Severity Assessment 
The severity of AEs will be dete rmined as described in Table 6.

Death Grade 5 Death. 
 
When changes in the intensity of  an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the 
maximum intensity for the event  should be noted for that day. Any change in severity of 
signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by [CONTACT_901892] a new AE, with 
the amended severity grade and the date (and time, if known) of  the change. 
11.2.2. Relationship to Study Drug 
One of the following categorie s in Table 7 should be selected b ased on medical judgment, 
considering the definitions below and all contributing factors.  
Table 7: Adverse Event Causality Definitions 
Related 
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs  in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment a dministration, and which cannot be explained 
by [CONTACT_262150]. The re sponse to 
withdrawal of the treatment (dechallengea) should be clinically plausible. The 
event must be definitive pharma cologically or phenomenologically, using a 
satisfactory rechallengeb procedure if necessary. 
Probably related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to admin istration of the treatment, un likely to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or other medications or chemic als, and which 
follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechall enge). 
Rechallenge information is not r equired to fulfill this definit ion. 
Possibly related 
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs within a 
reasonable time sequence to admin istration of the treatment, bu t which could 
also be explained by [CONTACT_901893]. 
Information on treatment withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely to be related 
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs  with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and in w hich other medications, chemicals, or 
underlying disease provide p lausible explanations. 
Unrelated 
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs  with little or 
no temporal relationship with treatment administration. May hav e negative 
dechallenge and rechallenge information. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_396506] (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or oth er medications 
or chemicals). 
a Dechallenge is when a medicati on suspected of causing an AE is  discontinued. If the symptoms of the AE

 negative dechallenge. Note that th ere are exceptions when an AE  does not disappear upon discontinuation 
of the medication, yet  medication-relatedness clearly exists (e .g., as in bone marrow suppression, fixed 
medication eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia). 
b Rechallenge is when a medication suspected of causing an AE in  a specific subject in the past is readministered to that 
subject. If the AE recurs upon ex posure, this is termed a posit ive rechallenge. If the AE does not recur, this is termed a 
negative rechallenge. 
11.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be collected and recorded for each subjec t from the date the 
informed consent form (ICF) wa s signed until the end of their p articipation in the study, 
(ie, the subject has discontinued or completed the study) throu gh the follow-up visit. Only 
those AEs that occurred while  on study drug that have not been resolved will be followed 
until resolution or stabilization. 
Following the end of the subject’s participation in the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_901833] “spontaneously” if considered at least possibly related to 
study medication. 
Adverse events may be voluntee red spontaneously by [CONTACT_901894], or discovered by 
[CONTACT_901895], non-leading question 
such as, “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”  All AEs and any required 
remedial action will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and transcribed onto 
the appropriate CRF page for t he study period in dicated. The nature of AE, date (and time, 
if known) of AE onset, date (and time, if known) of AE outcome to date, severity, and 
action taken of the AE will be documented together with the PIs  or an authorized 
physician’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to study 
medication and/or study procedur e (at the time of assessment). 
All AEs should be recorded indivi dually in the study subject’s own words (verbatim) 
unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_261972], th e AEs constitute components 
of a recognized condition, disease , or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual symptom. T he AEs will 
subsequently be code d using the MedDRA. 
Throughout the study, safety will be monitored closely for unex pected or significant 
adverse effects by [CONTACT_45822]. Any unanticipate d problems involving risks to 
subjects or others in cluding adverse events  will be reported to  the PHRC in accordance 
with PHRC unanticipated problems reporting guidelines . The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_901834]. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_901835] t asks based on appropriate staff qualifications. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_901836]. 
AEs, SAEs and all safety-related events will be reported in acc ordance with IRB 
guidelines.  
 
MediciNova, Inc.                                                                        MN-166 (ibudilast) 
MN-166-ALS-[ADDRESS_1264946]’s source documentation and  transcribed onto the appropr iate CRF page. 
All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization of th e condition, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the s ubject is lost to follow-up. 
11.5. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
An AE is considered serious if it meets one or more of the foll owing criteria: 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (i.e., a subj ect is at immediate risk of de ath at the time of the 
event, not an event where occurrenc e in a more severe form might have caused 
death) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is another important medical event (see below) 
Important medical events th at do not result in death, are not l ife-threatening, or do not 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128151] c onsidered SAEs when, based on a ppropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medic al or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes lis ted above. Examples of such m edical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emerg ency room or in a 
physician’s office, blood dyscrasia s or seizures that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug  abuse. A distinction 
should be drawn between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a m easure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_29967]. For example, a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal bleeding requi ring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n for monitoring purposes 
would be considered an SAE, but is not necessarily severe. Simi larly, an AE that is severe 
in intensity is not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia m ay be assessed as severe in 
intensity, but would probably not be considered an SAE.

• Criterion/criteria for cla ssification as “serious” 
• Study medication name, or code if  blinded, and treatment start date 
• Date of SAE onset 
• Causality assessment (if suffici ent information is available to  make this 
classification). 
Initial reports of SAEs must be  followed later with detailed de scriptions, including clear 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_211387] (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_901838], consultant reports, 
autopsy reports, etc.), with the s tudy subject’s personal ident ifiers removed. All relevant 
information obtained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a n authorized d elegate throug h review of these 
documents will be recorded on the A E eCRF page and/or a new SAE Report Form and 
faxed to the Sponsor  or designee  within [ADDRESS_1264948] using a new SAE Report Form, 
bearing the PI’s signature [CONTACT_3670]. 
Any AE fulfilling the criteria for expedited reporting will be reported by [CONTACT_901896](s) in accordan ce with the Sponsor’s 
standard operating procedures (SO Ps) and local regulatory requi rements.

report.  
Complete an SAE Report Form if the delivery outcome meets the c riteria for a SAE (e.g., 
congenital anomaly/birth defect, s tillbirth, some other sicknes s, etc.). The SAE Report 
Form should be completed with the study subject’s details (e.g. , subject number, initials, 
date of birth, investigational  product information, etc.) and t he details of the fetal SAE and 
maternal complications should be described in the “Narrative” f ield of the SAE Report

 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP) will provide details on the  statistical methods planned 
for this study. 
12.1. Sample Size Justification 
 
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of the  biomarker. The primary 
outcome is the changes in the ROI in the motor cortex as assess ed by [11C]-PBR29-PET. 
Our previous studies comparing mean PBR28 binding in the motor cortices in limb-onset 
ALS subjects (1.18 units) with m atching healthy volunteers (1.0 64 units) revealed 0.[ADDRESS_1264955] cha nges in PBR28 uptake after MN-166 treatment. This will also 
provide more safety and tolerability data on MN-166 for up to 5 0 mg BID in people with 
ALS.  
 
12.2. Safety Analysis 
 
The incidence of treatment-eme rgent AEs (TEAEs, defined as AEs occurring from the time 
of first dose through [ADDRESS_1264956] dose of study medic ation), SAEs and AEs leading 
to discontinuations w ill be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Inc idence of TEAEs will also 
be summarized by [CONTACT_926] (mild, moderate, or severe), as well as by [CONTACT_348243] (not related, possi bly related, or probably related) and by [CONTACT_12917]. 
 Changes from baseline in laborat ory values will be summarized. Incidence of out-of-
normal-range values and markedl y abnormal change from baseline in laboratory safety test 
variables will be tabulated.   Changes in vital signs from baseline will be summarized.

 Appendix 2: El Escorial World F ederation of Neurology Criteria for the Diagnosis of ALS 
 
Information obtained from the web site: www.wfnals.org . 
 The diagnosis of Amyotrophic Late ral Sclerosis [ALS] requires:  
A - The presence of: 
 (A:1) evidence of lower motor neuron (LMN) degeneration by [CONTACT_901909], 
 electrophysiological or neu ropathologic examination,  
 (A:2) evidence of upper motor neuron (UMN) degeneration by [CONTACT_901910], 
 and  
 (A:3) progressive spread of symptoms or signs within a region or to other regions, as 
 determined by [CONTACT_525049], together with 
B - The absence of:  (B:1) electrophysiological and pa thological evidence of other disease processes that 
 might explain the signs of LMN and/or UMN degeneration, and   (B:2) neuroimaging evidence of other disease processes that mi ght explain the observed 
 clinical and electrophys iological signs.  
 
CLINICAL STUDIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALS 
A careful history, physical and ne urological examination must search for clinical evidence 
o f  U M N  a n d  L M N  s i g n s  i n  f o u r  r e g ions [brainstem, cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]] (see Table 1) of th e central nervous system [CNS]. Ancillary tests should be 
reasonably applied, as clinicall y indicated, to exclude other d isease processes. These should 
include electrodiagnostic, neur ophysiological, neuroimaging and  clinical laboratory 
studies.  Clinical evidence of LMN and UMN degeneration is requ ired for the diagnosis of 
ALS.  The clinical diagnosis of ALS, without pathological confirmation, may be 
categorized into various levels of certainty by [CONTACT_901911] t ogether in the same topographica l anatomic region in 
e i t h e r  t h e  b r a i n s t e m  [ b u l b a r  c r a n i a l  m o t o r  n e u r o n s ] ,  c e r v i c a l ,  thoracic, or lumbosacral 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] [anterior horn motor neurons]. The terms Clinical D efinite ALS and Clinically 
Probable ALS are used to describe  these categories of clinical diagnostic certainty on 
clinical criteria alone:  A. Clinically Definite ALS is de fined on clinical evidence alon e by [CONTACT_525051], 
as well as LMN signs, in three regions.   B. Clinically Probable ALS is def ined on clinical evidence alon e by [CONTACT_901912] e UMN signs necessarily rostral  to (above) the LMN signs. 
 C. Clinically Probable ALS - La boratory-supported is defined wh en clinical signs of UMN 
and LMN dysfunction are in only one region, or when UMN signs alone are present in one region, and LMN signs defined by E M G  c r i t e r i a  a r e  p r e s e n t  i n  a t  least two limbs, with 
proper application of neuroimagi ng and clinical laboratory prot ocols to exclude other 
causes.

 D. Clinically Possible ALS is defined when clinical signs of UMN and LMN dysfunction 
are found together in only one region or UMN signs are found alone in two or more regions; or LMN signs are found rostral to UMN signs and the di agnosis of Clinically 
Probable - Laboratory-supported ALS cannot be proven by [CONTACT_901913] c, neurophysiologic, neuroimag ing or clinical laboratory 
studies. Other diagnoses must have been excluded to accept a di agnosis of Clinically 
Possible ALS.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types)  
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act c ommitted with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought o f as method to kill oneself. Int ent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated  with the act, then it can be co nsidered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury o r harm. If person pulls trigge r while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results,  
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to d ie, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accide nt so no other intent but suic ide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_901862] a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they d id could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself? Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? Did you______ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____? 
Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get  s
ympath y, 
or get something else to happen)?  (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)  
If yes, describe: 
 Has subject engaged in Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior?

□   □
Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) fro m starting the potentia lly self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_901863] g.  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], th is becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away  by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger.  Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Perso n is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hang ing: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to ha ng - is stopped from doing so. 
Has there been a time when you started to do something to end your life but someone or something stopped you before you 
actually did anything?

Aborted Attempt:   
When person begins to take steps toward making a suicide attemp t, but stops themselves before t hey actually have engaged in any self-destructive behavior. 
Examples are similar to interr upted attempts, except that the i ndividual stops him/herself, instead of being stopped by [CONTACT_901916].

Preparatory Acts or Behavior: 
Acts or preparation towards immi nently making a suicide attempt . This can include anything be yond a verbalization or thought, such as assembling a specific 
method (e.g., buying pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], purchasing a gun) or preparing for one’s death by [CONTACT_20673] (e.g., giv ing things away , writing a suicide note).

 SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these ar e separate events; must ask about all types) Since Last Visit  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self-injurious act c ommitted with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to die associated  with the act, then it can be co nsidered an actual suicide 
attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury  or harm. If person pulls trigge r while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considere d an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to d ie, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumst ances. For example, 
a highly lethal act that is cl early not an accident so no other  intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jum pi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] 
a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but  they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be  inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt? 
Have you done anything to harm yourself?  Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? 
What did you do? Did you______ as a way to end your life?  Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  Were you trying to end your life when you _____? Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intentio n of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, 
get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) fro m starting the potentia lly self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt 
would have occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_901863] g.  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], th is becomes an attempt rather than an 
interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward se lf, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling 
trigger. Once they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is gr abbed and taken down

1. Introduction  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) defines the outcome measure and analysis samples and 
specifies the planned analyses of data from the phase Ib/IIa open label trial of MN -166 ( Ibudilast ) 
in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The SAP supplements the cl inical protocol. Please refer 
to the clinical protocol for details on the rationale for the intervention, eligibility criteria, conduct 
of the trial, clinical assessments and the timing of their use in the trial, definitions and reporting of 
adverse events , data management conventions, and regulatory oversight and compliance 
procedures. In case of discrepancies between the SAP and the clinical protocol concerning matters of data analysis, the SAP is authoritative. On all other matters, the clinical protocol is authoritative.  
 
2. Study Design  
2.1 Overview  
This is a multi- center, open label Ib/IIa phase study to evaluate Ibudilast in subjects with ALS. 
Participants go through [ADDRESS_1264975] uptake in motor cortices and brain 
stem as measured by [CONTACT_28124] (PET) imaging at [ADDRESS_1264976] on ALS clinical outcomes such as the revised ALS function rating scale (ALSFRS -R), 
slow vital capacity (SVC), and strength measured by [CONTACT_352516] (HHD) over 36 weeks  
2.3 Study Populations  
Individuals eligible for trial participation are men or women aged 18 or above who are diagnosed 
as having possible, probable, probable -laboratory supported, or definite ALS, either sporadic or 
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1264977] a vital capacity of more than 50% of 
predicted normal. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are specified in the clinical protocol.  
Participants will be enrolled at MGH and the South Shor e Neurologic Associates Long Island Site. 
Up to five participants are expected to be enrolled in the study by [CONTACT_901917]. This is referred to as the flexible arm.   
2.4 Schedule of Assessments  
Off-treatment PET imaging will be performed at baseline and on -treatment PET imaging will be 
performed once between weeks 12 and 24. Blood samples for biomarkers will be collected at 
baseline and weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36. ALSFRS -R, SVC, and HHD will be coll ected at baseline 
and weeks 4, 12, 24, and 36 (SVC will have an additional collection at screening to assess inclusion criteria). Full schedule of assessments is specified in the clinical protocol.  
3. General Statistical Considerations  
3.1 Statistical Software  
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute, NC, [LOCATION_003]) or R (R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). PET analyses will be done using Freesurfer v6.0 
(https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and FSL Stats. 
3.[ADDRESS_1264978] deviations at each timepoint.  
3.3 Precision 
Resul ts will be reported to 3 significant figures. Percentages will be reported to 0.1 percentage 
points. P -values will be reported to two digits when greater than or equal to 0.095, to three digits 
when greater than or equal to 0.[ZIP_CODE] and less than 0.095, and as <0.001 for all smaller values.  
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, 2 1 Jun 2019  
 Page 6 of 11 
 4. Analysis Samples  
The following analysis samples will be used for testing endpoints: 
• Per-protocol (PP) sample: Participants who are eligible, randomized, initiate at least the 
first Ibudilast dose and successfully titrated up to and maintained the full Ibudilast dose of 50mg 
BID. Flexible arm participants will not be included. This sample will be used to analyze PET, 
blood biomarker, safety and tolerability endpoints.  
• Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT) sample: Participants w ho are eligible, randomized, 
initiate at least the first Ibudilast dose, and complete both pre and post- treatment PET scans. 
Observations made after premature permanent discontinuation or permanent dose reduction of 
Ibudilast are included in this sample, should such participants remain on study. Flexible arm participants will not be included. This sample will be used to analyze PET, blood biomarker, safety and tolerability endpoints.  
• Intent- to-treat (ITT) sample: Participants who are eligible, randomized, and initiate at 
least the first Ibudilast dose. Observations made after premature permanent discontinuation of 
Ibudilast are included in this sample, should such participants remain on study. Flexible arm 
participants will not be included. This sample will be used to analyze blood biomarker, safety and tolerability endpoints.  
• Safety (ST) sample: Participants who are eligible, randomized, and initiate at least the 
first Ibudilast dose. Observations made after premature permanent discontinuation of Ibudilast 
are included in this sample, should such participants remain on study. Flexible arm participants 
will be included. This sample will be used to analyze safety and tolerability endpoints.  
5. Study Endpoints  
5.1 PET Endpoint  
The ratio of standardized uptake value (SUVR) will be the only imaging endpoint.   
5.2 Biofluid Biomarker Endpoints  
MIF (Macrophage migration inhibitory factor), TNF -alpha, Neurofilament light will be used as 
blood biomarkers for inflammation. All blood biomarkers will be presented as pi[INVESTIGATOR_278794]/milliliter 
(pg/mL).  
5.3 Safety Endpoints  
To describe safety, clinical and laboratory treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
summarized overall and stratified by [CONTACT_926], persistence over time and relationship to study drug. 
Kaplan Meier p lots of survival will be presented.  
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1264979] sample.  
5.5 Efficacy En dpoints  
• ALSFRS -R Total Score  
• SVC as a percent of predicted normal volume 
• HHD of the following standardized megascores: (a) upper limbs: proximal (bilateral 
shoulder and elbow flexion), distal (bilateral wrist extension and first dorsal interossei), (b) low er 
limbs: proximal (bilateral hip flexion and knee extension) and distal (bilateral ankle dorsiflexion)  
6. Measurement Definitions  
6.1 PET Measures  
Glial activation will be estimated in eligible participants in the regular arm by [CONTACT_901918] (MR -PET) using the [11C] -PBR28 radioligand. Per 
protocol, individuals who are homozygous for the T/T allele of the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism (rs6971) are excluded from the regular arm, since this genotype is associated with 
low a ffinity binding for [11C] -PBR28. Glial activation will be quantified as a mean standardized 
uptake value (SUV) using PET images acquired from [ADDRESS_1264980] -injection of 
approximately 430 MBq [11C] -PBR28. FreeSurfer v6.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) will 
be employed to circumscribe a region of interest (ROI) defined anatomically as bilateral grey and 
white matter of primary motor cortices. SUV of the ROI will be normalized to the SUV of the 
whole brain tissue and occipi[INVESTIGATOR_33934]  (pseudorefere nce region)( Albrecht DS et al, J Nucl Med, 
2018)  and expressed as a SUV ratio (SUVR) separately to control for variability in the global 
[11C]-PBR28 PET signal. An independent neuroimaging rater, who is blinded to the clinical data 
will assess for quality control of the PBR28- PET images and SUVR values.  
6.2 Blood biomarkers  
Blood biomarkers of inflammation and neurodegeneration, including TNF -alpha, MIF 
(Macrophage migration inhibitory factor) and Neurofilament light will be measured pre - and post - 
treatment. Prior studies have suggested that by [CONTACT_901873], Ibudilast is a potent suppressor of 
both microglial recruitment and activation in a dose dependent fashion (Cho Y et al, 2010; Cox 
GM et al 2013) . Further, in neuron and microglia co-cultures, Ibudilast significantly suppressed 
neuronal cell death induced by [CONTACT_901919] a neuroprotective action ( Mizuno T et al, 2004) . Neuofilament light is a marker of neuronal cell death and axon loss, 
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1264981] ’s effect on neuroprotection in ALS and is hypothesized to be 
inversely correlated with disease progression markers such as ALSFRS -R and SVC, as well as 
markers  of glial activation on imaging and blood biofluids. TNF -alpha is a marker of 
neuroinflammation, shown to be elevated in ALS in in vitro and in vivo models and Ibudilast has 
shown inhibitory action of production of TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner ( Suzumura A et  
al, 1999) . All these biomarkers will be measures in pg/ml . 
6.3 Clinical Progression Measures  
6.3.1 ALSFRS-R 
The ALSFRS -R (Cedarbaum  et al. 1999) is a 12 -item clinician -completed interview scale for 
assessing participants’ function in four domains: bulbar, fine motor, gross motor, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]. 
Each item is scored from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater function. The ALSFR S-R 
total score is the sum of all items (range 0 to 48).  
6.3.2 SVC 
Slow vital capacity (SVC) is the maximum volume of air that can be slowly exhaled after slow, 
maximal inhalation. Trained technicians coach participants through 3 to 5 maneuvers using an 
EasyOne  Plus spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (ndd Medical Technologies, Inc., Andover, MA). Assessments will be 
analyzed if at least two acceptable maneuvers are recorded. The maximum volume expi[INVESTIGATOR_901866]. Normal values are calculated based on sex, age, and 
height using equations published by [CONTACT_636448]. (1983). Higher values indicate better 
pulmonary function.  
6.3.3 Handheld dynamometry  
Handheld dynamometry (HHD) will be used by [CONTACT_901920] a MicroFET2 HHD (Hoggan Scientific, Salt Lake City, UT). Nine upper and lower extremity 
muscles or muscle groups will be examined: shoulder flexion, elbow flexion,  wrist extension, first 
dorsal interosseous contraction, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. Each muscle 
or muscle group will be measured twice or three times bilaterally. The average of the two highest 
measurements will be analyzed. To calculate megascores, the mean and standard deviation of each 
muscle or muscle group, without regard to la terality, will be calculated from the baseline 
assessment of all participants in the ITT sample. Maneuvers that cannot be completed by a 
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1264982] deviation. Z scores for will be averaged into the standardized megascores: (a) 
upper limbs: proximal (bilateral shoulder and elbow flexion), distal (bilateral w rist extension and 
first dorsal interossei), (b) lower limbs: proximal (bilateral hip flexion and knee extension) and distal (bilateral ankle dorsiflexion)  
 
6.4  Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
6.4.1 Safety  
TEAEs will be reported for AEs that are possibly or definitely related to study drug and occur in more than 5% of subjects or lead to early drug discontinuation. Discontinuations due to TEAEs, 
treatment emergent serious adverse events, all SAEs and study deaths, treatment emergent 
laboratory abnormalities judged  to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_135942], and mean change from 
baseline and percent change from baseline in weight, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure will also be summarized to describe safety. Reported proportions will use as their denom inator all participants in the ST sample and AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_901921]. 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1264983] if they complete all 36 -weeks of treatment and 
remain on study drug and free from any possibly or definitely drug related AEs leading to permanent study drug discontinuation to the week 36. 
7 Power Calculations  
Sample size calculation was based on the primary outcome of the biomarker. The primary outcome 
is the changes in the ROI in the motor cortex as assessed by [11C] -PBR28 -PET. The study PI’s 
previous studies comparing mean PBR28 binding in the motor cortices in limb -onset ALS subjects 
(1.18 units) with matching healthy volunteers (1.064 units) revealed 0.[ADDRESS_1264984] changes in PBR28 
Babu (PI) Ibudilast  Trial: Statistical Analysis Plan  Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1264985] for up to 50mg BID in people with ALS.  
8 Participant Characterization  
Each analysis sample will be summarized overall for the following characteristics: age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, El Escorial diagnosis, years since ALS symptom onset, delay between symptom onset 
and ALS diagnosis, site of ALS symptom onset, use of Riluzole at baseline, and baseline levels of 
[PET score(s)], [biomarker(s)], ALSFRS -R, SVC, and HHD standardized megascores.  
9 Statistical Analyses  
9.1 PET Analysis  
Primary analysis will be on changes from baseline for [11C]PBR -[ADDRESS_1264986] - treatment groups will be reported as 
Median (range) values. Change SUVR scores post -treatment will be tested using Wilcoxon signed 
rank test  to assess if there was a significant change from baseline.   
Subjects scan quality will be assessed by [CONTACT_901922], who is blinded to 
the clinical data. All poor -quality scans , defined by [CONTACT_901923] (less than 20 minutes of PET 
data collected or incomplete anatomical FOV affecting reliable PET attenuation correction) and excessive motion degradation , will be excluded from the study.   
9.2 Biofluid Biomarkers Analysis  
Primary analyses will be on changes from baseline for biofluid biomarkers (TNF -alpha, MIF, and 
NF-l) at week [ADDRESS_1264987] - 
treatment groups will be  reported as median (range) values. Change scores post -treatment will be 
tested using a Wilcoxon signed rank test to assess if there was a significant change from baseline. Only subjects with complete baseline and week [ADDRESS_1264988] for time (weeks since baseline), and a random slope and intercept for each subject with an unstructured covariance will be used for this analysis using the ITT sample. Further exploratory

 analyses will use baseline SUVR as a covariate to the mixed effects models of change over 36 
weeks to assess the predictive value of SUVR in biofluid biomarker trajectory. 
9.3 Clinical Outcomes  
Change in clinical outcomes measures (ALSFRS -R, SVC and HHD- megascores) will be assessed 
over the [ADDRESS_1264989] for time (weeks 
since baseline), and a rand om slope and intercept for each subject with an unstructured covariance 
will be used for this analysis on the ITT sample.  
Exploratory analyses will use Pearson correlation coefficient to correlate the a) 12 -24 week change 
in PBR28- SUVR in the primary motor cortices and b) 36 -week change in biofluid biomarkers 
(TNF -alpha, MIF, and NF- l) with changes in clinical outcome measures over [ADDRESS_1264990] sample and described as 
counts and proportions. 
9.5 Notes on Analyses  
Alpha of 0.05 will be split between PET and biomarker outcomes with 0.025 used for SUVR and 
0.025 split evenly between the 3 biomarkers. Non- primary analyses will not be corrected for 
multiple testing.

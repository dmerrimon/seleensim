Confidential Page 3 of 101  Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel group , multicenter study of FDC  versus EZE and 
PBO administered for 12 weeks in subjects with T2D and elevated LDL -C.  An overview of the study 
design is presented below.  
Overview of Study Design 
  
T2D = type 2 diabetes; HbA 1C = hemoglobin A 1C; LDL -C = low -density lipoprotein cholesterol; LMT  = lipid-
modifying therapy; BA = bempedoic aci d; EZE = ezetimibe; FDC = fixed -dose combination.  
 
Subjects with a history of T2D for at least 6  months will be screened for eligibility at an initial screening 
visit (Visit S1), which will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_364277] an LDL- C level >70  mg/dL and who meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria 
will be return for Visit S2 approximately 5 weeks prior to planned randomization into the study to washout of all LDL-C-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298520] -blind (subject) PBO.  Subjects will 
return to the study site approximately [ADDRESS_364278] an LDL -C level ≥100 mg/dL and who continue to meet the study inclusion/exclusion 
criteria  will be scheduled for their first treatment visit.  
Subjects will report to the study site for the first treatment visit (Visit  T1/Day  1) after a minimum 
10-hour fast.  Subjects who continue to meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in 
a 1:1:1  ratio to receive either FDC (n  = 56), EZE (n  = 56), or PBO (n = 56) once daily  in the morning for 
12 weeks.  Randomized subjects will return for clinic visits at Week  4 (Visit T2) and Week  12 
(Visit T3/End of Study [EOS]). Subjects who withdraw from investigational medicinal product (IMP) 
treatment will be asked to continue to be followed for safety and efficacy using the protocol- specified 
visit schedule and procedures.  
Subjects will report to each of the study visits after a minimum [ADDRESS_364279] been completed.  All other doses 
of IMP will be self -admini stered by [CONTACT_748]; the last dose will be taken the day prior to the final 
clinical visit (Visit T3/EOS).   
Study Population:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_364280] 6  months and who meet 
the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.

5.1. Lipid -Regulating Drugs and Cardiovascular Disease  
Bempedoic acid ( BA; ETC -1002) is an inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate- citrate lyase (ACL) 
(adenosine triphosphate [ATP] citrate lyase), an enzyme upstream of 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl 
coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathwa y.  It is an oral, 
first-in-class small molecule designed to lower  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C) 
levels in patients with high cardiovascular risk who are unable to meet their treatment goals with 
currently available lipid -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Bempedoic acid is being evaluated as an adjunct to 
diet alone or in combination with other lipid- lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298525]/or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy and who require additional lowering of LDL- C or 
who are unable to tolerate effective doses of currently available statin formulations.  
Elevated  LDL-C level  is a major modifiable risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis 
and atherosclerotic cardiovascular  diseases .1  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_298526], cardiovascular  disease is the number 1 cause of death globally.2  An 
estimated 17.7 million people died from cardiovascular  diseases in 2015, representing 31% of all 
deaths worldwide.  Of these deaths, an estimated 7.4 million wer e due to coronary heart di sease,  
and 6.7 million were due to stroke.2  Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death 
among Americans, Europeans, and around the world.  The Global Burden of Disease study estimated that 29.6% of all deaths (
approximately 15.6 million deaths) were caused by 
[CONTACT_298542] 2010, more than all communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
disorders combined, and double the number of deaths caused by [CONTACT_282628].3  Based on 2011 death 
rate data, more than 2150 Americans die from cardiovascular  diseases daily, for an average of 
1 death every 40 seconds.  Approximately 155,000 Americans who die from cardiovascular  
disease are younger than 65 years of age.  In 2011, 34% of deaths due to cardiovascular  disease 
occurred prior to the age of 75 years, less than the current 78.7- year average life expectancy .4 
LDL-C is largely accepted as a valid surrogate endpoint of cardiovascular  events by [CONTACT_298543].5  Long -term elevations in LDL -C lead to progressive accumulation of 
atherosclerotic lesions in the walls of arteries that require long -term management.  While 
lifestyle changes are the primary intervention, these measures rarely decrease plasma LDL -C by 
>15%.  Evidence supporting LDL- C as a therapeutic target and surrogate for cardiovascular  
outcomes comes from interventional studies with LDL-C- lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], epi[INVESTIGATOR_34207], and genetic variants (both gain of function and loss of function).  Large randomized 
clinical studies aimed at lowering LDL -C show a consistent log- linear relationship between 
LDL-C reduction and cardiovascular  risk reduction, independent of the way LDL- C lowering 
was achieved based on mechanism of action .6-9  A published patient -level meta -analysis , which 
includes 26 trials and more than 160,000 participants, showed a consistent relationship between 
LDL-C reduction and cardiovascular  outcomes.7  This analysis showed that a 1 mmol/L 
reduction in LDL- C was associated with a 22%  reduction in the 5- year incidence of major 
coronary events, revascularizations, and ischemic strokes.  Intensive statin therapy relative to

Confidential Page 20 of 101  low/moderate intensity statin treatment produces greater benefit in patients at high 
cardiovascular  risk.10 
Unfortunately, some patients with elevated LDL-C are unable to take high intensity statins due to 
dosing limits based on comorbidities, contraindications, and/or tolerance.11  Nonstatin  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298527]- IT 
trial, which added ezetimibe (EZE)  to statin therapy .12  Bempedoic acid and EZE are oral 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298528]-C via up-regulation of LDL 
receptors.  Coadministration  of BA and EZE may, therefore, result in further reductions in 
LDL-C than can be obtained with either agent alone, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a therapeutic benefit to 
patients who do not achieve optimal lowering of LDL- C with either treatment alone.  
The availabilit y of a fixed -dose combination (FDC) tablet of BA  180 mg and EZE  10 mg (the 
recommended dose of each agent) would provide convenience to patients over coadministration of individual tablets, thereby [CONTACT_298544].  This 12- week study will e valuate 
the efficacy and safety of FDC compared to EZE 10 mg or placebo (PBO) in subjects with type 2 
diabetes (T2D) and elevated LDL -C levels.   
5.1.1. Overview of Bempedoic Acid  
A complete summary of the available and nonclinical and clinical experience with BA is 
provided in the Investigator ’s Brochure.
[ADDRESS_364307].  Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires 
activation in liver to ETC -1002- coenzyme A (ETC -1002-CoA), which mediates c ompetitive 
inhibition of ACL.  Inhibition of ACL by [CONTACT_76753]-1002- CoA decreases cholesterol synthesis in the 
liver leading to increased low -density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression and LDL particle 
clearance from the blood.  Therefore, inhibition of ACL b y ETC -1002- CoA decreases LDL -C 
via the same pathway as HMG -CoA reductase inhibition by [CONTACT_101818].  
An important differentiating feature of BA is that, unlike statins, it does not inhibit cholesterol 
synthesis in skeletal muscle.  The enzyme required to convert BA to ETC -1002-CoA is not 
present in skeletal muscle.   Therefore, BA is not anticipated to mediate the adverse effects 
associated with inhibition of biological intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in skel etal muscle; however, the safety of BA and its metabolites regarding human skeletal 
muscle is not yet established.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  2, randomized, double-blind, parallel -group, multicenter study of BA 180 mg and 
EZE 10 mg  FDC  versus PBO and EZE 10 mg administered for 12 weeks  in subjects with T2D 
and elevated LDL -C.  An overview of the study design is presented in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Overview of Study Design 
 
T2D= type 2 diabetes; HbA1c = hemoglobin A1c; LDL -C = low -density lipoprotein cholesterol; LMT = lipid -
modifying therapy; BA = bempedoic acid; EZE = ezetimibe; FDC = fixed dose combination.  
Subjects with a history of T2D for at least 6  months will be screened for eligibility at an initial 
screening visit  (Visit S1), which will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_364309] an LDL- C level >70 mg/dL and who meet all 
other inclusion/exclusion criteria will be return for Visit S2 approximately 5 weeks prior to 
planned randomization into the study to washout of all LDL-C- lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_298529] -blind (subject) PBO .  Subjects will return to the study site approximately [ADDRESS_364310] an LDL- C level 
≥100 mg/dL and who continue to meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be scheduled 
for their first treatment visit. 
Subjects will report to the study site for the first treatment visit (Visit T1/Day  1) after a minimum 
10-hour fast.  Subjects who continue to meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive either FDC  (n = 56), EZE (n = 56), or PBO (n  = 56) once 
daily for 12 weeks .  Randomized subjects will return for clinic visits at Week  4 (Visit T2) and 
Week  12 (Visit T3/EOS).  Subjects  who withdraw from IMP treatment will be asked to continue 
to be followed for safety and efficacy using the protocol- specified visit schedule and procedures.   
Subjects  will be dispensed IMP at Visit T1 /Day [ADDRESS_364311] and without having 
taken their dose of IMP.  Study site personnel will administer the IMP on these days after blood 

Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364312] been completed.  
All other doses of IMP will be self -administered by [CONTACT_748]; the last dose will be taken the 
day prior to the final clinical visit (Visit T3/EOS) .   
7.2. Study Hypothesis  
The clinical  hypothesis for this study is that FDC  therapy with BA180 mg, EZE 10 mg will 
significantly reduce LDL -C in subjects with T2D and elevated LDL -C treated daily for 12 weeks  
versus EZE 10  mg and versus PBO . 
7.3. Rationale for Dose Selection  
The daily dose of BA (180 mg) taken  as an individual tablet or in combination with EZE in the 
FDC tablet represents the dose that is being evaluated in Phase [ADDRESS_364313] s with hypercholesterolemia.  The daily dose of EZE (10 mg) 
taken  as an individual tablet or in combination with BA in the FDC tablets represents the 
recommended therapeutic dose for this drug.  
7.4. Study Duration  
The expected study duration is approximately 126 days, including an approximate 42- day 
screening period (Visit  S1/Day  -42, followed by a 5- week single -blind PBO  run-in/lipid-
modifying therapy ( LMT ) washout period from Day -35 to Day  -1), an 84- day treatment period  
beginning at Visit T1/Day  1, and an EOS visit (Visit T3/Day  85). 
7.5. Number of Subjects 
Approximately [ADDRESS_364314] 6  months and 
who meet the inclusion and exclusion crit eria will be enrolled  and randomized in a 1:1:1  ratio to 
receive FDC (n  = 56) or EZE (n  = 56) or PBO (n  = 56). 
7.6. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study for any reason may be replaced at the discretion of 
the sponsor. 
7.7. Number of Clinical Sites  
Approximately 45 clinical sites  in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) will participate in this  study.  
Additional sites may be invited to participate to ensure study timelines are met.  
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364315] satisfy all the following criteria at Visit S1 (unless otherwise specified) for 
enrollment in the study:  
1. The subject must be willing to provide written informed consent before any study 
specific procedures are performed;  
2. The subject must be aged  18-75 years or be of legal age of majority based on regional 
law, whichever is older;  
3. The subject must have a history of T2D for 6  months or greater; and must be currently 
taking s table diabetes medication for 3  months or greater with HbA 1C between 7% and  
10% at Visit S1; 
4. The subject mus t have a fasting calculated LDL -C level >70 mg/dL at Visit S1; 
5. The subject must have a fasting calculated LDL -C level between 100 and 220 mg/dL at 
Visit S3 after washout of all LMT; 
6. The subject must clinically stable and su itable to undergo washout of all LDL-C- lowering 
drugs and nutritional supplements for 17 weeks (with potential for 1- week extension if 
repeat assessments described in the protocol are required) based on investigator assessment;  
7. The subject may be male or f emale.  Women must not be pregnant (or planning to 
become pregnant within [ADDRESS_364316] dose of IMP) or lactating and must be: 
a. Naturally postmenopausal, defined as ≥1 year without menses and either:  
i. ≥55 years old, or 
ii. <55 years old with a follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥40.0 IU/L; 
b. Surgically sterile by [CONTACT_31658], bilateral oophorectomy, and/or tubal ligation; or 
c. Willing to use [ADDRESS_364317] agrees to follow the definition of true abstinence.  The minimal 
requirement for use of acceptable contraception is from the time the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, during the study period, and for at least [ADDRESS_364318] dose of IMP.  Acceptable methods of birth control include: 
i. placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) with or without hormones, 
ii. established use of oral, implanted, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], or injectable, or hormonal method of 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation, 
iii. barrier methods, including condom or occlusive cap with spermicidal foam or 
spermicidal jelly,  
iv. vasectomized male partner who is the sole partner for the subject, or 
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364319].  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post 
ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
There are no protocol-specific birth control requirements for men who have partners that can become pregnant.  
8.2. Subject  Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria at Visit S1 (unless otherwise specified) will be excluded from the study: 
1. The subject has a body mass index (BMI) >40 kg/m2; 
2. The subject has a history of documented clinically significant cardiovascular disease including, but not limited to: 
a. myocardial infarction, severe or unstable angina pectoris, coronary angioplasty, 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292], stroke, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular event, 
symptomatic carotid artery disease, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease ; 
b. uncontrolled hypertension, defined as mean systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥100 mmHg after sitting quietly for 5  minute s; 
Note:   At the discretion of the investigator, a single repeat sitting systolic blood pressure and 
diastolic blood pressure may be obtained at another visit; the repeat values will be used to 
determine the subject’s eligibility for the study ; 
c. an arrhythm ia requiring medical intervention ; 
d. abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm ; 
e. [LOCATION_001]  Heart Association (NYHA) Class  III and  IV heart failure;

Note: At the discretion of the investigator, a repeat TG measurement may be obtained once, and the screening period will be extended for up to [ADDRESS_364320]’s eligibility for the study;  
4. The subject has a history of type 1 diabetes;  
5. The subject has uncontrolled hypothyroidism, including a value for thyroid- stimulating 
hormone (TSH) >1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN); 
6. The subject has liver disease or dysfunction, including:  
a. positive serology for hepatitis  B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis  C vi rus

randomization (at Visit T1/Day  1) or during the study; and 
• topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930].  
Short- term use of a medication for a self -limiting indication (eg, acetaminophen for a headache) 
may be authorized by [CONTACT_093].  The maximum allowable dose of acetaminophen is 
2 g/day.  The investigator must make the decision to authorize use of such a medication only after consideration of the clinical situation, the potential for masking symptoms of a more 
significa nt underlying event, and whether use of the medication will compromise the outcome or 
validity of the study. 
9.3.3. Contraception  
Women of nonchildbearing potential are not required to use contraception.  Women of 
nonchildbearing potential are defined as those wh o are naturally postmenopausal (defined as 
≥1 year w ithout menses and either a) ≥55 years old, or b) <55  years with an FSH level 
≥40.0 IU/L) and those who are surgically sterile by [CONTACT_31658], bilateral oophorectomy, and/or tubal ligation.  
Women of childbearing potential must use [ADDRESS_364324] dose of IMP.  Acceptable 
methods of birth control include:  
a. placement of an IUD with or without hormones;  
b. established use of oral, implanted, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], or injectable, or hormonal method of 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation;  
c. barrier methods, including condom or occlusive cap with spermi cidal foam or 
spermicidal jelly;  
d. vasectomized male partn er who is the sole partner for the subject; and  
e. true abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.  Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a trial, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
If a subject who is abstinent at the time the ICF is signed becomes sexually active, she must 
agree to use [ADDRESS_364325] dose on Day -1, the day prior to Visit T1.  During the Treatment P eriod, 
subjects  will receive double -blind IMP.  On  Day  1 (Visit T1), subj ects will be randomized to 
receive either FDC  or EZE or PBO , randomized 1:1:1.  Randomized assigned  blinded study drug 
will be dispensed to subjects according to the interactive web response system  (IWRS ).  During 
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364326] research organization ( CRO ), and subject  
will all be unaware of subject ’s treatment assignment.  
Blinding of treatment must be maintained for all subject s unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], the safety of the subject  may be at risk.  Only under the rarest of circumstances 
should the investigator consider breaking the blind and only when medical/supportive care 
cannot be provided without determining if the subject  is receiving active drug treatment.  In the 
event that the blind needs to be broken prior to completion of the study, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_282632].  If the blind must be broken prior to 
consultation with the Medical Monitor, contact [CONTACT_282633] [ADDRESS_364327] ’s medical record the date, time, and reason for breaking the blind, and the names of 
personnel involved. 
Post-randomization values for individual laboratory measures for L DL-C, hs- CRP , non- HDL -C, 
TC, TG, and HDL -C that may inadvertently suggest treatment assignment will not be available 
to personnel from the clinical site, the subject , the Sponsor, or the CRO.  While knowledge of 
these values does not truly ‘unblind,’ the c ollection of these lab assessments by [CONTACT_093], 
all collaborating physicians, or the subject s locally (outside the study visits) is strongly 
discouraged. Investigators should not perform testing of these analytes at the local lab during the 
conduct of the study. 
9.5. Investigational Medicinal Product  Adherence  
Subjects will be instructed to bring their IMP to each study visit beginning at Visit S3 and 
completing at Visit T3/EOS .  Compliance with dosing instructions will be assessed by [CONTACT_298547].  If the subject  has not taken 
multiple doses as instructed, the subject  will be queried for a reason, findings wil l be 
documented, and the subject will be counseled on the importance of carefully following all 
dosing instructions. Factors contributing to poor adherence will be determined and, if possible, 
remedied. Subjects demonstrating poor adherence during the Treatment Period will continue to 
be counseled on the importance of carefully following all dosing instructions, but will not be 
removed from the study. 
9.6. Overdose  
There is no specific antidote for an overdose of BA .  Management of an overdose should be 
focused on the treatment of symptoms.  These symptoms should be managed according to current standards of care with appropriate supportive measures.  Discontinuation of study drug 
should also be considered, as per medical judgement. 
Ezetimibe has been generally well tolerated in clinical trials in which healthy subjects (N  = 15) 
received 50  mg/day  of EZE for 14  days, subjects with primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (N  = 18) received 
40 mg/day of EZE for up to 56 days, and subjects with homozygous sitosterolemia (N = 27) 
received 40  mg/day of EZE for up to [ADDRESS_364328] with homozygous

lock and key, with access limited to those authorized by [CONTACT_093], and will be managed according  to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations concerning the storage and 
administration of investigational drugs.  
Additional information regarding packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution is provided in the pharmacy manual . 
10.2. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
The dose of IMP will be administered to the subjects at the study site at each of the study vi sits.  
The first dose of single -blind  PBO will be taken during Visit S2.  Subsequent doses will be self-
administered once daily by [CONTACT_298548] -1 (the day prior to Visit T1).  Double-blind IMP will be taken at 
Visit T1/Day  [ADDRESS_364330] dose of IMP will be taken on the morning of the day prior to Visit T3 /EOS ). 
Subjects will be instructed on the importance of maintaining 24-hour intervals between doses.  If 
the daily dose of IMP is not taken at the usual time due to unforeseen circumstances, the subject 
may t ake the dose as soon as possible after the target time but no later than noon.  If the daily 
dose is not taken by [CONTACT_18828], the subject will be instructed to skip the dose on that day and to 
resume dosing on schedule the next day. 
10.3. Investigation al Medicinal Product Accountability, Handling and 
Disposal  
The Principal I nvestigator must maintain accurate records of the receipt of all study medication 
shipped by [CONTACT_456]/sponsor representative and the disposition of that study medication. The 
Princi pal Investigator will ensure that all IMP is stored in a secured area, under recommended 
storage conditions  
 in accordance with applicabl e regu latory 
requirements for investigational drugs.  Access to IMP will be limited to those clinical site 
personnel authorized by [CONTACT_737].   
Upon comple
tion or termination of the study, all used and unused IMP ( FDC, EZE , and PBO ) 
will be returned  to the sponsor (or designee) for destruction or disposed of by [CONTACT_3452], per 

Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364331] comply with applicable regulations, local 
law, and guidelines, and should include: 
• amount received/placed in storage area;  
• amount currently in storage area; 
• label identification or batch number; 
• dates and initials of person responsible for product inventory (including 
entry/movement/disposition); 
• date and amount dispensed to each subject, including unique subject identifier; 
• data returned by [CONTACT_1130], assessment of compliance, and relevant documentation of discrepancies ; 
• nonstudy disposition (eg, lost, broken, wasted); and  
• amount returned to sponsor/sponsor designee. 
The sponsor will provide forms to facilitate inventory control if the staff at the investigational 
site does not have an established quality system that meets the needs of this requirement. 
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364332] identification number (subject ID) will be assigned to identify each subject 
throughout the study and will be entered on all documentation.  If a subject is not eligible to receive treatment or discontinues from the study, that subject’s identification number cannot be 
assigned to another subject.  Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially. 
11.3. Rescreening  
Subject s who are screening failures due to stability requirements for a condition or concurrent 
medication or other reason may be considered for rescreening after consultation with the Sponsor (or designee).  If rescreened, these subjects  must also be re- consented  and screening procedures 
must be repeated.   If a subject  is a screen failure, or if a subject  discontinues from the study, their 
subject  ID number will not be assigned to another subject .  Rescreened subjects will be assigned 
a new subject ID number. 
11.4. Procedures and Schedule of Assessments 
The study is comprised of two distinct periods: the Screening and Run-in Period and the 
Treatment Period. The schedule of study events is provided in Appendix 1. However , a subject 
can be seen at any time for reasons of safety.  
All relevant data will be captured on electronic case report forms (eCRFs) according to the eCRF 
completion guidelines. 
11.5. General Visit Guid elines

11.8.1. Early Withdrawal f rom Study  
Subjects must re main in the study through Week  12 (Visit T3/Day  85 ± 3) to be considered as 
having completed the study.  Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will be asked to 
continue to be followed for safety, as outlined in Appendix 1. 
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364345] whose health or 
well-being may be threatened by [CONTACT_298551].  Such subjects should be 
withdrawn from the study and should not be continued under a modified regimen. 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study may not re-enter the study.  The reasons for study 
withdrawal may include:  
• Adverse event ; 
• Subject withdrawal of consent; 
• Failure to comply with the protocol; 
• Refusal to take IMP as indicated by [CONTACT_760]; 
• Illness, condition, or procedural complication that affects the subject’s ability to participate in the study or that requires prohibited medication ; 
• Sponsor or investigator terminates the study; 
• In the investigator’s judgment, it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue participation in the study ; 
• Other (specify) . 
If a subject is lost to follow -up, study site personnel must make reasonable efforts to contact [CONTACT_298552]/w ithdrawal.  The measures that are taken to 
follow-up must be documented.   
11.8.2. Procedures for Early Withdrawal  
If a subject withdraws or is removed from the study for any reason, the subject should complete 
an End of Study visit.  Reason for withdrawal, date of the discontinuation, and date of the last 
dose of study drug should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Additionally, the discontinuation visit date must be registered in IWRS.  Study drug assigned to the withdrawn 
subject  may not be assigned to another subject. 
All effort should be made to have each subject complete all study visits on schedule according to 
the protocol.  Accommodations for early or late visits in special circumstances will be considered 
by [CONTACT_282640].  Written notice (regardless of cause) is to be 
provided within 48 hours of the withdrawal to the Sponsor personnel or the Medical Monitor.  At the time of discontinuation, every effort should be made to ensure all relevant procedures and

13.6.3. General Monitoring and Management of Abnormal Clinical Laboratory Values 
The investigator will review the results of all laboratory tests as they become available and will sign and date the report to document their r eview.  The investigator will ascertain if any 
laboratory value is abnormal or represents a clinically significant change from baseline for the 
individual subject , with baseline defined as the last value or observation before the first dose of 
IMP.  The in vestigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the 
results of the original laboratory test.  
If a laboratory value is determined to be an abnormal and clinically significant change from 
baseline for the subject , the investig ator will determine if it qualifies as an AE (as described 
below), and if yes, an appropriate eCRF will be completed.  All clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities that occur  during the study that were not present at baseline should be followed 
and evaluated with additional tests , if necessary, until diagnosis of the underlying cause or 
resolution.  Specific monitoring and management guidelines for laboratories of special interest are outlined in the sections below.

Confidential Page 54 of 101  An abnormal laboratory value that is not already associated with an AE is to be recorded as an 
AE only if any one of the following criteria is met: 
• an action is taken with the  imp because of the abnormality;  
• intervention for management of the abnormality is required; or 
• the abnormality be deemed clinically  significant by [CONTACT_093]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Liver Function Tests 
If a subject  has a new value >3  × ULN for serum ALT and/or AST at any time after 
randomization, the subject  will undergo a repeat confirmatory liver function test (LFT) 
assessment as soon as is reasonably possible but preferably within 3 to 7 days after the laboratory 
result  is available.  
Repeat LFT assessment will include the following: (1)  measurement of serum ALT, AST, 
alkaline phosphatase, TB , direct bilirubin , and CK; prothrombin time (PT)/international 
normalized ratio (INR) ; eosinophil count; and antihepatitis A virus (total), HBsAg (confirmation 
of screening measurement), HCV (confirmation of screening measurement), and  
anticytomegalovirus/immunoglobulin M; (2) history of concomitant medication use; (3) history 
of exposure to environmental chemical agents, including ethanol; and (4) questioning for related 
symptoms.  Additionally, further testing, such as liver ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) scanning, may be warranted to rule out additional pathology depending on clinical presentation and should be discussed with the sponsor personnel or the authorized medical 
monitor. 
• If the repeat LFT assessment confirms that the value for serum ALT and/or AST is 
>3 × ULN, consideration should be given to withdrawing the subject  and 
administering no further doses of IMP.  At the investigator’s discretion, IMP may be 
interrupted and the subject may be rechallenged with the IMP after values for the 
LFTs have returned to baseline levels.  
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms a value for serum ALT and/or AST >5 × ULN, the 
subject  will be withdrawn from IMP treatment but will be asked to continue to be 
followed for safety (as outlined in the protocol- specified visit schedule in Appendix 1 
or more frequently as determined by [CONTACT_093] ). 
• If repeat LFT assessment confirms that the value for serum ALT and/or AST level is 
>3 × ULN and the subject has any of the following findings, the subject  will be 
withdrawn from IMP treatment but will be asked  to continue to be followed for safety 
(as outlined in the protocol- specified visit schedule in Appendix 1 or more frequently 
as determined by [CONTACT_093] ): 
− TB value >2  × ULN ; 
Note: In th e case of subject s with Gilbert’s disease, TB will be fractionated and 
the determination of 2 × ULN will be based upon direct (conjugated) bilirubin. 
− INR value >1.5  × ULN (unless the subject  is on a stable dose of anticoagulation 
medication) ;

[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring and Management of Elevated Serum Creatinine Levels  
If a subject  experiences a decrease in eGFR to the level of 15 mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_364352]  will be withdrawn from IMP treatment but will be asked to 
continue to be followed for safety (as outlined in the protocol-specified visit schedule in  
Appendix 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring and Management of Changes in Hemoglobin Levels 
If a subject  experiences a decrease of >2.0  g/dL (20  g/L) from baseline in Hgb at any time after 
randomization, the subject  will undergo a repeat confirmatory hematology testing as soon as is 
reasonably possible but preferably within [ADDRESS_364353] result becomes 
available.  
Repeat hematology assessment will include the following: (1)  measurement of Hgb, hematocrit 
(Hct) , mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration 
(MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count, reticulocyte count (percent and 
absolute), RBC count, and white blood cell (WBC) count with differential (absolute values only); (2) history of concomitant medication use; and (3) questioning for related symptoms.  
Additionally, further testing may be warranted to rule out additional pathology, depending on 
clinical presentation, and should be discussed with sponsor personnel or the authorized medical monitor.  
• If a repeat assessment confirms a decrease >2.0  g/dL (20  g/L) from baseline in Hgb 
concentration , the subject should be monitored carefully during the study and return 
at 2-week intervals after stu dy completion for additional Hgb measurement s until the 
Hgb concentration returns to baseline or reaches a stable level.  
• If a repeat assessment confirms a value <8  g/dL (80  g/L)  for Hgb, the subject  will b e 
withdrawn from IMP treatment.  The subject  will return at 1 -week  intervals after 
withdrawal of IMP treatment for additional Hgb  measurement s until Hgb 
concentration returns to baseline or reaches a satisfactory conclusion.  
• Subjects who are withdrawn from IMP treatment due to decreases in Hgb 
concentration will be asked  to continue to be followed for safety (as outlined in the 
protocol- specified visit schedule in Appendix 1). 
The investigator may choose to consult with a specialist at any time to further evaluate the cause 
of the alteration in  hemoglobin.

• If the repeat CK assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent 
trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality (value >5 × ULN ), the 
subject  should, if asymptomatic,  receive further assessment and investigation into the 
cause.  The presence of renal injury should be assessed , and serum CK levels should 
be measured approximately weekly or more frequently , if clinically indicated , until 
resolution.  If serum CK levels continue to rise, treatment with the IMP should be 
discontinued. 
• If symptomatic , the following steps should be completed: 
− Hold dosing with the IMP; 
− Clarify the nature, duration, and intensity of muscle symptoms; 
− Review possible predisposing factors, such as unaccustomed exercise, heavy 
alcohol intake, viral illness (consider performing serology); 
− Evaluate for additional diagnoses or other conditions, which can cause myopathy , 
including muscle tenderness (by [CONTACT_153056]), weakness, rash, measurement of serum 
creatinin e level , and dipstick urinalysis with microscopy , if indicated ; 
− Obtain clinical chemistries to assess the possibility of lactic acidosis ; and  
− Follow symptoms and serum CK levels until the abnormality has resolved. 
If, based on the above evaluation, an alternative explanation is suspected, consider 
resuming IMP once the serum CK level returns to baseline levels .  If no 
alternative explanation exists, c onsider withdrawing the subject from IMP 
treatment.  
• If the repeat assessment confirms an unexplained (ie, not associated with recent trauma or physically strenuous activity) CK abnormality (serum CK value 
>10 × ULN ) even in the absence of symptoms, the subject  should be withdrawn from 
the study and given no further doses of IMP.  In all cases, signs/sym ptoms and 
laboratory evaluations, as outlined in the bulleted point above, should be evaluated. 
• If the subject  is withdrawn from IMP treatment, the subject  should be asked to 
continue to be followed for safety (as outlined in the protocol-specified visit schedule 
in Appendix 1).

13.7. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
13.7.1. Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject  administered a 
pharmaceutical product, including control, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment.  
An AE can be:  
• any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered r elated to the medicinal p roduct; 
• any new disease or exace rbation of an existing disease; 
• any deterioration in nonprotocol-required measurements of laboratory value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation from IMP; or 
• an adverse drug reaction (ADR; see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of IMP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Drug Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered an ADR.  “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility (ie,  the relationship 
cannot be ruled out). 
Bempedoic Acid 180 mg + Ezetimibe  [ADDRESS_364355] information (eg, Investigator ’s Brochure  for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an 
approved product). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs that occur from the time the ICF is signed through [ADDRESS_364356] study visit should be reported to the sponsor per Section  [IP_ADDRESS].   
Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience from the time the ICF is 
signed through [ADDRESS_364357] the ev ent on the appropriate eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_256299].  However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_093], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF.  Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transf usion) should be recorded as an AE, not the procedure.  
Any medical condition already present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an AE unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline change in severity or seriousness a t any time during the study.  In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (eg, ECG) findings that are detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as AEs.  The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific 
judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  Significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically 
significant.  Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an 
AE. 
Each AE is to be evaluat ed for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the 
investigational drug.  For each AE, the following information will be recorded: 
• description of the event (eg, headache) ; 
• date of onset; 
• date of resolution (or that the event is continuing); 
• action taken because of the event ; 
• seriousness of the event; 
• severity of the event ; 
• outcome of the event; and

Confidential Page 59 of 101  • investigator’s assessment of relationship to IMP. 
A cluster of signs and symptoms that results from a single cause should be reported as a si ngle 
AE (eg, fever, elevated WBC s, cough, abnormal chest x- ray, etc, can all be reported as 
“pneumonia”). 
The investigator will carefully evaluate the comments of the subject  and the response to 
treatment in order that he/she may judge the true nature and severity of the AE.  The question of 
the relationship of AEs to IMP administration should be determined by [CONTACT_282645].  
Additional information will be collected regarding muscle -related AEs that may include, but may 
not necessarily be limited to, a muscle -related questionnaire, with questions regarding type of 
muscle -related symptoms, location of the muscle- related AE, and potential cause of the muscle-
related AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the intensity (severity) of an AE.  The severity of 
the AE will be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe according to the following definitions: 
• Mild:  Events are usually transient and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities . 
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject  
and may interfere with daily activities.  
• Severe:  Events interrupt the subject ’s usual daily activity, are incapacitating with 
inability to do usual activities, or significantly affect clinical status and warrant intervention and/or close follow-up. 
Note :  A severe AE need not be serious and an SAE need not, by [CONTACT_108], be severe. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship of the AE to both the IMP and EZE.  The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the IMP and EZE should be described using the 
following scale:  
• Not Rela ted:  No temporal association and other etiologies are likely the cause. 
• Unlikely :  While cannot be definitively ruled as not related to IMP, a causal 
association is remote, and other etiologies are more likely to be the cause.  For 
reporting and summariza tion, events assessed as “Unlikely” to be related to IMP will 
be considered as “Not Related” to IMP for regulatory reporting purposes.  
• Possible:  Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely the cause.  However, 
involvement of the IMP cannot be excluded. 
• Probable :  Temporal association, other etiologies are possible but unlikely.  The event 
may respond if the IMP is discontinued.

Confidential Page 60 of 101  • Definite :  Established temporal association with administration of the IMP with no 
other more probable cause.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the event should resolve when the IMP is 
discontinued and recur on re- challenge.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring and Follow- up of Adverse Events  
Subject s having AEs will be monitored with relevant clinical assessments and laboratory tests, as 
determined by [CONTACT_093].  All follow -up results are to be reported to the sponsor personnel 
or the authorized medical monitor .  Any actions taken and follow up results must be recorded 
either on the appropriate page of the eCRF or in appropriate follow-up written correspondence, 
as well as in the subject ’s source documentation.  Follow-up laboratory results should be filed 
with the subject ’s source documentation. 
For all AEs that require the subject  to be discontinued from the study, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests must be repeated at appropriate intervals until final resolution, stabilization of the event(s), or until the subject  is lost to follow -up or dies. 
Subject s with AEs that are ongoing at study completion or study withdrawal must be followed 
until resolu tion or for [ADDRESS_364358].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that begin or worsen after the first dose of IMP. 
13.7.2. Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• results in death ; 
• is life threatening ; 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; or 
• is an important medical event. 
Note : Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a formal inpatient admission.  This will not include 
admissions under “23-hour Observational Status,” an emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517], or an urgent care visit and therefore such events will not be recorded as an SAE under 
this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298536].  However, unexpected complications and/or 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_282609].   Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_298537] 180 mg + Ezetimibe  10 mg

inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening , or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of suc h medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
Any clinical endpoints th at meet SAE criteria will be also reported as SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Adverse Events or Outcomes Not Qualifying as Serious Adverse 
Events  
The following are not considered SAEs and therefore do not need to be reported as such: 
• Preplanned or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , including social and/or convenience situations 
(eg, due to inclement weather). 
• Overdose of either Esperion IMP or concomitant medication unless the event meets 
SAE criteria (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  However, the event should still be captured as a 
nonserious AE on the appropriate eCRF page. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Laboratory Assessments as Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal values as defined by [CONTACT_298558].  In some cases, significant changes in lab values within the normal range will require similar judgment.  Laboratory 
abnormalities should be reported as an AE if they meet any of the following criteria: 
• Intervention is re quired to treat the abnormality . 
• Modification of study treatment is required due to the abnormality. 
• Based on the investigator’s medical judgement . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Serious Adverse Events

Within [ADDRESS_364362] update the SAE form and submit any supporting documentation (eg, subject  discharge summary or autopsy reports) to 
the safety designee.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  to Regulatory Authorities 
The sponsor (and/or designee) is responsible for submitting expedited reports of suspected and unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]RS) to the appropriate regulatory authorities.  All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with the IMP will be notified by [CONTACT_103] (or designee) of S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  S[LOCATION_003]RS must be communicated as soon as possible to the appropriate IRB by [CONTACT_093], as applicable and/or reported in accordance with local laws and regulations.  Investigators should provide written documentation of IRB notification for each 
report to the sponsor. 
Serious AEs that are anticipated to occur in this subject  population will be collected and reported 
by [CONTACT_298559] S ection  [IP_ADDRESS] .  However, these events will not be 
submitted to the regulatory authorities as expedited reports unless they meet S[LOCATION_003]R criteria.  
The events that are considered exempt from expedited reporting include the following clinical 
endpoints: 
• cardiovascular death ; 
• nonfatal myocardial infarction ; 
• nonfatal stroke; 
• unstable angina requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
• coronary revascularization ; 
• heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; and  
• noncoronary arterial revascularization . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting of Subject  Death  
The death of any subject  during the study or within the 30-day follow-up period after they have 
completed the study (regardless of the cause) must be reported as detailed above.

14.1. General Considerations  
The analyses described in this section will be performed as further outlined in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan, which will be finalized before the end of the study.  The analyses specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan will supersede those specified in the protocol in the event of any 
differences between the two documents.  A copy of the Statistical Analysis Plan will be included 
as an appendix in the clinical study report for this protocol. 
14.2. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of approximately 56 subjects per treatment arm (1:1:1) in this study (168 subjects total) is selected to provide adequate power for each of the co -primary endpoi nt as well 
as the co -primary endpoint family as a whole. 
14.3. Analysis Populations  
The following analysis populations will be defined: 
• The full analysis set (FAS) will be used for the pharmacodynamic analyses and will include all randomized subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_364364] s in the FAS will be 
included in their randomized treatment group, regardless of the treatment they 
actually received . 
• Treatment Completer analysis set is a subset of full analysis set and will include 
subjects who complete 12- week treatment as indicated on the end of treatment CRF 
and have non- missing LDL -C value at Week 12 
• The safety population (SP) will include all subjects who receive at least 1  dose of 
IMP.  Subjects in the SP will be included in the treatment group that they actually 
received, regardless  of their randomized treatment.

15.1. Study Monitoring  
The sponsor (or its authorized repre sentative) has the obligation to follow this study closely to 
ensure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation ( ICH) and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidelines, national regulatory 
requirements, and the current Declaration of Helsinki throughout its duration by [CONTACT_298566]’s facilities and other communications.  
These visits will be conducted to evaluate the progress of the study, to verify that the rights and well-being of the subjects are protected, and to verify that the reported clinical study data are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  This includes review of ICFs, results 
of tests performed as a requirement for participation in this study , and any other medical records 
(eg, laboratory reports, clinic notes, investigational medicinal product dispensing log, pharmacy 
records, subject sign-in sheets, subject-completed questionnaires, telephone logs) that are 
required to confirm information contained on the eCRFs. 
The monitoring strategy for the study foresees a risk-based monitoring approach, in line with the 
relevant FDA recommendations, and will be described in detail by [CONTACT_1758]- specific risk -based -

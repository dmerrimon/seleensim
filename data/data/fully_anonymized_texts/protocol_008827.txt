2 Synopsis  
Purpose  
Our overall goal is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_788363] -Emotional Learning 
(SEL) Program with novel wellness and COVID -19 safety components that are trauma -
informed and culturally -specific in a resettled refugee community.  
Objectives  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], “EMPOWER” ( Emotions Program Outside the clinic and Wellness Education 
for Refugees), we aim: 
1. To assess implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, and feasibility) of 
EMPOWER with refugee children and families during the COVID -[ADDRESS_1085546] of EMPOWER by [CONTACT_58833] (a) children’s SEL competence 
and (b) children’s and family’s COVID -19 knowledge.  
Study Population  
The study population will include  families who are connected with Elena’s Light, a trusted 
community non -profit  organization that supports refugee families in the New Haven 
region.  
Because the model of adaptation and delivery will be culturally specific for Afghan 
refugees (the majority of recent refugees in the New Haven area are from Afghanistan), 
eligible parti cipants will include Afghan refugee children, 5-[ADDRESS_1085547] 
completed ≥1 year of school in US . One parent/guardian will also be surveyed in the pre - 
and post -evaluation on Zoom.  
Number of Participants  
A total of approximately [ADDRESS_1085548] one parent/guardian from each family. This will include 50 children from 
20 family units in the intervention group and 25 children form 10 famil y units in the control 
group.   
Study Design  
The overall objective of this study is to establish and evaluate the preliminary 
efficacy and implementation of an adapted social -emotional learning (SEL) and 
Wellness Program for refugees: EMPOWER (Emotions Pro gram Outside the clinic 
with Wellness Education for Refugees). To achieve the two aims of this study, the 
study team will conduct a wait -list controlled  pi[INVESTIGATOR_788364] (a) c hildren's SEL 
competence and (b) measures of mental health, stress, quality of life and wellness 
before and after participation in the program (Aim 1). Then, the study team will 
assess the implementation of EMPOWER with refugee children by [CONTACT_788392] a summative evaluation of implementation outcomes -including 
fidelity, sustainability, and reach -in the Afghan refugee community (Aim 2).

[ADDRESS_1085554] limited access to timely diagnosis and treatment for mental 
and/or behavioral health (MBH) problems, despi[INVESTIGATOR_788365]. Children 
in immigrant families face barriers to receiving preventative MBH services and to rece iving 
timely diagnoses and treatment. A study of first point -of-contact [CONTACT_788393] -immigrant peers.1 Using data from the Nation al Survey of Children’s Health, 
we found that, among children who have an MBH diagnosis, those in immigrant families are 
also less likely to receive treatment.[ADDRESS_1085555] -
migration experiences.3–5 Additional MBH risks are related to potential toxic exposures; for 
exampl e, elevated blood lead levels are common in refugee children depending on age and 
country of origin.[ADDRESS_1085556] increased, especially  for refugee populations. Risk factors during the COVID -
19 pandemic that may exacerbate MBH concerns already faced by [CONTACT_788394], inability to social distance, and educational disruptions. Refugees are particularly 
vulnerable to exace rbations of language barriers, isolation, and economic insecurity.7–[ADDRESS_1085557] evidence supports the value of SEL curricula in multiple domains . A recent 
systematic review and meta -analysis found that, compared with control groups, children who 
participated in SEL curricula demonstrated improvement in social and emotional 
competence, behavioral self -regulation, early learning skills, and social -emotional challenge 
behaviors.12 Specifically, emotional competence —which includes the ability to identify one’s 
own feelings, to identify the feelings of others, and the skills to communicate and cope with 
emotions to guide thinking and actions —is associated with successful school and work 
performances and decreased susceptibility to disease.13–[ADDRESS_1085558] interviews with Afghan refugee parents. Fro m this community -based participatory 
research ( Rosenberg, J., Leung, J. K., Harris, K., Abdullah, A., Rohbar, A., Brown, C., & 
Rosenthal, M. S. (2021). Recently -arrived Afghan refugee parents’ perspectives about 
parenting, education and pediatric medical a nd mental health care services. Journal of 
Immigrant and Minority Health ), we learned that many parents had not yet considered or 
reflected on MBH concerns because of higher priority concerns around safety and 
acculturation. Parents described priorities ar ound health that were related to basic safety 
after living in war -torn regions. They described an emerging support system and an 
appreciation for an engaged and connected health system but expressed little trust in 
discussing MBH concerns with medical prov iders. Based on parents’ identified needs and 
opportunities for engagement, we sought opportunities for education, prevention, and 
engagement with community members.  
In summer 2020, we developed and launched an adaptation of an SEL curriculum, 
“EMPOWER,” with [ADDRESS_1085559], determine program feasibility, 
                                                                                                                       HIC # [PHONE_16437]

preferred languages. We analyzed the program after its conclusion by [CONTACT_788396]. Findings from this analysis, which  were 
recently published in Health Education Behavior  (Rosenberg, J., McDonough Ryan, P., 
O’Brien, C., Ganjavi, F., & Sharifi, M. (2021). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_788366] –

After the program, all [ADDRESS_1085560] ed in re-enrollment, and that they would recommend 
EMPOWER to a peer. However, social desirability bias, a small sample, and the lack of a

11 2 Rationale/Significance  
2.[ADDRESS_1085561] adapted curricula for refugee populations nor included COVID -19 pandemic safety . In 
this proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_788367], we aim to improve the health and wellbeing of resettled 
Afghan refugee children by [CONTACT_788397], which is augmented with novel, trauma -informed and culturally -specific 
wellness and safety elements related to the COVID -19 pandemic and its aftermath.  
 
2.2 Risks  
Risks of the intervention and evaluations may include discomfort or confusion with some of 
the information provided and/or questions asked. Resources will be available for participants 
and family members should any discomfort arise, including direct connections with care 
coordinators, patient navigators, and mental and medical health providers. COVID -[ADDRESS_1085562] in line with CDC guidelines, with symptom screening, physical 
distancing, masking, outdoor -only activities, and empha sis on hygiene and cleanliness, so 
there is minimal risk of COVID -19 exposure based upon these safety measures.  
 
2.3 Anticipated Benefits  
Benefits for the participants will include access to COVID -19 safety information, access to 
information about social -emotional learning, and nutrition and exercise information, which 
can all contribute to health and wellness. Participants will also receive course materials 
(yoga mats, art materials, cleaning supplies) and gift car ds. For society and/or science, th e 
benefits will include information about the preliminary efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of 
social -emotional learning and wellness curricula for refugees.

3 Study Purpose and Objectives  
3.1 Purpose  
Our overall goal is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_788363] -Emotional Learning (SEL) 
Program with novel wellness and COVID -19 safety components that are trauma -informed 
and culturally -specific in a resettled refugee community. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], “EMPOWER” ( Emotions 
Program Outside the clinic and Wellness Education for Refugees), we aim:  
 
3.2 Hypothesis  
The major question that guides this research is: can an adaptation of an established Social -
Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum effectively improve Social -Emotional wellness for 
refugee children and their  families?  
 
We hypothesize that participation in this program will (a) improve children’s SEL competence 
and (b) lessen stress and improve quality of life for refugee families.  
 
3.3 Objectives  
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], “EMPOWER” ( Emotions Program Outside the clinic and Wellness Education for 
Refugees), we aim:  
1. To assess implementation outcomes (adoption, acceptability, and feasibility) of 
EMPOWER with refugee children and families during the COVID -[ADDRESS_1085563] of EMPOWER by [CONTACT_58833] (a) children’s SEL 
competence and (b) children’s and family’s COVID -19 knowledge.  
 
  
                                                                                                                       HIC # [PHONE_16437]   
 
13 4 Study Design  
Overall Approach:  
The overall objective of this study is to establish and evaluate the preliminary efficacy and 
implementation of an adapted social -emotional learning (SEL) and Wellness Program for 
refugees: EMPOWER (Emotions Program Outside the clinic with Wellness Education for 
Refugees). We will achi eve these goals through two aims. We will conduct a wait -list 
controlled,pi[INVESTIGATOR_788368] (a) children’s SEL competence and (b) measures of mental health, 
stress, quality of l ife and wellness before and after participation in the program (Aim 1). 
Then, we will assess the implementation of EMPOWER with refugee children by [CONTACT_788398] a summative evaluation of implementation outcomes —including fidelity, 
sustain ability, and reach —in the Afghan refugee community (Aim 2).  
 
EMPOWER Curriculum:  
EMPOWER is an adapted SEL and wellness education initiative delivered to a community of 
refugee families that was developed through a pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_788369] 2020.  Unlike traditional school -based SEL curricula, EMPOWER partner s with 
community organizations to provide translated and trauma -informed wellness education to 
family units. The program combines in -person (socially distant) and remote delivery of 
culturally -informed  physical, emotional, and medical wellness tools adapte d from evidenced -
based behavioral medicine, refugee trauma and recovery, and community health research. 
Over two weeks, enrollees participate in six in-person sessions (two hours each). They also 
complete eight, one -hour, weekly Zoom sessions during and be yond the in -person 
curriculum. At -home Zoom technical support is provided as needed. Each family unit is 
guided through in -person and online components by a facilitator. The EMPOWER curriculum 
focuses on the core competency of self -awareness, a core elemen t of emotional 
competence, from the Collaboration for Academic Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL) 
framework. Facilitators include interns, health -providers, and community partners. We have 
published a detailed EMPOWER manual, which we will iteratively m odify, through an online 
request portal.   
Intervention:   
We will use implementation science methods and apply an Intervention Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_788370], acceptability, and feasibility  of EMPOWER.    The program 
will include virtual and in -person SEL, COVID -19 safety, and physical activity instructions. 
Program administrators will also respond t o and track disclosure of and/or identification of 
mental health, medical, or other needs.  
Data Collection and Measures:  
We will conduct a mixed methods evaluation —using concurrent qualitative and quantitative 
data collection and merged analysis —to survey  parents and their children (over Zoom) at 
early and late time -points of their involvement in the program. Interview guides and survey 

                                                                                                                       HIC # [PHONE_16437]   
 
14 tools will be developed with community partners and will be based upon previously -studied 
measures used for war -affected families. In addition to demographic covariates (age, 
gender, languages, years in the US), we will collect data and assess implementation 
outcomes as well as primary and secondary outcome measures. Questions will be asked to 
parents about each child and to  the children directly.  
Implementation measures (Aim 1) will include assessment of adoption, acceptability, and 
feasibility through parent and stakeholder evaluations and through rates of attrition. 
Outcome measures (Aim 2) will include (a) COVID -19 knowle dge, measured via an 
established COVID -19 knowledge assessment and (b) children’s SEL competence, 
measured by [CONTACT_788399] -Mood Scale. Secondary outcomes and covariates will include 
the validated measures that may modify intervention effectiveness. While  timeline and small 
sample size in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_788371] -post differences in quality of life 
or behavioral health concerns such as stress or depressive symptoms, we will examine 
patterns in secondary outcomes to form hypotheses in preparation for future, larger -scale 
trials.  
 
Analysis Plan:  
In this mixed methods study, we will perform concurrent qualitative and quantitative data 
collection and subsequent merged analysis. We will analyze quantitative data in Stata, with 
statistic al support from a biostatistician. Qualitative responses will be transcribed and coded 
by [CONTACT_788400]. We will identify emerging themes using 
the constant comparative method. A repeated measures linear mixed model approach w ill 
be used for analysis. The primary analyses will compare changes in COVID -[ADDRESS_1085564] control groups. Similar analyses will be measured for secondary outc omes.

4.2 Outcome Variables /Endpoints  
Outcomes of interest (in Table 1,  below) will include (1) implementation outcomes (feasibility, 
attrition, acceptability) and (2) primary preliminary efficacy outcome measures (COVID -19 
knowledge and Social -Emotional Competence). Additional exploratory outcomes of interest 
are related to quality of life, stress, and behavioral health. Measures were chosen based 
upon previously validated measures that can be adapted to other cultures and languages.  
 
4.2.1  Primary Outcome Variables /Endpoints  
As outlined in Table 1, below, primary implementation ou tcome measures will include 
feasibility, attrition, and parent and child acceptability, measured via post -intervention 
qualitative evaluations of parents.  
Primary preliminary efficacy measures will include COVID -19 knowledge and Social -
Emotional Competenc e, measured via evaluation of symptoms and the Trait Meta -Mood 
Scale, respectively.  
 
4.2.2  Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables /Endpoints  (if applicable)  
Secondary outcomes will be measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, 
Perceived Stress Scale, and the Afghan Symptom  Checklist.

Participants will include families who are connected with Elena’s Light, a trusted community 
non-profit organization that supports refugee families in the New Haven region.  
Waitlist control participants will receive written, translated program materials a nd begin the 
formal curriculum after the intervention group.  
 
5.2 Number of Participants  
We will recruit a total of 75 children from a total of approximately 30 family units.  
After recruitment, we will assign participants to an intervention group (50 children  from 20 
family units) and a wait -list control group (25 children from 10 family units) and will stagger 
administration of the EMPOWER curriculum to the two groups.  
 
5.3 Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility will be determined in partnership with our community part ner, Elena’s Light, with 
approval by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_788372].  
• Because we are recruiting by [CONTACT_788401], we will allow a wide age range of children, 
from 5-15 years old.  
• The model of adaptation and delivery will be culturally specific for Afg han refugees 
(the majority of recent refugees in the New Haven area are from Afghanistan).  
• Thus, eligible participants will include:

18 6 Study Methods/ Procedures  
6.1 Study Procedure s 
EMPOWER Curriculum:  EMPOWER is an adapted SEL and wellness education initiative 
delivered to a community of refugee families that 
was developed through a pre -pi[INVESTIGATOR_788377] 2020.  Unlike 
traditional school -based SEL curricula, 
EMPOWER partner s with community 
organizations to provide translated and trauma -
informed wellness education to family units. The 
program combines in -person (socially distant) and 
remote delivery of culturally -informed  physical, 
emotional, and medical wellness tools adapte d 
from evidenced -based behavioral medicine, 
refugee trauma and recovery, and community 
health research (Table 2). Over two weeks, 
enrollees participate in six in-person sessions (two 
hours each). They also complete four, one -hour, 
weekly Zoom sessions duri ng and beyond the in -
person curriculum. At -home Zoom technical 
support is provided as needed. Each family unit is 
guided through in -person and online components 
by a facilitator. The EMPOWER curriculum focuses on the core competency of self -
awareness, a co re element of emotional competence, from the Collaboration for Academic 
Social and Emotional Learning (CASEL) framework.[ADDRESS_1085568] portal.24 
Intervention:  We will use implementation science methods and apply an Intervention  
Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_788378], acceptability, and feasibility  of 
EMPOWER.18 The program w ill include virtual and in -person SEL, COVID -19 safety, and 
physical activity instructions. Program administrators will also respond to and track 
disclosure of and/or identification of mental health, medical, or other needs.  
Data Collection and Measures: We will conduct a mixed methods evaluation —using 
concurrent qualitative and quantitative data collection and merged analysis25—to survey 
parents and their children (over Zoom) at early and late time -points of their involvement in 
the program. Interview guides and survey tools will be developed with community partners 
and will be based upon previously -studied measu res used for war -affected families.26 In 
addition to demographic covariates (age, gender, languages, years in the US), we will collect 
data and assess implementation outcomes as well as primary and se condary outcome 
measures (Table 1). Questions will be asked to parents about each child and to the children 
directly.  
Implementation measures (Aim 1) will include assessment of adoption, acceptability, and 
feasibility through parent and stakeholder evaluat ions and through rates of attrition. 
Outcome measures (Aim 2) will include (a) COVID -19 knowledge, measured via an 
established COVID -19 knowledge assessment17 and (b) children’s SEL competence, 
measured by [CONTACT_788399] -Mood Scale.[ADDRESS_1085569] 
differences in quality of life or behavio ral health concerns such as stress or depressive 
symptoms, we will examine patterns in secondary outcomes to form hypotheses in 
preparation for future, larger -scale trials.  Table 2. EMPOWER Curricular Components

7.2 Planned Analyses  
In this mixed methods study, we will perform concurrent qualitative and quantitative data 
collection and subsequent merged analysis. We will analyze quantitative data in Stata,29 with 
statistical support from a biostatistician. Qualitative responses will be transcribed and coded 
by [CONTACT_788406]®. We will identify emerging themes using 
the constant comparative method. A repeated measures linear mixed model approach will 
be used for analysis. The primary analyses will compare changes in COVID -[ADDRESS_1085574] control groups. Similar analyses will be measured for secondary outcomes.  
 
7.2.1  Secondary Objective Analyses (if applicable)

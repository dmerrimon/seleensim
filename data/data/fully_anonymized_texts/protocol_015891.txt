Mechanical valves are generally chosen over bioprosthesic valves when a very small size is 
required because they exhibit better hemodynamic characteristics than bioprostheses.5   Valve 
replacement with allografts and xenografts are reported to show po or durability in pediatric 
patients.5   In addition, the rate of premature calcification observed with bioprostheses appears 
to be high in this population.2,7,8,11

 6 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 
6.1 Statistical Analysis and Reporting  
 Kaplan -Meier adverse event rates with 95% confidence intervals and early rates will be 
calculated for all safety and survival endpoints.   
 
 Hemodynamic function will also be evaluated at each visit for each of the following variables : 
• Mean pressure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Peak pressure gradients  across the mitral valve  
• Cardiac output  
• Cardiac index  
• Valvular regurgitation  (and the site, as appropriate)

7.2 Potential Risks  
 
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Pa ge 9 of 42 Dec. 12, 2018  
 
Potential risks of receiving a mechanical mitral valve include:  
• The need for a second valve replacement due to either dehiscence, valve failure or 
malfunction, development of mitral stenosis, unacceptable hemodynamic status or 
eventual somatic outgrowth.  
• Heart failure requiring cardiac transplant.  
• Cardiac arrhythmia with or without the need of pacemaker implantation.  
• Hemolysis potentially resulting in anemia with or without splenomegaly and/or 
development of cholelithiasis.  
• Infection including but not limited to endocarditis, myocarditis, cellulitis and/or 
septicemia . 
• Thromboembolism or hemorrhage causing stroke, myocardial infarction or other significant impairment.  
• Obstruction or distortion of adjacent cardiac structures.  
 
All of the identified risks have the potential to result in death.  The mortality rate reporte d for 
mitral valve replacement in the pediatric population is highly variable and ranges between 
approximately 5 and 30%.
3,7,12- 15    
 
7.3 Risk Minimization  
 
Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_170837] s that:  
• Have experience implanting mechanical mitral valves in patients under the age of 
five. 
• Appreciate the need for closely monitoring and managing anti-coagulation regimens.  
• Are willing to partner with the subject’s personal cardiologist to ensure appropriate 
care and follow -up.

conducting any study -related testing that is not considered standard of care for valve 
procedures.  All baseline tests must occur prior to the procedure.  It is pr eferable if the tes ting is 
completed no more than one  month prior to the procedure date.    
 
The following baseline assessments are required:  
• Medical h istory    
• Physical exam  
• Transthoracic echocardiogram  
• Blood collection (Plasma free hemoglobin for Hemolysis evaluation). Spot urine urobilinogen is an acceptable alternative if a non- hemolyzed blood sample cannot 
be obtained.

 For Adjunctive EU/CU S ubjects, baseline assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment . 
 9.4 Procedure  
 
The 15mm MHV is implanted surgically  pursuant to the Instructions for Use .   
 
The following assessments are required at the time of the procedure:  
• Anti coagula nt/antiplatelet  medication collection  
• Adverse event collection  
 For Adjunctive EU/CU S ubjects, procedure assessments should be collected from subject’s 
medical records , when available,  for procedures  conducted prior to enrollment . 
 
9.[ADDRESS_200015] should be discontinued from 
the study and followed per the physician’s standard of care.  
 As there are insufficient data to indicate otherwise, the sponsor recommends that subjects 
implanted with the 15mm MHV be routinely maintained on anticoagulants unless, for other reasons, it is not medically indicated.   
 
The following assessments are required after the  enrolled  subject leaves the surgical suite  with 
the valve implanted. These assessments must be completed at least 24 hours after the 
procedure:   
• Physical exam

molecular weight heparin may be ass ociated with an increased rate of complications  based on 
input from HALO IDE investigators . 
 In patients receiving warfarin, the INR should be monitored daily until therapeutic levels are achieved, and then may be decreased in frequency when stable with a minimum of monthly 
testing.  The INR should be tested whenever there is illness or with any changes in medication 
or diet.

Investigators should inform cardiologists of all required follow -up tests prior to the visit and 
every effort should be made to obtain complete tests results with all required data points after 
the visit occurs.  Protocol deviations wi ll be required for all missed testing (refer to section 
17.2.5 Protocol Compliance).  
 
The following assessments are required at follow -up visits at the intervals noted on the 
assessment schedule in section 9.[ADDRESS_200018] the valve implanted:

Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) examinations are required for each subject at baseline, 
post -procedure, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for as long as the valve 
remains implanted.   
 
The study specifies TTE rather than transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to minimize 
subject risk.  Echocardiographic data collected from TEE warranted for any other medical 
purpose is allowed.     For Adjunctive EU/CU Subjects, echocardiograms should be collected from subject’s medical 
records , when available,  for visits conducted prior to enrollment .  Additionally, 
echocardiograms should be collected even if any echocardiographic a ssessments occurred 
outside of a specified visit window as they may be used as supporting source documentation on 
the subject.  
 
CDs of the echocardiography  exams from  each required visit will be forwarded to the 
echocardiography core lab oratory (core lab)  for interpretation.  The primary responsibility  of 
the core lab is to provide consistent interpretation of TTE data across all study site s by 
[CONTACT_170839] (CRF) .   
 The sponsor will use only the measurements fr om the core lab for analysis.  If the core lab 
determines the echocardiogram is unreadable, the subject may be asked to return for another echocardiogram.

15.2.2  Reporting Valve -Related Adverse Events  
 
Safety surveillance within this trial (and the safety reporting performed by [CONTACT_093]) 
starts : 
• as soon as the subject is enrolled for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_170826] A or B . 
• as soon as the subject is enrolled for Adjunctive P rospecti ve Subjects . 
• from  the time of attempted initial  implant  (defined as the device physically 
contact[CONTACT_13742]’s cardiac anatomy)  for enrolled Adjunctive EU/CU Subjects .   
 
Safety surveillance and safety reporting will continue until the last study visit has been 
performed, or the subject is deceased, or the subject concludes participation in the trial.  
Invest igators are responsible for promptly reporting , as soon as they become aware,  all serious 
and non- serious valve -related adverse events as specified in Akins et al.25 to the sponsor by 
 
[CONTACT_170840]06404 Revision D

completing the A dverse Event  CRF. Serious adverse events should be reported as specified in 
Section 15.2.1.   Reportable events include:  
• Death  
• Endocarditis  
• Hemorrhage  (whether or not due to anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication)  
• Nonstructural dysfunction (including perivalvular leak, hemolysis, and hemolytic 
anemia)  
• Reoperation (including valve explant, not due to anatomical growth of the subject)  
• Structural valve dete rioration  
• Thromboembolism (valve -related)  
• Valv ular thrombosis  
• Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect s (UADEs)  
 
Refer to Appendix [ADDRESS_200026] that additional information such as operative notes, clinic notes, 
discharge summaries, histopathology reports, or a physician’s summary of the event be 
provided to the sponsor as supporting documentation for all reported events.    
 
15.2.[ADDRESS_200027] occurring during an investigation as soon as possible, but in no event later 
than ten (10) working days after the Investigator  first learns of the effect (21 CFR 812.150 (a) 
(1)).  
 
15.2.4  Reporting Deaths  
 
An Investigator  shall submit to the sponsor a report of any death occurring during the  study  as 
soon as possible  without undue delay .  All deaths will be reported by [CONTACT_170841] (10) working days of becoming aware of the death.  
 
 
Send all source documents to the sponsor clinical study team via email.   
 
15.[ADDRESS_200028] (DSMB)  
 An independent DSMB will be  formed to regularly review study  progress with regard to safety.  
At a minimum, the DSMB will meet semi -annually.  Members of the DSMB will have no 
affiliation with the HALO  Clinical Study .   
 
HALO Clinical Study   CL06404 Revision D  
Inve stigational Plan  Page [ADDRESS_200029] ions of the 
DSMB.  The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to:  
• Establish adverse event definitions (and refine definitions as necessary during the conduct of the clinical study ) 
• The DSMB will act as a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) to adjudicate whet her or not 
adverse  events are valve -related and determine the severity of the events  
• Review and validate the subject sample (i.e., review inclusion/exclusion deviations and other protocol deviations)  
• Provide oversight for issues affecting general subject welfare  
• Establish study termination guideline criteria  
• Recommend premature study  termination  
 At any time during the course of the study , the DSMB may offer opi[INVESTIGATOR_170827] (e.g., safety -
related protocol changes or input regarding adverse event rates associated with the investigational study ).  Additionally,  the DSMB may act as an advisory panel for questions 
regarding informed consent, subject enrollment, protocol implementation, study  endpoints, 
data discrepancies, and other issues that may present during the course of the study .  
 The DSMB will review all adverse events reported by [CONTACT_170842]: 
adverse event type, relatedness to the procedure or device (if known), and whether the event 
is anticipated or unanticipated.  Following each DSMB meeting a report will be sent to 
Investigato rs indicating the final adjudication of all adverse events reviewed during the 
meeting.  
 
In all reports to the FDA adverse events will be pulled from the DSMB adjudication unless the 
adverse event has not been adjudicated, as noted in the report.  
 
[ADDRESS_200030] information collected during the course of this study will be kept confidential  
according to applicable state and federal laws and regulations.   The FDA or other US government agencies (including regulatory agencies) and regulatory authorities in other countries may inspect and copy subject records or other information about 
subjects rel ated to this study.   
 
Any information about subjects that leaves the institution conducting the study will be modified 
to remove certain information that could identify the subject (e.g., subject’s name, age on the 
day of enrollment, address, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_170828]) and only be identifiable by a s ubject  ID code.

4. Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, Roth’s spots, and rheumatoid factor  
 
5. Microbiological evidence: positive blood culture but does not meet a major criterion as noted above (excludes single positive cultures for coagulase -negative 
staphylococci and organisms that do not cause endocarditis) or serological 
evidence of active infection with organism consistent with infective endocarditis  
   
Endocarditis meeting the Duke definitions for ‘definite’ or ‘possible’ will be reported.  
 
Positive blood cultures are not required for the diagnosis of study valve endocarditis.  Morbidit ies associated with active infection, such as valve thrombosis, thrombotic embolus, 
bleeding event, or paravalvular leak, are  included under this category , and  not counted in other 
categories  of morbidity.  
 
Hemorrhage  
 Any epi[INVESTIGATOR_170834], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], pericardiocentesis, permanent injury (e.g., vision loss) , or requires transfusion  will be reported .  
 Note: A bleeding event is reportable whether or not the subject is taking anticoagula nt or 
antiplatelet medication . 
 Note: Embolic stroke complicated by [CONTACT_170849] a neurological event under 
“embolism” and is not included as a separate bleeding event.

Nonstructural Dysfunction  
 
Any abnormality not intrinsic t o the valve itself that results  in stenosis or regurgitation of the 
study  valve or hemolysis  will be reported .  Nonstructural dysfunction refers to problems 
(exclusive of thrombosis and infection) that do not directly involve valve components yet result 
in dysfunction of a study valve , as diagnosed by [CONTACT_170850], autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
 Examples of nonstructural dysfunction include:  entrapment by [CONTACT_170851], tissue, or suture; 
paravalvular leak ; inappropriate sizing or positioning ; residual leak or obstruction after  valve 
implantation or repair ; and clinically significant intravascular hemolytic anemia.   More than 
mild recurrent or residual mitral regurgitation after surgical or percutaneous interventional 
valve procedures (coronary sinus interventions, direct reparative methods, or other methods 
aimed at achieving ventricular remodeling) is nonstructura l dysfunction, unless there is 
disruption of the valve components themselves, which would then be structural deterioration.   
 Sudden or progressive dysfunction or deterioration of the study valve may be structural, nonstructural, or both as determined by [CONTACT_170850], autopsy, or clinical investigation.  
 
Reoperation 
 
Reoperation is any operation that repairs, alters or replaces the study valve.  The reasons for 
reoperation are to be reported and may include reasons other than valve -related morbidity, 
such a s recall, excessive noise, or incidental or prophylactic removal.  
 
Thrombolytic or catheter -aided therapy of valve -related morbidity is not considered 
reoperation; however, the morbid event that prompted the intervention should be reported.  
 
Structural Valv e Deterioration  
 
Dysfunction or deterioration involving the study valve (exclusive of infection or thrombosis), as 
determined by [CONTACT_170850], autopsy, or clinical investigation will be reported .  Structural valv e 
deterioration  refers to changes intrins ic to the valve, such as wear, fracture, poppet escape, 
calcification, leaflet tear, stent creep, and suture line disruption of components (e.g., leaflets) of 
the study valve. 
 
Thromboe mbolism  
 
Any thrombo embolic event that occurs in the absence of infecti on after the immediate 
perioperative period (when anesthesia -induced unconsciousness is completely reversed)  will be 
reported as valve -related .  Thromboembolic events occurring during the procedure will be 
reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_170852].  
Subsets of thrombo embolic events are:

Neurologic :  
 
A neurologic thromboembolism is one that results in a central, new  neurological deficit , 
whether temporary or permanent and whether focal or global, that occurs after the subject 
emerges from anesthesia .  Types of neurologic events are:  
 
• Stroke:  A prolonged (>72 hours) or permanent neurologic deficit that is usually 
associated with abnormal results of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scan s.  Subjects with minimal, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], or protean symptoms that 
lead to radiographic imaging demonstrating an acute ischemic event are considered to have sustained a stroke.    
• Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):  Fully reversible symptoms of short duration.  I f 
radiographic imaging demonstrates an acute central neurologic lesion (“cerebral infarction with transient symptoms”), however, such subjects are reclassified as having sustained a stroke.  
 
Noncerebral : 
 A thromboembolism documented operatively, at autops y, or clinically that produces signs 
or symptoms attributable to complete or partial obstruction of a peripheral artery.     
 
Valv ular Thrombosis  
 Any thrombus  not caused by [CONTACT_170853], interferes with valve function,  or is sufficiently large to warrant treatment.  
Valv ular thrombosis found at autopsy in a subject  whose cause of death was not valve related 
or found at operation for an unrelated indication should also be counted as valv ular 
thrombosis.

 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease 
(Angulo, 2002; Wieckowska and Feldstein, 2005) with an estimated global prevalence  of 25% 
(Younossi et al., 2015).  The severity of NAFLD ranges from simple  hepatic steatosis to 
nona lcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and  around 7 –30% have  NASH, of which 10 –20% 
progress to liver cirrhosis, for which  the only treatment is liver transplantation  (LT) (Younossi 
et al., 2015).  
Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  is now the fastest growing and second most etiology of liver 
disease among new waitlist registrants  for LT. Simultaneously to this course, the development 
and or recurrence of NASH after LT is certain to impose significant challenges.  The genetic 
predispo sition, immunosuppressive regimen and metabolic syndrome risk factors all play a 
role in the development of NAFLD/NASH after LT. In fact, NAFLD tends to recur 90% of 
the time after LT (Bhati et al. 2017) and patients with post -LT are at much higher risk of  
metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_748085]. These 
metabolic conditions pose considerable risk to LT patients with NAFLD as these conditions 
or linked to post -LT mortality.  
Generally, c ontrol of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_748086] a nd exercise are recommended for 
treatment of patients with NAFLD, including NASH, but their long -term effectiveness is 
questionable because many patients are unable to comply with the required dietary and 
lifestyle changes (Bellentani et al., 2008 ; Musso et al., 2010). Therefore, an alternative and 
effective pharmacotherapeutic approach is needed. Moreover, a multidisciplinary approach is 
required to manage transplanted patients with NASH, which include cardiovascular medicine, 
endocrinology, surge ry, nutrition, and behavioral psychology , etc., to reduce identified risk 
factors.   
2.2 RATIONALE FOR CONDUC TING THE STUDY  
Saroglitazar magnesium  is a novel predominately PPAR  agonist and moderate PPARγ 
agonist. Pre -clinical studies with Saroglitazar  magnesium  using various animal models 
wherein, EC50 of PPARα: PPARγ  >300; favorably modulated the lipid and glucose profile.

(FA) and reduces the synthesis and secretion of TG. This, in turn, increases diversion of FA 
from peripheral tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle and fat tissue) to the liver, thereby [CONTACT_668994]. In addit ion, Saroglitazar 
magnesium  causes increased lipolysis and elimination of TG -rich particles from plasma by 
[CONTACT_748132] (LPL) and reducing production of apolipoprotein C -III (an 
inhibitor of LPL activity). Consistent with the above mechani sm, Saroglitazar magnesium  was 
also found to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol. PPARα activation by [CONTACT_748133], A -I, A-II and HDL cholesterol.  
Although Saroglitazar magnesium  is predomina ntly a PPARα agonist, it also causes activation 
of PPARγ and regulates the transcription of insulin -responsive genes involved in the control 
of glucose production, transport and utilization. Saroglitazar magnesium  increases the 
expression of numerous PPARγ -responsive genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism, including adiponectin, adipocyte fatty -acid-binding protein (aP2), LPL, fatty acid 
transport protein and fatty acid translocase (CD36). By [CONTACT_748134], Saroglitaz ar magnesium  decreases the post -prandial rise of plasma free fatty acids 
(FFA), improves post -absorptive insulin -mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output, 
reduces the metabolic burden on liver and muscle and promotes glucose utilization. Robust 
antid iabetic and insulin sensitizing effects of Saroglitazar magnesium  were observed in 
preclinical models, in which hyperglycemia and/or impaired glucose tolerance is a 
consequence of insulin resistance in target tissues.  
Peroxisome proliferator -activated rece ptors (PPARs), the largest family of nuclear receptors, 
are now a prime focus of NAFLD/NASH research. There are three subtypes, PPAR -α, γ and 
δ. Upon receptor activation, all bind the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form transcriptionally 
active heterodimers.  PPARα is primarily expressed in tissues that use fatty acids as a fuel, such 
as the liver, muscle, heart and kidneys. In contrast, PPARγ is found predominantly in adipose 
tissue where it mediates differentiation of pre -adipocytes (adipogenesis), lipid sto rage and 
insulin action.

Version No.: 7.0 
  PPARα is central to hepatic lipid homeostasis. When hepatic fatty acid levels increase, 
PPARα is activated, leading to transcription of such genes as liver fatty acid binding protein 
(LFABP), acyl -CoA oxidase (ACO), cytochrome P45 0 (CYP)  4A, microsomal triglyceride 
transfer protein (MTTP) and apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100). The net effect is catabolism and 
clearance of fatty acids. It has recently been appreciated that the liver may respond to newly 
synthesized fatty acids different ly from those 'recycled' from peripheral stores, and this 
discrimination is mediated by [CONTACT_748135]α. This may explain why PPARα 
activation does not appear to occur as an adaptive response in fatty liver disease, when it would 
be an effective  pathway to enhance insulin sensitivity and suppress inflammatory recruitment. 
Thus, while pharmacologic PPARα activation effectively 'cured' fibrosing steatohepatitis in a 
murine, dietary model, the efficacy of such agents is less clear in humans. PPARγ i s found 
predominantly in adipocytes. It has both opposite and complementary functions to PPARα. 
Thus, PPARγ activation leads to differentiation of adipocytes from pre -adipocytes in-vitro . 
This increases the lipid storage capacity of the adipose mass, and i n animals, also increases 
the number of small, insulin -sensitive adipocytes so as to improve insulin sensitivity. 
Increasingly, the importance of PPARγ is being recognized in the liver, despi[INVESTIGATOR_748087]. Steatosis is often associated with increased 
hepatocyte expression of PPARγ.  
Therefore , peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor (PPAR) agonists are known to lower 
high blood triglyceride levels (PPARα agonists) and improve insulin resistance (PPARγ 
agon ists), and may offer a potential treatment not only for patients with NAFLD or NASH but 
also for post liver transplant NAFLD/NASH.  
2.[ADDRESS_1023373] developed or are attempting to develop dual PPARα/γ agonist, 
some of which may eventually reach desirable clinical efficacy and safety end point. But if the 
agonist has higher PPARγ binding properties then several of the side effects such as edema, 
weight gain, bone effect s and cardiovascular complication s may occur. Therefore, there  has 
been an increasing interest to develop new molecular entities which can treat insulin 
resistance, lower plasma glucose in diabetic patients and improve lipid profile without weight 
gain and cardiovascular risk.

rescreening a subject. The subject will need to be rescreened under a new screening number 
and a new informed consent must  be obtained. A scre en failure occurs when a patient who 
has signed the informed consent form (ICF) does not meet all the entry criteria outlined in 
this protocol and has not been randomized or received study drug. No study procedures 
(including End -of-treatment procedures) w ill be performed for these patients. For patients 
who fail to meet the inclusion criteria or who meet 1 or more of the exclusion criteria, the PI 
(or designee) will document on a screening log the reason for the screening failure.

The patients should monitor their glucose levels as follows:  
 Fasting blood glucose should  be measured on at least two different days in a week. 
These measurements should  be done in the morning before having breakfast and when 
the patient has been fasting for a minimum of 10 hours.  
 Spontaneous measurements of blood glucose should be done in the event the patient 
suffers from suspected hypoglycemia. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_748092] (i.e. palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], tremor, diaphoresis, 
hunger and/or cognitive impairment) and instruct them on the actions to be taken in 
accordance with standard -of-care.  
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends the f ollowing treatment for 
non-severe hypoglycemia during which a patient is willing and able to consume oral 
treatment:  
1. Consume 15 -20 grams of glucose or simple carbohydrates  
2. Recheck your blood glucose after 15 minutes  
3. If hypoglycemia continues, repeat #1 & # 2 
4. Once your blood glucose returns to a normal level, consume a small snack if 
your next planned snack or meal is greater than 1 hour in the future .

measured using MRI -PDFF. Proton -density -fat-fraction technique is an MRI p rotocol that 
improves on the conventional Dixon in - and out -of phase method. PDFF uses a low flip angle 
to reduce T1 bias (By[CONTACT_93367] M et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2007). Multiple echoes per excitation are 
used to correct T2* decay (By[CONTACT_93367] M et al. 2008; Yokoo et al. 2009; Yu et al. 2007). As a

 result, the expected loss of signal with longer echo times, particularly in the presence of iron, 
is corrected. In head -to-head comparisons, PDFF quantified liver fat more accurately than 
conventional two -point Dixon MRI (Yo koo et al. 2011; Mashhood et al. 2013). In addition, 
PDFF minimizes the multifrequency interference effects of fat protons (Yokoo et al. 2009). 
PDFF has been shown to have high reproducibility at 1.5 T and 3.0 T (Kang et al. 2011). 
Studies assessing liver fat have confirmed the accuracy of PDFF using hydrogen -1 MR 
spectroscopy (H1 -MRS) (Yokoo et al. 2009; Yokoo et al. 2011; Kang et al. 2011; Noureddin 
et al. 2013) or liver histology (Idilman et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2013) as gold standard. In 
addition, PDFF  MRI technique allows fat mappi[INVESTIGATOR_668989], whereas longitudinal 
segmental changes of liver fat may be accurately determined and small differences can be 
detected (Noureddin et al. 2013). The procedure will be conducted per the site’s policies and 
SOPs for the procedure which will be followed for the study.  
6.2.2 Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP)  
CAP based on FibroScan  is a promising tool for noninvasive semiquantitative assessment of 
liver fat content  (De Ledinghen V,  2012 ). CAP measures the ultrasound attenuation at the 
center frequency of the FibroScan M probe (3.5 MHz), with values range from 100 to 400 
dB/m. Besides CAP being able to provide an instantaneous assessment of liver steatosis, some 
advantages, such as quantif icational accuracy and ease of performance (which provide for 
instantaneous results), as well as inexpensive cost and reproducibility are highlighted when 
compared with other imaging methods  (De Ledinghen V  et al, 2014 ). In a prospective study 
of 153 patie nts, the areas under the receiver operating characteristics curves of CAP for ≥5%, 
>33% and >66% steatosis were 0.79, 0.76 and 0.70, respectively  (Myers RP  et al, 2012 ).  
See below table for vibration -controlled transient elastography cutoff values for CAP

6.2.3 Magnetic Resonance Elastography ( MRE ) 
Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a dynamic elasticity imaging technique that uses 
mechanical waves to quantitatively assess the shear modulus or stiffness of tissues 
(Muthupi[INVESTIGATOR_24121]., 1995).  
The three basic steps of this MRE are i) shear waves with frequencies ranging from 50 – 500 
Hz are induced in the tissue using an external driver, ii) the waves are imaged inside the body 
using a special MRI technique and iii) the resulting data are processed to generate quantitative 
images displaying the st iffness of tissue.  The procedure will be conducted per the site’s 
policies and SOPs for the procedure which will be followed for the study.  
6.2.4 Whole Body MRI  
Body composition is linked to cardiometabolic health and will be evaluated in patients. 
Subjects will  be scanned in a research -dedicated Phillips Ingenia 3.0T Omega HP Multi -
Transmit MRI scanner using 6 -minute dual -echo Dixen Vibe protocol, providing a water and 
fat separated volumetric data set covering neck to knees. Acquired images will be analyzed 
for visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue, thigh muscle volume, and muscle fat 
infiltration in the anterior thighs. Liver fat content will be quantified via proton density fat 
fraction as published previously  (Linge et. al, 2018 ).   
6.2.[ADDRESS_1023404] (FSIVGTT ) 
The Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test assesses insulin sensitivity by a 
computed mathematical analysis of glucose and insulin dynamics. FSIVGTT consists of an 
intravenously administer ed bolus of glucose and an infusion of insulin 20 minutes after

6.2.6 Metabolic Flexibility  
Energy expenditure:  The recording of the components of energy balance, i.e. energy intake 
and expenditure is extremely important to understand the individual’s response to 
pharmacologic or lifestyle modifications interventions. Yet, estimation of energy expenditure 
by [CONTACT_748147], and food dietary recording are imprecise and subject to recall bias, respectively. 
The indirect calorimetry technique, by [CONTACT_748148] a precise 
measurement of energy expenditure; additionally, the measurement of carbon diox ide 
production provides the opportunity of measuring the respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (RQ) and in turn 
calculating the substrate utilization (carbohydrate vs. fat). Virginia Commonwealth University 
has a newly established indirect calorimeters suite with two whole  room indirect calorimeters, 
a small 4’x8’ “flex room” for short term studies and a larger 10’x10’ room, fitted with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_748097], sink, and toilet which allows long -term studies. Additionally, recent improvements in the 
data acquisition algorithm allow th e recording of acute changes in energy expenditure. By 
[CONTACT_748149], researchers have the unique opportunity to precisely measure 
the energy expenditure  in its components. Finally, by [CONTACT_748150]  (Galgani and Ravussin, 2008).  
Metabolic Flexibility : The switch from carbohydrate oxidation to lipid oxidation defined as 
a drop in RQ during an overnight fasting is one of the gold -standard measure s to assess 
metabolic flexibility. Insulin -resistant and T2DM  patients  are characterized by a metabolic 
inflexibi lity, which is associated with even worse insulin resistance, and they typi[INVESTIGATOR_748098] (higher RQ), defining metabolic inflexibility, and 
specifically metabolic inflexibility to lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. A significant change in mean [ADDRESS_1023406] improvements in metabolic flexibility, which is associated with improved 
metabolic outcomes  (Goodpaster and Sparks, 2017; Galgani et  al., 2008).

6.2.9 Appropriateness  of Measurement  
The endpoints chosen for the given study [safety  and efficacy ] are appropriate for the 
assessment of outcome of the study.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1023409] will be 
performed as medically indicated.  
If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_748099], he/she should also record 
this as an AE. If the findings contribute to a clinical diagnosis (e.g. hepatitis in case of 
increased liver enzymes), this diagnosis should be recorded as an AE. 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows:  
1. The t est result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
2. The t est result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical 
intervention, and/or  
3. The t est result leads to change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or  
4. The t est result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE , 
and/or  
5. The test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461] . 
For any abnormal test result that meets one of the above conditions except for the last 
condition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_53473] a justification in the source documentation for not 
reporting  the abnormal test finding as an AE.  
Each AE shall be evaluated for severity, seriousness, duration, resolution, action taken and its 
association with the study treatment. The participant may be withdrawn or terminated from 
the study depending on the serio usness of the AE(s).

 deviation or violation from  the protocol, considered serious, the patient may be withdrawn 
from the study  at the discretion of the Sponsor or the PI. 
7.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATION  
For the purpose of this study, no distinction will be made between Protocol Violations and 
Deviations. Deviations will be categorized as Clinical Study Report (CSR) non -reportable 
protocol deviation s and a s CSR reportable protocol deviation s. A CSR non -reportable protocol 
deviation includes any deviations that do not necessarily influence the results/outcome of 
primary endpoints or patient  safety. A CSR non -reportable protocol deviation does  not require 
immediate notification to the IEC/IRB , unless otherwis e specified by [CONTACT_8134]/IRB  requirements. 
All CSR non -reportable protocol deviations will be noted in monitoring reports and provided 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_144997] . 
A CSR reportable protocol deviation includes any violation that may influence the 
results/outcome of prim ary endpoints or patient safety. CSR reportable protocol deviations 
must be reported immediately to the IEC/IRB , as specified by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB  requirements. All 
CSR reportable protocol deviations will also be reported to the Sponsor immediately . These 
deviations will also be noted in the monitoring reports and provided to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_144997] . 
Note: Persistent non -compliance of CSR non -reportable protocol deviations may rise to the 
level of being considered  CSR reportable protocol deviations  (i.e., persist ent non -compliance 
with dosing) . 
The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at a given site in the event of monitoring 
and/or auditing findings of serious or persistent n on-compliance with the protocol, SOPs, 
GCP, and/or applicable regulatory re quirement(s) by [CONTACT_978]/institution.  In all cases of site 
closure due to protocol deviations, the IEC/IRB  and regulatory authorit ies will be informed.  
The CSR  will provide the list of protocol deviation/violations in a separate section. The result 
will be a nalysed for all participants with CSR reportable protocol deviations.  
Protocol deviation s/violation s will include but are not limited to the following : 
 Patients that did not meet entry criteria  but are enrolled into the study ; 
 Patients that received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose ; 
 Patients that received an excluded medication ; 
 Patients that met the discontinuation criteria but continued in the study ; 
 Failure to report within specified time lines of the planned visits ;

7.5 DATA MONITORING COMM ITTEE  
As per DMC charter , an independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will 
monitor the study for safety events. The DMC  will have a formal structure and will operate 
according to a previously agreed upon remit. Safety data will be reviewed regularly by a DMC . 
The DMC will meet on an ad hoc basis if there are at least 3  treatment -related AEs of CTCAE  
Grade ≥3 severity  obser ved in the study. In the event of 2 similar treatment -related AE s of 
CTCAE Grade 4 - or one treatment related AE of CTCAE Grade 5, the DMC will review the 
data and advise the Sponsor  regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_550219].  
7.6 ADJUDICATION  
An external indep endent Central Adjudication  Committee (CAC) will adjudicate serious 
adverse events (SAEs), including all deaths, that are known or suspected to be a Major Adverse 
Cardiac Events (MACE) or heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. The CAC members will be 
independent of the Sponsor, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), and the clinical study

severity rating on the appropriate AE reporting page of the patient’s eCRF. The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) (Version 4.03 or higher)  system will be 
used for reporting and grading AEs  severity of events not classified in CTCAE will be 
assessed according to the following scale:  
 Mild: Event is usually transient and easily tolerated, requiring no special treatment 
and causing no disruptio n of the patient’s normal daily activities.  
 Moderate: Event introduces a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient 
and may interfere with daily activities, but is usually improved by [CONTACT_39508]. Moderate experiences may cause s ome interference with functioning.  
 Severe: Event interrupts the patient’s normal daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Causality  
For all AEs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_748119] p rovide an assessment of causal relationship to study 
drug. The causality assessment must be recorded on the appropriate AE reporting page of the 
patient’s eCRF.

  Possibly related: Suggests that the association of the AE with the study drug is 
unknown. However, the AE is not reasonably supported /explained  by [CONTACT_100097].  
 Probably related: Suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of the AE with study 
drug administrat ion exists and, based upon the PI’s clinical experience, the 
association of the AE with study drug seems likely.

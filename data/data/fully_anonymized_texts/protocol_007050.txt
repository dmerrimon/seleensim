 3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
  
3.1. Introduction 
 
 
MydCombi (fixed combination phenylephrine 2.5%-tr opi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%) is a proprietary product administered 
via the MydCombi dispenser to facilitate accurate t opi[INVESTIGATOR_898023] a controlled quantity of 
mydriatic agents in a precise manner to maximize ther apeutic control and minimize systemic absorption and 
loss to washout.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_1258816]. MydCombi was approved in 
May 2023 for this use. 
 
As shown in Figure 2,  the Eyenovia MydCombi dispen ser is designed to deliver a finely controlled 
microdroplet spray of phenylephrine 2.5%-tropi[INVESTIGATOR_898024] e 1% ophthalmic solution with precisely defined 
volume, velocity, and geometry.1 These characteristics facilitate high-pr ecision, pi[INVESTIGATOR_401038]-generated medication 
delivery that gently coats the ocular surface.

9. STUDY METHODS 
 
9.1. Subject Informed Consent 
 
The IRB-approved study ICF must be used for administration of informed consent.   
 
The investigator or designee will explain the study purpose, procedures and responsibilities to the potential 
participant and provide sufficient opportunity to  ask questions, while allowing adequate time for 
consideration of the information provided.  Written con sent for study participation must be present prior to 
initiation of any study-specific procedure; subjects w ill be considered enrolled in the study upon their 
signature [CONTACT_75288](s).  It is the responsibility of the Investigator to complete the informed consent 
process, maintain a copy of the signed consent form in the subject’s medical records, and provide each 
subject with a copy of their fully-executed consent documents. 
 
9.2. Subject Selection and Screening Procedures 
 
Study participants will be recruited from the Investigat or’s patient population, referrals, or other outreach 
methods.  Written recruitment materials directed to poten tial study participants must be approved by [CONTACT_1201].   
 
Where possible, candidate participants may be pre-screened via review of their medical charts to evaluate 
potential eligibility based on study inclusion/exclusion cr iteria.  During the informed consent discussion, the 
potential participant’s willingness and ability to meet the follow-up requirements will be evaluated.  Those 
who elect to sign the study consent form(s) will be considered enrolled in the study and given a study 
identification code.   At/after the time of enrollment, the subject will be evaluated at the Screening Visit for 
study eligibility based on eligibility requirements established in Sections 8.1  and 8.2.  Subjects who fail to 
qualify for the study will be considered “screen fa ilures” and exited from the study.  Subjects who 
successfully complete the Screening Vi sit will continue to the Treatment portion of the visit or be scheduled 
for their Treatment Visit at which the study medication will be administered.

 Investigator decision that termination is medically indicated 
 Voluntary withdrawal from the study 
 Lost to follow-up 
 Other administrative reasons (e.g., study te rminated by [CONTACT_2728], technical problems, non-
compliance with study medication administ ration or other study requirements, etc.) 
 
Subjects who terminate due to the occurrence of an AE  will be followed until resolution or stabilization of 
the event. 
 
Subjects who exit the study due to failure to meet el igibility criteria may be replaced.  Subjects who exit the 
study prematurely for other reasons will not be repl aced.  The Sponsor (or designee) should be promptly 
notified of a subject’s early termination, and informa tion regarding the terminati on (e.g., date and reason) 
should be documented in the source records and on the Study Exit eCRF.

Consolidated Guidance.   Because of the differing sources for these definitions, some terminology; e.g., 
“adverse event”, “adverse reaction”, and “adverse experi ence”, differs.  For this study, these terms should be 
considered equivalent. 
 
10.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered 
drug-related.2    
 
10.1.2.  Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
 
Any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product administered at any dose.  A reasonable 
possibility must exist that the adverse reaction is  related to the medicinal product administered.3

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "unexpected" if it is not listed in the Package Insert 
(Appendix 2 ) or is not listed at the specificity or sev erity that has been observed; or, since an IB is not 
required, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere 
in the current application, as amended.  "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or 
suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug but ar e not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.4

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-th reatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  Life-threatening AEs do not include 
AEs or suspected adverse reactions that, had they o ccurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.6 
 
10.1.6.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
 
An AE or  suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of eith er the Investigator or Sponsor, results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
 
 Death 
 Is life-threatening7  
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity, mean ing there is a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions 
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the subject and

 The occurrence of a medical condition during the study, which was absent at baseline 
 The worsening of a baseline medical condition during the study 
 
Treatment-emergent AEs, regardless of causal relatio nship, must be assessed by [CONTACT_898053] e eCRF.  Each AE must be described as ocular or 
non-ocular along with the following information: date of  onset, date of resolution, severity, frequency of the 
event (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], intermittent, con tinuous), action taken (none, medical and/or surgical), relationship to 
study drug, and seriousness criteria .  Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE must be recorded 
on the Concomitant Medication eCRF and any surgical  intervention necessary for AE treatment must be 
recorded on the Concomitant Procedure eCRF.  If more than one distinct AE occurs, each event should be 
recorded separately. 
 
Adverse events will be documented beginning at the time of onset, and documentation must continue until

Mild Subject is aware of sign or symptom, but it is easily tolerated  
Moderate Subject experiences discomfort enough to cause interference with 
usual activity 
Severe AE is incapacitating to subject, causi ng inability to work or do usual 
activity

unlikely to be related to the study drug, it cannot be ruled out 
with certainty; and/or the event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

investigator’s becoming aware of the event.   
 
Reports should be made by [CONTACT_401074].  Information provided on the SAE eCRF should be 
supplemented with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78685], death certif icate, clinic notes from specialists evaluating the 
subject’s condition, etc. as applicable for the even t.  The urgency for reporting SAEs is 3-fold:  
 
 to facilitate discussion [and implementation, if n ecessary] by [CONTACT_401075]-up measures;  
 To facilitate Investigator reporting of unanticipated  problems involving risk to human subjects to the 
IRB/EC; and  
 To enable the Sponsor to fulfill the reporting re quirements to the appropriate regulatory authority. 
 
10.4.  Device Deficiency Reporting 
 
Any adverse event directly related to the use of th e MydCombi dispenser must be documented and reported 
per the requirements listed in CFR Part A Section 80 3.10.  Reporting to the sponsor withing 24 hours of 
learning of the event as follows: 
 
 Reports of death 
 Reports of serious injury 
 
Device malfunction not related to an individual subject or that do not result in an adverse event should be 
report to the sponsor as soon as possible and include a description of the issue. 
 
11. STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate  the safety and efficacy of one administration of 
MydCombi, Eyenovia’s fixed combination of phenyl ephrine 2.5%-tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution 
administered with MydCombi dispenser for dilation of the pupil.   Descriptive statistics will be employed to 
define the dilation curve for a single spray. 
 
11.1.  Efficacy Endpoints 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: An efficacy analysis will be conducted to characterize a single spray of 
MydCombi: 
 
The primary performance endpoint is mean change per visit in pupil diameter at 30 minutes versus baseline, 
as measured by [CONTACT_401062][INVESTIGATOR_898025].  The highly photopic condition will be 
established using a fully-charged transilluminator (muscle light) at the brightest setting.

 Additional Efficacy Analyses: 
 Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter of 6.0 mm or greater at 30 minutes 
 Proportion of eyes achieving pupil diameter of 7.0 mm or greater at 30 minutes 
 Mean change in pupil diameter at other timepoints (15, 60, 90, 150, 210 and 360 minutes) 
 Distribution of pupil diameters at 15, 30, 60, 90, 150, 210 and 360 minutes 
 Time from baseline to maximal pupil dilation 
 
No other formal analyses are planned.  
 
These additional efficacy readings will also be m easured using digital pupi[INVESTIGATOR_401029]. 
 
11.2.  Sample Size 
 
Up to [ADDRESS_1258829] provided informed consent for study particip ation will be enrolled in the study 
and a minimum of 25 subjects will be receive study drug administration at Treatment Visit with the goal of 
having 25 subjects evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint. The study’s sample size will provide data to 
generate descriptive statistics for the d ilation curve for 1 spray of MydCombi.   
 
11.3.  Safety Outcomes 
 
A safety analysis will be conducted to summarize the effects of a single spray of phenylephrine 2.5%-
tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1% ophthalmic solution for the following outcomes: 
 Slit-lamp examination findings 
 Occurrence of AEs 
 IOP measured at [ADDRESS_1258830]-administration* 
 Visual acuity changes 
 
 
11.4.  Analysis Populations 
 
Subjects who are missing efficacy assessments at any of  the time points or are otherwise unevaluable for 
efficacy considerations will not be replaced.  
 
11.4.1.  Intent to Treat Population 
 
The intent to treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who received a dose of study drug.    
 
11.4.2.  Per Protocol Population 
 
The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all ITT subjects who completed all planned assessments 
without major protocol violations.

11.5.  General Statistical Considerations 
 
Primary efficacy analyses will be conducted on the PP population. Safety analy ses will be performed using 
the safety analysis set. All primary analyses will be  performed in both eyes.  The pupil diameter 
measurement at each corresponding time point af ter administration will be characterized. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, 
standard deviation or standard error of the mean , median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical 
variables, i.e. race, sex, iris color (frequenc y and percentage) at each assessment time point.  
 
 
11.5.1.  Analysis of Primary Efficacy 
 
All time points for pupil diameter will be analyzed se parately; however, only the 30-minute time point will 
support the primary efficacy analysis.  Success is define d as drug effect resulting in ability to visualize the 
back of the eye.  A pupil size of [ADDRESS_1258832]-
dose will be summarized by [CONTACT_72067] w ith descriptive statistics.  
 
The distribution of time to maximum pupil diameter will be described by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier plots.   
 
Descriptive statistics will be employed to define the dilation curve for a single spray of MydCombi. 
 
11.5.3.  Interim Analyses 
 
No interim analyses are planned for this study. 
 
11.5.4.  Analysis of Baseline Data 
 
No separate analyses of baseline da ta are planned for this study.

measurements should be obtained at a testing dist ance of [ADDRESS_1258856] of practice.    
 
2. Pupil Diameter Measurement 
 
Pupil diameter should be measured prior to a dditional study-specified examinations using the 
Neuroptics VIP 300 pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]; the same pupi[INVESTIGATOR_898044] a given subject.  The subject should be asked to focus straight ahead at a target 
placed at [ADDRESS_1258857] period, the process will be repeated to measure pupil diameter in the other eye.   
 
3. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_898045] a fu lly-charged transillumator, or muscle light.  The 
response will be recorded on a scale ranging from 0 (non-responsive) to 3 (brisk). 
 
4. Intraocular Pressure Measurement   
 
IOP should be taken after the slit lamp examina tion using a non-contact [CONTACT_898060]. Recent tonometer calibration must be documented. 
 
The same tonometer should be used throughout the study.

 APPENDIX 5:  WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI 
 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects 
 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Hels inki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]: 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_1258861] , Republic of South Africa, October 1996 
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edin burgh, Scotland, October 2000 
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington 2002 (Not e of Clarification on paragraph 29 added) 
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added) 
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008 
 
A.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.  The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement 
of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including research on 
identifiable human material and data. The Declarati on is intended to be read as a whole and each of 
its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consider ation of all other relevant 
paragraphs. 
 
2.  Although the Declaration is addressed prim arily to physicians, the WMA encourages other 
participants in medical research involvi ng human subjects to adopt these principles. 
 
3.  It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who 
are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the 
fulfillment of this duty. 
 
4.  The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds th e physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the In ternational Code of Medical Ethics declares that, 
“A physician shall act in the patient's best  interest when providing medical care.” 
 
5.  Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human 
subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate 
access to participation in research. 
 
6.  In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research subject 
must take precedence over all other interests. 
 
7.  The primary purpose of medical research in volving human subjects is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve  preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN-MYD-TP-[ADDRESS_1258862], incentives fo r subjects and provisions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a conseque nce of participation in the research study. The 
protocol should describe arrangements for pos t-study access by [CONTACT_898062]. 
 
15. The research protocol must be submitted for c onsideration, comment, guidance and approval to a 
research ethics committee before the study begins . This committee must be independent of the 
researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence.  It must take into consideration the laws and 
regulations of the country or countries in wh ich the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms a nd standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN-MYD-TP-[ADDRESS_1258864]’s freely-given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally seek 
consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or  reuse. There may be situations where consent 
would be impossible or impractical to obtain for su ch research or would pose a threat to the validity 
of the research. In such situations the research ma y be done only after consid eration and approval of 
a research ethics committee. 
 
26. When seeking informed consent for particip ation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in  a dependent relationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the inform ed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_11274]. 
 
27. For a potential research subject who is incompeten t, the physician must seek informed consent from 
the legally authorized representative. These indivi duals must not be included in a research study 
that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the 
population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be performed with 
competent persons, and the research entails  only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed  incompetent is able to give assent to decisions 
about participation in research, the physician must s eek that assent in addition to the consent of the 
legally authorized representative. The poten tial subject’s dissent should be respected. 
 
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or  mentally incapable of giving consent, for 
example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents 
giving informed consent is a necessary charact eristic of the research population. In such 
circumstances the physician should seek inform ed consent from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study 
may proceed without informed consent provided th at the specific reasons for involving subjects 
with a condition that renders them unable to give in formed consent have been  stated in the research 
protocol and the study has been approved by a resear ch ethics committee. Consent to remain in the 
research should be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorized 
representative.

EYENOVIA CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL EYN-MYD-TP-[ADDRESS_1258865] current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances: 
 The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current proven 
intervention exists; or 
 Where for compelling and scientifically sound me thodological reasons the use of placebo is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of  an intervention and the patients who receive 
placebo or no treatment will not be subject to a ny risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme 
care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered in to the study are entitled to be informed about the 
outcome of the study and to share any benefits  that result from it, for example, access to 
interventions identified as beneficial in the st udy or to other appropriate care or benefits. 
 
34. The physician must fully inform the patient wh ich aspects of the care are related to the research. 
The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study 
must never interfere with the patient-physician relationship. 
 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interv entions do not exist or have been ineffective, the 
physician, after seeking expert advice, with in formed consent from the patient or a legally 
authorized representative, may use an unproven inte rvention if in the physician's judgment it offers 
hope of saving life, re-establishing health or allevi ating suffering. Where possible, this intervention 
should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new 
information should be recorded and, wher e appropriate, made publicly available.

Justification for the Modification
After consulting with Sinai Anesthesia Pain Service and the literature* it is clear that this was not needed. It is
 not standard to monitor these levels with infusion and previous studies were done to demonstrate that it wasn't
 necessary previously. Further, several studies have been done without monitoring the levels. The amount of

Page [ADDRESS_652952] focused their attention on maximizing the success of these
 technically difficult surgeries. However, now, with free flap reconstruction rates in excess of 95%, surgeons are
 afforded the opportunity to turn their focus toward the morbidities associated with these surgeries. While much has
 been published about donor site wound healing, pain control in the post-operative period has largely been neglected
 in the head and neck reconstruction literature. Systemic analgesia with opi[INVESTIGATOR_506100], which has
 been shown to lead to increased confusion, significantly increased length of stay and increased risk of pulmonary
 complications (Oderda et al., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_506101].). In addition, it has been shown that early mobilization and optimal wound
 care can decrease donor site morbidity.
In this study we aim to better control donor site pain utilizing local, targeted analgesia to relieve pain at the donor
 site for osseocutaneous free-flaps. To reduce confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective
 randomized placebo controlled trial wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be
 randomized to receive continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_409676] (placebo) via intraosseous catheter, which
 will be placed intraoperatively at the time of donor site closure. Patients' pain will be monitored for the first 48hrs after
 surgery. Donor site and global pain at rest will be evaluated every [ADDRESS_652953] pain assessment via a numeric pain scale (0-10). Median daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_506102].

Objectives
Research Question: Can continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506103]-operative period?
Hypothesis 1: Continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506104]-operative period
Hypothesis 2: Continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506105]-operative period
Objectives:
1) Determine whether there is a significant difference in donor site pain at rest with continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506106]. Pain will be assessed globally and specifically at the donor site.
- Pain will be assessed every [ADDRESS_652955] 48 hours using a numeric pain scale (0-10) at rest.
- Time of extubation will be considered time zero. Then every [ADDRESS_652956], with no intervention. Patients will be asked their
 global, or overall, pain level. They will then be asked their pain at the donor site specifically. 
2) Patients will be given standard of care opi[INVESTIGATOR_506107].
Patients will be provided a dilaudid PCA, set for low dose, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patients. 
- The amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_506108]
3) Determine whether there is an association between continuous infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506109]
- At post-operative day 2 (or soonest non-holiday weekday if surgery is performed on Friday), patients will receive a
 physical therapy evaluation where patients will be compared on basic physical therapy milestones.
- Distance able to ambulate, range of motion, strength - standard measures already obtained during standard
 physical therapy consultation. Distance able to ambulate will be measured in feet. Range of motion is a descriptive
 variable (within normal limits, within functional limits, etc.). Strength is measured on the standard neurological
 strength scale out of 5. 
- Total length of stay will be compared between groups to look for a correlation between continuous infusion
 ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506110]
4) Determine whether there is an association between continuous infusion ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506111]
- A standardized pain satisfaction survey (see attachments) will be distributed to patients prior to discharge rating
 their overall satisfaction with postoperative recovery from osseocutaneous free flap
Purpose:
The purpose of the study is to determine whether infusion of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506112], achievement of PT milestones,
 length of stay, and patient satisfaction.
Background
Free flap reconstruction success rates have reached >95%, allowing surgeons to focus on minimizing morbidity
 associated with the surgery. There has been a great deal of literature focused on donor site wound healing including
 the use of negative pressure wound therapy, skin grafts, and local rotational and advancement flaps. However, there
 is scant high quality evidence about donor site morbidity in ossecutaneous free flaps. In particular the literature is
 lacking on donor site pain management outside of standard intravenous analgesia (PCA pump, IV push, etc.)
Donor site pain is a known complication of osseocutaneous free flaps (Klein et al, Harris et al). One study found that
 out of forty procedures with the highest pain scores (median numeric rating scale, 6–7) twenty-two were orthopedic/
trauma procedures on the extremities (Gerbershagen et al), which are the most frequent donor sites for head and
 neck free flap reconstruction. A specific example from orthopedics is the use of iliac crest bone grafts for spi[INVESTIGATOR_506113]. These bone grafts are associated with immediate donor site postoperative pain and difficulty
 ambulating, persistent donor site pain at >3 months in 26% of patients, and functional impairment (Silber et al. 2003).
 Indeed, donor site pain may restrict mobility, preventing adequate rehabilitation and early ambulation resulting in co-
morbidities such as VTE, pneumonia and pressure ulcers (Oderda et al., Pi[INVESTIGATOR_506101].). In addition, early rehabilitation
 may also prevent gait disturbance long term or site-specific functional deficits and allow for participation in physical
 therapy protocols.
The mainstay of postoperative pain management in patients receiving osseocutaneous free flaps is opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_506114] a variety of risks including decreased mobility leading to complications such as DVT and decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_506115]. As such, alternative pain control methods are preferred for early ambulation and
 recovery. There is evidence in other surgical fields that the use of donor site catheter-based analgesia may alleviate
 pain at the donor site.  There have been several small trials in the orthopedic and craniofacial surgery literature
 that have evaluated the use of long acting anesthetic agents for pain control in iliac crest bone grafts (Singh 2005,
 Singh 2007, Brull 1992, Sbitany 2010, Meara 2011, Samartzis 2016). Although results vary with respect to patient
 reported pain score, patient satisfaction, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], three out of four studies reported decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_506116] (Singh 2005, Singh 2007, Meara 2011, Brull 1992, Sbitany
 2010, Samartzis 2016). Further, prior studies have postulated that the use of local anesthesia may prevent the
 development of chronic post-operative pain by [CONTACT_506136] (Tverskoy 1990). As a result, the benefits of donor site analgesia in the post-operative
 period may extend beyond the length of their use.
         
The research design utilized in this study is not unique, and in fact has been utilized in the fields of orthopedic and
 plastic surgery to study the use of donor site analgesia (Blumenthal et al., Heller et al.). We seek to replicate the
 double-blind placebo controlled trial design to evaluate the use of donor site catheter-based analgesia to minimize
 the morbidity associated with head and neck reconstructive surgery donor site pain.

10. Procedures - Narrative
Description of the Study Design
To reduce confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective randomized placebo controlled trial
 wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be randomized to receive continuous infusion of
 ropi[INVESTIGATOR_409676] (placebo) via intraosseous catheter, which will be placed intraoperatively at the time of
 donor site closure. 
Description of Procedures Being Performed
Intraoperatively, following procurement of the fibula or scapula bone graft and at the time of surgical wound closure,
 all patients will receive the placement of a continuous infusion catheter into the donor site wound bed. The infusion
 reservoir will be connected to a catheter-based On-Q pump, and the catheter will be placed in the donor site. A
 stab incision separate from the surgical wound will be used to bring the catheter through the skin. Patients will
 be randomized to receive 6 ml/hr of 0.2% Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506126] 6 ml/hr of normal saline via the infusion reservoir. The
 catheter will be left in place with continuous infusion for first [ADDRESS_652961] 48
 hours, patients will be asked to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for reporting their pain. The VAS will be
 performed six times over the course of the 48hrs. These will be performed during regular flap check monitoring, to
 ensure patients are not disrupted additional times throughout the day for this study.
Prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study subjects will be asked to complete a brief survey (APS-POQ-R Pain
 Survey) regarding their experience, with regard to pain management. 
Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
The source records used will come from the electronic medical records of patients at the Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
 The electronic medical record system used at MSH is Epic. The information collected will be age, race, sex, BMI,
 comorbid conditions, tumor grade/stage, operative time, length of stay, ASA status, intra-operative analgesic use,
 post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_196437], time to PCA removal, pain scores, time and distance of ambulation,
 strength, and the standard physical therapy evaluation.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
1) Donor site specific and global pain scores using the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be collected every [ADDRESS_652962] 2 postoperative days. The VAS pain scale will be measured and recorded by a member of the research
 team.
2) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_506127] 2 postoperative days. 
3) Physical therapy milestones will be assessed on the second postoperative day (or soonest non-holiday weekday, if
 surgery is performed on Friday) by [CONTACT_506142].

Data Analysis Plan Including Any Statistical Procedures
Intra- and inter-patient pain scores are expected to be highly variable and non-normally distributed, thus median
 pain score after [ADDRESS_652966] 80% power to detect a
 probability of 0.800 that a pain score in the local anesthesia group is less than a pain score in the placebo group
 using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.[ADDRESS_652967] L. Levy PlaceNew

Type
Specific Items That Will Be Monitored for Safety
Patient reported adverse events related to toxicity of Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  
Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506129],
 tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse. 
Frequency of Data Review
The DSMC will meet bi-annually and/or more often if required to review data safety.
Rules for Alteration of Study Design
In the event of toxicity, catheter system will be
immediately removed and the acute pain service will escalate care as indicated.
Selection Procedures to Minimize Toxicity
Patients with a history of allergic reaction to Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506130]., Additionally, patients with previous pain disorders or drug abuse requiring chronic narcotic use will not be
 enrolled in the study. 
Grading System to Evaluate Adverse Events
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
 (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. 
Procedures to Assure Data Accuracy
The selected principle monitor has established relationships with the subjects that will enable him to identify risks
 to the subjects. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a delegate will inquire about adverse events at each follow-up visit. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_506131] (CTCAE) for
 documentation. Additionally, a data and safety monitoring committee (DSMC) will be established and consist of the
 principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigators. Adverse events will be reviewed at least bi- annually, or, more often if
 needed. To help capture data for adverse events in the discharged postoperative period, the participant will be given
 the contact [CONTACT_506146]. The
 research coordinator will document the unexpected adverse events, or expected adverse events with higher than
 expected severity, and their resolution on a detailed log for the regulatory binder, on PDMS, and to the PI. Serious
 adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRB.
Suspension Reported to
Adverse events occurring during the study will be reported to the Mount Sinai Program for the Protection of Human
 Subjects (PPHS). Any suspension of the study will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_506132]. 
Anticipated Circumstances of Subject Withdrawal
Previously enrolled subjects who do not meet inclusion criteria due to an an intraoperative decision will be removed
 from the study. For instance, if an initially planned free tissue transfer reconstruction is forgone for a local-regional
 flap reconstruction the subject will no longer meet criteria for inclusion into the study. Once patients are withdrawn, a
 record of the signed consent form along with the reason for withdrawal will be stored and filed. Enrolled patients who
 fail to have a successful placement of donor site catheter will be withdrawn from the study.
Primary or Secondary Safety Endpoints
Median postoperative pain score on the visual analogue scale (VAS), recorded over the 48 hours. Secondary Study
 Endpoints: total opi[INVESTIGATOR_9357], achievement of physical therapy milestones, patient satisfaction, and side
 effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (nausea/vomiting, pruritus) Primary Safety Endpoints: Infection at the site of local infusion catheter,
 donor site hematoma, seroma, wound dehiscence, compartment syndrome, and ropi[INVESTIGATOR_506133].docx

Under the assumptions of a median survival of the control group of [ADDRESS_276579] ratio of 0.69, the required 
total sample size to achieve a 85% power to compare the experimental group (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and DT 30mg/m2 
groups) versus BSC with a significance level of 2.5% one sided is 348 patients in the ITT population (116 patients 
in the BSC group and 232 patients in DT groups). It is expected that 10% of patients will be lost to follow-up; this 
leads to a calculated total sample size of 390 randomised patients. 
Child Pugh A population (85% of the patient population): 
Under the assumptions of a median survival of the control group of [ADDRESS_276580] ratio of 0.68, the required 
total sample size to achieve a 80% power to compare experimental group (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and DT 30mg/m2 
groups) versus BSC with a significance level of 2.5% one sided is 291 patients in the ITT Child Pugh A population 
(97 patients in the BSC group and 194 patients in DT groups). It is expected that 10% of patients will be lost to 
follow-up; this requires for a calculated total sample size of 324 ITT Child Pugh A randomised patients. 
Main efficacy analyses: 
Results will be presented by [CONTACT_229891]. 
The primary endpoint is overall survival in the ITT population (all randomized patients). The 95% confidence 
intervals for hazard ratios and median times will be constructed and the Kaplan-Meier method will be used and 
plotted as curves by [CONTACT_1570] (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and DT 30mg/m2 groups) versus BSC group. The  
comparison between experimental group and BSC group will be made using the unstratified LogRank test. The 
analysis will be performed when [ADDRESS_276581] procedure will be used to control the overall type I error rate of 5% to evaluate 
first the OS primary endpoint in the ITT overall population, then if statistically significant, the OS primary endpoint 
in ITT Child Pugh A population and then if statistically significant, the two main secondary endpoints (PFS and 
OOR) in the ITT Child Pugh A population. 
To determine the optimal dose of DT between 20mg/m2 or 30 mg/m2, all statistical analyses (efficacy and safety) 
will be repeated as exploratory in the DT 20mg/m2 group alone versus BSC and DT 30mg/m2 group alone versus 
BSC. The dose of DT which presents the best benefit/risk ratio will be selected.  
For secondary and exploratory endpoints, all time to event endpoints will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier 
method and plotted as curves by [CONTACT_6660]. The comparisons between DT groups and BSC will be made 
using LogRank tests. Proportion of subjects with objective response, disease control… will be compared between 
DT groups and BSC by [CONTACT_219181]-square test. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions 
between DT groups and BSC will be provided. Estimate and confidence intervals for the odds-ratio will also be 
provided. 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):  
An independent DSMB will be organized to regularly evaluate the safety of DT during the study. The DSMB will 
be regularly provided with safety data. Safety data will be provided  by [CONTACT_229892] 75 patients (around 25 patients/group) or at least twice a year. The DSMB will remain 
blinded for its evaluation but may ask for unblinding if required. The DSMB will receive every serious adverse

- Adequate haematologic tests : 
 Neutrophil count  1000 /mm3 
 Platelets count  50,000 /mm3  
 Haemoglobin  10 g/dL 
- No clinical evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
- No other limiting toxicity > grade 2 
In case of grade 3-4 AE, infusion should be delayed  up to 4 weeks until resolution or recovery to CTC grade  2.  
 
For patients randomised in the BSC group 
For patients enrolled in the BSC group, safety measure will be done according to the specificity of the Standard 
of Care and the local practice.

2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary objective 
To compare the efficacy of repeated slow IV infusions of DT at doses of 20 mg/m² or 30 mg/m² 
to Best Standard of Care (BSC) in patients with advanced HCC after failure or intolerance to 
Sorafenib on overall survival (OS). 
2.2 Secondary objectives 
− To compare DT and BSC in additional efficacy parameters as progression free-survival 
(PFS) and objective  response rate, 
− To determine the optimal dose of DT infusions; 
− To evaluate the safety of DT; 
− To assess PK parameters of DT at the doses of 20 and 30 mg/m2; 
− To evaluate pharmacodynamics parameters and predictive factors of safety and efficacy. 
− To measure QoL using a generic health-related questionnaire

3 TRIAL DESIGN 
This is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, comparative, 3 arms (DT 20 mg/m², DT 30 
mg/m², Best Standard of Care) study in patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma.  
The study will be carried out at multiple hepatology or oncology centres that manage patients 
with HCC with or without cirrhosis. Approximately [ADDRESS_276594] to be included to adequately compare the efficacy of DT 20 mg/m² and DT 30 
mg/m² to that of BSC.  
A safety evaluation will be carried out on a regular basis at least twice a year by [CONTACT_229893] (DSMB) and every 75 patients (around 25 patients/group) whichever comes 
first.  
Patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised according to a 1:1:1 ratio 
to receive either DT 20 mg/m², DT 30 mg/m², or BSC. Only those patients whose survival 
expectations is longer than 2 months and could receive more than 1 DT infusion will be 
enrolled. 
The study duration for each patient includes a screening period of 28 +/- 2 days maximum 
before baseline visit (D0 Cycle 1). The patient will then be randomised to receive either DT 20 
mg/m² or DT 30 mg/m² as protracted IV infusion over 6 hours once every 4 weeks or BSC.  
Patients will receive study therapy until unequivocal tumour progression (assessed by [CONTACT_1275]) or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.  
All patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_229894] 2 months for tumour assessements.  
After study therapy discontinuation, an end of study visit will be performed 1  month +/- [ADDRESS_276595] BSC treatment.  
Then, a follow up of all patients (including those who withdrew prematurely from the study) 
will be maintained every 3 months until death. The following information will be recorded: 
• Survival (patient alive or deceased) 
• Date of progression (in the case of withdrawal for other reason than progression during 
the study treatment period) 
• Administration of any other anti-cancer treatment. 
The follow-up period is defined as “until [ADDRESS_276596] Patient In”.

The assignment of number and code for patient’s identification will ensure patient’s anonymity. 
Patients will be assigned a sequential patient number in each center and will be identified by: 
− The identification center number (a 3-digit number) 
− The patient number (a 4-digit number); these four numbers being allocated 
according to the sequence of presentation for trial participation in each centre. 
As soon as a potential patient is screened by [CONTACT_229895], the investigator will have 
to complete the eCRF. If needed, he may contact [CONTACT_229896] (formerly known as BioAlliance 
Pharma) or its representative in order to review the inclusion criteria.

enrollment criteria is inadvertently enrolled, that patient should be discontinued from the study 
and Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) or its designee must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. An 
exception may be granted in rare circumstances where there is a compelling ethical reason to 
allow the patient to continue taking study drug. In these rare cases, the investigator must obtain 
documented approval from the Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) medical 
monitor to allow the patient to continue in the study. 
In addition, a patient’s participation may also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of 
the investigator or Sponsor. The following are some of the potential reasons that could lead the 
investigator or sponsor to remove a patient from the study drug or the study, or both:

the patient (e.g. the patient needs to be treated, for any reason, with another anti 
cancer therapy);  
− The patient experiences an intolerable AE. An intolerable AE is an event that, even 
with optimal treatment, causes such discomfort or disability that the patient is unable 
or unwilling to continue further study participation 
− The patient is non compliant with study requirements  
− The patient becomes pregnant during the study or fails to use adequate birth control 
(for those patients who are able to conceive)  
− The patient requires a medication prohibited by [CONTACT_4690]  
− The Sponsor decides to terminate the trial

The e-CRF has to be completed until the time of drop out. All drop outs after the first intake of 
investigational product should be given a post-study assessment as appropriate.The premature

6.6  Dose adjustment, dose delay and infusion duration  
6.6.1  Dose Adjustment: DT Arms 
Dose adjustement will be based upon haematologic and non haematologic toxicities observed 
after the previous dose administration.  
All dose reductions for patients randomised to receive either treatment A (DT 20 mg/m2) or B 
(DT 30 mg/m2) will be calculated based upon the following dose level reduction guidelines.  
 
Dose level reduction guidelines: 
 Arm A (DT 20 mg/m2) 
Initial Dose Level 20 mg/m2 
Dose Level -1 15 mg/m2 
 
                                 Arm B (DT 30 mg/m2) 
Initial Dose Level 30 mg/m2 
Dose Level -1 20 mg/m2 
Dose Level -2 15 mg/m2 
 
Haematologic criteria for dose modifications: 
• In case of grade 3 (500 – 1000/mm3) or grade 4 (< 500/mm3) neutropenia whatever the 
duration of neutropenia and/or in case of grade 3 (25 000 – 50 000/mm3) or grade 4 (< 
25 000/mm3) thrombocytopenia, DT will be interrupted until resolution to a grade  2.

6.6.2 Dose Delay: DT arms 
To initiate a new DT infusion, the patient needs to meet the following continuing treatment 
criteria: 
• Adequate liver function:  
 Child-Pugh score from A5 to B7 included (if cirrhosis)  
 Serum bilirubin < 35 µM/L (or 2.0 mg/dL) 
•
 Adequate respi[INVESTIGATOR_229823] 2  9 5%;

 Neutrophil count   1000 / mm3 
 Platelets count   50,000 / mm3  
 Haemoglobin   10 g /dL 
• No c
linical evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding 
• No other limiting toxicity  > grade  2  
 
I
f one of these  criteria is not met, the next infusion should be delayed for a maximum of four 
weeks. In case one of these criteria is not met after the 4 weeks delay, the patient will be 
withdrawn from the study treatment period and the end of therapy notification form will be 
completed. 
  
6.6.3 DT Infusion duration 
 
DT will be administered as a protracted i.v infusion during 6 consecutive hours. That infusion 
duration will be prolonged up to 12 consecutive hours if any of the condition described in 
section 7.6 occurs. In case of accidental infusion acceleration, i.e accidental infusion duration 
 2 hours, urgent safety precautions should be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y  available at the patient bedside. Those 
measures include, but are not limited to, mechanical respi[INVESTIGATOR_229839], i.v 
corticosteroids, i.v antibiotics if infection is suspected.

The pharmacokinetic study of DT will be performed only in selected centers that can meet the 
requirements of blood sampling.  
The primary aim of pharmacokinetic evaluation will be to determine the population 
pharmacokinetic parameters. The secondary objective will be to analyse the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic correlation with DT efficacy and toxicity, and to evaluate 
inter-cycles AUC stability. For this purpose, blood sampling will be performed at the first and 
third treatment cycles. For patients still on treatment after Cycle 3, an optional and limited 
sampling at cycle 4, cycle 6 and beyond (e.g. every 2 cycles until the end of study treatment) 
will also be performed. 
The bioanalytic method will be described in separate bioanalytical study plans and analysis of 
the study samples will be centrally performed at  Blood 
samples collected and stored in the biobank are aimed at measuring total doxorubicin, free 
doxorubicin and doxorubicinol plasma concentrations. Each sequence of analysis will be 
performed according to current quality standards, especially in term of quality control samples, 
calibration curve and acceptance criteria.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis will be performed under the responsibility of the Sponsor. A 
formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) for PK analysis will provide further details of the 
statistical analyses and will be finalized before database lock. The section below is an overview 
of the PK statistical analyses planned for this study.  
Total doxorubicin, free doxorubicin and doxorubicinol concentration data will be analysed 
using a 3 compartment model. This will allow for determination of both the steady-state and 
the elimination pharmacokinetic parameters of free doxorubicin, total doxorubicin and its major 
metabolite doxorubicinol.  
The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived for total doxorubicin, free 
doxorubicin and doxorubicinol: 
Cmax, Tmax, AUC (last, and inf), Half-life, Clearance  
The study protocol is planned to present pharmacokinetic parameters as mean, standard 
deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV%), median, minimum and maximum values (and 
geometric mean when appropriate).  
The influence of covariates such as demographics and liver impairment will be investigated.  
 
Amount of blood samples taken for the pharmacokinetic study (see appendix VIII) 
A maximum of thirty-six (36) blood samples will be taken for PK during the study within the 
first 3 months. The amount of blood taken each time will be less than 10 ml each: fourteen (14) 
times during treatment period Day [ADDRESS_276613] Cycle. 
I
n patients still on study treatment after Cycle 3, an optional and limited blood sampling will 
be drawn on each Day 1 (4 times: at T0, 4h, 6h, 8h), Day 14 (once) and Day 28 (once) of Cycle 
4, Cycle 6, and beyond (e.g. every 2 cycles until the end of study treatment).

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be organized to regularly 
evaluate the safety of DT during the study. The complete role and responsibilities of DSMB is 
described in the DSMB charter. The DSMB will be provided with blinded safety data by [CONTACT_229900] 75 patients (around 25 patients/group) and will review the data at 
least twice a year. The DSMB will remain blinded for its evaluation, but may ask for unblinding 
if required.  
At the end of each meeting, the DSMB will have to make recommendations to the Sponsor as 
follows: 
- To continue the trial without modification; 
- To continue the trial and amend the protocol, as specified; 
- To suspend the trial pending further information or evaluations;  
- To terminate the trial prematurely. 
The DSMB will receive every SAE within [ADDRESS_276617] to postpone the recommendation, pending external 
consultation(s) with required specialists and/or receipt of additional data and a subsequent 
closed DSMB meeting session. 
The DSMB members will be appointed by [CONTACT_1034]. DSMB is an independent expert group 
consisting of specialists in hepatology, liver oncology disease, lung diseases and statistics, well 
experienced in the management of patients with HCC and adverse lung reactions. DSMB will 
elect the chairman. Appropriate Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) employees 
(including Pharmacovigilance and Clinical Departments) will participate to the DSMB 
meetings but will not have any voting rights.  
DSMB will have the responsibility for providing the following: 
• Assurance of patient safety, 
• Trial integrity, 
• Discussion with the Sponsor and required specialists, 
• Recommendations and commitment in the study. 
 
Following their risk evaluation, the DSMB reserves the possibility of alerting the Sponsor in 
the event of observation of highly unexpected events. The DSMB may request a futility analysis 
on the primary criterion of overall survival. This futility analysis serves one objective: to 
recommend the potential discontinuation when it is unlikely, based on the interim results, to 
achieve statistically significant results at the end of the study. This futility analysis will be 
realized under the responsibility of the DSMB statistician. The results of this futility analysis

(12-hour infusion); the total dose will not be changed; 
− In case of persistence of symptoms in the following hour, DT infusion will 
be immediately and definitively stopped. 
 
SaO 2 monitoring after the end of DT infusion :   
A SaO2 monitoring during 24 hours after infusion start is mandatory.  
In case of a marked decrease in SaO 2  or occurrence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], the patient will 
be
 transferred to intensive care unit for monitoring and treatment until recovery.

DT treatment will have reinforced respi[INVESTIGATOR_229845]2 collected every hour during infusion and within the 6 hours after the end of infusion. 
The recommended treatment of drug-induced pneumonitis is based on systemic corticosteroids 
with methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days in patients with respi[INVESTIGATOR_229846] (i.e methylprednisolone 60 mg every  6 hours) in less severe cases. Before 
initiating corticosteroid therapy, an infectious etiology must be excluded. Supportive care, 
bronchodilators, IV fluid, vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation could be indicated in 
patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions and circulatory collapse (Vahid B., 2008[49]). 
I
n case of ARDS and/or any related life-threatening respi[INVESTIGATOR_228711], DT 
will be definitively stopped and the patient will not receive any additional DT infusion.  
In case of grade 3 or grade 4 AE, infusion should be delayed up to 4 weeks, when AE decreases 
to grade  2. Further DT infusions should be performed only if adequate respi[INVESTIGATOR_229847]2   95% is obtained (see section 6.6). 
A 
decrease of SaO2 below 90%, regardless of any respi[INVESTIGATOR_229848], will be 
considered as SAE and reported to Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) 
within 24 hours. 
In any case, the total DT dose administered will be carefully recorded in the source document 
and e-CRF.

Asymptomatic neutropenia and thrombopenia are frequent in patients with cirrhosis and related 
to hypersplenism and portal hypertension. The risk of neutropenia, anemia and thrombopenia 
will be carefully monitored before each study treatment administration, then every day for 3 
days, at day 14 and day 28 during each cycle.

practices; haematopoietic growth factors (G-CSF) and/or erythropoietin (EPO) could be 
administered according their respective SmPC in patients with documented anemia or 
cytopenia; 
In case of febrile neutropenia, any grade 3 or grade 4 thrombopenia or neutropenia, DT will be 
interrupted and infusion should be delayed up to 4 weeks until resolution to a grade   2.  
F

ose reduction is authorized in case of grade 4 related heamatological adverse events as 
described in section 6.6.1. The dose to be administered will be reduced ( minus 1 dose level) in 
case of febrile neutropenia of any duration, grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days and grade 4 
thrombocytopenia.  
 
7.6.3 Liver toxicity 
Cirrhosis may decompensate and liver function may deteriorate in cirrhotic patients. Clinical 
signs and symptoms and liver function tests will be closely monitored thoughout the study, 
before each study treatment administration, then every day for 3 days, at days 14 and 28 during 
each cycle.  
In case of aggravation of liver function tests, the investigator may prolong the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
take all appropriate measures and administer symptomatic treatments as required. If 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229850] (> Day 3), investigator should inform Onxeo (formerly known 
as BioAlliance Pharma), fill in and fax a SAE form. 
Further DT infusions should be performed only if liver function tests returned to baseline values 
with a Child-Pugh score from A5 to B7 included (if cirrhosis) and serum bilirubin < 35 µM/L 
(or 2.0 mg/dL) (see section 6.6).  
Infusion could be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 4 weeks. Dose reduction is authorized as described in section 
6.6.1.  
7.6.4 Cardiac toxicity 
Cardiac toxicity has been reported with doxorubicin. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is among 
the most serious toxicities of doxorubicin, increases with the cumulative dose of doxorubicin, 
and is estimated to be 5 % at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2, 16 % at 500 mg/m2 and 26 % at 
550 mg/m2. To date, no cardiac events have been reported in patients suffering from HCC and 
treated with DT.

eCRF. All serious adverse events (related or not related) must be reported to Onxeo (formerly 
known as BioAlliance Pharma) Pharmacovigilance Department (Cf. section 8.7). 
 A ny study drug-related AE (Cf. definition section 8.1) or any related or not related 
SAE (Cf. definition section 8.3) is to be followed until resolution or until mutually 
agreed by [CONTACT_229902] (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma)

seriousness, severity, and relationship to the study drug. 
8.1 Adverse Events 
The term AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal 
product.  
AEs associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related, 
include the following: 
− An AE occurring in the Cycle of the use of a drug product in professional practice 
− An AE occurring from an overdose whether accidental or intentional 
− An AE occurring from drug abuse 
− An AE occurring from drug withdrawal 
− An AE where there is a reasonable possibility that the event occurred purely as a 
result of the patient’s participation in the study must also be reported as an AE even 
if it is not related to the investigational product. 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action will not be 
recorded as an AE if it is already reported as efficacy criteria in the e-CRF. If, however, the 
event fulfils any of the criteria for a SAE, it must be recorded and reported as such. 
Underlying conditions (existing prior to the trial) which become aggravated or recur after 
resolution during a clinical trial must be reported as an AE. An AE may be deemed serious if it 
meets any of the seriousness criteria given in Section 8.3.

8.2 Unexpected Adverse Event Definition 
An unexpected AE is any event, the nature, specificity or severity of which is not consistent 
with the current Investigator’s Brochure. Also, reports which add significant information on 
specificity or severity of a known, already documented AE constitute unexpected AEs. For 
example, an event more specific or more severe than described in the investigator’s Brochure 
would be considered unexpected. Specific examples would be as follows: (a) acute renal failure 
as a labeled AE with a subsequent new report of interstitial nephritis, and (b) hepatitis with a 
first report of fulminant hepatitis. 
 
8.3 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is classed as being “serious” during a clinical trial if it: 
− Results in death  
− Is life-threatening  
− Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
− Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57656] 
− Is a congenital anomaly, or birth defect 
− Is a suspected transmission of an infectious agent 
− Is an important medical event (requires medical intervention to prevent outcomes 
listed above). 
Life-threatening: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event 
in which the patient or the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] : Any event leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229852], unless at least one of the following exceptions is met: 
− The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours 
− The admission is pre-planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to 
the start of the study)  
− The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229853]). 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_229854], as such, may be reportable as a SAE depending on clinical 
investigator’s judgment. In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a 
more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedent. 
Disability:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Important Medical Event : Any AE may be considered serious because it may jeopardize the 
patient and may require intervention to prevent another serious condition. As guidance for 
determination of important medical events, refer to the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology 
“Critical Terms List”, these terms either refer to or might be indicative of a serious disease state. 
Such reported events warrant special attention because of their possible association with a 
serious disease state and may lead to more decisive action.

 Confidential  Page 70 / 123 Note : previous studies have identified acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) as 
SAE. In order to prevent the occurrence of ARDS, a decrease of SaO 2 below 90% will be 
considered as SAE. 
 
Pregnancy : 
Any pregnancy that occurs from date of informed consent to six (6) months after end of therapy 
must be reported to Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) immediately and followed 
up until after delivery on the Pregnancy report form. Pregnant patients will be withdrawn from 
the trial and will be advised to present at a center specialized in human genetics for genetics 
councelling. In case of still birth, spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, or congenital 
malformation/abnormality, a Pregnancy report form must be provided as well. 
8.4 Severity Assessment 
The NCI CTC AE v4.0 classification should be used to determine and to grade the severity of 
AEs. 
For AEs not specified and detailed in the NCI CTC, severity will be categorized as mild 
corresponding to grade 1, moderate corresponding to grade 2, severe corresponding to grade 3 
or life-threatening corresponding to grade 4, according to the following NCI CTC definitions:  
Mild  is defined as usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal 
activities. No medical intervention/therapy required. 
Moderate  is defined as sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities. No or 
minimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Severe  or medically significant is defined as prevents normal activities. Some assistance is 
usually required, medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]. 
8.5 Causality Assessment 
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the administration of study drug is a clinical 
decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the e-CRF. 
Related adverse events are those that are judged unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely 
related to the study or to the study drug by [CONTACT_093]. 
Unrelated adverse events are those that are judged to be not related to the study or to the study 
drug by [CONTACT_093]. 
An assessment of “No relation to study drug” would include: 
− The existence of a clear alternative explanation (i.e., mechanical bleeding at surgical 
site) or 
− Non plausibility (e.g., the patient is struck by [CONTACT_23634], cancer 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few days after the first drug administration). 
An assessment of “Yes, related to study drug” indicates that there is a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_229855]. 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study drug include the 
following: 
Doxorubicin Transdrug™ 
Protocol BA2011/03/04                 Version 7.0, July 27th, 2017 
 Confidential  Page 71 / 123 − The temporal sequence of the event related to the time of drug administration. The 
event should occur after the drug is given. The length of time from drug exposure to 
event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. 
− Recovery from the event on discontinuation (dechallenge), recurrence on 
reintroduction of the drug (rechallenge) should be evaluated. Patient’s response after 
drug discontinuation (dechallenge) or patients response after drug reintroduction 
(rechallenge) should be considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the 
event in question.  
− Underlying, concomitant, concurrent diseases. Each report should be evaluated in the 
context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other 
disease the patient may have. 
− Concomitant medication or treatment. The other drugs the patient is taking or the 
treatment the patient received should be examined to determine whether any of them 
may be suspected in the cause of the event in question. 
− The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the test drug: The pharmacokinetic 
properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of the test drug(s), 
coupled with the individual patient’s pharmacodynamics, should be considered. 
 
8.6 Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
(See Subject Premature Withdrawal, section 4.4 and End of treatment Notification, section 
7.2.3). 
8.[ADDRESS_276623] be fully recorded in 
the patient’s e-CRF. Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_151806]’s file. A 
laboratory test abnormality considered clinically relevant (e.g., causing the patient to withdraw 
from the study, requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical manifestations, or judged 
relevant by [CONTACT_093]) should be reported as an AE. Each event should be described in 
detail along with start and stop dates, severity, relationship to investigational product, action 
taken and outcome. 
For all adverse events, the investigator has to pursue and obtain adequate information to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as non serious or SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor (see 
below). Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, is required if the 
AE or its after-effects persist. 
Follow-up is required until the event or its after-effects are resolved or stabilized at a level 
acceptable to the investigator and the Sponsor. For subjects withdrawn from the study and 
subjects experiencing AE at the end of the study and within [ADDRESS_276624] treatment 
day, the investigator will arrange for appropriate follow up (if required until the AEs are 
resolved or attributed to a cause other than the study drug).

Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptom cannot be determined 
as being exclusively due to progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not fit the 
expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. 
Progression could be evident in the patient’s clinical symptoms, and the investigator may elect 
not to perform further disease assessments. In such cases, the progression is based on 
symptomatic deterioration and considered as a clinical progression. As far as possible, these 
evaluations should be a rare exception and every effort should be made to document the 
progression. 
If there is any uncertainty about an AE or SAE being due ONLY to the progression of the 
underlying malignancy, it should be reported as an AE or SAE.

of 24.2% for Control and of 51.4% for Doxorubicin, respectively  and to predictions of median 
survival times of 356.7 days and 760.4 days, respectively.  
Actually the population expected in the ReLive study will be markedly different from the 
population observed in the DOTAHCC1 study. Patients are expected to be more severe and 
consequently the median survival time of the control group should be markedly lower. A 
Korean study conducted on a population closer to the one expected for ReLive study has 
reported a median survival time of 187 days (Woo H.Y., 2011[50]). Under an exponential 
distribution, a median survival time of 187 days would correspond to a 1-year survival rate of 
25.8% (2-year survival rate of 6.7%). A French cohort study conducted on 1287 naive patients 
with HCC reported that only 187 patients were eligible for Sorafenib treatment and 103 received 
Sorafenib in whom a 1-year survival of 16% was reported (Rosa L., 2011[27]). Under an 
exponential distribution, a 1-year survival rate of 16% would correspond to a median survival 
time of 138 days and to a 2-year survival rate of 2.6%. 
Following the publication of the positive RESORCE regorafenib phase 3 study in Child Pugh 
A patients tolerant and progressing under sorafenib, the SAP was revised in order to handle the 
potential risk of lack of power. Analysis of efficacy and safety of the pooled DT groups versus 
BSC group was chosen as primary analysis and a more realistic OS in the control group of 
8 months instead of 6.6 months (200 days) and an HR of 0.69 instead of 0.60 were considered. 
Following the recent data of prospective non interventional studies showing that the Child Pugh 
status is a strong prognostic factor for OS in patients treated by [CONTACT_44369] (median OS of 13 
months in Child Pugh A patients versus 5 months in Child Pugh B), analysis of efficacy and 
safety in this homogeneous population of Child Pugh A patients from whom the clinical benefit 
is expected to be higher has been added.  An OS in the control group of [ADDRESS_276626] procedure will be used to control the overall type I error 
rate of 5% to evaluate first the primary endpoint OS in the ITT population, then if statistically 
significant the primary endpoint OS in the ITT Child Pugh A population and then if statistically 
significant the main secondary endpoints (PFS and OOR) in the ITT Child Pugh A population.  
The following sequence will be followed: 
• OS in the overall ITT population 
• OS in the ITT Child Pugh A population 
• PFS in the ITT Child Pugh A population 
• ORR in the ITT Child Pugh A population 
Overall population: 
Under the assumptions of a median survival of the control group of [ADDRESS_276627] ratio 
of 0.69, the required total sample size to achieve a 85% power to compare the experimental 
groups (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and DT 30mg/m2) versus BSC and performed at a significance 
level of 2.5% one sided is 348 patients in the ITT population (116 patients in the BSC group

leads to a calculated total sample size of 390 randomised patients. 
Child Pugh A population (85% of the patient population): 
Under the assumptions of a median survival of the control group of [ADDRESS_276628] ratio 
of 0.68, the required total sample size to achieve a 80% power to compare the experimental 
group (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and DT 30mg/m2 groups) versus BSC with a significance level of 
2.5% one sided is 291 patients in the ITT Child Pugh A population (97 patients in the BSC 
group and 194 patients in DT groups). It is expected that 10% of patients will be lost to follow-
up; this leads to a calculated total sample size of [ADDRESS_276629] occurred (corresponding to 230 events in the 
ITT Child Pugh A population).

groups, DT 20 mg/m2 alone, DT 30 mg/m2 alone and BSC control group) and overall.  
The baseline value will be defined as the last available value prior to first DT infusion for 
patients in tested dose groups or prior to first BSC administration for patients in BSC. 
The type I ( ) error will to be 5% (two-sided) for all analyses.  
From a statistical point of view, this study will not be comparative between the two doses of 
DT. So comparison of confidence intervals between each DT group versus BSC will be 
exploratory in order to define the benefit-risk ratio for each dose (see 9.6).

patients will be analysed in their randomisation group whatever the treatment they 
received. 
- The Per Protocol (PP) population includes all the patients of the ITT population without 
any major protocol deviation. Patients terminating the study prematurely will be 
included in the PP population provided that there is no protocol deviation. Before 
locking the database, the precise reasons for excluding patients from the PP dataset will 
be fully defined and documented by [CONTACT_229903].

9.4  Efficacy endpoints  
9.4.1 Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint is overall survival (OS), defined as the time from the date of 
randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Patients without death at the time of the 
statistical analysis will be censored at the date they were last known to be alive.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed in ITT population (primary analysis), with an additional 
analysis in PP population. 
Definition of date of death or censoring will refer to FDA guidelines for OS (definition 
including documented death only). 
OS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and plotted as curves by [CONTACT_6490].

5%. 
In addition to the analysis not adjusted for baseline characteristics considered above, a 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted using a Cox model adjusting for geographical region and 
pre-defined selected prognostic factors as recently described in this population such as ECOG 
score, BCLC stage, macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic spread and hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh score, prothrombine time) (Marrero J.A., 2013[54], Reig M., 2013[55], Iavarone M., 
2015[56]). HR, median and mean survival and OS rates every 3 months will be given with the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
9.4.2 Secondary endpoints 
A sequential (closed) testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error rate. 
Formal testing of the first secondary endpoint will be undertaken only if a statistically 
significant result is achieved on the primary endpoint of OS in the Child Pugh A population and 
formal testing of the second secondary endpoint will be undertaken only if a statistically 
significant result is achieved on the first secondary endpoint.  
1. Progression Free Survival (PFS): 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented 
progression or death from any cause. The assessment of progression will be done by [CONTACT_229905] 1.1. Patients without progression or 
death at the end of study treatment period will be censored at the date of their last tumour 
assessment.  
PFS will be analyzed in the ITT Child Pugh A population with an additional analysis in ITT 
and PP  populations. 
Definition of date of progression or censoring will refer to FDA guidelines for PFS.   
PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and plotted as curves by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The  comparison between groups (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 versus BSC) will be made 
using LogRank test. 
HR, median and mean survival and PFS rates every 2 months will be given with the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
If the primary endpoint of OS is statistically significant for the pooled DT 20 mg/m2 and 
30mg/m2 groups versus BSC in the Child Pugh A population, PFS will be formally tested at 
significance level of 5% for the pooled DT 20 mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 group versus BSC in the 
Child Pugh A population. The analysis of the other comparison will be considered as 
exploratory. 
In addition to the analysis not adjusted for baseline characteristics considered above, a 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted using a model adjusting for geographical region and pre-
defined selected prognostic factors as recently described in this population such as ECOG score,

ORR will be analyzed in the ITT Child Pugh A population with an additional analysis in ITT 
and PP populations. 
The comparisons between groups (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 versus BSC) will be made 
using chi-square test. 
If the PFS is statistically significant for the pooled DT 20mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 group versus 
BSC in the Child Pugh A population, ORR will be formally tested at significance level of 5% 
for the pooled DT 20mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 group in the Child Pugh A population. The analysis 
of the other comparison will be considered as exploratory.

Safety analyses will be descriptive and conducted in the safety population.  
Descriptive data will  be provided for adverse events, laboratory values (biochemistry and 
hematology), vital signs (weight, blood pressure), clinical exams (normal/abnormal), and 
concomitant treatments.  
Patients with at least one AE, SAE, severe AE, AE leading to discontinuation, AE leading to 
dose reduction, and AEs of interest will be summarized. Adverse events will be coded using 
MedDRA.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]:  
- Incidence and duration of reduction of SaO2 during DT infusion (in DT arms); 
- Incidence and severity of respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]; 
Cardiac: 
- Incidence and severity of cardiovascular events (including BP and HR); 
- ECG and LVEF change ; 
Overall: 
- Incidence and severity of all TEAEs and SAEs according to NCI-CTC v4.0 scale; 
- Biological (haematology and biochemistry analyses and particularly AST/ALT, WBC); 
- Child Pugh Score deterioration. 
Safety endpoints will be individually described per subject number, presenting: emergence, 
description, body system, preferred term, date and time of onset, date and time of last study

frequency, severity and seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken (corrective 
treatment, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]…) required and outcome if any. 
The treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as those events that occurred or worsened after 
the first drug administration, will be summarized by [CONTACT_49240]. The 
number of emergent AEs and the number of subjects reporting these emergent AEs will be 
presented by [CONTACT_6654]. 
The same table presentation will be used for serious TEAEs, drug related TEAEs and drug 
related serious TEAEs. 
 
9.6 Determination of the optimal dose of DT  
 
The statistical analyses comparing the experimental group (pooled DT 20mg/m2 and 30mg/m2 
groups) versus BSC will also be conducted in the DT 20mg/m2 group alone vs BSC and DT 
30mg/m2 group alone vs BSC in the ITT population.  
Baseline demographic characteristics, exposure, efficacy, safety and adjustment for covariates 
(as described in Sections 9.3, 9.4 and 9.5 of the protocol) will be compared for each DT group 
versus BSC (as exploratory analysis). 
The selection of the optimal DT dose will be based on the benefit/risk ratio of each dose of 
DT, taking into account: 
 
− Benefit/Efficacy: The optimal dose of DT in term of efficacy will be the one which is 
associated with the best survival in comparison with the BSC group. 
This will be assessed through the measure of OS and tested by [CONTACT_152057]-rank 
test.   
The optimal dose for efficacy will be identified if one out of the 2 exploratory unstratified 
log-rank tests between the DT 30 mg/m2 versus BSC or DT 20 mg/m2 group versus BSC 
is statistically significant or if a clinically relevant difference is observed in favour of one 
DT group versus BSC (i.e. unstratified log-rank tests between the DT 30 mg/m2 versus 
BSC or DT 20 mg/m2 group versus BSC less than 15%).  
If there is no difference between the DT 30mg/m2 versus BSC and DT 20mg/m2 group 
versus BSC (i.e. unstratified log-rank tests between the DT 30 mg/m2 versus BSC or DT 
20 mg/m2 group versus BSC more than 15%), it will be concluded that DT 20 mg/m2 and 
DT 30 mg/m2 are similar in term of efficacy.   
 
− Risk/Safety: The optimal dose of DT in term of safety will be the one which is 
associated with the lowest incidence of treatment discontinuations due to adverse drug 
reactions and the lowest incidence of deaths due to adverse drug reactions.  
Difference between the two doses of DT (DT 30 mg/m2 versus DT 20 mg/m2) will be 
explored via two-sided Fisher exact tests on the incidence of treatment discontinuations 
and on the incidence of death due to adverse drug reactions.  
If at least one exploratory Fisher test leads to conclude to a statistically significant 
difference between the DT 30 mg/m2 group and the DT 20 mg/m2 group, or if a clinically

Protocol BA2011/03/04                 Version 7.0, July 27th, 2017 
 Confidential  Page 83 / 123 relevant difference is observed between groups (absolute difference of more than 5%), the 
optimal dose of DT for safety will be the one which is associated with the lowest 
incidence of study treatment interruptions or deaths due to adverse drug reactions. If there 
is no difference between the dose groups for these safety criteria, it will be concluded that 
DT 20 mg/m2 and DT 30 mg/m2 are similar in term of safety.   
 
In summary, the optimal DT dose will be the dose of DT associated with the best OS (if any). 
If OS is similar between the [ADDRESS_276645] dose (20mg/m2) will be selected.

9.8 Risk estimation of any event according to drug exposure 
Safety data will be carefully and regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_212199] 75 patients, 
corresponding to the collection of data in around 25 patients per treatment group. Estimates of 
the risk of serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857] (or any other serious events) are given in the following 
table.  
 
The 95% and 90% (exact binomial) confidence intervals are presented for different sample 
sizes: 
Sample size 0 respi[INVESTIGATOR_229858] (ARDS) 1 respi[INVESTIGATOR_229858] (ARDS)

A first approach assumes that the 'experimental unit' is the patient and that the risk considered 
is the risk to see a serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229859] (i.e. ARDS) in a patient receiving a series of injections. 
In this first approach, the table above is interpreted as follows: 
Doxorubicin Transdrug™ 
Protocol BA2011/03/04                 Version 7.0, July 27th, 2017 
 Confidential  Page 84 / 123 - seeing 0 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229860] a series of 25 patients leaves a risk of 5% that the true 
incidence could be above 11.29% and a risk of 2.5% that the true incidence could be 
above 13.72%. 
- seeing 1 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229860] a series of 25 patients leaves a risk of 5% that the true 
incidence could be above 17.61% and a risk of 2.5% that the true incidence could be 
above 20.35%. 
A second approach is to consider that the 'experimental unit' is the injection and that the risk 
considered is the risk to see a serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229861]. In this situation, the risk 
remains the same at each injection and is not influenced by [CONTACT_229911] a new patient. In this second approach, the table above is 
interpreted as follows: 
- seeing 0 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229860] a series of 100 injections (e.g. 25 patients having had 
4 injections on average) leaves a risk of 5% that the true incidence could be above 2.95% 
and a risk of 2.5% that the true incidence could be above 3.62%. 
- seeing 1 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229860] a series of 100 injections leaves a risk of 5% that the 
true incidence could be above 4.66% and a risk of 2.5% that the true incidence could be 
above 5.45%. 
Based on these assumptions, the probability to see 1 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229862]: 
Sample size ARDS: 0.1% ARDS: 1% ARDS: 5% ARDS: 10% 
25 0.0247 0.2222 0.7226 0.9282 
50 0.0488 0.3950 0.9231 0.9948 
75 0.0723 0.5294 0.9787 0.9996 
100 0.0952 0.6340 0.9941 1.0000 
This table shows that in a series of 25 patients, if the true serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229863] 
0.1%, there is a probability of 2.47% to see 1 serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229864] (and a probability 
of 97.53% to see 0 ARDS). If the incidence is 10%, there is a probability of 92.82% to see 1 
serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_229864] (and a probability of 7.18% to see 0 ARDS). Sample size may 
apply to patients (either all patients treated with DT or patients belonging to one treatment 
group) or injections.  
On the basis of these assumptions, safety analyses will be performed when a total of [ADDRESS_276647] been included.

10 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1  Data Collection  
The Investigator/coordinator at each site must enter the information required by [CONTACT_229912] (eCRF) provided by [CONTACT_229896] (formerly known as 
BioAlliance Pharma). These will be forwarded to the sponsor, Onxeo (formerly known as 
BioAlliance Pharma), and their representatives. All additions to the eCRF during the study and 
SAE forms must be forwarded to the sponsor. Details on responses need to be accurately 
documented in the patient's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]. 
10.2 Study Monitoring  
Before study initiation at a site initiation visit, an Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance 
Pharma) representative will review the protocol and eCRF with the investigators and their staff. 
A Clinical Research Associate (CRA) will be appointed by [CONTACT_229913], including the conduct of site visits. 
Monitoring visits at the investigational site will be made regularly to ensure that all aspects of 
the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and national and local requirements are observed. 
Source documents will be verified for consistency with the data on the eCRF. The investigator 
guarantees direct access to source documents by [CONTACT_456]. Source data verification is 
performed in accordance with data protection regulations and guidelines and all information 
reviewed will be kept confidential. 
The investigator is responsible for completing the eCRFs within five days of the patient’s visit 
and the Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) monitor/representative is responsible 
for reviewing them in order to clarify and resolve any data queries. The completed and 
monitored eCRFs for completed visits will be locked by [CONTACT_229914] 
(formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) and data will be processed by [CONTACT_229915]. At the end of the study, a copy of the completed eCRFs will be provided to the 
respective sites for retention with other study documents, such as the protocol, the investigator’s 
brochure and any protocol amendments, in a secure place. 
10.3 Data Management  
Data Management will be performed under the responsibility of the Sponsor. 
Data from the eCRFs are entered into the study database using EDC (Electronic Data Capture).  
Subsequently, the information entered into the database is systematically checked  
- On line with automatic checks 
- Off line by [CONTACT_229916].

It is the responsibility of the CRA to regularly check that the protocol is being adhered to and 
that the e-CRFs are being filled in correctly through comparison with the source data. 
The investigator agrees to cooperate with the CRA in order to resolve any problems identified 
by [CONTACT_229925]. 
The CRA will monitor the study progress at the following times: 
− Before the initiation of the study to visit the site and determine the site’s ability to 
conform with the requirements of the protocol ( as applicable); 
− At the initiation visit, the investigator may only enroll his first subject after the CRA 
has completed this visit; 
− During the study the number of monitoring visits will be adapted to suit recruitment 
at each centre; 
− A closing visit will be conducted at the end of the trial.

should take adequate measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents. In the event of accidental destruction, the investigator must notify Onxeo (formerly 
known as BioAlliance Pharma) immediately. The following essential clinical study documents 
must be maintained: 
− Signed informed consent documents for all subjects 
− Screening log and enrollment log 
− Record of all communication between the investigator and IEC 
− Composition of the IEC or other applicable statement 
− Record of all communications between the investigator and Sponsor/CRO  
− List of sub investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the

− Drug-accountability records 
− Record of any body fluids or tissues retained 
− All other source documents (i.e., subject records, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], laboratory 
records, etc.) 
− All other documents as listed in Section 8 of the consolidated guideline on GCP 
(Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial) 
Essential clinical study documents shall be retained for at least 15 years following the date a 
marketing application is approved for the drug with the indication for which it is being 
investigated, or, if no application is to be submitted or if the application is not approved for 
such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and the appropriate 
regulatory authorities are notified. 
These documents shall be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_229926] (formerly known as 
BioAlliance Pharma). The investigator must, therefore, obtain approval in writing from the 
Sponsor prior to destruction of any records. 
The investigator shall notify Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) prior to any 
change in the location or status of any essential, clinical-study documents. Onxeo (formerly

13 ETHICS, REGULATORY & LEGAL CONSIDERATION 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local 
country requirements, the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki, as amended from 
time to time and the rules of International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) . 
 
13.1 Ethical aspects 
Research is designed to benefit society and Public Health by [CONTACT_31283].  
There is no guarantee, though, that the individual participant will personally benefit from study 
participation. The study treatment may result in an improvement of the disease or there may be 
no improvement at all. This is clearly described in the participant information. 
Overall it is considered that the study does not cause undue constrain to the participants.  
On this basis it is considered that the potential usefulness of the study exceeds the 
inconvenience and risks, and is reasonable to implement the study. 
 
13.2 Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) 
Documented approval from the appropriate IEC will be obtained for the participating centre 
prior to study initiation, according to GCP, local laws, regulations, and organizations. When 
necessary, an extension, amendment, or renewal of the IEC approval must be obtained and also 
forwarded to the Sponsor. The IEC must supply to the Sponsor, upon request, a list of the IEC 
members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that the IEC is organized and operates 
according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_276652], evaluation, and 
documentation of this study are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and investigator abide by 
[CONTACT_229927]. The study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and 
regulation(s). This may include an inspection by [CONTACT_229928]/or regulatory 
authority representatives at any time. The investigator must agree to the inspection of study-
related records by [CONTACT_46962]/Sponsor representatives, and must allow direct 
access to source documents by [CONTACT_46962]/Sponsor representatives. 
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by [CONTACT_229929]. However, the investigator may implement a 
deviation form or a change of the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial 
subjects without prior IEC/Sponsor approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As soon as possible, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and, if appropriate, the proposed protocol

fully explained and documented by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
13.4 Regulatory Authority Approvals/Authorizations 
Regulatory Authority approvals/authorizations/notifications, where required, must be in place 
and fully documented prior to study start. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_276653] Information and Consent 
A core information and Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be reviewed with each subject. Prior 
to the beginning of the study, the investigator must have the IEC written approval of the written 
ICF and any other written information to be provided to patients. The informed consent should 
be in accordance with the current revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP 
guidelines, and Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) policy. The written approval 
of the IEC together with the approved (signed and dated) patient information/ICFs must be filed 
in the study file. 
The principal investigator, or co-investigators licensed to do so, will provide the oral 
information and simultaneously will go through the written participant information and ICF. 
The conversation will be conducted in a quiet and undisturbed environment at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Appropriate time for reflection (ideally at least 24 hours) will be given. If needed or requested, 
the patient could have a second meeting or seek for another opi[INVESTIGATOR_229867]. 
Written ICF must be obtained from each subject before any study-specific procedures take 
place. Participation in the study and the date of informed consent given by [CONTACT_229930]’s file. The ICF should be written in a language in 
which the subject is fluent. 
The investigator must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated 
benefits, and potential hazards of the trial and any discomfort it may entail. Subjects will be 
informed that they are free to not participate in the trial and that they may withdraw consent to 
participate at any time. They will be told that refusal to participate in the study will not prejudice 
future treatment. They will also be told that their records may be examined by [CONTACT_229931]. Subjects must be given the opportunity to ask 
questions. After this explanation and before entry into the trial, consent should be appropriately 
recorded by [CONTACT_19720]’s dated signature. This document should be prepared in 
duplicate, one for the subject and the other for the investigator. The investigator must retain his 
copy in his archives for a period of [ADDRESS_276654] was enrolled into the study or the reason for failure to enroll.

• case report forms (CRF) 
• X-ray images 
• radiological reports, etc. 
As the location of source data could vary from one investigator site to another depending on 
the organisation of the site and/or the investigator, some source data may be recorded directly 
in the Case Report Form (CRF). This corresponds, for example, to specific data requested by 
[CONTACT_229933]/or in case of data usually not fully described and/or collected in routine 
practice (e.g. ethnic origine, classification of AE / pain / other according to specific scale, body 
mass index, body surface aera, calculated creatinin clairance, disease staging..). These data 
collected and validated in the CRF are considered as source document. 
In addition, all efforts have to be made to maintain the anonymity and confidentiality of medical

It is important to read the entire content of this section prior to the preparation of this 
medicinal product. 
Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout handling of DT since no 
preservative is present. 
Caution should be exercised in the handling and preparation of DT. The use of gloves is 
required. 
The preparation for intravenous infusion of DT is performed according to two main steps 
(reconstitution and filtration) as described hereafter.  
 
Step 1 – Reconstitution of DT powder 
 C alculate the dose of DT and determine the number of vials needed, based upon the 
recommended dose and the patient’s body surface area (BSA), according to the tables 
below.  
 G et the vials for reconstitution out of the refrigerator.  
 K eep the vials for reconstitution at room temperature for at least 30 min before 
reconstitution. 
 R econstitute each vial containing HCl Doxorubicin 10 mg with 25 mL of 2.5% glucose 
as follows : 
o Remove the flip-off seal of each vial. 
o Insert a vent needle through the rubber cap. 
o Open the vent needle protective cap. 
o Add 25 ml of sterile glucose 2.5% for injection using a 30 ml syringe to each 
DT vial, to yield a suspension containing 0.4 mg/ml of doxorubicin HCl. The 
addition of glucose may induce the formation of a foam;  
o Close the vent needle and shake each vial for a minimum of [ADDRESS_276671] the vial for particulate matter and 
continue shaking until complete dispersion is obtained.   Once reconstituted the 
resulted nanoparticle suspension for infusion of DT is a red-orange 
homogeneous suspension. 
Step 2 - Double filtration of the DT suspension through 5 µm filter and 1.2 µm 
filter into a sterile bag  
Each individual vial has to be filtered using one unique set of 5 µm and 1.2 µm filters and 
30 mL syringe.  
 C arefully open the protective cap of the vent needle. 
 W ithdraw the suspension of DT into a sterile 30 mL syringe. During the collection of 
reconstitued suspensions, pay attention to avoid the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_229873]

wide inter-individual variability, which require evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile in 
patients with HCC.  
In this study, patients will be treated with doses at 20 or 30 mg/m² of Doxorubicin Transdrug™, 
repeated every [ADDRESS_276673], to determine the population pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Secondly, the objective is to analyse the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic 
correlation with DT efficacy and toxicity, and to evaluate inter-Cycles AUC stability.  
 
Due to its specific formulation ( ), late 
exposure (>48 hours after DT infusion) has to be evaluated  in order to be able to characterize 
the pharmacokinetic profile of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol. 
For this purpose, blood sampling will be performed at the first and third treatment Cycles. For 
patients still on study treatement after Cycle 3, an optional and limited pharmacokinetic blood 
sampling will be done at Cycle 4, Cycle 6 (e.g. every 2 cycles until the end of study treatment).  
Blood collection (10mL/sample) will have to be taken from a peripheral vein. DT will be 
infused at D1 of each cycle over 6 hours through intravenous route. 
At Cycle 1 and Cycle 3: 
Blood samples will be collected at the following times on D1, D2, D3, D4, D8, D14 and D28 
during the 1st and the 3rd Cycle of DT treatment, to perform total and free doxorubicin and 
dox

Blood Sampling procedures: 
The blood will be taken in 10 ml EDTA tubes. Blood samples will be immediately put into a 
glass of ice + water after sampling. Then,centrifugation will be performed immediately  at 
3000 rpm, at +4°C ±  2°C for [ADDRESS_276674] 1.5ml of plasma, and then  immediately frozen at -80°C; Plasma can be 
alternatively kept at -20°C if -80°C is not feasible .  
The samples may be centrifuged individually, after the sample is collected. 
Each sample shall be identified as follows, using a label that is resistant to the storage 
temperature of -80°C:  
- the protocol number BA2011/03/04, 
- the centre number, 
- the identification number of the patient, 
- the theoretical sampling time, 
- the date of sampling. 
A check-list will be kept, including the exact identification of each sample and the real sampling 
times.  
Onxeo (formerly known as BioAlliance Pharma) will ensure dispatching of samples to third 
parties in charge of doxorubicin and its metabolite dosage. Study samples will be transferred

Confidential Page 114 / [ADDRESS_276675] Criteria (Lencioni and Llovet 2010[53]) 
 
Tumour response and progression will be assessed by [CONTACT_229938] (RECIST) guideline version 1.[ADDRESS_276676] 
Critera for HCC (Eisenhauer 2009[54]).  
 
RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
Target lesions: the number of lesions to select as target lesions is a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those 
with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements.   
At baseline, the sum of the diameters: longuest diameters (LD) for extra nodal target lesions 
and short axis diameters (SAD) for nodal lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum LD. This baseline sum LD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_229939]. 
Non target lesions: all other lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout the study. 
 
RECIST 1.1 response criteria used to determine the response on target lesions: 
Evaluation of target lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR): Disappearance of all targets extra nodal lesions and the regression of all 
nodal lesions to < 10 mm SAD. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease 
(PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline if that 
is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The 
appearance of one or more new lesions is considered progression. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while 
on study. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions  
Complete Response 
(CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumour 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non pathological in size ( < 10 
mm short axis)

Modified RECIST: 
Modified RECIST (mRECIST) criteria are considered as the best criteria to evaluate the 
efficacy of treatment of HCC. mRECIST criteria are endorsed by [CONTACT_229940] (Lencioni and Llovet, 2010). The definitions used in the mRECIST 
are described below: 
Target lesions: the lesion should be located in the LIVER:  
− Be classified as a RECIST measurable lesion (in at least one dimension as 1 cm or 
more); 
− Be suitable for repeat measurement; 
− Show intratumoural arterial enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. 
mRECIST response criteria used to determine the response on target lesions: 
− Complete response  (CR)  = Disappearance of any intratumoural arterial enhancement 
in all target lesions; 
Doxorubicin Transdrug™ 
Protocol BA2011/03/04                                       Version 7.0, July 27th, 2017 
 
 
Confidential Page 116 / 123 − Partial response  (PR)  = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable 
(enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum 
of the diameters of target lesions; 
− Progressive Disease (PD)  = An increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of 
viable (enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters 
of viable (enhancing) target lesions recorded since treatment started; 
− Stable Disease (SD)  = Any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or 
progressive disease.  
Note: Infiltrative–type HCC should be defined as non target lesion when the mass shows ill-
defined, not suitable for repeat measurements. The same applies for HCC lesions previously 
treated with local or systemic treatments. They may or not be considered as target lesions 
according to delineation and suitability for repeat measurements. 
mRECIST response criteria used to determine the response on non target lesions are the same 
as RECIST 1.1 response criteria. However, as for target lesions, tumour necrosis should be 
taken into account when assessing the response to nontarget lesions. The disappearance of any 
intratumoural arterial enhancement in nontarget lesions should be considered equivalent to the 
disapperance of nontarget lesions. Likewise, the persistence of intratumoural arterial 
enhancement in one or more nontarget lesions should be considered equivalent to the 
persistence of one or more nontarget lesions and therefore declared incomplete response/stable 
disease.  
Special recommendations can be made: 
− Portal vein thrombosis should be considered a non measurable lesion due to the 
difficulty in performing consistent measurements of the malignant thrombus during the 
course of the treatment; 
− Porta hepatis lymph node can be considered as malignant if the lymph node axis is at 
least 20 mm; 
− Pleural effusion or ascites: cytopathologic confirmation of the neoplastic nature of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment is required when the measurable 
tumour has met criteria for response or stable disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis is a 
rare event in HCC). 
New lesions are: 
− A newly detected hepatic nodule is classified as HCC when its longest diameter is at 
least 1 cm and the nodule shows the typi[INVESTIGATOR_229877] (hypervascularisation in the arterial phase with washout in the venous or late 
venous phase); 
− Liver lesions larger than [ADDRESS_276677] 
1 cm interval growth in subsequent scans;

Confidential Page 117 / 123 − Individual radiological event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time 
it was 1st detected by [CONTACT_229941].   
 
Overall tumoural response takes into account all possible combinations of tumoural responses 
on target and non target lesions. The guidelines for the evaluation of overall response are similar 
using RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_276678] for HCC and as shown in table below.

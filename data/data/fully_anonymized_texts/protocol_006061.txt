1.  Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research  
  
Monitored anesthesia care with procedural sedation has increased dramatically over the past 15 
years, driven by [CONTACT_606796], cardiology (both interventional 
and electrophysiology), and interventional radiology.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_606765], current monitors of respi[INVESTIGATOR_606766].  Underappreciated hypoventilation puts 
patients at risk for hypoxia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374], cardiopulmonary arrest, and other adverse events.   
While pulse oximetry is an outstan ding and required monitor of oxygen saturation, it is a poor 
monitor of ventilation in patients receiving supplemental oxygen.  The American Society of  
Anesthesiologists Monitoring Standards recognizes the underlying contribution of hypoventilation to 
hypoxia and adverse events by [CONTACT_606797] -tidal capnography for procedural sedation.  
While well intentioned, end -tidal capnography is helpful in determining respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], it appears 
to be insufficient for detection of hypoventilation  during procedural sedation.  In fact the quantitative 
value may paradoxically decrease as the degree of hypoventilation increases.  Further, the 
mechanism of anesthetic induced hypoventilation during monitored anesthesia care with procedural 
sedation is not entir ely understood or appreciated.    
  
Fortunately, other FDA approved monitors are available that can non -invasively monitor additional  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_606767].  The ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606768] -cleared 
device that allows acqu isition of quantitative values of respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) tidal volume (TV), and 
minute ventilation (MV), and has a signature [CONTACT_606816][INVESTIGATOR_606769] 
(Respi[INVESTIGATOR_248683], Inc. Waltham, MA).  Transcutaneous CO 2 (PtcCO 2) monitoring is a non -invasive 
method for continuous monitoring of overall ventilation that closely approximates arterial carbon 
dioxide values (PaCO 2) obtained from blood samples (SenTec, Bern, Switzerland).  Further, 
processed electroencephalography (EEG ) using bispectral index (BIS) is a non -invasive monitor that 
has been described as a marker for depth of anesthesia during general endotracheal anesthesia GETA 
and procedural sedation (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN.   Together, these devices will allow a mor e 
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_803864] alleviate obstruction and decrease 
hypoventilation, it is a potentially very impor tant finding for patient care.   
  
In addition, this study aims to explore a novel mechanism that may account for individual variability 
in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_606770].  Short chain fatty acids are produced by [CONTACT_606798] (non -pathologica l bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract).  Low levels of these compounds 
have been associated with hypertension and obesity, as well as hypertension in people with sleep 
apnea.  Receptors that are activated by [CONTACT_606799], where their activation appears to stimulate respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  We will measure serum levels 
of short chain fatty acids, and hypothesize that lower concentrations will be associated with greater 
anesthesia induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] a nd higher levels will be protective.  If short chain fatty 
acids are shown to be associated with a protective affect on respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], this could open 
the door to an entirely new understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to respi[INVESTIGATOR_606771], but also those involved with obstructive sleep apnea.  In addition, it 
could raise the possibility that short chain fatty acids could be administered as a protective 
treatment.  
  
2.  Objectives (include all primary and secondary o bjectives)   
  
Specific Aim 1: To test whether nasal CPAP reduces the incidence of hypoxia during procedural sedation 
with propofol as compared to usual care.  Hypothesis: A randomized clinical trial of an intervention to 
reduce airway obstruction (nasal CP AP) will d ecrease the incidence of hypoxic events (<90% ≥ 15s)  
compared to usual care in patients undergoing procedural sedation.  
  
Specific Aim 2: To determine the duration, magnitude and mechanism of hypoventilation and its 
association with hypoxia in subjects undergoing procedural sedation. Hypothesis: By [CONTACT_606800], transcutaneous CO2 and sedation depth while measuring end -tidal CO2, it will be possible to 
relate ventilation to hypoxic events, sedation depth and airway obstruction.   Further, reductions in the 
incidence of hypoxia in the intervention group will be consistent with the hypothesis that loss of airway 
motor tone underlies hypoventilation and associated hypoxia.  
  
Specific Aim 3: To characterize the physiologic state when end -tidal capnography is insufficient for 
detecting hypoventilation.  Hypothesis: The amplitude of the capnographic signal is not representative of 
the adequacy of ventilation due to artifact from loss of airway motor tone during procedural sedation.  
  
Specific Aim 4: To determine if there short chain fatty acid serum concentration is protective for 
procedural sedation induced hypoventilation, obstruction and hypoxia:  Hypothesis: Higher concentrat ion

  of short chain fatty acids will be reduce the risk of hypoventilation, obstruction, and hypoxia and suggests 
a link between respi[INVESTIGATOR_606772].    
  
3.  Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experienc e with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
  
There has been an explosion in the number of anesthetics administered outside of traditional operating 
rooms in the last decade.  The rise in such non -operati ng room anesthetics (NORA) has been driven by 
[CONTACT_606801] (GE), interventional radiology, and cardiology.1 Increased 
anesthesia support for GE procedures appears to be the primary driver for the rise in NORA.1 The increas e 
is huge – between 2003 and 2009, anesthesia support for GE for Medicare patient s grew from 13.5% to 
30.2%, while anesthesia support for patients undergoing GE procedures with private insurers increased 
from 13.6% to 35.5%.[ADDRESS_803865] a large number of 
patients.  In several retrospective studies, cardiopulmonary events occurred in up to 11.7/[ADDRESS_803866].15 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_606773].16  The rate of hypoxia is considered as a marker for unsafe sedation practices in 
endoscopy suites.17  However, the true rate of hypoxia associated with sedation for endoscopic procedures  
is unknown and ranges from 1% to 70% in the literature.18,19,[ADDRESS_803867] been reported.21  A 
recent study from the Netherlands reported a hypoxia rate in average risk patients during sedation for 
colonoscopy without oxygen supplementation of 55.6%.[ADDRESS_803868] and found rates of 
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007    
Page 4 of 14  
  hypoxia of 1.8% versus 13.5%.23  In another study from the Cleveland C linic evaluating the STOP -BANG 
sleep apnea scoring system, subjects with STOP -BANG score >3 had a rate of hypoxia of 16.9% versus 
11.2% in the STOP -BANG score <3 group, but this did not reach significance in this underpowered 
study.24  However, higher BMI was associated with more sedation -related adverse events (SRAE).     
  
Hypoxia is related to both centrally mediated changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_606774], direct 
effects of the anesthetic agents on motor function, and diminished airway ton e due to sleep or sedation 
(change in state). Furthermore, sedative agents decrease airway tone and increase the risk of obstruction, 
while blunting the normal arousal that occurs in response to hypercarbia and hypoxia during obstruction 
events during natu ral sleep.25,[ADDRESS_803869], alleviating the obstruction 
from oropharyngeal soft tissue that occurs during sleep and under sedation, and has been advocated in 
patients wit h obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP at home.28  Positive pressure ventilation using a nasal mask 
has also been shown to be effective.29  The Supernova mask (RMD medical, Tucson, AZ) is FDA approved 
commercially available nasal mask that can  be attached to a  standard anesthesia circuit or Jackson Reese, 
and allows for up to 30 l/min of oxygen delivery, making it convenient for use in procedural sedation.  It 
can supply CPAP as well as supplemental positive pressure breaths by [CONTACT_606802].  
  
During general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA), airway obstruction is by[CONTACT_606803] (EtCO 2) generally approximates arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2).  During monitored anesthesia 
care, end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2) monitoring is routinely utilized as a qualitati ve marker of respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], but quantitative evaluation to identify hypoventilation is usually not possible by [CONTACT_606804] (“green mask). Likewise, minute ventilation is not routinely monitored. In fact, ETCO2 
reading often decreases during hypoventilation with opi[INVESTIGATOR_358983], while respi[INVESTIGATOR_606775] (see figure, attached).30  Still, ETCO2 monitoring remains an important  measure of respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and has been shown to decrease the rate of hypoxia during pro cedural sedation for colonoscopy from 
32% to 18%.[ADDRESS_803870] obstruction will  be assessed using the 
commercially available ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606776] (Exspi[CONTACT_119980], Respi[INVESTIGATOR_606777], Waltham MA).  Previous studies 
using the ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606778].33 Transcutaneous carbon dioxide has 
proven to closely approximate to arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2), and in fact more closely reflects PaCO 2 
then end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2).35 Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO 2) has been shown to 
closely correlate with paCO 2.  After approximately 5 minutes of calibration time, it appears to track 
changes in PaCO 2 with a lag time of 30 seconds to 2 minutes.  In our experience using the TcCO 2 monitor 
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_803871] found the device to consistently track within 5 points 
of the PaCO 2. (Sentec, Therwil, Switzerland).   
  
Depth of anesthesia using processed electroencephalography has been described as a marker for depth of 
anesthesia during GETA and MAC with sedation.  Depth of anesthesia using bispectral index (BIS) has 
been relatively well established and is known to corr elate well with other measures of depth of 
anesthesia.36,37  We will use bispectral index (BIS) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) as a marker of 
state.  In addition, all clinical data utilized in routine practice will be recorded, including drug dosing, 
method of drug administration, and length of stay in the recovery area.   
  
Recently, alterations in the gut microbiome have been implicated in obesity, hypertension, obstructive sleep 
apnea induced hypertension, and airway smooth muscle  tone that may rel ate to reactive airway disease.38-40  
In general, lower short chain fatty acid levels are associated with pathology, and higher levels appear to be  
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_803872] lower short chain fatty acid levels.   
  
 
with minute ventilation and transcutaneous CO 2 to better understand the  total effects of sedation on 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Thus, the study will also serve  to evaluate which mode(s) of respi[INVESTIGATOR_606779].  Further, we suspect that the 
amplitude o f ETCO [ADDRESS_803873] the degree of respi[INVESTIGATOR_606780].  In 
addition, we will measure serum short chain fatty acid concentrations as a predictor and possible 
mechanism for differences in individual variability in anesthesia induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341].   
  
   
  
4.  Study Procedures   
Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures (distinguish research 
procedures from those that are part of routine care).  
  
This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing oxygen delivery with nasal CPAP versus 
standard care (d elivery via nasal cannula or standard facemask) during propofol -based sedation for 
endoscopic procedures.  The primary outcome will be the rate of oxygen desaturation below 90% 
for ≥  15 seconds.  Secondary outcomes are the de gree of hypoventilation measure d by [CONTACT_606805] (TcCO 2), the change in minute ventilation (MV) and obstructive 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_606781] -based respi[INVESTIGATOR_606782], and depth of anesthesia 
measured by [CONTACT_606806] (BIS) monitoring.  The ade quacy of standard ETCO [ADDRESS_803874] maneuvers or rescue, length of stay in the recovery area, and any 
complications that are identified.   
  
Subjects will be recruited from the patient population scheduled for MAC with sedation for 
gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures at the Johns  Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_606783] 
2. Patients scheduled for colonoscopy, EGD (including EGD with biopsy, ultrasound, PEG

  placement, or enteroscopy ) or combined upper and lower endoscopic procedures predicted to last 
longer than [ADDRESS_803875] our recruitment to patients with documented OSA o r a BMI ≥ 30, but we 
not limit it to just those patients.  Written, informed consent will be obtained from interested eligible 
subjects or their representative.    
  
As part of routine care, all patients undergoing MAC with sedation receive an IV in the pr eoperative 
area.  During the placement of this IV up to [ADDRESS_803876], BIS and TcC O2 
on the forehead.  All enrolled subjects will be connected to the ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606784] (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_606785], Inc., Waltham MA) and digital respi[INVESTIGATOR_606786], TV, and RR measurements will be 
collected on all [ADDRESS_803877] to measure the amount of air moving in and out of the lung in real time.  
Minute ventilation will also be correlated to transcutaneous CO 2 as measured by [CONTACT_606807] (SenTec AG, Therwil, Switzerland). Transcutaneous CO 2 (Ptc CO 2) monitoring 
provides a noninvasive technique allowing continuous monitoring of ventila tion. It is based on 
arterialization of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_606787] –
Severinghaus electrodes.  The sensor will be calibrated, applied to the patient’s forehead, cheek, 
or chest, and warmed to a constant surfac e temperature of 42 °C.  In adults, these temperatures 
are safe for up to 24h, and the procedures performed in this study are generally less than [ADDRESS_803878], routine monitors placed by [CONTACT_333618], including blood 
pressure, ECG, pulse oximetry, and EtCO 2.  Subjects will be randomized to either 1) receive oxygen 
by [CONTACT_606808] (nCPAP) with CPAP of 10 mmHg or 2) standard oxy gen therapy.  Subjects 
randomized to nCPAP will have a nasal facemask (SuperNOVA) placed approximately 5 minutes 
prior to the procedural start.  The mask attaches to the anesthesia circuit, oxygen flow will be set at 
10 lpm, and the CPAP of 10 will be set by [CONTACT_606809] “pop -off” valve to [ADDRESS_803879] that 95% of airway obstruction can be alleviated with a CPAP of 7.1, and it is 
convenient marked on the anesthesia “pop -off” valve, ensuring standardization.[ADDRESS_803880] access to all of the 
routine monitors, they will be blinded to the research monitor data, which will include TcCO 2 
monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_606782] (RVM), and BIS.  Researchers analyzing the data will be 
blinded to the intervention.   
  
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_803881].  Further, the duration of the endoscopic procedure and any 
anesthesia related interruptions will be recorded.  The study duration will be entirely within the time 
period of the patie nts’ visit to the endoscopy suite.  All study monitors will be removed when the 
participants are discharged to home or transferred to the ward depending on the clinical routine or 
needs.    
  
Each subject will be assigned a study number to allow connection  of the demographic data and 
clinical characteristics for comparison with the physiological data.   All analog data for vital signs 
will be digitized using a digital to analog converter and processed using commercially available 
software.  Medication data and length of stay data will be collected directly from EPIC .   
Additionally, data relating to any respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343] (decreased RR, oxygen saturation, airway 
obstruction, etc.) requiring intervention will be recorded.  Raw data from the ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606788] r, actigraph device, and transcutaneous monitor will be stored in a separate file with 
the file name [CONTACT_606817].  There will be no patient identifiers in 
these files.    
  
a. Study duration and number of study visits required of res earch participants.  
Enrollment and data collection will begin after IRB approval. For each subject, the study will be 
performed entirely within their visit to the endoscopy suite.  No additional visits will be required of 
study participants.    
  
b. Blinding , including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
The clinical team will have access to all of the routine monitors, but they will be blinded to the 
research monitor data, which will include TcCO2 monitoring, respi[INVESTIGATOR_606789] 
(RVM), and BIS.  For practicality, providers and patients will not be blinded to the intervention 
because application of the nasal mask is obvious. Researchers analyzing the data will be blinded to 
the intervention.   
  
c. Justification of why participants will not receive routine care or will have current therapy 
stopped.  
Except for the application of study monitors to the skin and nasal CPAP in the treatment group, 
all subjects will receive routine anesthesia care to facilitate the planned pr ocedure.  The 
procedure will not be effected by [CONTACT_9286].  
  
d. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group. Not applicable  
  
e. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria.  
If a case is aborted because of procedural problems and no anesthesia was provided or the 
duration of the procedure was too short to obtain data, the participant would meet criteria for 
removal from the study.  However, if an anesthetic requires change to an alternate anesthesia 
plan (such as conversion to general anesthesia) this will be recorded in the analysis.    
  
f. Description of what happens to participants receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant’s participation in the study ends prematur ely.  
If a participant’s participation ends prematurely, they will receive routine care.

6.  Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.   
The ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_606791] -approved device that allows acquisition of quantitative values 
of minute ventilation (MV) (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_248683], Inc. Waltham).  Unlike currently u tilized 
ECG derived RR, the device’s detection algorithm has been tuned to identify not just the 
onset of a new breath (RR) but also to estimate the thoracic size changes to provide a 
measurement of TV.  
  
Transcutaneous CO 2 (Ptc CO 2) monitoring provides a  noninvasive technique allowing 
continuous monitoring of ventilation. It is based on arterialization of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_606792] –Severinghaus electrodes.  
Transcutaneous CO [ADDRESS_803883] been used in pati ents as young as neonates and a good 
correlation between Ptc CO 2 and PaCO 2 has been found in adults and children.  
(Berkenbosch JW, Tobias JD. Crit Care Med 2002 30:1024 –1027. Herrejo´n A, Inchaurraga 
I, et al. Arch Bronconeumol 2006 42:225 –229).  The BIS monitor is an FDA approved, 
noninvasive monitor that can provide a validated monitor for depth of anesthesia and sedation.    
  
The SuperNovaTM is an FDA approved nasal anesthesia mask that can generate CPAP to 
maintain airway patency, provide ventilator s upport, and provide rescue nasal ventilation during 
procedural sedation and during the perioperative period.  The most likely risk is a red mark on 
the face from the mask, dry nose and mouth, and the very unlikely risk of nose bleed.  (In 
fact, a common re scue during standard therapy is to place a nasopharyngeal airway, which 
carries a higher risk of nose bleed).   CPAP and ventilator interventions associated with the 
nasal mask carry similar risks to interventions that may be required in patients 
undergoin g sedation who require additional ventilator support.    
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -
FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant 
populations are changed. Not ap plicable

7.  Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.    
The primary outcome will be the rate of hypoxia below 90% for ≥ 15 seconds.   
   
b. Secondary outcome variables. Secondary outcomes will include change in respi[INVESTIGATOR_401528] (tidal volume, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], minute ventilation, obstructive events), 
hypovent ilation by [CONTACT_606810] 2, EtCO 2, and depth of anesthesia by [CONTACT_231032], as well as demographic 
differneces.  Demographic information to the occurrence of hypoxic events will be analyzed 
with logistic regression.    
  
Statistical plan including sample size justification a nd interim data analysis.   
Power analysis is based on a previous German study in the literature, of patients undergoing  
upper and lower endoscopy with hypoxia rates of 13.5% with standard care and 1.8% with 
application of nasopharyngeal airway.  Using th ese figures to perform a power analysis for the 
primary outcome of hypoxia bellow 90%, with alpha 0.05 and power of 0.9, approximately 109 
subjects in each arm or a total of 218 subjects will be needed.  In order to obtain 109 completed 
subjects in each ar m and to allow for those participants with incomplete datasets (e.g. monitor 
failure), we will enroll 120 subjects in each arm and a total of 240 subjects.  
  
Frequency data will be analyzed with Fisher’s Exact Test, ordered categorical data will be 
analyz ed with the rank sum test, and continuous data will be analyzed with regression or 
equivalent techniques.  Therefore, our primary outcome as to the incidence of hypoxia in each 
arm of the study will be determined using Fisher’s exact test. All time series data from multiple 
sources will be aligned using the associated time stamp with the aid of the program data 
manipulation capabilities in Mathematica 11.  Longitudinal analysis will be performed using a 
mixed model approach, initially with random intercepts  alone, with the addition of nonlinear 
terms and interaction as indicated by [CONTACT_606811].  Throughout, findings will be  
considered significant for p < 0.[ADDRESS_803884] 20 subjects to ensure complete data collection and to run a batched analysis of 
SCFA to evaluate  this aim.  An interim data analysis will be done after ~[ADDRESS_803885], there was a risk of discomfort or skin burning in infants with the use of transcutaneous 
CO 2 sensors. However, current moni toring technology differs from previous sensors in the use of 
lower temperatures (42 °C as opposed to 45 –47 °C) which has been shown to dramatically decrease 
the risk for skin burning (Storre JH, Steurer B, et al. CHEST 132:1810 –1816).  In adults, the

this study, sensors will be in place for significantly shorter period of time  
The SuperNovaTM is a nasal anesthesia mask that can generate CPAP to maintain airway  patency, 
provide ventilator support, and provide rescue nasal ventilation during procedural sedation and 
perioperative period.   The most likely risk is a red mark on the face from the mask.  Dry nose 
and mouth may occur, as can dry eyes, and a very unlike ly risk of nose bleed.  (In fact, a 
common rescue during standard therapy is to place a nasopharyngeal airway, which carries a 
higher risk of nose bleed).   CPAP and ventilator interventions associated with the nasal mask 
carry similar risks to interventio ns that may be required in patients undergoing sedation who 
require additional ventilator support.   b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
Transcutaneous CO [ADDRESS_803886] managed by 
[CONTACT_606813] e Medicine.   Demographic and clinical data 
will be only linked to the random study number.

9.  Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society.  
This study may provide no benefit to any particular patient.  
  
The study may benefit society if a better method of delivering oxygen is demonstrated for a 
procedure that is perform ed in millions of patients every year.  Further, the study may help 
us to better understand how patients breathe under anesthesia, which may help us to 
improve delivery of anesthesia care in the future.  
  
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensati on for participants including possible total compensation, proposed bonus, 
and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol. None

a. Detail costs of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants and id entify who will 
pay for them.  
There will no costs for the monitors (the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56756] a separate supply) or the SuperNova masks

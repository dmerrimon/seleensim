Statistical AnalysisSample Size Determination: The sample size justification is based on the 
primary analysis. We consider a study design with a total sample of n=50 
patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to the Botox and non-Botox 
treatment arms) and an interim analysis at n 1=30. The performance of this 
study design and decision rules (described in the primary analysis) was 
assessed via simulation study.
Randomization: Patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_969119] will be developed by [CONTACT_712441].
Primary and Secondary Analyses:
Primary Analysis: A recent study demonstrated that patients that received 
Botox had a delayed gastric emptying rate of approximately 30% as 
compared to a complication rate in historical controls of 70% in patients 
that did not receive botulinum toxin (Botox) (1). A retrospective review of 
patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy at Roswell Park 
Cancer Institute indicates that the rate of postoperative delayed gastric 
emptying is even lower. Therefore, the primary objective is to determine if 
intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive 
esophagectomy decreases postoperative occurrence of delayed gastric 
emptying. The primary outcome is delayed gastric emptying (assessed 
radiographically by [CONTACT_712442]) which is treated as a 
dichotomous variable.
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_712443], 
smoking status, and diabetes; and randomized in a 1:1 to the botulinum and 
non-botulinum treatment arms. The primary objective will be assessed 
using the intent-to-treat principle and a one-sided Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) s test about the following hypotheses:
, 𝐻0:𝜃≥1 
𝐻𝐴:θ<1
where θ is the common odds ratio (COR) for the odds of delayed gastric 
emptying rates for the botulinum versus non-botulinum treatment arms. A 
one-sided test is performed as the rate of delayed gastric emptying is 
expected to decrease in the botulinum arm over the non-botulinum arm; that 
is we expect θ < 1.

12/03/[ADDRESS_969125] common cause of death from cancer in men in the United 
States (U.S.). An estimated 16,910 new cases will be diagnosed in the U.S.in 2016, resulting in 
15,690 deaths (2). Multimodality treatment for esophageal carcinoma includes chemotherapy, 
radiation, and surgery in the form of esophagectomy. During an esophagectomy, a majority of the 
esophagus is resected, and the stomach is narrowed to form a tube, creating a “gastric conduit” 
that is then relocated from the abdominal cavity into the thoracic cavity. Because both vagus nerves 
are resected with the specimen, it is theorized that patients may develop gastric dysmotility and 
pylorospasm, with resulting delayed gastric emptying or gastric outlet obstruction. These are both 
major complications, as they may lead to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712408], inability to tolerate oral intake 
and maintain adequate nutrition, and the need for additional procedures.
One of the major controversial issues currently is how to prevent delayed gastric emptying. Several 
methods have been implemented to improve gastric emptying during open esophagectomy, with 
inconclusive results. In the minimally invasive setting, surgeons are utilizing intra-pyloric 
botulinum toxin injection to prevent pyloric spasm and thus minimize gastric outlet obstruction. 
Retrospective studies comparing botulinum toxin to historical controls demonstrate inconclusive 
results regarding the ability of botulinum toxin to decrease rates of delayed gastric emptying. This 
study aims to test whether it is necessary to use botulinum toxin as a pyloric drainage procedure 
during minimally invasive esophagectomy. We hypothesize that it is not effective in preventing 
delayed gastric emptying, and that performing botulinum injection adds cost and time to an already 
lengthy procedure, without decreasing the procedure complication rate or benefitting patient 
outcomes.
Improving gastric emptying is crucial to not only maintaining independent nutrition, but also in 
preventing devastating pulmonary complications including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712409]. 
In the era of open esophagectomy, several types of drainage procedures were employed during 
esophagectomy in an attempt to prevent gastric outlet obstruction. These include pyloroplasty 
(full-thickness longitudinal incision closed transversely), pyloromyotomy (incision through 
muscle only, preserving integrity of mucosal layer), and finger fracture (manual pressure on the 
pylorus, causing muscle disruption). Other surgeons elected not to perform any type of drainage 
procedure. Advocates of the “no drainage” procedure believed that surgical manipulation of the 
pylorus during drainage procedures leads to short-term inflammation and edema, which may cause 
gastric outlet obstruction despi[INVESTIGATOR_712410]. In 
addition, pyloric drainage procedures may lead to dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_80565], bile reflux, or leak at the 
pyloroplasty site, leading to intra-abdominal or intra-thoracic sepsis and even death (3). Possible 
long-term side effects include scar or stricture formation. Alternatively, no drainage procedure 
may cause gastric outlet obstruction, leading to inability to tolerate oral diet, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and 
pneumonia. Whether or not to perform a pyloric drainage procedure is controversial.
With newer minimally invasive esophagectomy techniques, many surgeons omitted drainage 
procedures, as they are technically challenging to perform minimally invasively. Other surgeons 
use botulinum injection at the pylorus as a minimally invasive pyloric drainage procedure, with

12/03/[ADDRESS_969126] to the procedure, approximately 
$1,000 per treatment (1). Botulinum toxin injection into the pyloric sphincter has a pharmacologic 
duration of three to five months (4).
There is much controversy as to the optimal surgical management of the pylorus. A recent review 
of studies performed on this topic in the past ten years concluded that pyloric drainage procedures 
were associated with a non-significant trend towards delayed gastric emptying and biliary reflux, 
while not affecting the incidence of dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (5). Two other meta-analyses supported pyloric 
drainage, showing decreased rates of gastric outlet obstruction and improved gastric emptying (6, 
7). These meta-analyses reviewed randomized controlled trials published between 1984-2002, 
prior to minimally invasive technique and botulinum use. Over the past ten years significant 
changes were made to the way esophagectomies are performed, and these studies do not apply to 
our patient population today. Major changes in technique include the transition to minimally 
invasive technique, stapled technique for anastomosis and tissue transection, and tubularization of 
the stomach conduit as opposed to use of the whole stomach. With minimally invasive techniques, 
surgical pyloric drainage procedures are difficult to perform, and frequently omitted. When the 
whole stomach is used as a conduit, the conduit becomes redundant, and such a large reservoir is 
conducive to gastric stasis. With a narrower conduit, surgeons advocate drainage procedure is 
unnecessary because the occurrence of redundancy and stasis is lower. Lastly, these studies were 
published prior to the use of botulinum toxin.
Three retrospective reviews comparing botulinum to pyloric drainage procedures versus no 
drainage procedure during open esophagectomy have found a significant benefit of botulinum in 
preventing gastric outlet obstruction, with varying effect on rate of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712411] (1, 3, 8). However, a fourth retrospective review of patients undergoing open 
esophagectomy, patients receiving botulinum injection experienced higher  rates of gastric outlet 
obstruction, requiring additional procedures for pyloric dilation compared to patients undergoing 
pyloromyotomy or pyloroplasty (9). Although these studies were performed using the open 
esophagectomy technique, they highlight the issues with the data we currently base our practice 
on. These studies have all been underpowered or flawed, are retrospective in nature, and lack 
objective criteria in determining requirement for secondary intervention. We are unable to 
determine if botulinum toxin as a pyloric drainage procedure is a necessary step in an already 
complex operation. Standardized reporting of postoperative gastric outlet obstruction with delayed 
gastric emptying and thresholds for intervention are necessary to determine if botulinum toxin as 
a pyloric drainage procedure is a necessary step in an already complex operation. No prospective 
randomized study has been published, or to the author’s knowledge is in process, to assess the use 
of intra-pyloric botulinum toxin in the minimally invasive setting as a pyloric drainage procedure.
1.2 Risks and/or Benefits
Risks:
By [CONTACT_712446], there is a risk of delayed gastric emptying 
causing nausea, vomiting, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pneumonia, prolonged nasogastric decompression, inability

12/03/21 Page 13 of 46to tolerate oral diet and lengthening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Delayed gastric emptying is a known 
complication after esophagectomy, and a common complication. This complication occurs even 
with botulinum injection in about 30% of patients (7). One published study concluded that patients 
receiving botulinum toxin injection experienced higher rates of delayed gastric emptying (9). In 
most cases of delayed gastric emptying, symptoms may be treated with medications and if severe, 
by [CONTACT_712447], such as botulinum toxin injection or balloon dilation. Therefore, if a 
patient who did not receive pyloric botulinum toxin injection develops gastric outlet obstruction, 
he may undergo an endoscopic procedure to alleviate his symptoms. Rarely, severe delayed gastric 
emptying with complete obstruction may require a return to the operating room.
The drug used in this study is OnabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum toxin type A, Botox©). When 
injected intramuscularly, botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings 
at neuromuscular junctions in the local muscle (10). Without release of acetylcholine, 
neurotransmission between peripheral nerve endings and muscle fibers cannot occur, and the 
muscle becomes weak or paralyzed (10). Botulinum toxin is used for cosmetic procedures, and is 
also FDA-approved to treat cervical dystonia, strabismus, and primary axillary hyperhidrosis (11). 
Off-label uses of botulinum toxin in the gastrointestinal tract include achalasia and refractory anal 
fissure, in addition to pyloric injection during esophagectomy. 
Benefits:
We hypothesize that pyloric botulinum toxin injection does not prevent delayed gastric emptying 
and is an unnecessary portion of the minimally invasive esophagectomy. If it is found that 
botulinum toxin injection does not lead to lower rates of delayed gastric emptying, then this 
procedure may be omitted, saving cost and side effects associated with the medication, and 
potential side effects of employing a pyloric drainage procedure, including pyloric edema, 
dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_712412]. Pyloric edema from receiving botulinum toxin injection may 
actually cause delayed gastric emptying. The current rates of pyloric edema, dumpi[INVESTIGATOR_80565], 
and bile reflux are unclear at this time, and will be directly assessed in this study during the 
nuclear medicine emptying study.
[ADDRESS_969127] ten years significant changes were made to 
esophagectomy technique including transition to minimally invasive technique, stapled technique 
for anastomosis and tissue transection and tubularization of the stomach conduit as opposed to use 
of whole stomach. With a narrower conduit, a drainage procedure may be unnecessary since the 
occurrence of redundancy and stasis is lower.

As a participant in this study the patient will undergo a nuclear medicine emptying study to assess 
for conduit function. This study will be obtained within the window of Postoperative Visit #2 (±14 
days). Prior to the nuclear medicine emptying study, the patient must be fasting for at least 6 hours; 
including oral intake and any supplemental j-tube feeds. The fasting glucose should be measured 
and less than 275 mg/dL. Patients should be off all narcotic pain medications for the 48 hours prior 
to the nuclear medicine emptying study.
[ADDRESS_969130] (Egg Beaters) will be radiolabeled with [ADDRESS_969131], it will be recorded on the study report.
During the study, for the time between the images, the patients may be sitting, standing, or 
walking, but should remain in close proximity to the nuclear medicine facility. Patients will 
be monitored for any symptoms of delayed gastric emptying during this time. Participants 
will answer a questionnaire to assess for gastrointestinal symptoms during the nuclear 
medicine study (See Appendix C).
A single nuclear radiologist, who is blinded to the randomization group, will assess gastric 
emptying on the nuclear emptying study. There is no standardized method for reporting conduit 
emptying by [CONTACT_115564]. Two published studies on this topic have used time to 50% gastric 
emptying as an endpoint (8), and categorized 50% gastric emptying into ranges, with >180 minutes 
categorized as “delayed,” within 180 minutes as “intermediate,” and immediate emptying as 
“rapid” (12). We will measure time to 50% gastric emptying in all patients, and categorize similar 
to the above description, as follows:
Table 1 50% Gastric Emptying Times and Definitions:
Definition 50% Emptying Time
Rapid Immediate emptying, no radiotracer seen on 
first image obtained at 15 minutes
Intermediate < or = 150 minutes

abdominal cavities.
Multidisciplinary evaluation and neoadjuvant therapy if indicated for esophageal 
carcinoma. Multidisciplinary evaluation will be documented in the outpatient preoperative 
office visit note.
Pregnancy test (urine) in females of childbearing potential. The standard operating 
procedure for all females of childbearing potential in the Ambulatory Surgical Center 
(ASC) pre-op holding area is to obtain a urine HCG. This study protocol does not deviate 
from the standard operating procedure of the ASC/pre-op holding area at RPCI. If the 
pregnancy test is positive, the patient is excluded from the study.
Nutritional status assessment by a dietician, as clinically indicated.
The following will be performed if indicated by [CONTACT_712456]-op assessment (standard 
operating procedure for the pre-op clinic at RPCI). These tests are not strictly required to support 
eligibility for this study, but if indicated and performed, may exclude the patient from receiving a 
general anesthetic and thereby [CONTACT_712457].

12-lead electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, and cardiac stress test, if 
indicated.
6.3 Treatment
If criteria are met, patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_9137], per methods 
determined by [CONTACT_30165]. The randomization allocation will be shared with the 
surgical team from the study coordinator to the surgeon prior to the surgery.
oIf randomized to the botulinum arm, patients will undergo the standard minimally 
invasive esophagectomy performed at RPCI, including botulinum injection. The 
intraoperative procedure for botulinum toxin injection is as follows: 100 units of 
botulinum toxin is dissolved in 10 mL normal saline. After preparation of the 
gastric conduit, including mobilization and transection, the 10 mL of botulinum 
toxin solution is injected with a thoracoscopic needle intramuscularly at the anterior 
pyloric ring, in 2-3 separate areas.

6.4 Inpatient Postoperative Follow-Up Evaluations
The following evaluations will be performed during the inpatient postoperative course (surgery 
to discharge), unless otherwise clinically indicated.:
Patients will follow Roswell Park standard of care postoperative pathway for minimally invasive 
esophagectomy (refer to Section 4.1), unless otherwise clinically indicated. This includes:
Initial postoperative care in the intensive care unit or intermediate care unit, based on 
clinical status, with nursing care and vital signs per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712424]:
At the minimum daily physical examination (including vital signs).
Laboratory analysis, including hematology (CBC with automated differentials) and 
chemistry (CMP), at least on a daily basis until Postoperative Day 6.
Standard inpatient postoperative evaluations after minimally invasive esophagectomy 
include daily chest x-ray for at least four days postoperatively, and occasionally a CT scan 
of the chest if clinically indicated.
Gastrografin swallow study/CT esophagram is obtained to evaluate for any signs of 
anastomotic leak. 
Clinical evaluation of symptoms will be evaluated by [CONTACT_2299]’s care team, including 
inpatient nurses, mid-level providers, surgical fellows, operating surgeon, speech therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], 
occupational or physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], dieticians, and documented in the RPCI electronic 
medical record (EMR).
Speech therapy evaluation for any dysphagia or signs of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].
Nutritional assessments will be performed by a dietician familiar with the study. The initial 
evaluation will be performed in the outpatient setting if there are signs of malnutrition or 
inability to tolerate oral intake at the preoperative visit. Otherwise the standard is to 
perform the initial nutritional assessment in the immediate postoperative period. Patients 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_712458]-Friday while an inpatient, and then at each 
subsequent follow-up office visit, and assessment documented in the RPCI EMR. 
Nutritional goals are as follows: By [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_2345], patients are expected to meet 50% of 
their total nutritional requirements orally and 50% by [CONTACT_712459] j-tube feeds. On

assess oral intake. By [CONTACT_712453] #21, patients should meet 75% nutritional 
requirements orally and 25% j-tube feeds, and by [CONTACT_712460] #5, 100% oral calories. 
The postoperative day that each of these goals are met will be recorded (Day tolerating 50% 
oral feeds, 75% oral feeds, 100% oral feeds).
Concomitant medication: List any ongoing medications with dose changes, as applicable. 
Patients may take opi[INVESTIGATOR_712425], including on the day of the 
gastrografin swallow study/CT esophagram, and type and dosage will be recorded.
Clinical Events of Interest and Adverse Events
Patients will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712415] 100% of 
nutritional needs with a combination of orally and supplemental through j-tube:
Any clinical signs of delayed gastric emptying causing regurgitation, vomiting, or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_712426].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712417]: If patients have intractable 
nausea and vomiting, or experience a pulmonary event related to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], this will be 
recorded as attributed to delayed gastric emptying.
6.5 Criteria for Retreatment
Patients with “severe” delayed gastric emptying assessed radiographically or clinically at 
any time will be considered for endoscopic procedures for gastric outlet obstruction, 
including pyloric botulinum toxin injection or balloon dilation, or operative procedure. 
This is irrespective of whether a patient was initially treated with botulinum toxin at the 
minimally invasive esophagectomy; patients randomized to the botulinum toxin group may 
undergo additional botulinum toxin injection endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. The maximum dose of 
botulinum toxin a patient may receive for this study in the three-month period is 300 units. 
Each of these procedures- when a patient undergoes a therapeutic endoscopic procedure or 
returns to the operating room- will be defined as a secondary procedure.
 Development of “severe” delayed gastric emptying as assessed by [CONTACT_712461] a failure of the experimental procedure and will be included in the 
primary analysis. Requirement for secondary procedure or development of “severe” 
delayed gastric emptying as assessed by [CONTACT_712462]. 
Patients with “moderate” delayed gastric emptying assessed radiographically or clinically 
at any time will be considered for initiation of promotility agents. Development of 
“moderate” delayed gastric emptying will be included in the secondary analysis.
6.6 Outpatient Postoperative Follow-Up Visits
Study participants will be followed for data collection for 90 days (routine post-esophagectomy 
follow-up and surveillance, per standard of care). The following evaluations will be performed 
during the outpatient postoperative course, unless otherwise clinically indicated:

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
12/03/21 Page 24 of 46In the postoperative period, patients return to office for outpatient follow-up approximately 
one to three weeks after discharge (“Postoperative Visit #1”). This visit is standard of care 
and can be scheduled per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Physical exam and vital signs will be conducted at 
this visit. The dietician will assess oral intake, and supplemental tube feeds adjusted 
accordingly. Day until patient tolerates 75% and 100% of nutritional needs orally will be 
recorded as per nutritionist assessment. 
As a participant in this study, patients in both randomization groups will undergo a nuclear 
medicine emptying study The nuclear medicine emptying study may occur within the 
window of Postoperative Visit #2 (± 14 days ) to assess dynamic conduit function. This 
test can be extended beyond post-operative Visit #2 at PI’s discretion. Patients will be 
monitored for any symptoms of delayed gastric emptying during this time by [CONTACT_63496] 
(See Appendix C), to determine if nuclear medicine study findings correlate with 
concurrent clinical symptoms.
oPrior to the nuclear medicine emptying study, the patient must be fasting for at 
least 6 hours, including oral intake and any supplemental j-tube feeds. If the 
patient is a diabetic, the glucose level should be measured and less than 275 
mg/dL within [ADDRESS_969143] be held for 48 hours prior to the 
study. Patients should not be on any of the medications listed in Appendix B 
within the 48 hours prior to the study. Patients will remain in the nuclear medicine 
suite during this time, and will be required to sit upright, and may walk around the 
room. During the study, for the time between the images, the patients may be 
sitting, standing, or walking, but should remain in close proximity to the nuclear 
medicine facility.
Post-surgical symptom evaluation based on clinical factors during the outpatient follow-up 
visits, and additionally by [CONTACT_712463]-up appointments 
if clinically indicated.
At Postoperative Visit #2, patients will be assessed for quality of life as measured by 
[CONTACT_712464]-C30 OES18 questionnaire (Appendix D). This will usually occur in the office 
around postoperative week six to eight. However, if the patient remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712427], the questionnaire will be administered once between Postoperative Days 
35-42. 
Concomitant medications: List any ongoing medications with dose changes, as applicable.
Clinical Events of Interest and Adverse Events
Participants who are unavailable for follow-up evaluations should be classified as lost to follow-
up for one of the following reasons:
Lost to follow-up: For a participant to be considered lost to follow-up, the investigator must 
make two separate attempts to re-establish contact [CONTACT_6635]. The attempts to re-
establish participant contact [CONTACT_683663] (e.g., certified letter).

30 days of surgery (telephone verification is acceptable).
6.7 End of Study Visit
At day #90 (± 7 days), an end of study phone call will be conducted by [CONTACT_20234]. The purpose of this call is to inquire about any subsequent procedures the 
patient may have undergone related to delayed gastric emptying or esophagectomy, 
nutrition assessment to determine if the patient continues to require supplemental jejunal 
feeds, any persistent clinical symptoms of delayed gastric emptying, including any 
subsequent pneumonia, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_465801], respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], nausea, vomiting, ability to 
eat solid food or drink liquids or having any trouble eating, early satiety, difficulty 
swallowing saliva, noticing bile or green staining on pi[INVESTIGATOR_712428], experiencing 
acid indigestion or heartburn, or pain with eating,  concomitant medications and Clinical 
Events of Interest and adverse events will be assessed. If the patient indicates continued 
use of tube feeds, the study coordinator will alert the dietician to call the patient for further 
evaluation of the percentage of tube feeds versus oral intake. If the patient is no longer 
using jejunal feeds, the study coordinator will mark down “100% oral intake.

7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, 
‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
in other study-related documents.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms 
(e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event 
should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it 
should be reported as follow-up information.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is known to have 
resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.
APPROVED RPCI IRB
1/10/2022
Roswell Park Cancer Institute Study Number: I 283516
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE
12/03/21 Page 30 of 46However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated 
in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a severe 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded separately on 
the CRF. Pain will not be considered an adverse event at any point, given the nature of the 
intervention (surgical procedure).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g., abnormalities that require study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.).
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline 
phosphatase and bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the 
abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality 
can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE or 
SAE. For example, an elevated blood  potassium level of 7 mEq/L should be recorded as 
“hyperkalemia.”
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should 
not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or 
etiology changes.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on 
an Adverse Event CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
7.1.2 Drug Information- Botulinum toxin
OnabotulinumtoxinA (botulinum toxin type A, Botox©) inhibits the release of acetylcholine from 
nerve endings at neuromuscular junctions in the local muscle (10). Without the release of 
acetylcholine, neurotransmission between peripheral nerve endings and muscle fibers cannot 
occur, and the muscle becomes weak or paralyzed (10). The inhibitory effect of botulinum toxin 
is temporary, and muscle function recovers at [ADDRESS_969150] 
with the peripheral blood (10). In rare instances, botulinum toxin may spread from the area of 
injection and produce symptoms consistent with botulinum toxin effects (13). These unanticipated 
symptoms may include asthenia, diplopia, ptosis, dysphagia, dysphonia, urinary incontinence, and 
breathing difficulties. These symptoms have been reported hours to weeks after injection.

of underlying conditions predisposing to muscle weakness have an increased risk of these side 
effects occurring (11). However, due to the nature of this study, patients with underlying muscle 
weakness are excluded from this study.
The maximum recommended dose of OnabotulinumtoxinA, regardless of the indication, is 
400 units over three months (10). Cervical dystonia is treated with doses ranging from 198-
300 units, divided among the affected muscle, with maximum dose 50 units per site. Our proposed 
dosage, 100 units in divided doses into the pyloric muscle, is within the range used among other 
high-volume esophagectomy centers (2, 3, 8, 9).
Absolute contraindications to botulinum toxin injection include previous hypersensitivity to the 
product (10). Mild to moderate side effects are generally mild transient, and include swelling or 
bruising at the injection site, and the small possibility of infection at injection site ( 10). 
Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions have occurred (11). Higher doses or more frequent 
administration may result in neutralizing antibody formation and loss of efficacy (10). This

Unlikely: The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most likely 
related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, 
or concomitant drugs.
Possible: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.
Probable: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant drugs.

8 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING
The Roswell Park Data Safety Monitoring Committee will assess the progress of the study, the 
safety data, and critical efficacy endpoints (Phase I studies will be reviewed quarterly; Phase II, 
III and pi[INVESTIGATOR_553357]-initiated studies will be reviewed semi-annually). The DSMC will review 
the study and will make recommendations that include but not limited to; (a) continuation of the 
study, (b) modifications to the design (c) suspension of or (d) termination of the study
9 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
The primary objectives of this study are:
Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive 
esophagectomy decreases postoperative occurrence of delayed gastric emptying, as assessed 
radiographically by [CONTACT_712442].
The secondary objectives of this study are:
Determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin injection during a minimally invasive 
esophagectomy reduces the number of repeat procedures for delayed gastric emptying within 
90 days, decreases time to oral intake meeting 100% of nutritional requirements, reduces the 
incidence of pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications directly related to delayed gastric 
emptying, reduces hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712429], and increases 
patient quality of life.
9.1 Sample Size Determination
The sample size justification is based on the primary analysis. We consider a study design with a 
total sample of n=50 patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 fashion to the Botox and non-Botox 
treatment arms) and an interim analysis at n 1=30. The performance of this study design and 
decision rules (described in the primary analysis) was assessed via simulation study.
If the true rates of delayed gastric emptying are 0.30 and 0.70 in the Botox and non-Botox 
treatment arms, then the study design achieves 85.0% power to detect a significant change in the 
delayed gastric emptying rates at a significance level of 0.05. The chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_712430] 42.8%, while the chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_712431] 1.0%.
If the true rate of delayed gastric emptying is 0.70 in both treatment arms, then there is a 4.3% 
chance of falsely identifying the Botox arm as superior (observed type I error rate), a 0.9% chance 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_712432], and a 42.1% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_712433].
9.2 Randomization
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the Botox and non-Botox treatment arms using a 
permuted block design. Participants will be stratified on the receipt of neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy, smoking status, and diabetes. Participants will be randomized prior to the

start of the procedure.
9.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Descriptive statistics (as appropriate: n, percent, mean, median, min and max) will be used to 
summarize demographic and baseline characteristics.
9.4 Primary and Secondary Analyses
Primary Analysis: A recent study demonstrated that patients who received Botox had a delayed 
gastric emptying rate of approximately 30% as compared to a complication rate in historical 
controls of 70% in patients that did not receive botulinum toxin injection (7). A retrospective 
review of patients undergoing minimally invasive esophagectomy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute 
indicates that the rate of postoperative delayed gastric emptying is even lower, however, this rate 
is based on very stringent criteria for delayed gastric emptying- requirement of a secondary 
procedure. Therefore, the primary objective is to determine if intra-pyloric botulinum toxin 
injection during a minimally invasive esophagectomy decreases postoperative occurrence of 
delayed gastric emptying. The primary outcome is delayed gastric emptying (assessed 
radiographically by [CONTACT_712442]) which is treated as a dichotomous variable.
Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_712443], smoking status, and 
diabetes; and randomized in a 1:1 to the botulinum and non-botulinum treatment arms. The 
primary objective will be assessed using the intent-to-treat principle and a one-sided Cochran-
Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) s test about the following hypotheses:
, 𝐻0:θ≥1 
𝐻𝐴:θ<1
where θ is the common odds ratio (COR) for the odds of delayed gastric emptying rates for the 
botulinum versus non-botulinum treatment arms. A one-sided test is performed as the rate of 
delayed gastric emptying is expected to decrease in the botulinum arm over the non-botulinum 
arm; that is, we expect θ < 1. 
The analysis will proceed in two stages using an O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. An 
interim analysis will be conducted after n 1=[ADDRESS_969155] completed treatment and the final 
analysis will be conducted after n=[ADDRESS_969156] completed treatment. The following decision 
rules will be utilized at each analysis:

If , then stop due to inferiority.θ>1
Otherwise enroll n 2=20 patients.
Final Reject H 0 if p-value ≤ 0.046533
Secondary Analysis: The secondary outcomes include additional postop procedures, clinically 
assessed delayed gastric emptying (days to resumption of oral feeding, EORTC QLQ-30 QoL 
scores, and clinical symptoms of regurgitation, vomiting, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), delayed gastric emptying 
assessed by [CONTACT_712466]/CT esophagram, pulmonary complications (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_712406], pneumonia within 3 months of surgery), and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7491]. All variables will be reported by [CONTACT_712445].
The days to resumption of oral feeding, QoL scores and, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_712434]-sample, stratified T-test. Normality will 
be assessed using the Anderson-Darling test and transformations (such as Box-Cox) will be 
applied, as appropriate. Bootstrap or non-parametric methods will be applied if no normalizing 
transformations can easily be applied. The rates of moderate clinical delayed gastric emptying 
(clinical signs of regurgitation, vomiting, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]), moderate delayed gastric emptying 
(score of [ADDRESS_969157]/CT esophagram), severe delayed gastric emptying 
(score of [ADDRESS_969158]/CT esophagram), and pulmonary complications 
will be compared between treatment arms using the two-sided CMH exact test.
A previous study demonstrated that the rate of additional postoperative procedures may be lower 
for patients treated with botulinum (3.9%) as compared to those without botulinum (15.9%). 
Therefore, the rates of additional postop procedures within [ADDRESS_969159].
All analyses will be performed in SAS v9 (Cary, NC).

Your doctor has ordered a test that will permit evaluation of how food moves through your new 
stomach conduit. This test is called a Nuclear Medicine Gastric Emptying Study. This study will 
be performed in the nuclear medicine department.
Preparation for the Gastric Emptying Study:
You should not consume any liquids or food after midnight the night before the test. You 
should turn off your jejunal tube feeds at midnight as well.
If you smoke, do not smoke any time after midnight and throughout the time you are 
having the study pi[INVESTIGATOR_712436]. You may smoke after you are instructed that the test 
is completed.
Some medications are stopped for this test. This should be discussed with your doctor. 
The following medications must be stopped for 48 hours (2 days) before the test: Reglan 
(metoclopramide), erythromycin, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (Ativan, Valium, Xanax), and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 
(Lortab, Norco, Percocet, Dilaudid, Methadone, Morphine, Oxycontin, Oxycodone). Do 
not take any laxatives on the day before or any time during your study.
Unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_29591], you may continue your normal medications 
that could be taken with a small amount of water or juice up to 2 hours prior to your 
study. You should not drink coffee or tea.
If you have diabetes, skippi[INVESTIGATOR_712437]. If 
you are a diabetic and on insulin, we request that you bring your regular morning dose of 
insulin with you. You can take this with the meal that will be given to you. We may 
reduce your insulin dose to adjust for the small size of the breakfast. Often half of your 
insulin is taken with the test meal. If you take oral hypoglycemic medications, generally 
these are taken with the meal in the nuclear medicine department. If there are any 
questions concerning your dose of insulin this should be discussed with your study 
coordinator or surgeon.
If you have diabetes, we also ask you to bring your glucose monitoring equipment to the 
test. We will ask you to check your glucose before the test and possibly during or after 
the test.
Description of the Gastric Emptying Study:
For this test, you will be asked to eat an egg meal that consists of the equivalent of 
one egg together with water. The meal has been labeled with an isotope that will 
permit pi[INVESTIGATOR_712438].
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_712439]’s gamma camera. Between the images you will be permitted to 
walk about and continue normal activities. It is suggested that you bring some reading 
material and/or personal music device. These studies try to simulate normal daily 
activities. The nuclear medicine department’s rooms may be cooler than the rest of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and you may want to bring a sweater with you.
The study generally takes 4 hours once it is started.

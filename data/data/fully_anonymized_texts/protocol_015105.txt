Investigator:  Please respond to the questions below.  The IRB will utilize your responses to evaluate your protocol submission.  
  1.  YES   NO     Does the James Madison University Institutional Review Board define the project as research?   
The James Madison University IRB defines "research" as a "systematic investigation designed to  develop or contribute to generalizable  knowledge .”   All 
research involving human participants conducted by [CONTACT_236122], staff, and students is subject to IRB re view.   
 
2.  YES   NO     Are the human participants in your study living  individuals?  
“Individuals whose physiologic or behavioral characteristics and responses are the object of study in a research project. Und er the federal regulations, human 
subjects are defined as: living individual(s) about whom an investigator conducting research obta ins:  
(1) data through intervention or interaction with the individual; or (2) identifiable private information.”    
 
 3.  YES   NO     Will you obtain data through intervention  or interaction  with these individuals?  
“Intervention” includes both physical procedures by [CONTACT_236123] ( e.g., measurement of heart rate or venipuncture) and manipulations of the 
participant or the participant's environment that are performed for research purposes.  “Interaction” includes communication or interpersonal contact [CONTACT_236124] ( e.g., surveying o r interviewing).  
 
  4.    YES   NO     Will you obtain identifiable private information  about these individuals?  
"Private information" includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation  or recording is 
taking place, or information provided for specific purposes which the individual can reasonably expect will not be  made public ( e.g., a medical record or student 
record).  "Identifiable" means that the identity of the participant may be ascertained by [CONTACT_236125] ( e.g., by [CONTACT_2300], code 
number, pattern of answers, etc.).  
 
  5.  YES   NO     Does the study present more than minimal risk  to the participants?

thyroid cartilage. These motors 
vibrate to stimulate the sensory 
nerves that induce swallowing.  
Figure 2: the 70/110 Hz motor increased 
swallowing by 100% or more in a ll healthy 
participants.  Background:  
Over 60% of patients who have a stroke will experience secondary problems wi th their swallowing (dysphagia) 
(Mann  et al. , 1999). However, at least half of acute stroke patients will discharge to home with limited follow up on their 
swallowing problem (Howrey  et al. , 2011), which can lead t o severe consequences . Similar problems with need for 
continued access to swallowing therapy occur following treatment of head 
and neck cancer where patients usually experience swallowing difficulties 
following chemoradiation and surgery (Hutcheson et al., 2012; Hutcheson & 
Lewin, 2012). Patient s with swallowing disorders following traumatic brain 
injury also usually require a prolonged period of rehabilitation (Hansen et al., 
2008).  Once patients  are discharged to home, limited access and cost issues 
are often barriers to continuing swallowing r ehabilitation and consequently 
the patient’s swallowing problem is chronically untreated.  This not only 
negatively impacts the patient’s quality of life and their ability to eat an oral 
diet, it fails to address chronic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236092]. Continuing dysphagia care immediately following discharge  is 
extremely important as earlier treatment leads to better outcomes 
(Odderson  et al. , 1995).   
We are currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_236093]-Trainer  to 
continue treatment of dysphagia after the patient is discharged to home .  The 
self-training device is worn around the neck with motors placed externally on 
the skin over the thyroid cartilage to provide vibratory sti mulation to the 
larynx (Figure 1 ). The vibrations activate the sensory receptors in side the larynx which excite CNS control for swallowing 
(Chi-Fishman, 1994)  and can help the patient to initiate swallowin g.   Patients can use the self -training device at home to 
promote swallowing rehabilitation during daily swallowing  practice. The device can also be programmed  to vibrate at 
regular intervals throughout the day to promote saliva swallows. Using this method , the patient can continue their 
swallowing therapy independently and in a manner that is cost effective.   A previous Phase I trial  compar ed the clinical 
outcomes of 8 patients with chronic dysphagia using either an intramuscular  electrical stimulation implant device or an  
external vibratory stimulat or to practice swallowing daily at home  (FDA IDE G0G0153) . Functional outcomes of oral 
intake improved with both devices. As the external vibratory stimulation has the advantage of being external and 
completely noninvasive , it has been selected for further development as a self-training  device . A second pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (IRB -
12-0057) examined the effect of different frequencies of 
vibration on the swallowing frequency of healthy  
participants and found swallowing signi ficantly increased 
from baseline when using a vibration of 70 Hz on one side 
of the larynx and 110 Hz on the other side (Figure 2). Data 
is currently being collected on the effect of different 
vibration  characteristics on swallowing in participants 
who hav e swallowing problems after stroke (IRB -13-
0010) .  
 
Purpose :     The purpose of this study is to allow patients 
with chronic dysphagia  to use the Self-Trainer  for daily 
swallowing practice in their home and collect feedback  on 
device use and satisfaction and use .  Objective 
information on the effectiveness of self-training  for 
swallowing rehabilitation  will also be gathered . 
Objectives:  
1. To develop and evaluate  training for participants  
and caregivers to use the self -trainer.

Procedures/Research Design/Methodology/Timeframe  
Design:  This study is a case series study of  participants  using the device  to evaluate patient preferences  such as 
frequency of device use, compliance with training guidelines, patient and caregiver training required for appropriate 
use, and patient  and caregiver  feedback on satisfaction with the device. All participants  will continue any outpatient 
rehabilitation they  are receiving during this time period. This research will determine device training and use parameters 
before  designing a Phase II controlled trial of the degree of benefit from device use. All  participants  and their caregivers 
will be trained on correct use of the Swallowing Self-Trainer  and will use the device to practice swallowing in their home 
environment for 3 months (months 1 -3). Each participant will complete the outcomes measures  at baseline  and 
immediately after the 3 month s of device use.

7/29/15  The participant will practice swallowing with the Self -Trainer daily in their home environment for 3 months. The Self -
Trainer device will be set to vibrate at a vibration rate and pressure that is ideal for each participant based on testing  
(see Procedures Part B , section g). The participant will wear the Self -Trainer during waking hours with the device in 
automatic mode. In automatic mode the Self -Trainer will be programmed to vibrate up to 15 seconds every 3 -5 minutes 
to stimulate saliva swallow s and promote swallowing practice. In this manner the participant will complete 
approximately 180 -300 saliva  swallows per day.  
The participant will also engage in 30 -60 minutes  of active swallowing practice every day by [CONTACT_236132], and releasing the button to 
turn off the vibration. The participant will complete a total of 6 0 practice  swallows  a day by [CONTACT_7087] 30 trials of practice  2 
times a day. Participants will be given a small 5 cc syringe or ¼  teaspoon  for administering 1-2 cc of water (equivalent to 
a saliva swallow ) to moisten their mouths during each of their practice  swallows . 
 
 
Participant and Caregiver Instruction  
Each participant and their caregivers will be trained in the following:  1) Self -Trainer placement ; 2) Self -Trainer 
charging and use ; 3) Self -Trainer cleaning; and 4) Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_134174] .  Participants and caregivers will learn  to locate 
the thyroid notch (Adam’s apple) and place the motor contacts so that they are on either side of the thyroid notch  
(Figure  1). Each participant’s device attachment cuff will be marked to illustrate where the Velcro should be secured to 
assure appropriate tightness for a neck pressure  that is comfortable but effective for inducing swallowing during 
vibration . The participant and caregiver will also learn  to verify correct placement by [CONTACT_236133] .   
 
The participant and caregiver will learn  the differences between automatic and manual modes and how to change 
the device to operate in each mode.  Verbal, written, and /or video instructions will instruct the participant and caregiver 
to secure the Self-Trainer  to the outside of the participant’s neck (as described above) every morning after breakfast  
with the device set in a utomatic mode .  The participant will wear the Self-Trainer  set to au tomatic mode during waking 
hours with the exception of mealtime s, swallowing practice  and during vigorous exercise  when it may be cumbersome 
to use .  The participant will learn to correctly sequence  active swallowing practice with the Self-Trainer , which involves 
the following steps: 1) pushing the button to turn on the device vibration,  2) initiate swallowing  within a 1/3 of a second 
while the vibrator is “on” , and 3) releasing the  button when  the swallow is completed.  Participants will be given written, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_236097], and /or video instructions  on how to use the device and how to verify correct placement of the device. 
Instruction and training will be provided on how to daily clean and charge the device.  Partic ipants will learn  to follow a 
daily regimen for preventing aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236098], monitoring for wet vocal quality , taking their body temperature, and only  using the Self -Trainer in an upright 
position (see Human Subjects Protection) .

a. The participants will  be trained on appropriate device placement, appropriate device pressure, how to 
verify correct placement of the device, and how to use the device daily for swallowing therapy. 
Caregivers will be encouraged to attend to provide support and will be trained to “coach” the 
participant.  
b. Self-Trainer guides will be given to the participant in the following forms:  
i. Written directions with pi[INVESTIGATOR_236102]. Optional DVD instructional video  
c. Once the participant and their caregiver can demonstrate correct use of the Passy Muir Self Trainer for 
Swallowing,  they will be given the device to take home and use for [ADDRESS_285947] (IRB)   Page 9 of 15

7/29/15  a. Training and maintenance data  will be taken on each participant and will include how many training 
sessions were required to demonstrate competency for device use, the duration of each training 
session, caregiver involvement, documentation of questions or comments during maintenance phone 
calls, and how many times the participant contact[CONTACT_236140].  
b. Participant feedback  will be gathered at the end of the 3 month self -training period.   The participant will 
read or be read a series of multiple choice questions  (Appendix K)  regarding their opi[INVESTIGATOR_236103], ease of device use, and design of the device. The participants will be instructed to answer 
truthfully and will be assured  that their answers will not impact their treatment or enrollment in this or 
future research studies at JMU/ SRMH .  
c. Participant fidelity  will be measured by 1) daily documentation by [CONTACT_236141] 2) downloadi ng the count data from the device periodically throughout the study  which 
provides data on how many times the device has vibrated in au tomatic mode and in manual mode.  
d. Modified Barium Swallow  study  (MBS ) will be completed in radiology and requires the participant to 
swallow small amounts of barium .  This will be done by a license d speech -language pathologist who has 
been trained to complete MBS . An MBS  study  will be completed at baseline  and after the 3 month self -
training period . During each exam the participant will swallow thin liquid, nectar thick liquid, honey thick 
liquid, puree, and solid texture  (cracker /cookie ).  For the entire MBS protocol, see Appendix L. The 
participant will be given each consistency in gradually increasing amounts from 5 ml to approximately 15  
ml (See Human Subjects Protection) .  If more than  a trace  amount of  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236104], 
the remaining trials of that consistency will be discontinued from the study.  Radiation exposure time for 
each study will be 5 minutes or less. All MBS studies  will be recorded for later analysis.  All recordings 
will be de -identified with a random ID number . Each MBS study will include a 19 mm metal sphere 
calibration marker be tap ed to the side of the neck for future displacement measures. Each video will be 
analyzed for:    
i. Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score (MBSImP)  (Martin -Harris et al., 2008) allows 
the speech pathologist to rate specific physiological movement during each swallow and assign 
an overall  0 to 55 numerical score representative of swallowing impairment in the oral, 
pharyngeal, and esophageal phase  (App endix L).  
ii. Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS) (O’Neil et al., 1999) allows the speech pathologist 
to assign a [ADDRESS_285948] while reviewing each MBS  while  participant ID and condition will be 
masked (Appendix J ). This rating scale form will be identified only by [CONTACT_236142].    
e. Dysphagia Handicap Index  (DHI) (Silbergleit et al., 2012 ) survey requires the participant  to rate their 
agreement with 25  statements pertaining to their swallowing  (Appendix  M).  The DHI is designed to 
determine how the patient’s swallowing affects their day to day quality of life  on a physical, functional, 
and emotional level  and possible scores range from 0-100. The DHI will be completed by [CONTACT_236143] .  The DHI will be completed at baseline, 
after the [ADDRESS_285949] the self -training period. This survey will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_236137].  
f. Magnetic Resonance Imaging:   Some p articipants may  be scheduled to receive an MRI scan at SSRMH  as 
a part of  the study. The MRI image can be used to identify the [ADDRESS_285950] (IRB)   Page 10 of 15

menopausal  (unless they are breastfeeding) and not have child bearing potential a nd will not require a 
pregnancy test. All  female participants who have child bearing potential (i.e. are not post -menopausal  ) 
will be given a pregnancy test kit by [CONTACT_236144] (free of charge) and will be asked to take 
the pregnancy test the mo rning before going to the SRMH  for their MRI scan. They must report to the 
research staff at JMU that the test was negative before going for their MRI scan. If participants have not 
reported a negative pregnancy test before a scan, the scan will be cancell ed by [CONTACT_236145] . Results of the pregnancy test will be confidential and discussed privately with the 
participant  alone , even if the participant is a minor. Participation in the MRI will not be essential for 
participating in the study.  
g. Functional Near -Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)  will be conducted on those participants willing  and able 
to travel to James Madison University Neural Bases of Communication and S wallowing Laboratory  for 
testing  prior  to device use and after [ADDRESS_285952].  Participation in 
the fNIRS will not be essential for participating in the study.  
i. This is a noninvasive technology using optodes to emit laser lights, similar to pulse oximetry in 
concept and practice. Light detectors are placed 3 centimeters from the emitters to absorb any 
reflected light from the emitter. These emitters and detectors are placed on the scalp after 
parting the hair to reduce inference from pi[INVESTIGATOR_236105]. The only risk to participants and the 
investigative team is if the emitters are turned on and a laser light could be shined in someone’s 
eyes, similar to laser pointer s. Therefore, the emitters will only be turned on after they are 
placed and attached to a participants scalp.  The lasers will be turned  off prior to moving  or 
replacing the emitters on the scalp.  Six emitters and ten detectors  will be attached to the scal p 
over [ADDRESS_285953]. Bobby 
[CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_236106], a non-invasive p rocedure. No hair 
will be cut and  any color markings made on the scalp for the Brainsight identified coordinates 
will wash off in the shower with shampoo.  
ii. fNIRS data files will be deidentified and saved for later analysis. fNIRS sessions wil l be video 
recorded and saved for future analysis. Each digital video file will be saved using the 
participant’s study ID only and will be stored on an encrypted drive for 5 years  after publication,  
after which it will be destroyed.  
 
E. Participants will ret urn to the SRMH  Voice and Swallowing Service at the end of the 3 month self -training period  
to document outcome measures as outlined in section C. If the participant has also opted to participate in fNIRS, 
they will also return to the James Madison University Neural Bases of Communication and Swallowing 
Laboratory at 3 months.  
F. Follow up and Discharge :  
a. During months 4 -6 the investigators will contac t the participant by [CONTACT_236146]. At the end of month 6, the participant will be 
mailed the Dysphagia Handicap Index survey (Appendix M) to complete and return by [CONTACT_188052] a 
statement of discharge from the study (Appendix N). The participant will be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_236147].

7/29/15  Potential Problems and Alternative Strategies:   Anticipated problems include difficu lties with recruiting an adequate 
sample of patients in the Harrisonburg area for testing in our clinic at SRMH . A website has been developed for 
promoting research on the swallowing Self-Trainer  (swallow ingselftrainer.com), which can be used by [CONTACT_42649], speech 
pathologists or participant s, to educate themselves on the uses of the Self-Trainer  or to get contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
Advertisements on Google and on the National Foundation of Swallowing Disorders are  also in place to help with 
recruitment.  In this manner, participants who are interested in swallowing research can self -refer. Also participants who 
have participated in a previous protocol involving the Self-Trainer  and have stated that they give permis sion for future 
contact [CONTACT_236148].  Participants can also be recruited from the SRMH /JMU Voice 
and Swallowing Service , the SRMH /JMU Swallowing Support Group, which meets bimonthly  as well as other dysphagia 
services in the area , including other local support groups . Local speech -language pathologists will be informed of current 
research projects and will be able to inform their patients to contact [CONTACT_236149].  
 
Statistical Analysis : Questionnaire  data will be categorized and coded. Quantitative data will be analyzed using 
Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures  with a  Bonferroni corrected alpha of 0.05.   
 
Human Subjects Protection  
A. Potential Risks  
During this case series, the participants are asked to wear the swallowing Self-Trainer  around their neck 
to provide vibratory stimulation to the nerves that influence swallowing. They will wear the device during 
waking hours and prior research has shown t hat the stimuli can increase the frequency of swallowing 2 -3x 
their normal rate. Participants will be instructed to only take food or liquid consistencies by [CONTACT_236150] . Rather, the participants will swallow their own saliva or an equivalent amount 
of water (1 -2 ml) as a part of the self -training, as they do on a normal basis  throughout the day.  As the most 
persons use up their saliva after [ADDRESS_285954] be approved by [CONTACT_236151].  If the participant is not safe for any intake,  instructions will be given to remove the 
device from the participant’s neck prior to food consumption  they take for  pleasure .  As the Self -Trainer is 
known to increase the frequency of swallowing, the participants will be swallowing their secretions more 
frequently and therefore it is possible that each participant’s risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236107].  For some 
participa nts, specifically those who do not swallow their secretions and instead periodically expectorate, the 
participant is now attempting to swallow the secretions instead  of attempting to clear them form their 
oropharynx using regurgitation .  Participants who do not feel secretions pooling in their throat may have a 
decreased risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236108].  As 
saliva swallows and the risks associated with saliva aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236109], 
this study provides only a minimal increase in risk. Efforts will be made to minimize any risk associated with 
participation in this study (see Protection against risks). If a participant expectorates their saliva as a p art of 
reducing aspi[INVESTIGATOR_50498], they will be encouraged to continue with this practice as needed, but to try to 
swallow when they feel the urge to swallow as part of the self -training. The study will be conducted by a 
licensed speech language pathologist who will counsel each participant on minimizing secretion aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236110]. 
 
Participants will be encouraged to continue with their current swallowing treatment plan of care as 
determined by [CONTACT_236152]. We will take great care to make  certain that all 
participants and their family and caregivers do not misinterpret the purpose of this research and fully 
understand that this study is experimental research with no guarantees of benefit .  It will be made clear in 
the advertising material,  informed consent and in any discussions with the participants and family members 
that treatment received is experimental research and there is no guarantee of improvements in swallowing 
function.  The speech language pathologist conducting the research wi ll provide participants and their

7/29/[ADDRESS_285955], it is expected that 
the amount of radiation the participant  will be exposed to will be negligible.  
 
MRI does not involve  radiation and is safe when used on individuals who are appropria tely screened for 
the procedure .  The FDA has classified MRI as a class II risk.  Individuals with any implanted metal objects in 
the brain or body are at risk of injury with MRI procedures due to the high magnetic force to which they are 
exposed .  Therefore, individuals with one or more of the MRI exclusion criteria will be excluded from the 
study.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_236111]. Acoustic 
noise is generated in the magnet when the gradie nt coils are energized and de -energized in the magnetic 
fields to create MRI images.  Subjects will be required to wear earplugs during the scan, which will be placed 
by [CONTACT_473]. No incident of hearing impairment has been reported before in clini cal scanners.  
During the scan, the investigator will monitor the patient’s comfort level.  We consider that the procedures 
described above are safe and should not produce any undue discomfort for subjects.  The main discomfort 
associated with the study is  the need for the subject to remain quiet within the scanner for the duration of 
testing, about [ADDRESS_285956] postings, and a website (swallowselftrainer.com) to 
increase awareness of the study among speech language pathologists and patients with swallowing 
disorders  in the  community . We wi ll only ask professionals to place notices and make literature available on 
our study but not to refer patients directly to us so patients will not feel under any undue influence from 
their professional  caregivers to participate. Our notices and literature  will provide information that will allow 
participants to contact [CONTACT_236153] -refer .   
We have 3 rooms in the JMU -SRMH  Voice and Swallowing Service to support multiple participants being 
tested simultaneously. Free parking is immediately available within 100 ft of the entrance to our testing 
grooms in the Treatment Center on the ground floor of SRMH .  The burden to partic ipants will be the daily 
use of the Self-Trainer  for 3 months , the majority of which the device will be switched in “automatic” mode 
requiring no active engagement  on the part of the participant. Active practice required of the participant 
consists of 60 s wallows and will take from 30 -60 minutes a day.  Additional burden to the participant 
includes  3 or more visits to SRMH  for testing measures , while  periodic  counts taken from the Self-Trainer  
can be completed with laptops and can be done in the participant ’s home, JMU or  SRMH  as is convenient.  
Weekly check ins can be done over the telephone , Skype,  or as needed by [CONTACT_236154], although in person appointments can be made if needed.  
Administration of informed co nsent:  Participants will be telephone screened and if they meet the 
inclusion criteria, they will be mailed the consent form for information purposes to allow them to review it 
before coming to the Voice and Swallowing Service. The consent will inform participan ts that [CONTACT_236162] has 
a financial interest in the research. Either [CONTACT_236162] or [CONTACT_236163], the speech language pathologist , will 
administer informed consent to the participant. During the consent process, either [CONTACT_236162] or [CONTACT_236164] will revie w the study with the participant and any family members present to answer questions. 
The participant will then read or be read the consent  and answer a few questions to demonstrate they have

7/29/[ADDRESS_285957] risk  
As listed above under Potential Risks, this application is expected to involve only mini mal increased risk 
from the research procedures for participants with swall ow disorders as only saliva swallows or 1-2 ml water 
swallows as needed (equivalent to a saliva swallow) will be used while the device is on. All participants will 
be producing saliva normally and will be exposed to the risk of saliva aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236112]. This risk occurs even when they are receiving enteral feeding either through a PEG tube or 
nasogastric tube. With the increased frequency in swallowing associated with the Self-Trainer , there is a 
minimal increased risk for  the participant because of their swallowing disorder.  
To minimize the risk associated with saliva aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], the speech language pathologist conducting the 
research will train all participants and their caregivers on a daily regimen to follow for secret ion aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236113]. Each participant  and their caregivers will be 
trained  to competency on the following aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236114]:  
1. Oral hygiene including cleaning the mouth, teeth (or dentures), tongue, etc. with toothpaste and 
mouthwash, as deemed appropriate, after meals or [ADDRESS_285958] .  If voice quality sounds “wet” they will be trained to voluntarily move secretions 
away from the airway by [CONTACT_236155]/coughing to bring the secretions in the mouth and then 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_236115].  
3. Daily body temperature monitoring : The participant and their caregivers  will be instructed to  
contact [CONTACT_236156] a rise in body temperature over three days sequentially while 
participating in the study.  
4. Participants and caregivers wi ll be instructed to only use the Self -Trainer while sitting in an upright 
position, which may be helpful in preventing the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236116]. If the participant 
needs to lay down for any reason, the Self -Trainer should be switched off and/or re moved from the 
participant’s neck.  They will also be instructed not to use the self -trainer during vigorous exercise  
(like running)  as this would be cumbersome and could result in damage to the device .  
5. Participants will be instructed not to use the device with any oral intake they are unsafe for. The SLP 
will make recommendations as to what food consistencies the participant is safe for consuming 
while using the device. If they are unsafe on all consiste ncies, the recommendation will be not to 
wear the device while there is any food in their mouth.  
D. Adverse events  
Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of adverse events throughout their enrollment in the 
clinical study.  All adverse events occu rring during the course of the clinical study, whether device -
related or otherwise, will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. Records of adverse events (AE) will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_2216], [CONTACT_236165], the Study Team and the JMU and SRMH  IRBs for p articipants 
in the protocol.  Serious adverse events (SAE) will be evaluated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kini and reported to the IRBs at 
JMU and SRMH  within [ADDRESS_285959] been  anticipated.  The IRBs will 
evaluate the reports of AEs/SAEs to determine if use of the device shows increased ris k of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_236117] “more than minimal “ risk.

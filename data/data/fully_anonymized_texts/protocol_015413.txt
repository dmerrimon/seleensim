TITLE: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Assess the 
Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of TPOXX® When Administered Orally for 
28 Days in Adult Subjects 
STUDY PHASE: 3 STUDY SITES:  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TPOXX 
when  administered orally for 28  days in adult subjects. 
Secondary:  
The secondary objective of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TPOXX when  administered orally for 28 days in adult subjects. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
This is a Phase  3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess 
the safety, tolerability, and PK of oral TPOXX [ADDRESS_377265] 4 45 subjects (includes  a PK subset of 40 subjects), ages 18 to 80, inclusive, 
will be enrolled and randomly assigned within stratified age groups (18 to 30 years, 31 to 
45 years, 46 to 64 years, and 65 to 80 years) to 1 of 2  treatment groups in an overall 
randomization of 4:1 (approximately 356 subjects will receive TPOXX and 89 subjects will receive TPOXX matching placebo). There will be [ADDRESS_377266] ’s 
body weight : subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less will be administered either  
TPOXX 600 mg or placebo two times a day (BID), 12 hours apart (±30 minutes); and subjects with a body w eight more than 120 kg will be administered either  TPOXX 600  mg or 
placebo three times a day (T ID), 8 hours apart (±30 minutes). The enrollment goal for the 
study is to randomly assign a sufficient number of subjects to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_377267] 92% of the oral TPOXX 600  mg BID or TID  dosing regimen over the 28- day 
treatment  period. Overall, across all clinical investigative sites, a goal of approximately 20% 
of subjects (i .e., 89 subjects) or more will be enrolled and randomly assigned in each age 
group to ensure a respective investigation of TPOXX safety and PK across age g roups. The 
treatment groups will be as follows: 
• Treatment Group 1: An oral dose of 600 mg (3 × 200- mg capsules) TPOXX BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes] ) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days 
(Day  1 to Day 28).

Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 7 • Treatment Group 2: An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 8 hours [±30 minut es]) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28  days  
(Day  1 to Day 28). 
When study drug is administered at the clinical  investigative site, all subjects will be 
provided a meal (consisting of approximately 600 calories and 25 g of fat). The meal should 
be consumed within 30 minutes and prior to the administration of study drug ( TPOXX or 
matching placebo ). Subjects should be administered study drug as soon as possible following 
completion of the meal but no more than 30 minutes should elapse between meal completion and administration of study drug. Subjects should take study drug w ith 8 oz. (240 mL) of 
water. Subjects will be instructed at the screening visit and prior to check -in to the clinical 
investigative site on either Day –1 or Day 1 that other than water, no beverages may be ingested within 3  hours before or 3 hours after study drug administration. 
When study drug (TPOXX or matching placebo) is administered at home, subjects will be instructed to take it within 30 minutes  after the completion of a meal consisting of 
approximately 600 calories and 25 g of fat and with 8 oz. (240 mL) of water. Other than water, no beverages may be ingested within [ADDRESS_377268]  result s (hematology, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis), monitoring of adverse events ( AEs) including serious AEs (SAEs), vital sign  
measurement s (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and  body 
temperature) , electrocardiogram (ECG)  results , and physical examination  finding s. 
All subjects will have a follow -up telephone call [ADDRESS_377269] dose of study 
drug (Day 42 [+2 days] and Day 58 [+2 days] , respectively ) to report any AEs and SAEs. All 
AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be followed until 
resolution or until stability of the abnormality has been demonstrated as determined by [CONTACT_36284]/or medical monitor.

Safety Assessments:  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_106342]: monitoring and recording 
of AEs ; clinical laboratory test results (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis) ; 
pregnancy testing; vital sign measurements (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature); 12- lead ECG results ; and physical examination 
findings. A blood sample will be collected for all subjects who discontinue from the study for 
TPOXX plasma concentration if the ET  visit occurs within [ADDRESS_377293] ’s last 
dose of TPOXX/matching placebo in order to collect information about the relationship between TPOXX blood level and ET from the study. 
STUDY DRUG, DOSAGE, AND RO UTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Subjects Weighing 120 kg or L ess: 
• An oral dose of 600 mg (3 × 200-mg capsules) TPOXX BID (every 12 hours 
[±30 minutes]) for 28 days  
• An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) BID (every 12 hours 
[±30 minutes]) for 28 day s 
Subjects Weighing M ore  Than 120 kg: 
• An oral dose of 600 mg (3 × 200- mg capsules) TPOXX TID (every 8  hours 
[±30 minutes]) for 28 days  
• An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) TID (every 8 hours [±30 minutes]) for 28 days  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS : 
A summary of statistical considerations is provided below. More specific descriptions of the statistical methods to be used will be described in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP).  
Sample Size:  
There is no formal sample size calculation fo r this study. Although the sa mple size is not 
based  on statistical power considerations, administration of TPOXX 600 mg to 300 subjects 
provides approximately 95% probability of observing at least 1 occurrence of any AE if the 
incidence of AEs in the study population is 1% and is considered adequate to provide a reasonable assessment of safety and tolerability. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomly assigned to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_377294] 92% of  the doses of the 
BID or TID dosing regimen of oral TPOXX 600 mg over the 28- day treatment period.

 Page 15 Study Population:  
Adult subjects from [ADDRESS_377295] 
445 subjects will be enrolled  and randomly assigned into stratified age groups (18 to 
30 years, 31 to 45 years, 46 to 64 years, and 65 to 80 years). Approxima tely 356 subjects will 
be randomly assigned to receive active drug (TPOXX 600  mg) and 89 subjects will be 
random ly assigned  to receive placebo. Overall, across all cl inical investigative sites, a goal of 
approximately 20% of subjects ( i.e., 89 subjects) or more will be enrolled and randomly 
assigned in each age group to ensure a representative investigation of the safety and PK across age groups. 
Analysis Populations: 
All populations will be identified and finalized before the database lock. All subjects who are 
randomly assigned are considered study subjects. Study populations are defined as the following: 
• The Intent- to-Treat Population will include all subjects who were randomly assigned to 
the study ( i.e., a randomization number and randomization date are present in the 
database).  
• The S afety Population will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
(TPOXX or matching placebo). 
• The Per -Protocol (PP) Safety Population will include all subjects who received at least 
92% of the 600 mg BID or TID dos ing regimen  of TPOXX or matching placebo. 
• The PK P opulation will include all subjects in the PK subset who have taken at least 92% 
of the [ADDRESS_377296] from analysis. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
The PK Population will be used for the preparation of PK summaries and analys es.
 
Individual plasma concentration and time deviation data will be presented in a data listing. Plasma concentration data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53813] , time point, and study drug 
dosing regimen using the follow ing descriptive statistics: number of subjects, arithmetic 
mean, SD, coefficient of variation ( CV), minimum, median, and maximum. Individual and 
mean plasma concentration versus scheduled time profiles will be presented in figures on both linear and semilo garithmic scales.  Mean concentration versus scheduled time profiles 
will be presented by [CONTACT_308217]. 
The PK parameters of TPOXX will be analyzed using noncompartmental methods based on 
the actual sampling times. T he individual PK paramet ers will be presented in data listings 
and summarized by [CONTACT_308218]: number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV , geometric mean, geometric SD, geometric CV , minimum, median, and maximum.

 Page 16 Safety Analyses:  
The safety and tolerability data summaries will be presented separately for the Safety 
Population and the PP Safety Population and will also be presented by [CONTACT_308219] . 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_308220]. All AE data will be presented in a data listing. Treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], BID and TID study 
drug dosing regim en, and overall, as well as by [CONTACT_308221]. For a ny subject who discontinues the study for 
any reason , data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], reason for discontinuation, if the 
drug concentration was collected, and the result of the bioanalysis. In addition, SAEs and 
AEs leading to subject study discontinuation will be presented in the data listings and summarized by [CONTACT_3148], dosing regimen, and overall.  
The overall AE rat e will be defined as the percentage of subjects in the Safety Population and 
PP Safety Population who report at least [ADDRESS_377297] stratified for age group (18 
to 30, 31 to  45, 46 to  64, and 65 to  80 years). If expected cell counts are less than 5, then 
Fisher ’s exact test will be applied. An exact unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI), 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method, will be presented for each treatment group. For 
the difference in overall AE rates between treatment  groups, a continuity corrected exact 95% 
CI around the difference will be calculated. In addition, the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio and 95% CIs from the stratified analysis will be pr esented. The relationship of treatment  
group, age, clinical investigative  site, and their interactions on overall AE rate will also be 
investigated using a logistic regression model; CIs  for the odds ratios associated with each 
factor in the model will be presented. Further details will be included in the SAP. 
Time from the first dose to the first AE or to discontinuation from study for any reason will 
be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier quartile estimates along with 2 -sided 95% CIs. Treatment

1.1 BACKGROUND  
Historically, variola virus , the etiologic agent of smallpox, has been one of the more 
important human pathogens. Smallpox is highly communicable and carries exceptionally 
high morbidity. Secondary attack rates from 30% to 80% have been reported among 
unvaccinated members of households.1 Smallpox is defined by 2 clinical forms, variola major 
and variola minor. Mortality rates range from 1% for variola minor to 30% for variola ma jor.[ADDRESS_377300].  
In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approved oral TPOXX® for the 
treatment of human smallpox disease in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 
13 kilograms .  
1.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY 
Treatment with TPOXX following exposure to variola virus and prior to the onset of 
clinically diagnosed  smallpox disease would constitute postexposure prophylaxis treatment. 
For human smallpox, the asymptomatic incubation period following exposure to the variola virus may range from 7 to 19 days (most commonly 12 to 14 days) postexposure. This approximately  2-week asymptomatic incubation period (with variability in duration) in 
humans before the development of secondary viremia, symptoms, and the generation of neutralizing antibody responses, necessitates the need for a longer treatment duration of TPOXX as a prophylactic. Humoral immune responses in the form of hemagglutination inhibition, comple ment fix ing, and virus- neutralizing antibodies are detectable within 
approximately [ADDRESS_377301]-treatment virologic rebound, SIGA proposes the administration of TPOXX 600 mg for 28 days to support a postexposure prophylaxis 
treatment claim.  
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DOSE SELECTION  
TPOXX 600 mg (3 × 200- mg capsules) two times a day (BID) is the approved dose of 
TPOXX for the treatment of smallpox in patients weighing between [ADDRESS_377302] agreed that TPOXX dosing for patients weighing 120 kg 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 19 or more should be adjusted to 600 mg TPOXX three  times a day  (TID) .2 The 2 8-day T POXX 
treatment duration, rather than the 14-day duration, was chosen for the postexposure 
prophylaxis indication as a longer treatment period may be necessary to provide protection from smallpox from the time of initial exposure to variola virus until the development of protective neutralizing antibodies. This accounts for the 7- to 17-day, asymptomatic stage ; 
the subsequent 2- to 3-day, prodromal stage; and finally, the development of neutralizing antibodies, which are evident from about the sixth day following the onset of clinical symptoms and increase in antibody titer thereafter.

childbearing potential participating in this study will be required to agree to use an acceptable 
means of birth control from signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) and continuing 
through [ADDRESS_377304] result at the screening visit . For women of childbearing potential in the 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) subset, a urine pregnancy test will be performed  at check -in on Day –[ADDRESS_377305] dose of study drug  on Day 1. Additional serum pregnancy t esting will be 
performed on Days 7, 13, 21, and on Day  29 dosing complete /early termination (ET)  visit. 
For women  of childbearing potential not in the PK subset, a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at check -in on Day [ADDRESS_377306] dose of study drug. Additional serum pregnancy 
testing will be performed on Days 7, 14, 21, and on Day  29 dosing complete /ET visit. 
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding  or plan to become pregnant within 3 months after 
study drug administration will be excluded from the study; if a female subject becomes 
pregnant during study participation, study drug dosing will be discontinued, and the subject 
will be withdrawn from the study ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
As with all drugs, there is potential risk of an allergic reaction. At this time, there is no 
definitive information on the allergic activity of TPOXX. Headache and nausea have been 
the most common adverse events ( AEs) in clinical studies completed to date. There may be 
other side effects of TPOXX that are not yet known. Full details can be found in the TPOXX 
full prescribing information .
[ADDRESS_377307] health benefits from 
taking the study drug are expected. Study subjects may benefit from receiving the laboratory 
testing, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), and physical examinations. Others may benefit from 
knowledge gained in this study that may aid in the use of TPOXX for the treatment of 
smallpox . 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.[ADDRESS_377308] 445 subjects (includes  a PK subset of 40 subjects), ages 18 to 80, inclusive, 
will be enrolled and randomly assigned within stratified age groups (18 to 30 years, 31 to 
45 years, 46 to 64 years, and 65 to 80 years) to 1 of 2  treatment groups in an overall 
randomization of 4:1 (approximately 356 subjects will receive TPOXX and 89 subjects will 
receive TPOXX matching placebo). There will be 2 dosing regimens based on the subjects 
body weight : subjects with a body weigh t of 120 kg or less will be administered  either 
TPOXX 600  mg or placebo BID, 12 hours apart (±30 minutes); and subjects with a body 
weigh t of more than 120 kg will be administered TPOXX 600  mg or placebo TID, 8 hours 
apart (±30  minutes). The enrollment goal for the study is to randomly assign a sufficient 
number of subjects to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_377309]  92% of the oral 
TPOXX 600  mg BID o r TID  dosing regimen over the 28-day treatment period. Overall, 
across all clinical investigative sites , a goal of approximately 20% of subjects ( i.e., 
89 subjects) or more will be enrolled and randomly assigned in each age group to ensure a 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 21 representative investigation of TPOXX safety and PK across age groups. The treatment 
groups will be as follows: 
• Treatment Group 1: An oral dose of 600 mg (3 × 200- mg capsules) TPOXX BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes] ) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days 
(Day  1 to Day 28). 
• Treatment Group 2: An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) BID (every 12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 8 hours [±30 minutes] ) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days  
(Day  1 to Day 28). 
When study drug is administered at the clinical  investigative site, all subjects will be 
provided a meal (consisting of approximately 600 calories and 25 g of  fat). The meal should 
be consumed within 30 minutes and prior to the administration of study drug ( TPOXX or 
matching placebo ). Subjects should be administered study drug as soon as possible following 
completion of the meal but no more than 30 minutes should elapse between meal completion and administration of study drug. Subjects should take study drug  with 8  oz. (240 mL) of 
water. Subjects will be instructed at the screening visit and prior to check -in to the clinical 
investigative site on either Day –1 or Day 1 that other than water, no beverages may be 
ingested within 3  hours before or 3 hours after study drug administration. 
When study drug (TPOXX or matching placebo) is administered at home, subjects will be 
instruc ted to take it within 30 minutes  after the completion of a meal consisting of 
approximately 600 calories and 25 g of fat and with 8 oz. (240 mL) of water. Other than 
water, no beverages may be ingested within [ADDRESS_377310] results (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), monitoring of AEs including serious AEs (SAEs), vital sign measurements 
(systolic and diastolic  blood pressure s, heart  rate, resp iratory rate, and  body temperature), 
ECG results, and physical examination findings. 
All subjects will have a follow -up telephone call [ADDRESS_377311] dose of study 
drug (Day 42 [+2 days] and Day 58 [+2 days] , respectively ) to report any AEs and SAEs. All 
AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities will be followed until 
resolution or until stability of the abnormality has been demonstrated as determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or medical monitor.  
The study will consist of a  screening period (Day –28 to Day –2), 1 check -in, on- site visits 
(Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21), a  dosing complete /ET visit (Day 29), and 2 follow-up 
telephone calls ( Day 42 [+2 days] and Day 58 [+2 days]).  
The total duration of the study for each subject, including screening, treatment, and follow-up 
telephone calls, will be approxim ately 86 days . 
Non-PK Study Subjects: 
Those subjects not participating in the PK subset will check  into the clinical investigative site 
in the morning of Day  [ADDRESS_377312] dose of study drug administered at the clinical investigative 
site on Day 1, subjects will administer study drug at home f or all remaining doses through

The 28-
day supply of 200- mg TPOX X capsules and matching placebo capsules are supplied 
in 75- mL, high -density polyethylene bottles fitted  with a heat induction seal and 
child -resistant screw cap closure system. Each bottle of TPOXX and matching placebo will 
contain 42 capsules and will be labeled with at a minimum, the study number, bottle content, 
direction for distribution , storage conditions, and cautionary statement . The study drug will 
be provided to subjects in either 4 bottles (subjects weighing 120 kg or less) or 6 bottles 
(subjects weighing more than 120 kg) containing [ADDRESS_377342]’ s weight , for a total of 
6 capsules (1200 mg) or 9 capsules (1800 mg) per day . 
TPOXX and matching placebo must be stored in a secure area ( e.g., a locked cabinet), out of 
reach of children and pets, protected from moisture and light, and stored at room temperature 
(15°C to 30°C or 59°F to 86°F). 
TPOXX and matching placebo should not be refrigerated or used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_308184].

by [CONTACT_308234]. Study d rug accountability will be 
recorded in the subject ’s source documentation, entered in the eCRF, and reviewed by [CONTACT_308235]. On a regular basis and after study completion or termination of the study, the monitor will prepare used and unused study drug bottles for return and destruction. 
5.3 METHOD OF ASSIGNING  SUBJECTS TO TREATMENT 
GROUPS  
Randomization will be performed using an interactive web response system  (IWRS ). The 
randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_308236] (18 to 30 years, 31 to 45 years, 46 to 64 years, and 65 to 80 years ). In 
the event of the withdrawal of a clinical investigative  site, no adjustments to the 
randomization scheme will be implemented because site will not be used as a stratification 
factor . After a randomization number has been assigned, it will not be reused.

5.4 BLINDING  
5.4.1 Blinding Procedures  
This study will be performed as a double-blind study. All parties involved in the study except for the medical monitor (in the event of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction) and the unblinded statistician for DSMB Closed Session meetings, will remain blinded to the 
treatment until study completio n. Under routine circumstances, the blind will not be broken. 
TPOXX and matching placebo capsules are indistinguishable and all study drug bottles will 
be packaged the same way. Study drug bottle labeling will include all required identifying information e xcept for the identity of the study treatment.

options. In the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of the study drug 
administered to an individual subject, the investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_308237] [ADDRESS_377347] ’s randomization assignment . The investigator  will be responsible for documenting 
the time, date, reason for the code break, and the names of the personnel involved. All 
unblinding activities will be tracked via an audit trail in IWRS . Requests for unblinding of a 
subject ’s randomization assignment will be made through the I WRS  after consultation with 
the medical monitor. Subject code breaks by [CONTACT_308238]. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented on the appropriate page in  the eCRF , and SIGA  must be informed as soon as possible. The 
treatm ent assignment of subjects will remain blinded until all clinical evaluations have been 
completed. Unblinding at the end of the study will occur only by [CONTACT_308239], Inc.  TPOXX

ate was the required meal of approximately 600 calories and 25 g of fat, the date and time of 
their study drug doses, whether or not they took 3 capsules  of study drug at dosing,  and a 
comments for any missed capsules or dose . Subjects will also enter into the diary any new or 
changed  concomitant medications (including over-the-counter medications  taken , such as 
vitamin, supplemental, and herbal preparations), with the start and stop date of the medication, the reason for use, and any symptoms or problems (illness or injuries) that subjects  may have experienced. 
Subjects will be instructed to record all AEs in the subject diary. Instructions will be provided 
by [CONTACT_308240] s ites advising subjects to record the start and stop dates that they 
experience AE s. Subjects will be instructed to bring the subject diary with them to all study

6.1.1 Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection  
Blood samples ( approximately 5 mL) for the determination of plasma concentrations of 
TPOXX will be collected in lavender -topped K 3EDTA Vacutainer® tubes using a 20 gauge or 
larger needle, or from an in -dwelling  intravenous catheter using a vacutainer tube.  
Note: Refer to the investigative clinical site SOPs regarding flushing of peripherally inserted 
in-dwelling intravenous catheters and/or if a heparin lock is used, 1 cc of blood should be 
withdrawn and discarded before sample collection to assure that the heparin solution used to 
maintain catheter patency does not dilute the sample.  
Blood samples should be placed on wet ice or equivalent  (approximately 4°C to 8°C) and 
kept at this temperature until processed to  separate plasma.  
The exact time and date of sample collection will be recorded for each sample by [CONTACT_308243]’ s eCRF, on the vacutainer and cryovial labels, 
and the S pecimen Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7785]. In addition, the time of study drug administration before PK 
sampling will be recorded in  the subject ’s eCRF. Labels will contain the protocol number, 
matrix (plasma), subject number, date, and time drawn. For information that is not preprinted on the label, a fine tipped indelible marking pen is to be used to complete the entry.  
Pharmacokinetic Sample Processing  
The blood sample must be centrifuged immediately, if possible, or within less than or equal 
to 60 minutes of collection at 1000 to 1200 × g (2000 to 3000 rpm) for 10 minutes to separate 
plasma. Each plasma sample should be transferred via pi[INVESTIGATOR_173565] 2 cryovials labeled as described above and should be capped tightly. The second tube will be a duplicate and 
retained at the site as a back -up plasma  sample. If red blood cells are inadvertently drawn 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 42 into the plasma, the sample should be re-centrifuged as soon as possible. Adequate space 
between the solution and the tube cap should be allowed for expansion during freezing. 
Sample processing and storage should be as follows: 
Cryovial tubes containing plasma samples must be frozen at –70°C or below until shipment 
in a freezer equipped with a temperature monitor and temperature- activated alarm. 
Uncentrifuged specimens should not be frozen. The freez er should be equipped with a 
temperature monitor and should be checked on the weekend if it is not equipped with a temperature- activated alarm.  
The clinical investigative  sites will batch ship sets (primary and back -up plasma samples) of 
frozen plasma samples  using frozen shippers and dry ice. A log sheet listing the samples 
being shipped will be included in each shipment. Plasma samples will be shipped  on dry ice 
via courier to Alturas Analytics (Moscow, ID  [LOCATION_003]). B ack-up plasma samples will remain  at 
the c linical investigative site until further notice from SIGA. Shipments before weekends or 
holidays must be avoided. 
The samples will be shipped for analysis to:  Alturas Analytics , Inc.  
[ADDRESS_377353] 
Moscow, ID [ZIP_CODE], [LOCATION_003]  
Alturas Analytics  will stor e all plasma samples at –70°C until analysis for TPOXX is 
complete. SIGA will advise Alturas Analytics  when  to destroy any remaining plasma 
samples.  
6.1.2 Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_308244] a validated 
high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography- tandem mass 
spectrometry analys is for TPOXX in human plasma  method in accordance with the US FDA 
Guidance for Industry on Bioanalytical Method Validation.5 
6.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND ENDPOINTS  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by  [CONTACT_106342]: monitoring and recording 
of AEs ; clinical laboratory test results (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis); 
pregnancy testing; vital sign  measurement s (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 43 respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature) ; 12-lead ECG results ; and physical examination 
findings. A blood sample will be collected for all subjects who discontinue from the study for 
TPOXX plasma concentration analysis if the ET visit occurs within  [ADDRESS_377354] ’s last dose of TPOXX/matching placebo in order to collect information about the 
relationship between TPOXX blood level and ET from the study. 
For all safety assessments, t he investigator will determine whether results are  clinically 
significant, which is defined as any variation in a result  that has medical relevance and may 
result in an alteration in medical care ( e.g., active observation, diagnostic measures, or 
therapeutic measures). If clinical significance is noted, the result  and reason for significance 
will be documented and an AE will be reported on the AE page in the subject ’s eCRF . The  
investigator will monitor the subject until the result  has reached the reference range or the 
result  at screening, or until the i nvestigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically 
necessary . 
6.2.[ADDRESS_377355] dose of study drug until Day 42. 
Serious AEs will be collected up to Day 58. All AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities  should be followed until they are resolved or until stability of the 
abnormality has been demonstrated as determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or the medical 
monitor. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF 
and reported to SIGA , regardless  of their rel ationship to study drug or clinical significance. If 
there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definitions 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_308245]. 
A treatment- emergent AE  is defined as any event not present before exposur e to study drug 
or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational ne w drug safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 44 the study drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than an adverse reaction.  
An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a study drug. Adverse reactions belong to a subset 
of all suspected adverse reactions and indicate that there are reasons to conclude that the study drug caused the event. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ unexpected” if it is not listed in the Full 
Prescribing I nformation
2 or if it occurs with specificity or severity that has been previously 
observed with the study drug being tested . For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Full Prescribing 
Information referred only to elevated hepatic en zymes or hepatitis . Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the Full Prescribing Information listed  only cerebral vascular accidents. 
“Unexpected ,” as used in this definition, al so refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions 
that are mentioned in the Full Prescribing Information  as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with  the particular drug under investigation. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered  an SAE if, in the view of either the 
investigator , medical monitor, or SIGA , it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Results in d eath. 
• Is life-threatening  (subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event).  
• Requires i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] , other than 
elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], during the period of protocol defined surveillance. 
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Results in a per sistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Any other i mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475] , based upon appropriate medi cal 
judgment, the event  may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition or is otherwise 
considered to be medically significant. 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-[ADDRESS_377356] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An AE  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ life-threatening ” if, in the view of either 
the investigator , medical monitor, or SIGA , its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspect ed adverse reaction that , had it occurred in 
a more severe form,  might have caused death. All AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities will be followed until resolution or until stability of the abnormality 
has been demonstrated  as determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or medical monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse  Events 
Subjects  will be asked a standard question to elicit any medically  related changes in their 
well-being. They will also be asked if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], ha d any accidents, used 
any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over-the-counter medications).  
In addition to subject observations and A Es recorded in subject diaries, AEs will be 
documented from any data collected on the AE page in  the eCRF ( e.g., laboratory values, 
physical examination findings, and ECG changes) or other documents that are relevant to 
subject safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported , observed , or recorded in the subject diary from the first dose of study drug 
through the follow-up telephone call on Day 42 (+2 days) will be recorded on the AE page in  
the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment, type of event, date and time of onset, investigator- specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, date and 
time of resolution of the event, seriousness, any required treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome. Any AE s resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medi cations, or progression of disease states must also be reported. 
The Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities will be used to code all AEs.  This 
requirement indicates that for some events, follow-up may be required after the subject has 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-[ADDRESS_377357] is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time during the study following the administration of study drug on Day 1, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Prior to this, medical conditions reported by [CONTACT_308246]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that is considered serious by [CONTACT_188532]  
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), or any other event or condition regardless of grade, which in their  judgment 
represents a reportable event , must be reported to the medical monitor and SIGA as soon as 
the investigator becomes aware of the event. In addition, the event must be reported to [COMPANY_003] 
via the SAE hotline. The [COMPANY_003] SAE Report Form must be submitted within 24  hours of 
knowledge of the event. SIGA will be responsible for notif ying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of any SAE as outlined in US Title  21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 
Parts  [ADDRESS_377358] 
(IRB) directly.  
In addition, the investigator (or designee) must report any grade 3 (severe) AE that they deem 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug to the medical monitor and SIGA within 24 hours after becom ing aware of the event.  
After notification from the investigator, SIGA  will report all study drug -related and 
unexpected SAEs (those not listed in the TPOXX full prescribing information) to the FDA within [ADDRESS_377359] knowledge. The DSMB will also receive these reports (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].4).  
For this study, the following contact [CONTACT_308247]: 
 
 
 
The collection and monitoring period for SAEs is [ADDRESS_377360] dose 
of study drug (Day  58 [+2  days]) to report any SAEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
All AEs will be graded for intensity according to the current DAIDS AE Grading Table .3 
Any laboratory or clinical AE that is not listed on the DAIDS t able will be assessed for 
severity and classified into 1 of 5 clearly defined categories as follows:  
• Grade 1 ( Mild ): These events  require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• Grade 2 (Moderate): These events result in a low level of inconvenience or require minor therapeutic measures  and may cause some interference with normal functioning. 
• Grade 3 (Severe): These events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating . 
• Grade 4 (Life- threatening): Events that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], pla ce the 
subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred ( i.e., it does not include 
a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death). 
• Grade 5 (Death).  
Changes  in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. An A E characterized as 
intermittent require s documentation of the onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
Any occurrence of an AE will be ass essed for relationship to the study drug. A causal 
relationship means that the study drug caused (or is reasonably likely to have caused) the AE. This usually implies a relationship in time between the study drug and the AE; for example, the AE occurred shortly after the subject took the study drug. 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-[ADDRESS_377361] estimate at the time of reporting of an event and the degree of certainty about the 
causal relationship between the study drug administration and the AE will be graded as 
follows: 
Associated  
• Definite ly Related : The AE and administration of study drug are related in time, and a 
direct association can be demonstrated ( e.g., the event disappears or decreases with 
reduction in dose or cessation of study drug and recurs with re-exposure). 
• Probably Related : The AE and administration of study drug are reasonably related in time 
and/or follow a known pattern of response, and the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_308248]. 
• Possibly Related : The AE and administration of study drug are reasonably related in time 
and/or follow a known pattern of response, but the AE can be explained equally well by 
[CONTACT_308249] ( e.g., could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s 
clinical state or could have been due to environmental or other interventions). 
Not Associated  
• Unlikely Related: A potential relationship between study drug and the AE could exist (i.e., the possibility cannot be excluded), but the AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_308250] ( e.g., could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state or could have been due to environmental or other interventions). 
• Not R elated:  The AE is clearly due to extraneous causes ( e.g., underlying disease, 
environment) or exposure to the study drug has not occurred. Such events MUST have an alternative, definitive etiology documented in the subject’ s medical record/source 
document.

All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed until 
resolved or stabilized as determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or the medical monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Pregnancy  
Pregnant women are not eligible to participate in the study. Subjects must be counseled 
regarding prevention of pregnancy and encouraged to make every effort to avoid pregnancy 
during study participation. If a subject becomes pregnant during study participation, study drug dosing will be discontinued, and the subject will be withdrawn from the study. The pregnancy itself is not considered an SAE. However, the investigator must complete the 
pregnancy report form and fax it to [COMPANY_003] Pharmacovigilance within [ADDRESS_377362] will be asked to report the outcome of the pregnancy. If there is 
a congenital anomaly, this will be recorded as an SAE in the data forms for the mother (i.e. , 
the study subject). 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study after receiving the study drug, all safety 
evaluations will be collected as per protocol. In addition, at the time that the pregnancy is 
reported, consent will be requested to contact [CONTACT_308251]. 
If the partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, the partner will be asked for consent to 
allow her treating physician to provide SIGA or its designee with follow- up information 
regard ing the pregnancy and its outcome.

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  PLANS  
7.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULAT IONS  
There is no formal sample size calculation for this study. Although the sample size is not based on statistical power considerations, administration of TPOXX 600 mg to 300 subjects provides approximately 95% pro bability of observing at least 1 occurrence of any AE if the 
incidence of AEs in the study population is 1% and is considered adequate to provide a 
reasonable assessment of safety and tolerability. A sufficient number of subjects will be 
randomly assigned to ensure that at least [ADDRESS_377369] 92% of the doses of the 
BID or TID dosing regimen of oral TPOXX 600 mg over the 28- day treatment period.  
7.2 ANALYSIS SETS  
All populations will be identified and finalized before the database lock. All subjects who are randomly assigned are considered study subjects. Study populations are defined as the following: 
• The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will include all subjects who were randomly 
assigned to the study ( i.e., a randomization number and randomization date are present in 
the database).  
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 54 • The S afety Population will include  all subjects who received at least 1 dose of TPOXX or 
matching placebo . 
• The Per -Protocol (PP) Safe ty Population will include all subjects who received at least 
92% of the doses of TPOXX or matching placebo  600 mg BID or TID dosing regimen 
over the 28 day treatment period. 
• The PK P opulation will include all subjects in the PK subset who have taken at le ast 92% 
of the doses of the [ADDRESS_377370] from analysis. 
7.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Details of all statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan  (SAP) . All data 
collected will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis population will be presented in the data listings, but not included in the calculation of summary statistics.  
For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum).  
Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_308257], Safety, PP Safety, and PK Populations. The demographics table will also be summarized 
overall and by [CONTACT_308258]. For treatment -related 
tables  and listings , the data will be summarized by [CONTACT_308219]. 
The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects 
who complete the study will be presented. Frequency and percentage of subjects who 
withdraw or discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, will also be summarized.  
7.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The PK Population will be used for the preparation of PK summaries and analyses . 
Individual plasma concentration and time deviation data will be presented in a data listing. Plasma concentration data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53813] , time point, and study drug 
dosing regimen using the following descriptive statistics: number of subjects, arithmetic 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 55 mean, SD, coeffici ent of variation ( CV), minimum, median, and maximum. Individual and 
mean plasma concentration versus scheduled time profiles will be presented in figures on 
both linear and semilogarithmic scales.  Mean concentration versus scheduled time profiles 
will be p resented by [CONTACT_308259]. 
The PK parameters of TPOXX will be analyzed using noncompartmental methods based on 
the actual sampling times. The individual PK parameters will be presented in data listings 
and summarized by [CONTACT_308218]: number of subjects, arithmetic mean, SD, CV , geometric mean, geometric SD, geometric CV , minimum, median, and maximum.  
7.3.2 Safety Analyses  
The safety and tolerability data summaries will be presented separately for the Safety Population and the PP Safety Population and will also be presented by [CONTACT_308260]/matching placebo dosing regimen. 
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_308261]. All AE data will be presented in 
a data listing . Treatment -emergent AEs will  be summarized by [CONTACT_3148], BID and TID study 
drug dosing regimen, and overall, as well as by [CONTACT_308262]. For a ny subject who  discontinues the study 
for any reason , data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], reason for discontinuation, if the 
drug concentration  was collected, and the result of the bioanalysis. In addition, SAEs  and 
AEs leading to subject study discontinuation will be presented in the data listings and summarized by [CONTACT_3148], dosing regimen, and overall.  
The overall AE rate will be defined as the percentage of subjects in the Safety Popu lation and 
PP Safety Population who report at least [ADDRESS_377371] stratified  for age group 
(18 to 30, 31 to  45, 46 to  64, and 65 to  80 years). If expected cell counts  are less than 5, then 
Fisher ’s exact test will be applied. An exact unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI), 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method, will be presented for each treatment group. For 
the difference in overall AE rates between treatment  groups, a continuity corrected exact 95% 
CI around the difference will be calculated. In addition, the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio and 95% CIs from the stratified analysis will be presented. The relationship of treatment group, age, clinical investigative  site, and their interactions on overall AE rate will also be 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1 
 Page 56 investigated using a logistic regression model; CIs  for the odds ratios associated with each 
factor in the model will be presented. Further details will be included in the SAP. 
Time from the first dose to the first AE or to discontinuation from study for any reason will 
be analyzed using Kaplan- Meier quartile estimates along with 2 -sided 95% CIs. Treatment 
groups will be compared using the log rank test stratified by [CONTACT_308222]. If a subject 
does not experience any AE or does not discontinue from study, the time to first AE or time to discontinuation will be censored at the date of study completion. 
Toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be determined according to the DAIDS  AE Gr ading 
Table . The maximum postbaseline grade increase from baseline grade will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_308263] 1, 2, 3, 4, [ADDRESS_377372] results, vital sign 
measurements, and 12- lead ECG results will be summarized by [CONTACT_308264] ( number of 
subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Shift tables will be generated for 
clinical laboratory test results. Physical examination findings will be presente d in a data 
listing.  
Narratives will be presented for all deaths, subjects who reported SAEs, subjects withdrawn because of AEs, and grade 3 AEs deemed by [CONTACT_1010], probably, or 
definitely related to study drug.   
7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA  
Plasma  concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be treated as zero 
for descriptive statistics. Mean BLQ concentrations will be presented as BLQ, and the SD 
and CV will be reported as not applicable. Missing concentrations will be excluded from the 
calculations.  
For the PK analysis, BLQ values will be treated as zero with the exception that a BLQ value 
between [ADDRESS_377373]

will comply with current ICH guidance on quality and risk manageme nt. A ll aspects of the 
study will be monitored for compliance with applicable government regulatory requirements, 
current Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) , the protocol, and SOPs . The monitor will maintain 
current  personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and 
source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the investigator and staff. Electronic case report forms  (eCRFs) and electronic data capture will be utilized. The 
electronic data capture system is validated and compliant with US Title [ADDRESS_377384] traceability. There may be an internal quality review audit of the data and 
additional reviews by [CONTACT_24653].  
Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliabi lity of data include , but are not limited to: 
selection of qualified investigator s and appropriate clinical investigative sites , protocol 
training and review of protocol procedures with the investigators and study site personnel before the start of the stu dy, site initiation and periodic interim monitoring visits by [CONTACT_3642], and 
direct transmission of safety laboratory data into the [COMPANY_003] study database for all clinical safety laboratory tests performed. The eCRF will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness 
by a [COMPANY_003] clinical research associate (CRA) during on -site monitoring visits. Discrepancies 
will be resolved with the investigator s or designees, as appropriate. The data will be entered 
into the clinical study database and validated for accuracy. During on- site monitoring visits, 
100% source documentation verification will be performed . SIGA or the Joint Program 
Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense representatives 
may accompany the [COMPANY_003] CRA on any scheduled site visit. Investigator s will be informed in 
advance of any visitors to the clinical investigative site in addition to the [COMPANY_003] CRA.  
Representatives of SIGA ’s Quality Assurance department (or designee) may visit the site to 
carry out an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and [COMPANY_003] policy. Such audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for inspection and source document verification with the eCRF. Subject privacy must, however, 
be respected. Sufficient prior notice will be provided to allow the investigator to prepare 
properly for the audit. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_308270] a Licensing Application. The

AEs (including clinical and laboratory abnormalities) in participants enrolled in 
DAIDS -sponsored and -supported clinical trials. T he Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Corrected Version 2.1 
(July 2017)  updates and replaces version 2.1 (March 2017). 
DAIDS is grateful to the DAIDS Grading Table Working Group, numerous government and non-government affiliated medical subject matter experts and reviewers who were 
instrumental in the revision of the DAIDS grading table. 
Instructions for Use  
General Considerations  
The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Version  2.1 consists of parameters, or AEs, with severity grading guidance that are to be used 
in DAIDS clinical trials for safety data reporting to maintain accuracy and consistency in the 
evaluation of AEs. The term “ severe” is not the sa me as the term “serious ” in classifying 
AEs. The severity of a specific event describes its intensity, and it is the intensity which is 
graded. Seriousness, which is not graded, relates to an outcome of an AE and is a regulatory 
definition. 
Clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters in the DAIDS grading table as they are 
written to maintain data consistency across clinical trials. However, since some parameters 
can be reported with more specificity, clinical sites are encouraged to report parameters  that 
convey additional clinical information. For example, diarrhea could be reported as neonatal 
diarrhea; seizures, as febrile seizures; and pain, as jaw pain.  
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  
 Page 82 The DAIDS grading table provides an AE severity grading scale ranging from grades 1 to 5 
with descriptions for each AE based on the following general guidelines: 
• Grade 1 indicates a mild event  
• Grade 2 indicates a moderate event  
• Grade 3 indicates a severe event  
• Grade 4 indicates a potentially life -threatening event  
• Grade 5 indicates death (Note: Thi s grade is not specifically listed on each page of the 
grading table).  
Other points to consider include: 
• Use age and sex values as applicable.  
• Unless noted, laboratory values are for term neonates.  
• Where applicable, Standard International (SI) units are included in italics.  
Selecting and Reporting a Primary AE Term  
When selecting a primary AE term to report, sites should select the term that best describes 
what occurred to the participant. For example, a participant may present with itching, 
urticaria, fl ushing, angioedema of the face, and dyspnea. If the underlying diagnosis is 
determined to be an acute allergic reaction, sites should report “ Acute Allergic Reaction ” as 
the primary AE term.  
Primary AE terms should be reported using the DAIDS Adverse Experience Reporting System (DAERS) only if they meet expedited reporting criteria. However, all primary AE terms should be reported using protocol- specific case report forms (CRFs). Because the 
reported information is stored in different databases (i.e., safet y and clinical), sites should 
report primary AE terms using the same terminology for data consistency.  
When reporting using DAERS, other clinically significant events associated with a primary AE term that more fully describe the nature, severity, or complications of the primary AE term should be entered in the “ Other Events” section. However, the severity grade for these 
events must be lower than or equal to the severity grade of the primary AE term. In the 
SIGA Technologies, Inc.  TPOXX 
Protocol No. SIGA -246-024 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  
 Page 83 example above, dyspnea and angioedema of the face may be entered in the “Other Events” 
section, because they are more descriptive and provide additional information on the severity 
of the acute allergic reaction. However, their severity grades must be lower than or equal to the severity grade of the primary AE term of “ Acute Allergic Reaction ”. 
Differences exist in the reporting and recording of information (e.g., signs and symptoms, 
clinically significant events) in DAERS and CRFs. Therefore, sites should refer to their 
protocols and CRF requirements for further instructions. 
Grading Adult and Pediatric A dverse E vents 
When a single parameter is not appropriate for grading an AE in both adult and pediatric 
populations, separate parameters with specified age ranges are provided. If no distinction 
between ad ult and pediatric populations has been made, the listed parameter should be used 
for grading an AE in both populations. 
Reporting Pregnancy Outcomes  
In the Pregnancy, Puerperium, and Perinatal section, all parameters are pregnancy outcomes 
and should be reported using the mother's participant ID. If an infant is not enrolled in the same study as the mother, any identified birth defects should be reported using the mother's participant ID. However, if an infant is enrolled in the same study as the mother or in another 
study, any identified birth defects should be reported using the infant's participant ID. Sites 
should refer to the applicable network standards for reporting abnormal pregnancy outcomes on the CRFs. 
Determining Severity Grade for Parameters between Grades  
If the severity of an AE could fall in either one of two grades (i.e., the severity of an AE 
could be either grade 2 or grade 3), sites should select the higher of the two grades. 
Using Addenda 1 -3: Grading Tables Used in Microbicide Studies  
In protocols involving topi[INVESTIGATOR_308190], strong consideration should be given to using Addenda 1 to 3 (see below) as the 
primary grading tables for these areas. Although these grading tables are used specifically in microbicide studies, they may be used in other protocols as adjuncts to the main grading table 
(i.e., the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
Version  2.0). It should be clearly stated in a protocol which addendum is being used as the

addendum is being used in a complementary fashion.

Estimating Severity Grade for Parameters Not Identified in the Grading Table  
The functional table below should be used to grade the severity of an AE that is not 
specifically identified in the grading table. In addition, all deaths related to an AE are to be 
classified as grade 5.

 1. Introduction  
The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) is to define and ensure that the data listings, 
summary tables an d figures that will be produced, and the statistical methods that will be used are 
complete and appropriate to allow valid conclusions consistent with the study objectives. This SAP 
V2 dated March XX, 2023 is written bas ed on SIGA Protocol: SIGA -246-024, version 2.0, dated 
[ADDRESS_377427] 2022.  
TPOXX 600 mg (3 × 200 -mg capsules) two times a day (BID)  for 14 days  is the approved dose of 
TPOXX for the treatment of smallpox in patients weighing between 13 kg and less than 120 kg,.  
TPOXX dosing for patients weighing 120 kg or more should be adjusted to 600 mg TPOXX three 
times a day (TID).1 The 28 -day TPOXX treatment duration, rather than the 14 -day duration, was 
chosen for the postexposure prophylaxis indic ation as a longer treatment period may be necessary 
to provide protection from smallpox from the time of initial exposure to variola virus until the 
development of protective neutralizing antibodies. This accounts for the 7 - to 17 -day, 
asymptomatic stage; the subsequent 2 - to 3-day, prodromal stage; and finally, the development of 
neutralizing antibodies, which are evident from about the sixth day following the onset of clinical 
symptoms and increase in antibody titer thereafter.  
2. Study Objectives  
2.1. Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TPOXX when 
administered orally for [ADDRESS_377428] 445 subjects  (includes a PK subset of 40 subjects), ages 18 to 80, inclusive, will 
be enrolled and randomly assigned within stratified age groups (18 to  30 years, 31 to 45 years, 
46 to 64 years, and 65 to 80 years) to 1 of 2 treatment groups in an overall randomization of 4:1 
(approximately 356 subjects will receive TPOXX and 89 subjects will receive TPOXX matching 
placebo). There will be [ADDRESS_377429] ’s body weight: subjects with a body 
weight of 120 kg or less  will be administered either TPOXX 600 mg or placebo two times a day 
(BID), 12 hours apart (±30 minutes); and subjects with a body weight of more than [ADDRESS_377430] ered TPOXX 600 mg or placebo three times a day (TID), 8 hours apart (±30 minutes). 
The study will consist of a screening period (Day –28 to Day –2), 1 check -in, on -site visits (Day 7, 
Day 14, and Day 21), a dosing complete/ET visit (Day 29), and 2 follow -up telephone calls (Day 42 
[+2 days] and Day 58 [+2 days]). The total duration of the study for each subj ect, including 
screening, treatment, and follow -up telephone calls will be approximately [ADDRESS_377431] 92% of the oral TPOXX 600 mg BID or TID dosing 
regimen over the 28 -day treatment period. Overall, across all clinical investigative sites, a goal of 
approximately 20% of subjects (i .e., 89 subjects) or more will be enrolled and randomly assigned 
in each age group to ensure a representative investigation of TPOXX safety and PK across age 
groups. The treatment groups will be as follows:  
• Treatment Group 1: An oral dose of  600 mg (3 × 200 -mg capsules) TPOXX BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days 
(Day  1 to Day 28).  
• Treatment Group 2:  An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days (Day 
1 to Day 28 ). 
Subjects that fail to meet any inclusion or  meet one or more  exclusion criteria prior to study drug 
administration will not be randomized into  the study. Under certain circumstances, a subject may 
be terminated from participating in the study based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871],  the medical 
monitor,  the sponsor , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , and/or the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  
Subjects can withdraw consent and discontinue from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without pre judice to further treatment.  
 
The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study for any of the following:  
 
• Subject is in violation of the protocol.  
• Subject experiences a serious or intolerable AE that in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_308212] . 
• Subject becomes pregnant . 
• Subject is noncompliant . 
• Subject has laboratory abnormalities for assessments listed in Sections 4.1 or Section 4.2 
that meet grade 3 or grade 4 on the Division of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome 
(DAIDS) AE Grading Table; any other grade 3 or grade 4 AE; or a grade 2 or higher rash 
considered by [CONTACT_1010], probably, or definitely related to study 
drug.  
• Subject develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions list ed in the 
exclusion criteria.  
• Subject develops  laboratory abnormalities listed in the exclusion criteria  during the 
course of the study .  
• Subject requires a medication prohibited by [CONTACT_760].  
• Subject requests an early discontinuation for any reason.  
• Subject’s primary care provider requests that the subject be withdrawn.  
 
The FDA, SIGA, or the DSMB may request  subject withdrawal based on study safety findings.  
 
  
The investigator can also withdraw a subject upon the request of SIGA or if SIGA terminates the 
study. Upon occurrence of an SAE or intolerable AE, the investigator will confer with the 
medical monitor and with SIGA. If a subject is discontinued because of  an AE, the event will be 
followed until it is resolved or stabilized as determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or the medical 
monitor.  
 
3.1. Subject Selection  
The study population will consist of male and female volunteers, aged 18 to 80 years inclusive.  
3.1.1 Inclusion Criteria  
As stated in Protocol Section 4.1.  
3.1.2 Exclusion Criteria  
As stated in Protocol Section 4.2.  
4. General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical  analyses will be conducted using statistical analysis system SAS® Version 9.4 or 
higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include number of subjects, mean, standard 
deviation (SD),  median, minimum, and maximum, unless otherwise noted. For categorical 
variables, frequencies a nd percentages will be presented.  
All tables, listings, and figures will be presented by [CONTACT_308290]. The treatments  below 
will be used for presentations:  
• TPOXX 600mg  
• Matching TPOXX Placebo  
 
Unless otherwise indicated, outputs which are summarize d by [CONTACT_308291].  
All data listings will be sorted by [CONTACT_3148]  (TPOXX or placebo), by [CONTACT_71397] (BID or 
TID dosing),  and subject number.  
Visit Windows  
There are no p lans to derive visit windows; visits will be used in the analyses as reported on the 
eCRF.  
Pooling of Sites  
Up to [ADDRESS_377432] pooling of data.  
Subgroups  
The effects of age group (18  to 30 years , 31 to 45 years , 46 to 64 years , and 65  to 80 years ) used 
for stratification at randomization and site will be investigated for AE and severe AE rates . Time 
to first AE or severe AE and time to withdrawal for any reason  will be calculated.  
Study day is relative to first dose of study drug. Study days are calculated with respect to the first 
dose date as below:  
• If the assessment/observation date is on or after the first dose date, then Study 
Day = Assessment/Observation Date – First Dose Date  + 1; 
• Otherwise, Study Day = Assessment/Observation Date – First Dose Date.  
Baseline will be defined as the last non -missing assessment (including repeated and unscheduled 
assessments) before the first dose of study drug administration, unless otherwise sp ecified.  
For summary of safety assessments, if there are repeated measurements at a time point, the first 
non-missing assessment at that time point will be used in the summary tables.  
Unscheduled results will not be included in the summary tables, except for determining Baseline, 
but will be presented in data listings.  
The methodology and data handling specifications for PK data are detailed in Section 8 . 
4.1. General Definitions  
 
Age: Will be calculated as the integer part of  the difference between birth date and the date of 
informed consent  divided by 365.25. Birth date with missing day will be imputed as day 15 and 
birth data with missing day and month will be imputed as 30 -June. 
 
Adverse Event : any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity 
or frequency since administration of the first dose of study drug.  
4.2. Sample Size  
There is no formal sample size calculation for this study. Although the sample size is not based on 
statistical power considerations, administration of TPOXX 600 mg to 300 subjects provides 
approximately 95% probability of observing at least 1 occurrence o f any AE if the incidence of 
AEs in the study population is 1% and is considered adequate to provide a reasonable assessment 
of safety and tolerability. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomly assigned to ensure that 
at least [ADDRESS_377433] 92% of the doses of the BID or TID dosing regimen of oral 
TPOXX 600 mg over the 28 -day treatment period.  
4.3. Randomization, Stratification, and Blinding  
Healthy subjects will be randomized to receive:  
 
 • Treatment Group 1: An oral dose of 600 mg (3 × 20 0-mg capsules) TPOXX BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 days 
(Day  1 to Day 28).  
• Treatment Group 2: An oral dose of placebo (3 capsules identical to TPOXX) BID (every 
12 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight of 120 kg or less or TID (every 
8 hours [±30 minutes]) for subjects with a body weight more than 120 kg for 28 day s (Day 
1 to Day 28).  
Randomization will occur according to the randomization schedule and will happen before the 
study drug administration on Day [ADDRESS_377434] fulfill s all eligi bility criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1  of 
2 treatment groups using a 4:[ADDRESS_377435] will 
receive placebo. This will be based on a randomization schedule prepared by a [COMPANY_003] biostatistician 
before the study. The groups will be stratified by [CONTACT_164737] ( 18 to 30 years, 31 to 45 years, 46 to 
64 years, and 65 to 80 years).  
This study will employ a double -blind study design. Treatment assignment will not be known to 
the subjects, the Sponsor, the inv estigator, or the staff who are involved in the clinical evaluation 
of the subjects and the analysis of data. The randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_308292]’s standard operating procedures.  
The medical monitor will be responsible for maintaining the blind throughout the study. If a subject 
becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the study, the blind will be broken only if knowledge of 
the administered study drug will affect that subject’s ava ilable treatment options. In the event of a 
medical emergency requiring identification of the study drug administered to an individual subject, 
the investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_308293] [ADDRESS_377436]’s randomization assignment. The 
investigator will be responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for the code break, and the 
names of the personnel involved. All unblinding activities will be tracked via an  audit trail in 
IWRS. Requests for unblinding of a  subject’s randomization assignment will be made through the 
IWRS after consultation with the medical monitor. Subject code breaks by [CONTACT_308294] . The date, time, and reason for the unblinding 
must be documented on the appropriate page in the eCRF, and SIGA must be informed as soon as 
possible. The treatment assignment of subjects will remain blinded until all clinical evaluations 
have been complet ed. Unblinding at the end of the study will occur only by [CONTACT_308295]. The DSMB may request t o unblind the 
treatment assignment of a subject or the study at any time.  
4.4. Administration of Study Medication  
Study Medication will be provided to subjects in 4 or 6 bottles (depending on weight which 
determines BID or TID daily dosing regimen) , which is equivalent to [ADDRESS_377437] weight.   
 
 4.5. Endpoints  
4.5.1 Safety Endpoints  
The primary outcome measure is the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of t wice or three times 
daily oral dosing of TPOXX 600 mg for 28 days through adverse event (AE) findings, clinical 
laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG) tests , and physical 
examinations.  The primary endpoint is the AE rate.  Othe r endpoints include severe AE rate, time 
to first AE and time to withdrawal for any reason.  
4.5.2 Pharmacokinetic En dpoints  
The plasma samples will be collected at specific time points before and after dosing to evaluat e 
the appropriate  pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints for TPOXX after treatment with oral TPOXX 600 
mg twice daily or three times daily in the PK subset.  A validated bioanalytical method will be 
used to analyze plasma samples for quantification of TPOXX . For relevant PK timepo ints, please 
refer to Section 8.2 . 
4.6. Analysis Sets

8.1. Collection Schedule  
Serial blood samples will be collected at the following time points  for PK assessment :  
• BID Dosing (Subjects weighing 120 kg or less)  
o Day 1: Before the first dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (before the second 
dose), 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 hours (before the first dose on Day 2)   
o Day 14: Bef ore the first dose (0 hour)  
o Day 28: Before the first dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (before the second 
dose on Day 28), 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 (Day 29, AM), 48 (Day 30, AM), and 72 
(Day 31, AM) hours after the first dose on Day 28  
• TID Dosing (Subjects weighing more than 120 kg)  
o Day 1: Before the first dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, 8 (before the second dose), 10, 
12, 14, 16 (before the third dose), 18, 20, 22, and 24 hours (before the first dose 
on Day 2)  
o Day 14: Before the first dose  (0 hour)  
o Day 28: Before the first dose (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6, 8 (before the second dose), 
10, 12, 14, 16 (before the third dose), 18, 20, 22, 24 (Day 29, AM), 48 (Day 30, 
AM), and 72 (Day 31, AM) hours after the first dose on Day 28  
For PK blood samples , the acceptable window for collection from the scheduled collection time 
point will be as follows: ±15 minutes from 0 to 24 hours (except where samples are collected 
predose) and ±60 minutes from 48 to 72 hours . 
Individual plasma concentrations  and time d eviation data will be presented in data listings .  
Plasma concentration data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of 
observations, arithmetic mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_53813], time 
point, and study drug dosing reg imen.   
Individual plasma concentrations versus nominal time will be plotted on both linear and semi -
logarithmic scales. Mean plasma concentrations versus scheduled time will be plotted by [CONTACT_308304] -logarithmic scales.  
 
 8.2. Data Handling  
Data rounding specifications for PK data are documented in the PK table, listing, and figure 
shells.  
Plasma concentrations that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) will be replaced by  [CONTACT_308305]. Mean BLQ concentrations will be 
presented as BLQ, and the SD and coefficient of variation ( CV) will be reported as not 
applicable. Missing concentrations will be excluded from the calculations.  
Non-compartmental PK parameters for TPOXX will be calculated. Actual sampling times will 
be used in the determination of the individual PK parameters.  
Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data  
Missing concentration data for all subjects who take scheduled study drug treatment will be 
considered as non -informative missing and will not be imputed.  
The following rules will apply for the derivation of all kinds of AUCs:  
• Concentration values that are BLQ for pre -dose samples will be treated as zero.  
• The sampling time relative to dosing f or pre -dose samples will also be treated as zero.  
• Concentration values that are BLQ before the first quantifiable concentration will be 
treated as zero.  
• Post-dose BLQ values after the first quantifiable time point that are flanked or followed 
by [CONTACT_308306].  
• Post-dose BLQ value after first quantifiable time point that are not followed by 
[CONTACT_308307].  
If the actual time of sampling is missing, the nominal time may be used.  
No further imputation will be applied to any missing values.  
8.3. Plasma Pharmacokinetic Parameters and Definitions  
Plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analysis using Phoenix® 
WinNonlin® Version 8.0 or higher (Certara [LOCATION_003],  Inc., Princeton, NJ). The following PK 
parameters will be calculated for TPOXX, where data permit :

only).  
CL ss/F Apparent t otal body  clearance, calculated as : Dose  / AUC tau (Day 28 
only).  
Vz/F Apparent v olume of distribution during the terminal phase, calculated as : 
Dose / [ λz * AUC tau] (Day 28 only).  
RacC max Accumulation ratio based on C max, calculated as: C max (following first 
dose on Day 28) / C max (following first daily dose on Day 1).  
RacAUC  Accumulation ratio based on AUC, calculated as: AUC tau (following first 
dose on Day 28) / AUC tau (following first daily dose on Day 1).  
Fluctuation  Calculated as: (C max – Ctau) / C tau * 100 (Day 28 only).  
In addition to the above PK parameters, which will be listed and summarized, the following 
parameters will also be listed to document the selection of data points used to estimate t 1/2 using 
non-compartmental proced ures:  
Number  
points  Number of data points used to estimate λz; a minimum of [ADDRESS_377444] not be included  (Day 28 only) . 
λz lower  Lower bound used for the estimation of λz (Day 28 only) . 
λz upper  Upper bound used for the estimation of λz (Day 28 only) . 
Span  Number of elapsed half -lives over which λz is estimated, calculated as 
(λz upper – λz lower)  / t½. (Day 28 only)  
Rsq r2, the coefficient of determination (goodness of fit statistic); λz and al l 
associated parameters will  only be reported  where  r2 ≥ 0.80 . (Day 28 
only)  
Actual sampling times will be used for the estimation of all matrix PK parameters, and all 
concentrations will be included in the analysis (including concentrations collected outside 
predefined collection windows).  
Plasma PK parameters will be presented in data listings and su mmarized separately using 
descriptive statistics (number of observations, arithmetic mean, SD, CV, geometric mean, 
 
 geometric SD, geometric CV, median, minimum, and maximum) by [CONTACT_308308] . Tmax will be summarized using number of  observations, median, minimum, and 
maximum only.  
9. Safety Analysis  
The Safety Population and the Per -Protocol Safety Population will be used for the safety data 
summaries and analysis. All safety data collected will be listed. The safety and tolerability data 
summaries will be presented separately for the Safety Populatio n and the PP Safety Population and 
will also be presented by [CONTACT_308260]/matching placebo dosing regimen.   Safety will be 
assessed on the basis of AE reports, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, ECG parameters and 
physical examinations.  
For a ll subjects that discontinued, data will be summarized by [CONTACT_308309] , 
and reason for discontinuation.  
9.1. Extent of Exposure  
All derived exposure variables and variables recorded on the eCRF will be listed by [CONTACT_41163].  
9.2. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance will be derived for each subject and listed with exposure data.   
% Compliance= (Number of capsules dispensed - Sum of number of capsules returned and lost) 
/(Number of capsules dispensed) X [ADDRESS_377445] 92% 
compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_308309].  
9.3. Adverse Events  
The primary objective of t his study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TPOXX when 
administered orally for [ADDRESS_377446] accounting for age  (18 to 30 years, 31 to 45 years, 46 to 64 years, and 65 to 
80 years).  If expected cell counts are less than 5, then Fisher’s extract test will be applied.  The 
AE rate is the number of subjects who report at  least [ADDRESS_377447] 
unadjusted 95% confidence interval (CI), calculated using the Clopper -Pearson method, will be 
given for eac h treatment group.  For the difference in AE rates between the treatment groups, a 
continually corrected exact 95% CI around the difference will be calculated.  In addition, the 
Mantel -Haenszel adjusted odds ratio and 95% Cis from the stratified analysis w ill be presented.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_377448] 
adeq uate assessment; this is expected to be on the Day 42 (+2 day) Follow -up Telephone Call.   
 
 Time to First AE (days) = (Date of first AE – Date of first dose) +[ADDRESS_377449] AE will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier (KM) quartile estimates along with 2 sided 95% 
CIs.  Treatment groups will be compared using the log rank test stratified by [CONTACT_308310]. Statistical significance will be assessed at the 0.[ADDRESS_377450] does not discontinue from the study, time to withdrawal for 
any reason will be censored at the date of study completion; this is expected to be the Day 42 (+ 2 
days) Follow -up Telephone Call.   
Time to Withdrawal for Any Reason (days) = (Date of study withdrawal – Date of first dose ) + [ADDRESS_377451] does not discontinue or withdraw from the study, the time to discontinuation  will be 
censored at the date of study completion.  
9.3.3 Adverse Event Summaries  
An adverse event (AEs) will include any newly occurring event or previous condition that has 
increased in severity or frequency since administration of the first dose of study drug.   If there are 
partial AE start date and times, an AE will be date/time  of onset on or after the time of first dose 
of study medication on Day 1 to Day 42 (+2 day) Follow -up Telephone Call.  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_11702]  (PT) and system org an class (SOC) using 
MedDRA (version to be delineated in the CSR).  
Each AE will be graded for severity and classified into one of five categories according to Division 
of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric AEs (protocol Appendix 
4):  Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Gra de 4 (life threatening), and Grade 5 
(death).   
Each AE is assessed for relationship to study drug. Terms to describe the degree of causality 
between a study drug and an event are definitely, probably, possibly, unlikely related or not related. 
If relation ship to study drug is missing, it will be regarded as definitely related for the purposes of 
data summaries.   
Frequency of AEs will be calculated for each system organ class, by [CONTACT_308311] e vent for the Safety Population and the Per -Protocol 
Safety Population.  
Each AE will be counted only once per subject at the preferred term level.  
 
 For summaries of AEs by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, maximum severity and treatment the 
rule is as foll ows:  if a subject experiences more than one epi[INVESTIGATOR_308213], the subject is counted 
only once by [CONTACT_308312][INVESTIGATOR_1865] (preferred term).  If a subject has more than 
one AE within a system organ class, the subject is counted only once in tha t system organ class.  
Similarly, when study drug relationship is presented, the strongest relationship to study drug is 
used for AEs mappi[INVESTIGATOR_308214], or within a system organ class.  
Summaries will be ordered by [CONTACT_308313] S OC and then, within a SOC, by [CONTACT_308314].  
The following AE tables will be produced:  
• An Overall summary of the number of events and number and percentage of subjects 
reporting  the following:  
o All AES  
o Serious AEs  
o Treatment -related AEs  
o AEs leading to early study discontinuation and  
o AEs leading to death  
• AEs overall by [CONTACT_6657]  
• AEs by [CONTACT_764] , overall and by [CONTACT_6657]  
• AEs by [CONTACT_308315], overall and by [CONTACT_39812]  
• Treatment -related AEs, overall and by [CONTACT_6657]  
• Serious AEs, overall and by [CONTACT_6657].  
 
In general, all AE tables will show the number and percentage of subjects with an event. The 
number of events overall by [CONTACT_308316].  
A listing of all AEs will provide details including system organ class, preferred term, verbatim 
term, whether treatment was emergent or not, severity, relationship to treatment, onset and 
resolution date and time, duration (in days  for any AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, in hours  
otherwise,  derived as stop date and time – start date and time), action and  outcome.  Similar listings 
will be presented for SAEs, AEs with Grade 3 or higher, AEs with a fatal outcome (or Grade 5) 
and AEs leading to early withdrawal.   
Toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be determined according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table2. 
The maximum post -baseline grade increase from baseline grade will be summarized by [CONTACT_308317] 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 to 4, 2 to 4, and 3 to 4, 
respectively.  
All AEs will be presented  in a data listing.

72 𝑥 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑢𝑚  𝑐𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑒  (𝑚𝑔
𝑑𝐿){𝑥 0.85 𝑖𝑓 𝑓𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑒 } 
The hematology , serum chemistry, and u rinalysis tests will be performed at the time  points 
indicated in the schedule  of assessments ( schedules of assessments can be found in Section 13 . 
Glycosylated hemoglobin  and a fasting lipid panel including cholesterol (tot al, high -density 
lipoprotein, calculated low -density lipoprotein, and triglycerides) will be performed at screening.  
For women of childbearing potential, serum pregnancy test will be performed at the screening visit 
and analysed  by [CONTACT_308318]. A urine  pregnancy test will be performed and read locally at 
check -in on Day -1 (PK subset) or predose on Day 1 (Non -PK s ubset). Serum pregnancy tests will 
be read by [CONTACT_308319] ( Section 13 ). 
All positive urine pregnancy tests will be verified using the ß-human chorionic gonadotropin test.  
For postmenopausal women , a serum follicle -stimulating hormone test will be performed at 
screening.  
All clinical laboratory test results will be presented in the data listings.  Laboratory values that are 
outside of the normal reference  range will be flagged in the data listings.  
Actual results and change from baseline for hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis at each 
time point will be summarized for the Safety and PP Safety Population s by [CONTACT_308320] . Shift from baseline in terms of 
low/normal/high for hematology and serum chemistry tests, and in terms of normal/abnormal for 
urinalysis tests will be summarized for the safety population.   
A urine drug screen for alcohol, cotinine, amphetamines (including  methamphetamines and 
ecstasy/methylenedioxymethamphetamine), barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids 
 
 (including tetrahydrocannabinol), cocaine metabolites, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (including heroin, codeine, and 
oxycodone) will be performed at screening and sent to the central lab.  
Day –1 (Check -in - PK Subset or Day 1 (Predose - Non-PK Subset) ( Section 13 ): 
A urine drug screen for cotinine, amphetamines (including methamphetamines and 
ecstasy/methylenedioxymethamphetamine), barbitu rates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids 
(including tetrahydrocannabinol), cocaine metabolites, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (including heroin, codeine, and 
oxycodone) will be performed and read locally. Blood alcohol will be tested using a breathalyzer 
device at the clinical investigative site.  
Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be flagged as either high or low (or normal or abnormal) 
based on the reference range for each laboratory parameter. The investigator will determine 
whether any of the abnormally high or low res ults are clinically significant or not clinically 
significant.  
Toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be determined according to the DAIDS AE Grading Table2. 
Actual values and changes from baseline for clinical laboratory test r esults, will be summarized 
for Safety and PP Safety Populations and by [CONTACT_308321].  
9.5. Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital signs will be measured after the subject has been seated for at least 5  minutes at the time 
points indicated in the schedule  of events ( Section 13 ). 
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and body temperature .   
The investigator will determine whether any of the vital sign measurements are clinically 
significant or not clinically signi ficant. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in results 
that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (e .g., active observation, 
diagnostic measures, or therapeutic measures). If a clinically significant change fro m the screening 
values is noted, the clinically significant value and reason for clinical significance will be 
documented on the AE page of the subject’s eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the 
subject with additional assessments until the valu e has reached the reference range or the value at 
screening or until the investigator determines that follow up is no longer medically necessary.  
Summary tables presenting observed values and changes from baseline will be summarized for 
Safety and PP Safe ty populations and by [CONTACT_308322].  
All vital sign data will be presented in a data listing. All vital sign s, body weight, and height 
measurements will be presented  in a data listing.   
9.6. Physical Examination  
Full physical examinations will be performed at the time points indicated in the schedules of events 
(Section 13 ) and will include, at minimum, assessment of the following body systems: head, ears, 
 
 eyes, nose, and throat; cardiac (including auscultation of heart); pulmonary (chest) auscultation of 
lungs; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal system; lymphatic system; and neurologic system (cranial 
nerves, sensation, motor function, coordination, reflexes, and men tal status).  
A symptom -directed physical examination  will be performed on Day 31 (PK subset only) as well 
as unscheduled physical exam ination s at the discretion of the investigator, if necessary, to evaluate 
AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
Height and weight will be measured at screening only.  
Physical examination results will be presented in a data listing.  
9.7. Electrocardiograms  
A stand ard [ADDRESS_377452] 10 minutes at the time points indicated in the schedule of events  (Section 13 ).  
Electrocardiogram assessments will include comm ents on whether the tracings are normal, 
abnormal, indeterminate, not evaluable and unknown. The following parameters will be measured 
and reported: heart rate; PR interval, QT intervals; QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s 
formula; QRS duration and R R interval. All ECGs must be performed by [CONTACT_308323].  
The investigator will determine whether any of the 12 -lead ECG results are clinically significant 
or not clinically significant. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in r esults that has 
medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (e .g., active observation, 
diagnostic measures, or therapeutic measures). If a clinically significant change from screening is 
noted, the clinically significant value and rea son for clinical significance will be documented on 
the AE page of the subject’s eCRF. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject with 
additional assessments until either the values have reached reference range or the values at 
screening or unti l the investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary.  
Summaries will be presented separately for the Safety Population and the PP Safety Population 
and will also be presented by [CONTACT_308324]. ECG tables presenting o bserved 
values and changes from baseline will be presented for numeric results. Changes from baseline to 
each scheduled post baseline visit will be presented.  
All ECG data will be presented in a data listing.  
9.8. Unscheduled Visits  
Clinical investigative sites  will provide subjects with the contact [CONTACT_308325]. Subjects are free to contact [CONTACT_308326], and the  clinical 
investigative  site may require an unscheduled visit for the purpose of physical examinations, 
laboratory tests, etc. Unscheduled visits will be documented by [CONTACT_308327]. Unscheduled procedures and laboratory tests and results will also be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
 
 10. Timing of Analyses  
10.1. Final Analysis  
 
The primary analysis of safety and pharmacokinetics is planned after all subjects  complete the 
final study visit or terminate early from the s tudy and the data base has been hard  locked.  
10.2. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) Analysis  
 
An independent DSMB wil l review descriptive summaries of accumulating safety data at least 4 
times during the course of the study as described in Protocol Section [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_377453] dummy treatment and/or subject codes assigned to maintain the study blind.   
 
Interim Analysis:  No formal interim analys is is planned for this study.   
 
11. Changes in the Planned Analysis  
Protocol version 1.0, dated 04 NOV 2021 , states that “ the rela tionship of treatment group, age, 
clinical investigative site, and their interactions on overall AE rate will also be investigated using 
a logistic regression model…”. This is an outcome that will not be presented in the TLFs.  
Any further changes from thi s SAP and the protocol  will be documented in the CSR for this 
study.

(e) A full physical examination will include, at minimum, assessment of the following body systems, head, ears, eyes, nose, and t hroat; cardiac 
(including auscultation of heart); pulmonary (chest) auscultation of lungs; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal system; lymphatic system; and 
neurologic system (cranial nerves, sensation, motor function, coordination, reflexes, and mental status). Interim, unschedule d, symptom -directed 
physical examination will be performed at the discretion of the i nvestigator, if necessary, to evaluate AEs or clinical laboratory abnormalities.  
(f) Vital signs will be measured after the subject has been in the seated position for at least 5  minutes  and will include systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures, heart rate, resp iratory rate, and body temperature.  
(g) Vital signs will be measured within [ADDRESS_377459] dose of the day. The acceptable window 
for collection is ±15 minutes from the scheduled time point  
(h) Includes alc ohol, cotinine, amphetamines (including methamphetamines and ecstasy/methylenedioxymethamphetamine), barbiturates, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cannabinoids (including tetrahydrocannabinol), cocaine metabolites, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (including heroin, codeine, and oxycodone). A 
urine drug screen including alcohol and cotinine will be collected and sent to the central laboratory at the screening visit.  A urine drug screen and 
alcohol breath test using a breathalyzer will be performed and read locally on Day  1. 
(i) Fasting lipid pane l will include cholesterol (total, high -density lipoprotein, calculated low -density lipoprotein, and triglycerides).  
(j) Clinical laboratory testing will include hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. Clinical laboratory testing from screen ing will be us ed to 
determine eligibility.  
(k) Women of childbearing potential only. A urine pregnancy test will be performed and read locally on Day  1 Predose.  
(l) For postmenopausal women.  
(m) A single [ADDRESS_377460] dose of the day.

 (n) When study drug is administered at the clinical investigative site, all subjects will be provided a meal (consisting of app roximately 600 calories and 
25 g of fat). The meal should be consumed within 30 minutes and prior to the administration of study drug (TPOXX or matching pla cebo). Subjects 
should be administered study drug as soon as possible following completion of the me al but no more than 30 minutes should elapse between meal 
completion and administration of study drug. Subjects should take study drug with 8 oz (240 mL) of water.  
(o) The time of study drug dosing will be called “0” hour. Study drug will be administered to s ubjects by [CONTACT_308331] 
1 and subjects will self -administer study drug when at home. Subjects will be instructed at the screening visit and prior to check -in to the clinical 
investigative site on Day 1 that other than wate r, no beverages may be ingested within 3 hours before or 3 hours after study drug administration.  
(p) One diary will be dispensed to record TPOXX or matching placebo administration, completion of required meals before and after  dosing, all 
concomitant medicati ons (dose and frequency), and all AEs.  
(q) If the subject is completing the ET visit, a blood sample for TPOXX concentration analysis should be collected within [ADDRESS_377461]’s last dose of study drug, no sample needs 
to be collected.  
(r) Adverse events will be collected from first dose of study drug until Day 42. Serious AEs will be collected up to Day 58. All AEs, SAEs, and 
clinically significa nt laboratory abnormalities will be followed until resolution or until stability of the abnormality has been demonstrated as 
determined by [CONTACT_1755]/or medical monitor.  
Concomitant medication information will only be collected at the Day 58 foll ow-up telephone call if it is related to an SAE.

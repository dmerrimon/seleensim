CLS1001- [ADDRESS_1055019] common cause of visual loss in the developed world (Goldstein 2009; 
Wood 2011; Miserocchi 2013). Significant vision loss can occur in up to 35% of children and 
adults, and uveitis accounts for 5% - 20% of legal blindness in both the [LOCATION_002] and 
Europe, and perhaps as much as 25% of blindness in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19744] (Rothova 1996; Bodaghi 2001). 
There are a number of causes associated with this vision loss including cataract formation or 
progression, chorioretinal scarring, retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma, but the dominant cause of vision loss within uveitis comes from chronic macular edema accounting for 
about one third of visual impairment or blindness (Wood, 2011; Dick, 1994; Karim, 2013). 
Approximately 30% of all uveitis patients and up to 60% of interme diate- and pan- uveitis 
patients experience macular edema (Lardenoye, 2006).

  5.4  Summary of Clinical Experience  
TA has been safely and effectively used in human ocular therapeutics to treat ocular conditions 
involving inflammation for over 50 years. The initial recommended dose of the TA formulation (Triesence®) approved by [CONTACT_363354] 4 mg in 100 µL.   
Clearside is developi[INVESTIGATOR_363347] -TA, a proprietary TA formulation for the treatment of non-
infectious uveiti s by [CONTACT_769024].  
The completed clinical study, CLS1001-101, was a Phase 1/2, open- label, safety and tolerability 
study in subjec ts with intermediate -, posterior-, or pan- non-infectious uveitis. Each subject 
received a single suprachoroidal injection of 4 mg in 100 µL TA (Triesence). Nine (9) of the 11 
subjects in the safety analysis set (82%) completed the 26-week study. All subje cts had at least 
one AE, with a total of 37 AEs reported. One serious event (unrelated pulmonary emboli; SAE) 
occurred. No deaths were reported. No significant increases in IOP were reported. The most 
commonly reported AE, eye pain, was reported in [ADDRESS_1055021] a m ean 
reduction in central subfield  of thickness (CST) of 164 microns (p=0.002) when measured from 
baseline at 2 months. No subjects discontinued due to Adverse Event and there were no investigator -reported increases in IOP at follow -up visits. 
Additional information regarding clinical experience with TA administered to the SCS, is available in the Investigator’s Brochure.

  6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOS E 
The purpose of this study is to characterize the continued clinical benefit(s)  regarding safety and 
efficacy of suprachoroidally administered CLS- TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable 
suspension, for the treatment of macular edema associated with non- infectious uveitis.  This study 
will be a non-interventional extension of the Parent study, CLS1001-301. 
6.1. Primary Objective 
Demonstrate the maintenance of efficacy of CLS -TA, up to [ADDRESS_1055022] eligibility will be established at Visit 1 during the crossover day from the Parent study to 
the extension study (Day 0). Follow-up visits will be conducted every 6 weeks up to 24 weeks 
(Visit 4). At Visit 4, subjects will have a final evaluation conducted 24 weeks following study 
entry (48 weeks from Parent study randomization). Parent study masking will remain in effect 
until the Parent study is unmasked. 
7.2. Number of Subjects 
The study population will include approximately [ADDRESS_1055023] 
administered  in this study.  
7.4. Criteria for Study Termination  
The study or parts of the study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_1034], or at the recommendation of 
an Investigator after consultation with Sponsor, at any time.   
If the clinical study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor will inform the Investigators and the regulatory authorities of the termination/suspension and the reason(s) for 
the termination/suspension. The Investigator should promptly notify the IEC/IRB of the 
termination or suspension and of the reasons.

  9. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
9.1. Description of Stu dy Drug 
No study drug will be administered in the MAGNOLIA study.   
9.1.1. Study Eye Determination 
The study eye will remain the same as in the Parent study, CLS1001-301. 
9.1.2. Treatment of the Fellow Eye (Non -Study Eye)  
Ocular therapy for the fellow eye is not subject to the requirements of this protocol. Local 
medications are permitted for the fellow eye during the course of this trial. Systemic therapy for 
diseases of the fellow eye is subject to the list of medications  below and will be considered 
additional therapy for the study eye. Medications used in the fellow eye will be recorded in the 
subject’s medical chart and the case report form (CRF).    
 
9.2. Concomitant Medications  
9.2.1. Medications  for treatment of uveitis  
If additional therapy is necessary to treat uveitis in the study eye and normal standard of care 
requires these medications, they will be recorded in the subject’s case report form and should follow the guidelines presented for rescue criteria. The list of medications provided below is not 
intended to be comprehensive, but rather to help guide the Investigator’s medical judgment. If 
any of these medications are used during the study , the subject will be considered to have 
received additional therapy for uveitis and should be exited from the study ( Section 19.1.).  
• Increases in dose of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_769019]  
• Any corticosteroid implant (ie , Ozurdex
®, Iluvien® or Retisert™) in the study eye  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], periocular or intravitreal corticosteroids in the study eye  
• Increases in dose of systemic prednisone or other equivalent steroid (eg, dexamethasone), 
including, but not limited to, the following routes: oral, intravenous, intramuscular, in 
sufficient doses and/or for sufficient time such that the Investigator has concerns about 
additional ocular exposure to steroids in terms of safety and/or efficacy 
• Anti-angiogenic drugs (anti- VEGF) in the study eye or systemically (including 
pegaptanib sodium, bevacizumab, ranibizumab) 
• Increases to dose of systemic immu nosuppressant drugs 
• Acetazolamide (Diamox®) 
• Any investigational drug or device

CLS1001- [ADDRESS_1055026] medical practice in th e Investigator’s 
judgment for treating the subject. All additional therapy will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
chart and the CRF.  
Rescue Criteria  
If at any time during the study any of the following criteria are met in the study eye, the use of a tr eatment should be introduced. The therapy implemented is left to the discretion 
of the Investigator.   
• A loss of 10 or more ETDRS BCVA letters due to uveitis from either of the 
previous two visits 
• CSF > [ADDRESS_1055027] of  ≥100 microns or 20%, whichever is 
lower, from either of the previous two visits 
• In the investigator’s medical judgement, the uveitic complications in the study eye have worsened  and the condition needs to be addressed 
 
9.3. Treatment Compliance  
Once a subject has been treated with  additional therapy, the subject should be exited from the 
study per the Schedule of Assessments (Section 20.1 - Appendix A ). 
 
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
While there will be no randomization in this non-interventional e xtension study, the masking 
from the Parent study will be protected in this trial until the Parent study has completed and is 
appropriately unmasked. 
 
 
CLS-TA, triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension                                                       Clearside Biomedical, Inc   
CLS1001- [ADDRESS_1055028] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)   
Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) will be measured using ETDRS electronic visual acuity 
(eVA) and will be collected at every visit. BCVA will be recorded as total letter score in each 
eye following refraction. Visual acuity testing should precede any examination requiring contact 
[CONTACT_222199].  
In order to provide standardization and well-controlled assessments of BCVA during the study, 
all BCVA assessments must be performed by [CONTACT_769025]/lanes. 
If eVA cannot be performed for any reason, BCVA will be measured using a standard ETDRS 
chart. If Roman letters are not  familiar to the subject, Tumbling E charts may be used.  
11.2. Central Subfield Thickness as Measured by [CONTACT_66309]-OCT  
Retinal thickness and disease characterization will be assessed at every visit via spectral domain 
optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT) (Heidelberg SPECTRALIS® or Zeiss CirrusTM).  The 
SD-OCT instrument and technician must be certified prior to enrolling  any subjects. The 
technician is encouraged to use the same certified photography equipment throughout the 
subject’s study participation. All photos should be taken by [CONTACT_363362], whenever 
possible, on each subject per research site. Images will be sent to a central reading facility for analysis and interpretation in a masked fashion.

  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
12.1.1. Intraocular Pressur e  
Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be measured by [CONTACT_363363] (Tonopen or Goldmann) 
at every visit and results will be recorded in mmHg. A single measurement will be made at 
approximately the same time of day. The technician is encouraged to use the same tonometry 
method throughout the subject’s study participation. Tonometers must be calibrated for accuracy before the first subject screening at that site and according to the manufacturer specifications 
during the study, until the last subject ha s exited the study at that site.  
12.1.2. Slit-Lamp Biomicroscopy  
Slit-lamp biomicroscopy, including magnification, will be performed at every visit and 
consistent with standard clinical practice. This procedure should be conducted in the same 
manner for all subjects and will include an assessment of each of the following as normal or 
abnormal: eyelids, cornea, anterior chamber, iris and lens. All abnormal findings will be described.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cataract Lens Grading 
If an abnormal finding of cataract is noted for the lens d uring the slit- lamp exam, the cataract 
should be assessed for nuclear opalescence, cortical opacity and posterior subcapsular opacity. 
Graders must verify training on the grading procedure provided in the Manual of Procedures. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anterior Chamber Cells  
Anterior chamber cells will be assessed clinically using a field size of 1 mm slit beam and using 
a standardized grading scale ranging from 0 to 4+, as defined in Table 1 (SUN 2005).

  12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans and does not have to have a causal relationship with study treatment.   
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (that could include a cl inically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a single 
diagnosis under a single AE term (eg, “cough, rhinitis and sneezing” might be grouped together 
as “upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]”).  
An AE may include: 
• Any sign, medical diagnosis or symptom 
• Any new undesirable medical occurrence or unfavorable or unintended change of a pre-
existing condition that occurs during or after test article administration.  
NOTE:  
o The disease under study (ie, non- infectious uveitis) or sign or symptom associated with 
the disease are not considered adverse events, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition 
o Symptoms associated with disease, which are consistent with the subject's usual clinical 
course are not considered adverse events, unless the subject experiences worsening of 
symptoms more severe than expected or unless the symptom(s) meet the criteria for an SAE  
• Clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) laboratory abnormalities, 
ophthalmic assessments or vital signs (eg, requiring discontinuation of test article, specific 
treatment or a change in subject management). If possible, abnormal laboratory results or 
changes in vital signs that meet the definition of an AE should be reported as a clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal laboratory value (eg, “hypertension” rather than “blood 
pressure increased”)  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• Death

CONFIDENTIAL  
  • Life-threatening (ie, if in the view of the Investigator or Sponsor, the event’s occurrence 
places the subject at immediate risk of death); it does not include an AE  that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
o “In-patient” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124493] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979].  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include 
presentation at a casualty or emergency room.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a subject who received study drug 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition   
 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
Causality is the relationship of an AE to study drug and will be assessed by [CONTACT_769026] 5:  
Table 5: Causality Defin itions 
Causality  Definition  
Related There is a reasonable causal association with 
administration of the study drug; the event is confirmed 
by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_6926]/or restarting the drug or is not explained 
by [CONTACT_769027]; related to other etiologies such as concomitant 
medications or conditions  
 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_102]/subject and/or in response to an open 
question from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7200].  The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onse t (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the patient to discontinue the study .

CLS1001- 303 Clinical Protocol  
Version 2.0 14 December 2016  Page 23 of 36 
CONFIDENTIAL  The intensity of each AE will be graded using National Ca ncer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03. The criteria can be accessed at: 
http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf . 
The term
 “severe” is a measure of i ntensity. A s evere AE  is not necessarily a serious AE. 
Grade r
efers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: 
Grade 1 Mild
; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of 
daily living (ADL)  
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769020]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL  
Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5 Death related to AE  
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt reporting of a SAE requires: 
•Completion and transmission of SAE information  to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the
investigator ’s knowledge of the event.  The SAE information should be completed as
thoroughly as possible before transmittal to the Sponsor. It is very important that theinvestigator provide his/her assessment of causality to study treatment  at the time of
initial reporting of the SAE.
•Prompt reporting of additional information for previously reported SAEs should follow
the same reporting timeframe as initial reports .
If an ongoing SAE changes in intensity or the relationship to study drug, a follow-up SAE report 
should be sent to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1055029] be reported on an SAE form to the Sponsor immediately, 
but no later than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event.

CLS1001- [ADDRESS_1055034] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Site qualification visits for this study will be waived due to the fact that a member of the 
Clearside Biomedical team or representati ve have monitored the site for the parent study during 
the last [ADDRESS_1055035] been documented in the site monitoring visit reports (with exception in the event that significant staff or facility changes have occurred since the last visit).  
During the study, a monitor from Clearside Biomedical  or representative will have regular 
contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for  each patient 
(e.g. clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Clearside Biomedical . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Clearside Biomedical  and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Clearside Biomedical , a regulatory authority, an Independent 
Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification.  The purpose of a Clearside Biomedical  audit or 
inspection is to systematica lly and independently examine all study- related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of 
the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_769028] a regulatory 
agency about an inspection.

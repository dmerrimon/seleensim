TREATMENT OF HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_190244] -19 
Protocol Number: MP1032-CT05 
Investigators/Study Sites: Approximately 40 sites worldwide will participate in this study. 
Phase of Development: Phase IIa  
Study Objectives: 
 The primary objective of this study is: 
x To measure the effect of MP1032 plus standard of care (SoC) versus 
placebo plus SoC on Day 14 on disease progression in patients with moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are: 
x To measure the effect of MP1032 plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC on 
Day [ADDRESS_225807] of MP1032 plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC on 
the mortality rate and other specific COVID- 19 related characteristics 
x To assess the safety of MP1032 (eg, adverse events [AEs] and laboratory 
abnormalities) 
x To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MP1032 on Day 1 (single dose) 
and Day 7 (steady state) in a PK subset of patients 
 
The exploratory objectives of this study are: 
x To measure the effect of MP1032 plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC on 
some additional COVID-19 related characteristics 
x To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients treated 
MP1032 plus SoC compared with placebo plus SoC 
x To evaluate biomarker levels 
Study Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is: 
x Proportion of patients with disease progression on Day 14. Disease progression is 
defined as the proportion of patients who are not alive or who 
have respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_190245] a 
score of 2, 3, or 4 on the Nati onal Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
(NIAID) 8-point ordinal scale (see below).

Final
07-Feb-[ADDRESS_225808] a 
score of 2, 3, or 4 on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale (see below).  
x Proportion of patients with disease resolution on Day [ADDRESS_225809] a score of 6, 7, or 8 on the 
NIAID 8-point ordinal scale.  
x All-cause mortality rate at Day 28  
x Change of clinical status related to COVID-19 on Day 28 compared with baseline according to the following NIAID 8-point ordinal scale: 
1. Death 
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) 
3. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen 
devices 
4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen 
5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen, but requiring ongoing 
medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise) 
6. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring s upplemental oxygen and no longer requires 
ongoing medical care (used if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190246]-control reasons) 
7. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities, and/or requiring home 
oxygen 
8. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities 
Please note: Patients requiring oxygen before COVID-19 and returning to 
baseline oxygen use will be considered improved (ie, not requiring supplemental oxygen). Patients with a limitation on activities before COVID
-19 and returning 
to baseline activity will be  considered improved. In case of death before Day 14 
or Day 28, the patient will be considered with the NIAID score for death ( score of 
1) on the date of death in the analysis. 
 
The other secondary endpoints of this study are:

Page 7 of 85 The stratification factor for randomization will include baseline COVID-19 
severity (moderate versus severe) and age-class (aged 65 years versus 
>65 years). COVID-19 severity will be determined using the following criteria: 
x Moderate COVID-19:  
o Positive severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_190249]  2 
(SARS-CoV-2) testing by [CONTACT_190330]-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or 
equivalent test  
o Symptoms of moderate illness with COVID- 19, which could 
include any symptom of mild illness or shortness of breath with 
exertion 
o Clinical signs suggestive of moderate illness with COVID- 19, 
such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 20 breaths per minute, SpO 2 >93%  (on 
room air at sea level, if possible), heart rate 90 beats per 
minute  
o No clinical signs indicative of severe or critical COVID-19 
x Severe COVID-19:  
o Positive SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_225811], or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] 
o Clinical signs suggestive of severe systemic illness with COVID-19, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]  30 
breaths per minute, 
heart rate 125 beats per minute , SpO 2 93% (on room air at 
sea level, if possible), partial pressure of oxygen/FiO 2 <300 , or 
diagnosed with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( according 
to the Berlin definition) 
o No criteria met for critical COVID-19 
To standardize the assessment of COVID -19 severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO 2, and 
heart rate will be measured when the patient is on room air at sea level (ie, no 
supplemental oxygen)  and at rest for at least [ADDRESS_225812] the information from each patient at the same time each day (±1 hour).  
Please note: Patients who are receiving oxygen therapy at baseline for a chronic 
condition (eg, emphysema, c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 
pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF], etc) 
must  be considered as having severe COVID-19 (unless the patient meets the 
definition for critical COVID -19). For questions related to COVID- [ADDRESS_225813] the medical monitor.  
Each site will treat all patients with SoC for the duration of the study.  The 
selected SoC will be used in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and 
may include drugs under an emergency use authorization.  
This study consists of 3 periods: (1) screening, (2) treatment, and (3) follow- up. 
During the screening  period, each potential patient (or patient’s legally acceptable 
representative)  will provide informed consent before starting any study- specific 
procedures. The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed MetrioPharm AG

scheme that will be developed by [CONTACT_161698], independent statisticia n. During 
the treatment period, randomized patients will be provided their assigned 
treatment and assessments according to the protocol . All patients will be treated 
for 28 days unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons. Patients who 
progres s to the use of an invasive ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or 
ECMO)  or who can no longer swallow the study drug (>2 days [ie, 2-day 
interruption is acceptable] ) must discontinue the study drug; but whenever 
possible , the study assessments will be performed on Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, 
and Day  60. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28 , the study team will 
provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug kit (s) to 
take home along with instructions on how to continue tr eatment at home on the 
day-of-discharge; for these patients, treatment compliance will be conducted via a 
diary. If the patient does not feel comfortable to complete the diary, the site will 
alternatively provide the patient with the option to be called, t wice a day, to 
confirm that the study drug is taken as instructed.  The treatment period will end 
with the Day 28 (End of Treatment Visit) assessments. The follow -up period will 
consist of Day 60 (Follow -up Visit) assessments.

patient’s best interest, or the patient has any condition  or critical illness, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], that will not allow the protocol to be 
followed safely. 
Planned Sample Size: The primary efficacy endpoint “proportion of patients with disease progression on 
Day 14” is assumed to be 10% in the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC treatment 
group (Arm A) and 30% in the placebo plus SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using 
the Chi -square test with type I error alpha=10% two-sided for this proof-of-
concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio, with 114 randomized patients (76 in 
Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistica l power of 83% can be achieved. Considering 
about 5% early study terminations, the necessary sample size to randomize results 
is 120  patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct of 
the study the early study termination rate is higher than the estimated 5%, then an 
increase i n the randomized number of patients may be necessary.  
Sample size estimation was performed using nQuery 8, Version [IP_ADDRESS]. 
A subset of randomized patients will be consented for the collection of blood 
samples for PK measurements. The PK subset consists o f approximately 
20 patients from the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approximately 
10 patients from the placebo plus SoC group, up to a total of approximately 
30 patients. 
Study Drug, Dose, and 
Mode of Administration: All randomized patients will receive study drug from Day 1 to Day 28 according 
to their assigned treatment and according to the randomization scheme. Patients 
will receive 6  capsules in the morning and 6 capsules in the evening (ie, 
approximately every [ADDRESS_225830] 8 hours apart) according to their randomized treatment arm assignment as 
described below:  
x Arm A: MP1032 (300 mg [6 × MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg]  
BID) for oral administration 
x Arm B: 6 × placebo capsules (ie, matching MP1032 hard gelatin 
capsules 50 mg) BID for oral administration 
Standard of Care Each site will treat all patients with SoC for the duration of the study. The selected SoC will be u sed in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and 
may include drugs under an emergency use authorization.
 
Treatment Duration: Patients will be treated with study drug for 28 consecutive days (unless study drug 
is discontinued for safety reasons ) to provide a fixed duration of treatment across 
all patients . Patients who progress to the use of an invasive ventilation 
(mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study 
drug (>2 days [ie, 2-day interruption is acceptable]) must discontinue the study 
drug;  but whenever possible, the study assessments will be performed on Day 14, 
Day 21, Day 28, and Day 60. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28 , the 
study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug
 kit(s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue 
treatment at home on the day -of-discharge; for these patients, treatment 
compliance will be conducted via a diary. If the patient does not feel comfortable MetrioPharm AG

Page 13 of 85 to complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the patient with the option 
to be called, twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is taken as instructed.  
The study du ration for an individual patient will be as follows: 
x Screening period: up to 7 days  
x Treatment period: 28 consecutive days (ie, Day 1 to Day 28) 
x Follow-up period: 32 days after Day 28 (ie, Day 60) 
As such, the approximate study duration (including screenin g and the follow- up 
period) for an individual patient is up to 67  days (±3 days). 
Please note:  Patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] 28 days of consecutive 
treatment with study drug are not eligible for additional treatments with study 
drug.  
Any patient who is discharged during the study should complete the day-of-
discharge assessments before release from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Efficacy Assessments: The following efficacy assessments will be collected: 
x COVID-19 symptoms 
x COVID-19 severity 
x Clinical status related to COVID-19 on the NIAID 8- point ordinal scale, 
as well as, each individual component of the NIAID 8- point ordinal scale 
x HRQoL assessed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D-5L questionnaire 
x COVID-19 testing  
Safety Assessments: The following safety assessments will be collected: 
x Medical/surgical history 
x Demographics 
x Prior and concomitant medications 
x Vital signs  
x Physical examinations 
x Electrocardiograms 
x Clinical laboratory assessments  
x AEs  
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:  PK samples will be collected via sparse sampling from a subset of approximately 
30 patients  (who give optional consent) in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 20 patients 
from the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approximately 10 patients 
from the placebo group plus SoC group) to assess the PK of MP1032 on Day 1 
(single dose) and Day 7 (steady state). A total of [ADDRESS_225831] dose on Day 7. Samples on Day 1 
and Day 7 will be collected predose (within [ADDRESS_225832] daily dose) 
and postdose at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 
8 hours (before next dose), and 24 hours before the next morning dose (if 
applicable), if possible. Patients who provide consent for the PK sampling, but are 
no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190254] 7, will not have Day 7 PK samples collected.  
Other Assessments: Blood samples will be obtained on Day 1 (before the first study drug 
administration) and Days 7, 1 4, 21, 28, and 60 (when possible) to measure 
biomarker levels. Biomarkers will potentially include but will not be limited to MetrioPharm AG

Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Analysis Sets: 
Intention -to-Treat Set 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) set, correspond with randomized set, will include all 
randomized patients irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature 
discontinuation  from study drug/withdrawal from study. The treatment group 
assignment will be designated according to initia l randomization. The ITT will 
serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy and summary of demographics and 
baseline characteristics.  
Per Protocol Set  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients from ITT who received at 
least [ADDRESS_225833] any major protocol deviations 
impacting the efficacy assessments. The PPS will be used for supportive analyses 
of efficacy.  
Safety Set  
The Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized patients who received at least 
1 dose of study drug. The treatment group assignment in the SS will be defined by 
[CONTACT_115378]. The SS will be used for the analysis of safety.  
PK Analysis Set  
The PK Analysis Set (PKS) will include all the patients who have been 
administered active study drug and have at least 1 postdose evaluable plasma 
concentration after Day 1 dose.  
Analyses:  
The estimand s for the primary efficacy endpoint and for the 4 key secondary 
endpoints compa ring the 2 treatment groups will be tested with consideration of a 
two-sided alpha of 10% on each test- level on the ITT. Additionally, 95% 
confidence intervals will be provided . Also, the treatment comparison with 
regards to the other efficacy endpoints wi ll be performed using a two- sided alpha 
level of 10%.  
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as a binary 
variable indicating  disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 14. 
Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other 
treatment before Day 14 will be handled using the treatment- policy strategy (ie, 
the NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of the failure in such 
patients). Missing data on Day  [ADDRESS_225834]- baseline data for patients randomized but not 
treated will be  imputed by [CONTACT_190334] (baseline observation 
carried forward, BOCF). The comparison between the treatment groups 
considering all randomized patients after having imputed missing values will be 
performed using Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test for risk difference considering the 4 MetrioPharm AG

(moderate versus severe) an d age- class (aged 65 years versus > 65 years) at 
baseline.  
Similar MH analyses will be conducted for the main estimand of the first key 
secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a binary variable indicating 
disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 28, and the main 
estimand for the second key secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a 
binary variable indicating disease resolution (alive and have a score of 6, 7 or 8 
on NIAID) at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment
-policy s trategy for these estimands (ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will 
be used for definition of the failure or response, respectively) in such patients.

mortality at Day 28 . Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation 
and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28, will be handled using the 
treatment -policy strategy (ie, the life status at Day 28 will be considered). No 
missing data of life status on Day 28 is expected.  
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of 
clinical status related to COVID -19 on Day 28 compared with baseline according 
to the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale, will be compared using the risk difference 
from the analysis of covariance model with treatment and th e 2 binary 
stratification factors (ie, severity and age -class) as independent factors and the 
baseline value of NIAID as independent covariate. Intercurrent events that lead to 
study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be 
handled using the treatment -policy strategy for these estimands (ie, the NIAID 
score at Day 28 will be used). Missing data on Day 28 will be imputed by 
[CONTACT_190335]. 
 
Sensitivity  analyses for the main estimands of the primary and key efficacy 
estimands will be performed by [CONTACT_190336] 14 or Day 28 as 
failure or non -resolution for the binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190337] 8-
point ordinal scale.  
All above analyses for the main estimands of the primary efficacy and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated on PPS as supportive analysis. 
Additionally, for the primary efficacy and binary key secondary efficacy 
endpoints , logistic regression model with treatment and the 2 stratification factors 
as covariables will be performed on the ITT. 
The proportion of patients with disease resolution at Day 14 and the all -cause 
mortality rate at  Day 14 and Day 60 will be analyzed using similar MH methods 
as described above for Day 28. Cumulative proportion of patients with disease 
resolution will be plotted by [CONTACT_5586].  MetrioPharm AG

Page 16 of 85 A similar analysis of covariance approach as described above for Day 28 will be 
applied for the analysis of the change of clinical status related to COVID -19 on 
Day 14 compared with baseline on the NIAID 8 -point ordinal scale. The endpoint

ventilator and/or ECMO) or who are not alive, the proportion of patients in each 
NIAID category, and the proportion of patients alive and testing negative for COVID

improvement of at least 1 category on the NIAID scale and total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190255] (from baseline to discharge; with death censored on last day of the observed peri
od - at Day 28 or Day 60, respectively - depending on the analyses) 
will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and will be compared 
between treatment groups using log -rank tests. Additionally, Cox proportional 
hazards model will be applied with treat ment and the 2 stratification factors as 
covariables.  
The odds ratio between MP1032 and SoC and placebo and SoC for the number of 
patients with clinical status improvement from baseline on the NIAID 8 -point 
ordinal scale (ie, an improvement of at least 1  category) at Day 14 and Day 28 
will be analyzed using a logistic regression with consideration of the 
2 stratification factors. 
The time to recovery of all at baseline present COVID-19 symptoms (stuffy or 
runny nose, sore throat , red or irritated eyes, shortness of breath, cough, low 
energy or tiredness, muscle or body aches, headache, chills or shivering, feeling 
hot or feverish, nausea, and number of times of vomit, times of diarrhea, sense of smell, sense of taste in the last 24
 hours) will be presented by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier 
estimates and figure. The change from baseline will be presented in shift tables 
for each single symptom , with the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category at postbaseline assessment time -point compared to baseline for each 
treatme nt group.  
Total number of days in ICU, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
duration of ECMO will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_190338] 90%  confidence intervals and additionally by [CONTACT_190339].  To consider death sufficiently unfavorable in these measures, in case of 
death the duration of the respective measure will be considered with the longest 
duration possible (eg, if a summary of the first 28 days is presented, then death 
before  Day 28 will be considered as duration 28 days, and if the summary also 
includes follow -up period until Day 60, then death before Day 60 will be 
considered as duration of 60 days) . Both summaries (up to Day 28 and up to Day 
60) will be provided.   
For HRQoL assessments  at discharge and Day 60, the EQ index value and the EQ 
VAS , both based on the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be calculated and 
summarized by [CONTACT_3232]. Additionally, change at Day 60 from

5. 1 Background on COVID- 19 
On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a cluster of 
cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in . Severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_190249] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative 
virus by [CONTACT_190344] 07 January 2020 ( WHO 2020a ). Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) was identified as the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-[ADDRESS_225845] 2020, the WHO estimated the case fatality ratio, which estimates the 
proportion of deaths among confirmed cases, to vary from 0.1% to >25%. Whereas, the true severity of COVID-19 as measured by [CONTACT_190345], which estimates the proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, is estimated to be approximately 0.5% to 1% 
(WHO 2020b ). In a more recent summary of Levin et al ( 2020) it could be clearly shown that the 
infection fatality ratio is highly age dependent, being in average as low as 0.004% for patients 
younger than 35 and as high as 28.3% in patients at the age of 85 and older. 
Presentations of COVID-19 range from an asymptomatic course or mild symptoms to severe 
illness and mortality. Common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea ( Cennimo 2021 ). Less common 
symptoms are sputum production, malaise, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], and neurologic symptoms, such as altered mental state. While most patients with COVID-[ADDRESS_225846] common serious manifestation of COVID-19. Further, major deterioration such as an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) can lead to the imperative need of an intensive care unit 
(ICU) and might even require mechanical ventilation via intubation. Other complications that 
might occur during the course of the disease include sepsis, acute kidney injury, thyrotoxicosis, and neurologic manifestations such as myasthenia gravis. The elderly, as well as patients with pre-existing chronic conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, immune system deficiencies, liver disease, and cardiac 
diseases, etc), seem to be more vulnerable to a severe disease course. 
Although, to date, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding COVID-19 is still limited, 
it seems to be clear that the course of the disease, and particularly severe complications, are MetrioPharm AG

and By[CONTACT_41386] 2020 ). From a pathophysiological point of view, in severe cases the viral 
infection seems to trigger an excessive immune reaction in the host, a so-called cytokine storm, leading to extensive tissue damage. A key player of this mechanism is interleukin (IL)-6. IL-[ADDRESS_225847] viral infection of the endothelial cells and diffuse endothelial inflammation in the whole body ( Varga et al 2020 ). 
Recently the first vaccines to prevent COVID-[ADDRESS_225848] been approved by [CONTACT_177015], including

COVID-19 and/or ameliorate its symptoms. Among the antiviral treatment options, remdesivir 
has shown to be effective in reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190259] ( Beigel et al 2020 ); however, in the meantime the WHO has issued a conditional 
recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190260] ( WHO 2020c ) Among immune modulating drugs low-dosed dexamethasone could 
significantly lower the incidence of deaths when applied at a later time point of the disease 
course ( WHO-REACT 2020 ) but is not recommended early in disease or in patients with mild 
symptoms only (WHO 2020c ). Hence, there is still no antiviral treatment or otherwise effective 
curative agent that could really lower the burden of this pandemic. Thus, COVID-19 still 
presents an urgent unmet medical need. 
5.2 Background on MP 1032, Including Benefit Risk Assessment 
MP1032 is a purely synthetic, new chemical entity. MP1032 is a mono sodium salt derived from 
the aromatic system phthalazinedione, containing an additional amino group. MP1032 is water-soluble and hydrophilic. 
The primary mechanism of action of MP1032 is assumed to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
scavenging action in inflamed tissues (ie, tissues that experience oxidative stress). A unique 
pharmacologic property of MP1032 is that the ROS-scavenging function of the molecule is only activated in tissues with pathologically high ROS concentrations (oxidative stress), which is the 
case in inflamed tissue. By [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-establishing a physiologic redox balance in activated immune 
cells, MP1032 is putatively inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B is expected to lead to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6 and TNF-Į) (Gloire et al 2006 ). In addition, MP1032 is a specific inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose-
polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARP1 is a nuclear enzyme involved in inflammation ( Ke et al 2019 ). MetrioPharm AG

Page 26of 85Further identified potential targets are the kinases human Aurora-B, human Aurora-C, 
serine/threonine-protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, and the metalloprotease TNF- Į-converting 
enzyme —however, at relatively high molarity only. Therefore, the administration of MP1032 (as 
shown nonclinically, both in vitro and in vivo), in pathological conditions only, leads to a reduced concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines without completely blocking them. In addition to this broadly anti-inflammatory potential, MP1032 exhibits direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that could be shown by a clear and dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-
CoV-2 reproduction in Vero B4 cells (African green monkey [Chlorocebus aethiops ] kidney 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_190261]) ( Schumann et al 2020 ).
MP1032 could attenuate prolonged virus replication by [CONTACT_190346] 
(Khomich et al 2018 ) and/or by [CONTACT_190347]-ribosylation of the viral nucleocapsid protein via 
PARP1 inhibition (Grunewald et al 2018 ). PARP1 inhibitors also have been suggested for the 
treatment of COVID-19 ( Curtin et al 2020 ).
Based on the basic chemical mechanism of MP1032 as an electron donor to ROS, the molecule 
acts similarly across a wide range of species and is thus not an agent with a high degree of 
species specificity. Further, MP1032 has no specific immune-system targets as known from 
various biologicals. MP1032 is not expressed by [CONTACT_190348] (cells) or using raw materials of human or animal origin.
Nonclinical Studies
In vivo safety studies showed no evidence of neurotoxic potential or negative 
cardiohemodynamic effects; no local intolerance was observed. There was no dose-limiting or 
target organ toxicity and no substance-related findings in histopathology in rats or dogs. However, after [ADDRESS_225849] dose (1000 mg/kg/d), liver organ weight was elevated compared with that of controls and histopathologically associated with hepatocellular hypertrophy. This finding was not considered 
adverse because of its adaptive character, as histopathological changes were not present at the 
end of the recovery period (ie, effect was reversible after 8 weeks).
In reproduction toxicity studies on fertility, early embryonic, and embryo-fetal development, no 
pathological effects were found. On the basis of results from [ADDRESS_225850] dose (300 mg/kg) of MP1032. No pulmonary effects have been observed in any of the long-term animal toxicity studies. The maximum plasma levels 
reached in humans are over 1000 times (oral) lower than for the abovementioned dose. Thus, 
pulmonary effects are not considered a potential risk for patients and volunteers.
Emesis sporadically occurred in various repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs; the emesis was 
present in the dogs more often at the high doses of 150 mg/kg twice daily (BID) intravenous than 
at 125 mg/kg BID (oral). The lowest experimental oral dose inducing emesis was 25 mg/kg BID MetrioPharm AG

Page 27of 85(oral) in dogs, corresponding to 1.8 g (oral; conversion based on human-equivalent dose) for a 
65-kg human. Dogs are well known to be susceptible to emesis; in addition, the maximum doses administered in humans are [ADDRESS_225851] with safety margins between 2 to 20 times. Therefore, a phototoxic risk for patients 
seems to be unlikely.
Further, a slight to moderate increase in serum creatinine level combined with a slight decrease 
of kidney weights was observed after a 90-day treatment period in male mice in a dose-range 
finding, repeated dose (oral) toxicity study at high dosed animals. However, as there were no 
associated histopathological findings in kidneys of the respective animals, this effect is also not 
considered to be adverse in nature. In the scope of extensive laboratory controls in the clinical studies completed so far, no respective treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) have been reported. 
The probability of pharmacokinetic interactions of MP1032 regarding the inhibition or induction 
of Cytochrome P450 or inhibition of well-known drug transporters is rather low. However, based on in vitro experiments there are hints that a combination of MP1032 and dexamethasone might act (supra-)additive regarding the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-6). Thus, 
currently, a potential drug-drug interaction of MP1032 and dexamethasone regarding their anti-
inflammatory action cannot be excluded.

referred to the current version of the investigator’s brochure (IB).
Clinical Studies
MP1032 so far has been investigated in [ADDRESS_225852]-in-human study (MP1032-CT01; EudraCT-No.: 2014-004606-15) with a single ascending dose and a multiple ascending dose part, as well as 2 studies in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis: a 6-week,Phase IIa, pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (MP1032-CT02; EudraCT-No.: 2015-005159-28) and a 3-month, Phase II

Page 28 of 85 Among the subjects enrolled in MP1032 studies, 146 subjects were administered MP1032 orally. 
Among them, 24 male subjects participated as healthy volunteers in the Phase I study, while both male (n=89) and female (n=33) patients with psoriasis participated in the Phase II studies. The 
age of participants administered MP1032 ranged from [ADDRESS_225853] repeated dose was 300 mg MP1032 BID, applied to both healthy volunteers (7 days) and 
patients with psoriasis (3 months). 
No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in any of the subjects administered MP1032. No deaths occurred in the scope of the MP1032 clinical development program. 
MP1032 was well tolerated in all studies, and safety analyses did not reveal any clinically 
important safety issues. In general, incidence, intensity, causality, and spreading of TEAEs over 
system organ classes (SOCs) were comparable between groups. In the recent Phase II study, the incidence, intensity, relationship to investigational medicinal product (IMP), and causality to IMP for adverse events (AEs) were even lower for both MP1032 dose groups compared with 
those of the placebo group and statistically significantly lower for the [ADDRESS_225854] be considered as 
common ( 1/100 to <1/10); while neutropenia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], abdominal pain u pper, fatigue,

Regarding efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, the MP1032-CT02 study 
showed that after only 6 weeks of treatment, there was a clinically meaningful response in patients who entered the study with moderate to severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 10 to 20 and achieved the appropriate drug-exposure levels. 
Hence, only patients with a PASI score of 10 to 20 at baseline were randomized to the 
MP1032-CT04 study. After 12 weeks, a significant PASI reduction could be shown in the 
300 mg MP1032 BID group compared with those in the placebo group; however, this only occurred in a prespecified subgroup of patients with PASI 15 at baseline.

Page 29 of 85 5.3 Risk Management of MP 1032 
In the scope of planning and conducting future clinical studies, all potential risks associated with 
MP1032 will be considered, and measures will be taken as applicable.  
On the basis of limitations in the amount of preclinical and clinical data available so far, MP1032 
shall not be administered to patients for >[ADDRESS_225855] already been described in the clinical program so far, as well as 
any suspected AEs arising from risks associated with preclinical data will be evaluated 
extensively on a case-by-case base during ongoing and/or upcoming studies. 
Because of potential phototoxicity, patients in upcoming studies will be advised to avoid strong 
sun exposure (sunbathing) and strong ultraviolet exposure. Furthermore, the use of sunscreen will be recommended when spending an extended period outdoors. It should be ensured that 
exposure to ultraviolet light (eg, from lasers in procedures) is limited while the patient is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. 
To avoid risks associated with potential low efficacy in serious and life-threatening conditions, 
such as COVID-19, MP1032 is only recommended to be used as add-on to standard of 
care (SoC) until a respective proof-of-concept is demonstrated. 
As dexamethasone is expected to be part of SoC in most institutions treating patients with 
COVID-19 investigators should be aware that a (supra-)additive synergism between MP1032 
and dexamethasone regarding their anti-inflammatory activity cannot be excluded. 
Further details regarding known or anticipated risks, as well as reasonably anticipated AEs for 
MP1032 may be found in the current version of the IB.

are available on the downregulation of IL-[ADDRESS_225857] treatments, 
MP1032 may prevent and/or ameliorate any overstimulation of the immune system in the course 
of a COVID-19, thereby [CONTACT_190349][INVESTIGATOR_190262]. At the same time, the probability of a severe 
course of the disease is reduced because of a potential direct antiviral capacity of MP1032. This 
combinative approach makes MP1032 a promising candidate for the treatment of COVID-19. In 
addition, synergistic effects may be obtained when using MP1032 as an add-on to other 
medicinal products currently under investigation for treating patients with COVID-19. 
There is a substantial medical need for preventive and/or therapeutic options for the COVID-19 
pandemic. COVID-19 is a viral disease with a considerable mortality rate that is not yet 
completely determined, and it significantly affects healthcare systems. Considering the strong 
safety profile and good tolerability of MP1032 based on both preclinical and clinical data, 
combined with the signals of meaningful therapeutic effects of MP1032, it is justified that a 
proof-of-concept for MP1032 in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is started. 
As such, this proof-of-concept study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of MP1032 
plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190263]-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 infection. Additional exploratory 
objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) of MP1032 in a PK subset of patients and the effect of 
MP1032 on biomarker levels. 
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, resulting in capacity 
issues at many medical facilities and concerns about the safety of healthcare providers caring for 
these seriously sick patients. Consequently, this study is designed to minimize the burden on clinical sites, including minimizing the number of required assessments and interventions. To allow close monitoring and oral administration, the intended patient population shall include 
only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 that do not require intubation at the time of screening 
and/or randomization. Only adults shall be included. Additionally, pregnant and breastfeeding 
women shall be excluded. 
The study drugs will be indistinguishable to blinded study personnel to limit bias in study 
assessments. Most interventions and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with the 
schedule dictated by [CONTACT_190350]. An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established 
by [CONTACT_190351] (as per the 
DMC charter) throughout the study to ensure the safety of patients and review overall study 
conduct. MetrioPharm AG

Page 35 of 85 Each site will treat all patients with SoC for the duration of the study. The selected SoC will be 
used in acco rdance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and may include drugs under an 
emergency use authorization. 
This study consists of 3 periods: (1) screening, (2) treatment, and (3) follow-up. During the 
screening period, each potential patient (or patient’s legal ly acceptable representative) will 
provide informed consent before starting any study-specific procedures. The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_190331]-response 
system (IWRS) using a randomization scheme that will be developed by [CONTACT_161698], 
independent statistician. During the treatment period, randomized patients will be provided their assigned treatment and assessments according to the protocol. All patients will be treated for 
28 days unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons. If the patient is discharged home 
before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded 
study drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue treatment at home on the day-of-discharge; for these patients, treatment compliance will be conducted via a diary. If the patient does not feel comfortable to complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the 
patient with the option to be called, twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is taken as 
instructed. The treatment period will end with the Day 28 (End of Treatment Visit) assessments. The follow-up period will consist of Day 60 (Follow-up Visit) assessments. 
Please note: Patients will be assessed while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If patients are discharged from the

assist during the telephone/virtual call). For discharged patients, it is sufficient to conduct the Day 60 Follow-up Visit as a telephone/virtual call (the patient’s caregiver may assist during the 
telephone/virtual call) or an outpatient or home healthcare visit is also allowed. 
Note: Home healthcare visits are only allowed in countries where home healthcare visits are 
explicitly permitted by [CONTACT_66363]. 
The study duration for an individual patient will be as follows: 
x Screening period: up to 7 days  
x Treatment period: 28 consecutive days (ie, Day 1 to Day 28) 
x Follow-up period: 32 days after Day 28 (ie, Day 60) 
As such, the approximate study duration (including screening and the follow-up period) for an 
individual patient is up to 67 days (±3 days). 
An independent DMC will be established by [CONTACT_190353] (as per the DMC charter) throughout the study to ensure the safety 
of patients and review overall study conduct. The DMC can recommend in writing to the sponsor MetrioPharm AG

7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC 
versus placebo plus SoC treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190265]-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 infection.  
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 
capacity issues at many medical facilities. Additionally, the highly contagious nature of 
COVID-19 (compounded by a shortage of personal protective equipment) has caused concerns 
about the safety of healthcare providers caring for these seriously sick patients. Consequently, this study is designed to minimize any additional burden on clinical sites, including minimizing 
the number of assessments and interventions that the study will require in addition to SoC, while 
still ensuring the safety of patients. 
This study will be double-blinded and placebo-controlled to limit bias in study assessments. 
Either MP1032 or placebo will be administered as add-on therapy to SoC. Most interventions 
and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with SoC, without requiring additional 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190266]. 
The dose, dosing regimen, and duration of treatment planned for this study (300 mg MP1032 
BID for 28 days) were selected on the basis of: 
x The highest repeated dose was 300 mg MP1032 BID applied to both healthy volunteers 
(7 days) and psoriasis patients (3 months). MP1032 was well tolerated in all studies and 
safety analyses did not reveal any clinically important safety issues (see the current version of the IB for further information). 
x Acute treatment for symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_190267] [ADDRESS_225863] duration of time included 
in the WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19 (WHO 2020d ).  
All patients will be treated for 28 days (unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons) to provide a fixed duration of treatment across all patients. As it is impractical to require the study site to continue to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190268], if the patient is 
discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of 
the assigned blinded study drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue treatment at home on the day-of-discharge. Any patient who is discharged during the study should complete the day-of-discharge assessments before release from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190269] (Table 1). Patients who progress to the use of an invasive 
ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study drug MetrioPharm AG

Page 37 of 85 (>2 days [ie, 2-day interruption is acceptable]) must discontinue the study drug; but whenever 
possible, the study assessments will be performed on Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 60. 
This proof-of-concept study will neither include pregnant nor breastfeeding females. In 
reproduction toxicity studies of MP1032 on fertility and early embryonic as well as on embryo-
fetal development, no pathological effects were found. Genotoxicity testing as well as the repeated dose toxicity studies (up to 12 months in dogs and 6 months in rats) did not indicate any toxicological effects. Hence, MP1032 is considered as IMP with unlikely human 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy (see the current version of the IB for more 
information). However, due to the early clinical stage of development, only women who are neither pregnant nor breastfeeding will be randomized in this study. Women of childbearing 
potential (WOCBP) and non-sterile male patients with female partners who are WOCBP will be 
required to use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of first dose of study 
medication until at least [ADDRESS_225864] fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the patient has 
completed all study periods, including Day 60 as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1 ).  
The end of the study will be the last patient ’s last visit (ie, Day 60) as indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 1 ).  
[ADDRESS_225865] meet all of the following criteria to be included in the study: 
1. The patient must be willing and able to give informed consent to participate in the study 
and to adhere to the procedures stated in the protocol or, for adults incapable of consenting due to their medical condition (eg, too weak or debilitated, severe shortness of breath) or due to literacy issues, the patient’s legally authorized representative (LAR) 
must be willing and able to give informed consent on behalf of the patient to participate 
in the study as permitted by [CONTACT_31665], institutional review 
boards (IRBs)/independent ethics committees (IECs), or local laws. 
2. The patient is male or female adult aged 18 years (as per local laws) at the time of 
giving informed consent.

In the pharmacy, both MP1032 capsules and matching placebo capsules must be stored in the primary and/or secondary packaging at room temperature (15°C to 25°C [59°F to 77°F]) and protected from light. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug 
kit(s) to take home along with instructions on the day-of-discharge. 
Further details of the blinded study drug kits will be described in a Pharmacy Manual. 
9.2 Dosage Schedule 
All randomized patients will receive study drug from Day 1 to Day 28 according to their 
assigned treatment and according to the randomization scheme.  
Please note: Patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] 28 days of consecutive treatment with study 
drug are not eligible for additional treatments with study drug. Patients will receive 6 capsules in the morning and 6 capsules in the evening (ie, approximately every [ADDRESS_225884] 8 hours apart) according to their randomized treatment arm assignment as described below:  
x Arm A: MP1032 (300 mg [6 × MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg] BID) for oral 
administration 
x Arm B: 6 × placebo capsules (ie, matching MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg) BID for 
oral administration  
In Arm A, the planned total daily dose of MP1032 is 600 mg. In Arm B, the planned total daily dose of MP1032 is 0 mg.

when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administere d in fasted state ( 4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within the 4 hours before their planned administration, 
study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) 
within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be recorded. The PK samples should be 
collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fasted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered).
Any missed dose study drug may be administered as soon as possible and the next scheduled 
dose may be administered according to the planned schedule as long as the doses are at least 6 to

9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Randomization 
The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_190358] a randomization scheme that will be produced by [CONTACT_161698], independent statistician. During the randomization process, IWRS will assign a randomization number. Each patient will be 
assigned one kit number at randomization and a second kit number at the Day 14 visit. The study 
drug kits will contain the respective blinded treatment available at the study site. Further 
information on IWRS process will be provided in the IWRS
Manual.
Approximately 120 patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) as follows:

drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions to continue treatment at home; for these patients, treatment compliance will be conducted via a diary. If the patient does not feel comfortable to complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the patient with the option to be called, 
twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is taken as instructed. Patients are to be reminded of 
the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the patients were provided 
with the correct study drug kit(s) and reconcile the products received from the drug dispensing 
center. Investigational product will not be returned to the sponsor until accountability has been 
fully monitored. 
Noncompliance is defined as taking <80% or >120% of study drug. Discontinuation for 
noncompliance is at the investigator’s discretion and is to be noted on the eCRF.

f. Demographics will include sex, age, and race and/or ethnicity. 
g. Medical/surgical medical history includes all active and chronic diseases (eg, asthma and COPD), and any diseases diagnosed in the past 1 year (before screening) that the 
investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-exis ting conditions present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing 
(Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include documentation of social behaviors, including use of tob acco, nicotine (including use of electronic 
cigarettes), and soft or hard drugs (including cannabis), as well as alcohol consumption, if applicable. Smoking history also m ust be documented as part of medical history 
and includes never, light (<100 cigarettes/lifetime), active smoker, and former smoker (quit date). History of number packs/day , number of smoking years, and quitting 
time for former and active smokers must also be documented. Additionally, the investigators will document at screening the patient’s Charlson score via the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (see Section 12.1  for further details) ( Appendix 1 ). 
h. A complete physical examination will be performed at screening. Physical examinations will be performed by a physician, nurse, or other appropriately trained staff. The 
complete physical examination includes head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary l ymph nodes; and neurological and 
musculoskeletal systems. A limited physical examination to verify continued patient eligibility and to follow-up regarding any change in medical history will be 
performed at the visits indicated above. Symptom-driven, limited physical examinations may be performed as clinically indicated  during the study (according to SoC). 
i. Vital signs include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO 2, and body temperature. All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been 
resting for at least [ADDRESS_225898] ( 5 minutes).  
l. For WOCBP, a serum sample for pregnancy testing must be collected at screening and a urine sample for pregnancy testing must be  collected before the first dose on 
Day 1. Pregnancy tests must be negative for the patient to be randomized and treated. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated o n Day 14 (± 7 days). If the patient is 
discharged before Day 14, urine pregnancy test at day of discharge should be done, and urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_225899] at day of discharge is not required (whichever comes first). Patients with a positive 
pregnancy test will be discontinued from study drug. MetrioPharm AG

r. The EQ-5D-5L ( Appendix 2 ) is only required for discharged patients and at the following visits: day of discharge, Day 60, and Early Termination visit ( if applicable). The 
EQ-5D-5L is not required for patients  who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190279]. 
s. The limited physical examination and clinical laboratory assessments on Day 8 (± 3 days) will be collected in all patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patient is 
discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days), the site should arrange to have the physician assess the patient via a telephone/virtual ca ll. If the physician determines during the 
telephone/virtual call that the limited physical examination and clinical laboratory assessments are clinically indicated, then  the site should arrange for an outpatient visit 
to collect these assessments.

subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours before planned study drug administration and within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administered in fasted state (  4 hours), when feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within the 4 hours before their planned 
administration, study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be 
recorded. The PK samples should be collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fasted/fed state. The study site should r ecord the date and time of dosing (recorded as 
the time when the first capsule is administered). 
u. The clinical laboratory assessments on Day [ADDRESS_225905] the physician assess the patient via a telephone/virtual call. If the physician determines during the telephone/virtual  call that the clinical laboratory assessments are 
clinically indicated, then the site should arrange for an outpatient visit to collect this assessment.

Page 53 of 85 10.1 Informed Consent 
Before performing any study-related procedures, the investigator (or designee) will obtain 
informed consent from the patient to participate in the study or, for adults incapable of consenting due to their medical condition (eg, too weak or debilitated, severe shortness of breath) 
or due to literacy issues, the patient’s LAR must be willing give informed consent on b ehalf of 
the patient to participate in the study as permitted by [CONTACT_31665], IRBs/IECs, or 
local laws. 
Please note: The patient/LAR will be expected to provide the study site with their contact 
[CONTACT_190369]/LAR in the event that the 
patient is discharged before the end of the study. Additionally, at the time of informed consent, 
the study site may also request for the patient/LAR to provide alternative contact [CONTACT_3031]. In 
the event that rescreening occurs, the investigator (or designee) must reconsent the patient (or the 
patient’s LAR) and the patient  must be assigned a new identification number. 
10. 2 Study Procedures 
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 1 ). Section 12.5  specifies clinical laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). 
Efficacy assessments are described in Section 11  and include COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 
severity, clinical status related to COVID-19 on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale, HRQoL 
assessed by [CONTACT_20367]-5D-5L questionnaire ( Appendix 2), and COVID-19 testing.  
Safety assessments are described in Section 12  and include medical/surgical history and 
demographics, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments, and 
AEs. PK assessments are described in Section 13  and include PK sampling and PK analytical 
methodology. Biomarkers are described in Section 14.1. 
The investigator may, at his/her discretion, arrange for a patient to have an unscheduled assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow-up or are considered by [CONTACT_190370]. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  
Procedures for early study withdrawal are described in Section 8.4 .

Page 58 of 85 11.4 Health-related Quality of Life Assessment 
The HRQoL will be assessed via the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire ( Appendix 2 ). The EQ-5D-5L is a 
standardized questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_190372] a measure of HRQoL that 
consists of a descriptive system and a VAS. The descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The VAS records 
the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative measure of 
health outcome that reflects the patient’s own judgment. The patient is asked to in dicate his/her 
current health state (ie, describe their health “today”). The scores on these 5 dimensions can be 
presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number that 
describes the patient’s current health state. The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire has been validated in a 
diverse patient population in 6 countries and is available in multiple languages. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is suitable for completion by [CONTACT_67022] ( EuroQol Research Foundation 2020 ). 
The results of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be recorded at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Please note: This assessment will only be performed in 
patients who have been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5107] 60.  
11.5 COVID- 19 Testing  
Samples for COVID-19 testing will be obtained at the visits specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). At the screening visit, the local laboratory may perform COVID-[ADDRESS_225920] be 
available in order for the patient to be randomized on Day 1. If the patient has a previous 
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 (within 7 days of Day 1), the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_225921] at screening is not 
required. The result of the COVID-19 tests (positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF 
On Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 60, samples will be sent to the central laboratory for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_225922] RT-PCR assay. The result of the COVID-19 tests (positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF. Further details will be described in the laboratory manual.  
Please note: If COVID-19 tests are performed at unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), 
findings (ie, positive/negative result) must be recorded in the eCRF. 
12 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety assessments (medical/surgery history, demographics, prior and concomitant medications, 
vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments, and AEs) are to be 
performed at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).  
12.1 Medical/Surgical History and Demographics 
Medical/surgical history will be recorded at screening. Investigators will document all active and 
chronic diseases (eg, asthma and COPD), and any diseases diagnosed in the past 1 year (before MetrioPharm AG

Page 59 of 85 screening) that the investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-existing 
conditions present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing (Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include documentation of social 
behaviors, including use of tobacco, nicotine (including use of electronic cigarettes), and soft or 
hard drugs (including cannabis), as well as alcohol consumption, if applicable. Smoking history also must be documented as part of medical history and includes never, light (<100 cigarettes/lifetime), active smoker, and former smoker (quit date). History of number 
packs/day, number of smoking years, and quitting time for former and active smokers must also 
be documented.  
Additionally, the investigators will document at screening the patient’s Charlson score via the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Charlson et al 1987 ). The Charlson Comorbidity Index may be 
used to identify patients with higher risk of COVID-19 progression ( Garibaldi et al 2020 ) via the 
COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (online calculator available via: 
https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_predict/). The 14-item Charlson score is based on the patient’s comorbidities that are associated with mortality : myocardial infarction, congestive 
heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes, hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, malignancy, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus (online calculator available via: https://www.orthotoolkit.com/charlson-
comorbidity-index/). The investigator should record each individual component of the 14-item 
Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Appendix 1 ) as well as the overall score.  
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 12.[ADDRESS_225923] be recorded as AEs. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all patients and include sex, age, and race 
and/or ethnicity. 
12. 2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO
2, and body 
temperature) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 
All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes. Blood 
pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. Moreover, additional vital signs may be performed as needed in case of any cardiac AE. 
Additionally, body weight (without shoes) will be recorded at screening, Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, 
Day 60, and day of discharge (applicable); height (without shoes) will be recorded at screening only. Body mass index will be calculated whenever weight is recorded. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate measurements, or SpO

measurements must be recorded as AEs. 
12. 3 Physical E xaminations 
A complete physical examination will be performed at screening. Physical examinations will be 
performed by a physician, nurse, or other appropriately trained staff. The complete physical 
examination includes head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and musculoskeletal systems.  
A limited physical examination to verify continued patient eligibility and to follow-up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). Symptom-driven, limited physical examinations may be performed as 
clinically indicated during the study (according to SoC). 
Please note: The limited physical examination on Day 8 (± 3 days) will be collected in all 
patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patient is discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days), the site 
should arrange to have the physician assess the patient via a telephone/virtual call. If the physician determines during the telephone/virtual call that the limited physical examination is clinically indicated, then the site should arrange for an outpatient visit to collect this assessment. 
12. 4 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained locally at screening as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). At screening, the investigator must examine the ECG traces for clinically 
significant abnormalities that could exclude the patient from the study. If ECGs are performed at unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), findings must be recorded in the eCRF. 
ECGs should always be obtained in supi[INVESTIGATOR_190283] (  5 minutes). An 
assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the ECG is considered abnormal, the 
abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present. Any ECG considered by [CONTACT_190373]. Moreover, additional ECGs may be obtained 
as needed in case of any cardiac AE and will be recorded on the eCRF. 
12. 5 Clinical Laboratory Assessments

be collected in all patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patient is discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days) or Day 21 (± 2 days), the site should arrange to have the physician assess the patient via a telephone/virtual call. If the physician determines during the telephone/virtual call that the 
clinical laboratory assessments are clinically indicated, then the site should arrange for an 
outpatient visit to collect this assessment. All efforts should be made to collect clinical laboratory assessments on Day 14 (± 2 days) and Day 28 (± 3 days).
1 2.6 Adverse Events
Adverse Events
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at screening will be documented on the medical history eCRF. Changes in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be 
recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the patient was randomized in the 
study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical 
condition should be reported in the patient’s medical history.
Patients will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the follow-up period (Day 60). 
Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of study completion, is required (if possible) if the AE 
persists. The follow-up should continue until the event resolves (returns to normal or baseline 
values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_190374].It is understood that if a patient withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be possible for the study site to follow the AE to resolution.
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the event should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).MetrioPharm AG

Page 64of 85Table 7: Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_190376] : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the study drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the s
tudy drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the study drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the study drug administration 
appe ars unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.
PROBABLY: This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the study drug. An AE may be considered pr obably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it cou ld not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the study drug.
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to 
study drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_190377] c haracteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occur s); and (4) it follows a known pattern of 
response to the study drug.
Abbreviation: AE = adverse event.

Page 65of 85Other important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs if they are thought to jeopardize the patient and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the sponsor’s assessment. If either the sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_102673].
Serious Adverse Event Reporting
An SAE occurring from the time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the follow-up period (Day 60) or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648] (whichever is longer) must be 
reported to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to 
the sponsor. Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be 
reported within 24 hours the investigator ’s awareness of the event. Notification can be made 
using the dedicated fax line or email for the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group:
xSyneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance fax number: 
xSyneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance email address: 
If the investigator contacts the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group by [CONTACT_756], 
then a written report must follow within [ADDRESS_225927] report all additional follow-up 
evaluations to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the additional information. All SAEs will be followed up until the 
investigator and sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.
Any SAE that is not resolved by [CONTACT_80221]’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up, if possible, until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study drug or procedures. It is understood that if a patient withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be possible for the study site to follow the SAE to resolution.MetrioPharm AG

Suspected Une xpected Serious Adverse Reactions
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting:
xserious
xunexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the reference safety information in thecurrent version of the IB)
xthere is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study drug
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to the study drug. Syneos Health 
will consider the investigator’s assessme nt and determine whether the event meets the criteria for 
being reportable as a 7-day or 15-day safety report. S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life-threatening 
must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the IRBs/IECs (where required) within 7 days after Syneos Health/MetrioPharm has first knowledge of them, with a follow-up report (when 
applicable) submitted within a further [ADDRESS_225928] be reported to the 
relevant regulatory authorities and the IRBs/IECs within 15 calendar days afterSyneos Health/MetrioPharm first has knowledge of them.
Syneos Health is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs and any other events required to be reported 
in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing investigators of reportable 
events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes. 
Investigators will notify the relevant IRBs/IECs of reportable events within the applicable timeframes.
Pregnancy
WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test before the first dose on Day 1. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated on Day 14 (± 7 days). If the patient is discharged before Day 14, urine pregnancy test at day of discharge should be done, and urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_225929] at day of discharge 
is not required (whichever comes first). Patients with a positive pregnancy test will be 
discontinued from study drug. After administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy 
in female patients will be reported until the patient completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to 
Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The 
pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow up with the patient until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not >30 days after completion of the pregnancy. (It is understood that if a patient 
withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be possible for the study site to follow 
the pregnancy to completion.) The investigator should notify Syneos Health Safety and MetrioPharm AG

points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) from a PK subset of approximately 
30 patients (who give optional consent). In summary, PK samples will be collected via sparse sampling from these 30 patients (approximately) in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 20 patients from 
the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approximately 10 patients from the placebo group
plus SoC group) to assess the PK of MP1032 on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 7 (steady state). A 
total of 16 samples (approximately 4.9 mL per time point for a total of approximately 78.4 mL)will be collected relative to the first dose on Day [ADDRESS_225931] dose on Day 7. Samples on 
Day 1 and Day 7 will be collected predose (within [ADDRESS_225932] daily dose) and 
postdose at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 8 hours (before next dose), and 24 hours before the next morning dose (if applicable), if possible. Patients who provide consent for the PK sampling, but are no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 7, will not have 
Day 7 PK samples collected.MetrioPharm AG

Page 68 of 85 For patients in the PK subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours 
before planned study drug administration and within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administered in fasted state ( 4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within the 4 hours before their planned administration, study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be recorded. The PK samples should be collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fasted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered). 
Intravenous cannulas may be used for blood collection to avoid multiple skin punctures, when 
appropriate. Otherwise, blood samples will be collected by [CONTACT_37277]. The actual date 
and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Sample collections completed outside 
the predefined time windows (windows to be specified in the laboratory manual) will not be 
considered as protocol deviations because actual postdose sampling times will be used for PK and statistical analyses. 
PK samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory facility (Prolytic GmbH). Details of PK 
blood sample collection, processing (including separation of plasma), storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_190285] a separate laboratory manual. 
13. 2 Pharmacokinetic Analytical Methodology 
The concentration of study drug will be determined from the plasma samples using a validated 
analytical method. Details of the method validation and sample analysis will be included with the 
final clinical study report (CSR). 
14 OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
14.1 Biomarkers 
Blood samples will be obtained at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) 
on Day 1 (before the first study drug administration) and Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 (when 
possible) to measure biomarkers levels. Blood samples for biomarkers must be collected on Days 
7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 if a patient is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If a patient is discharged, the study site 
should arrange an outpatient visit (ie, at the study site) to accommodate the collection of blood 
samples for biomarkers on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60. 
Biomarkers will potentially include, but will not be limited, to cytokines (eg, C-reactive protein, 
IL-1E, IL-6, TNF- Į, and IFN- J), and other coagulation/inflammatory biomarkers (eg, D-dimer 
and ferritin). Samples may be collected at the same time that samples are collected for the 
clinical laboratory assessments. Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory facility. 
Details of sample collection, processing, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585], and analysis will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. MetrioPharm AG

completed his/her last visit in this study. 
15 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis 
variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will be finalized 
before any statistical output (eg, DSMB output) is produced. The SAP will serve as a companion 
document to the protocol. The SAP will further describe the statistical analyses. All data will be 
included with the final CSR.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS
® software version 9.4 or higher 
( ).  
Summary statistics will be present
ed by [CONTACT_1570]. Continuous and ordinal variables will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_190378] (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum for actual values and change from baseline. Additionally, for ordinal data, the number 
and percentage of patients in each category will be presented. Binary and categorical variables 
will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_190379].  
Statistical tests for comparison between treatments will be performed using a two-sided alpha 
level of 10%. No adjustment for multiple testing will be applied in this descriptive proof-of-
concept study. 
15.1 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary efficacy endpoint “proportion of patients with disease progression on Day 14” is 
assumed to be 10% in the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC treatment group (Arm A) and 30% in the placebo plus SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using the Chi-square test with type I error 
alpha=10% two-sided for this proof-of-concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio, with 
114 randomized patients (76 in Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistical power of 83% can be achieved. Considering about 5% early study terminations, the necessary sample size to 
randomize results is 120 patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct 
of the study the early study termination rate is higher than the estimated 5%, then an increase in 
the randomized number of patients may be necessary.  
Sample size estimation was performed using nQuery 8, Version [IP_ADDRESS]. A subset of randomized patients will be consented for the collection of blood samples for PK 
measurements. The PK subset consists of approximately [ADDRESS_225934] listings with exception of the listing presenting screening failures and 
the respective reason(s) for screen failure. 
Intention-To-Treat Set 
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) set, correspond with randomized set, will include all randomized 
patients irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature discontinuation from study 
drug/withdrawal from study. The treatment group assignment will be designated according to 
initial randomization. The ITT will serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy and summary of demographics and baseline characteristics. 
Per Protocol Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients from ITT who received at least [ADDRESS_225935] any major protocol deviations impacting the efficacy 
assessments. The PPS will be used for supportive analyses of efficacy. 
Safety Set 
The Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study 
drug. The treatment group assignment in the SS will be defined by [CONTACT_115378]. The SS will be used for the analysis of safety. 
PK Analysis Set The PK Analysis Set (PKS) will include all the patients who have been administered active study 
drug and have at least 1 postdose evaluable plasma concentration after Day 1 dose. 
15. 3 Efficacy Analysis 
The estimands for the primary efficacy endpoint, and for the 4 key secondary endpoints 
comparing the 2 treatment groups, will be tested with consideration of a two-sided type-1 error alpha of 10% for each test on the ITT. Additionally, 95% confidence intervals will be provided. 
Also, the treatment comparison with regards to the other secondary efficacy endpoints will be 
performed using a two-sided alpha level of 10%.  
 
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as follows: MetrioPharm AG

Page 71 of 85 x Treatment: 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC in Arm A and placebo BID plus SoC in Arm 
B. If a patient terminates the study drug, but still remains in the study and is followed up, 
then the patient will continue to receive either SoC alone or SoC+ additional treatment. 
These treatments are defined with regards to intercurrent events as ‘other treatments’.  
x Population: Of all patients defined by [CONTACT_190380]/exclusion criteria, the analysis population will include patients who were randomized to study drug (ITT population). 
x Variable: A binary variable indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at 
Day 14. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_190245] a score of 2, 3, or 4 on the 
NIAID 8-point ordinal scale. 
x Intercurrent events: All events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to 
other treatment before Day 14 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy (ie, the 
NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of the failure in such patients).  
x Population-level summary: Common risk difference resulting from the Mantel-
Haenszel (MH) test considering the 4 strata out of the combinations of the 
2 randomization stratification factors disease severity (moderate versus severe) and age-class (aged 65 years versus >65 years)  at baseline. 
Missing data on Day 14 resulting from study termination before Day 14 are not expected. However, in case they happen, such monotone missings will be imputed by [CONTACT_190335]. Missing postbaseline data for patients randomized but not treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190334] (baseline 
observation carried forward [BOCF]). The comparison between the treatment groups will be 
performed on the ITT after imputation of missing values using MH test for common risk 
difference considering the 4 strata resulting from the 2 randomization stratification factors disease severity (moderate versus severe) and age-class (aged 65 years versus >65 years). The 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the risk difference. 
Similar MH analyses and presentation of 95% confidence intervals will be applied to the main 
estimand of the first key secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a binary variable indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 28, and the main estimand of 
the second key secondary efficacy endpoint that is defined as a binary variable indicating disease 
resolution (alive and have a score of 6, 7 or 8 on NIAID) at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled 
using the treatment-policy strategy for these 2 estimands (ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will be 
used for definition of the failure or response, respectively) in such patients. Missing data on Day 
28 will be imputed by [CONTACT_190335]. Missing postbaseline data for patients randomized but not treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190381]. 
A similar MH approach and presentation of 95% confidence intervals as described above will be 
applied also to the main estimand of the third key secondary efficacy endpoint, which is the all-
cause mortality at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or MetrioPharm AG

Page 72 of 85 switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy (ie, 
the life status at Day 28 will be considered). No missing data of life status on Day 28 is expected.  
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of clinical status 
related to COVID-19 on Day 28 compared with baseline according to the NIAID 8-point ordinal 
scale, will be compared using the risk difference from the analysis of covariance model with treatment and the 2 binary stratification factors (eg, severity and age-class) as independent factors and the baseline value of NIAID as independent covariate. Intercurrent events that lead to 
study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using 
the treatment-policy strategy for this estimand (ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will be used). Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_225936]-baseline data for patients randomized but not 
treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190381]. The 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the risk 
difference.  
The population for all above described estimands of the key secondary endpoints is the ITT. 
Sensitivity analyses for the main estimands of the primary and key efficacy endpoints will be 
performed by [CONTACT_190336] 14 or Day 28 as failure or non-resolution for the 
binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190382] 8-point ordinal scale. 
All above analyses for the main estimands of the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be repeated on PPS as supportive analysis. Additionally, for the primary efficacy 
and binary key secondary efficacy endpoints, logistic regression model with treatment and the 
2 stratification factors as covariables will be performed on the ITT. Further estimands for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be provided in the SAP. 
The proportion of patients with disease resolution at Day 14 and the all-cause mortality rate at 
Day 14 and Day 60 will be analyzed using similar MH methods as described above for Day 28. 
Cumulative proportion of patients with disease resolution will be plotted by [CONTACT_5586]. 
A similar analysis of covariance approach as described above for Day 28 will be applied for the 
analysis of the change of clinical status related to COVID-19 on Day 14 compared with baseline 
on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale. The endpoint considering the proportion of patients 
requiring invasive ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who are not alive, the

compared between treatment groups using log-rank tests. Additionally, Cox proportional hazards 
model will be applied with treatment and the 2 stratification factors as covariables. MetrioPharm AG

clinical status improvement from baseline on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale (ie, an improvement of at least 1 category) at Day 14 and Day 28 will be analyzed using a logistic 
regression with consideration of the 2 stratification factors. 
The time to recovery of all at baseline present COVID-19 symptoms (stuffy or runny nose, sore 
throat, red or irritated eyes, shortness of breath, cough, low energy or tiredness, muscle or body aches, headache, chills or shivering, feeling hot or feverish, nausea, and number of times of

baseline assessment time-point compared to baseline for each treatment group.  
Total number of days in ICU, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and duration of 
ECMO will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_190383] 90% confidence intervals and additionally by [CONTACT_190384]. To consider death sufficiently unfavorable in these measures, in case of death, the duration of the respective 
measure will be considered with the longest duration possible (eg, if a summary of the first 28 
days is presented, then death before Day 28 will be considered as duration 28 days, and if the summary also includes follow-up period until Day 60, then death before Day 60 will be considered as duration of 60 days). Both summaries (up to Day 28 and up to Day 60) will be 
provided.

Investigators/Study Sites: Approximately 40 sites worldwide will participate in this study.
Phase of Development: Phase IIa
Study Objectives: The primary objective of this study is:
xTo measure the effect of MP1032 pl us standard of care (SoC) versus
placebo plus SoC on Day 14 on dise ase progression in patients with 
moderate to severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
The secondary objectives of this study are:
xTo measure the effect of MP1 [ADDRESS_225946] of MP1 032 plus SoC vers us placebo plus SoC on 
the mortality rate and other specific COVID- 19 related characteristics
xTo assess the safety of MP1032 (eg, adverse events [AEs] and laboratory 
abno rmalities)
xTo assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MP1032 on Day 1 (single dose) 
and Day 7 (steady state) in  a PK subset of patients
The exploratory objectives of this study are:
xTo measure the effect of MP1 032 plus SoC vers us placebo plus SoC on 
some additional COVID -19 related characteristics
xTo evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients treated 
MP1032 plus SoC compared with placebo plus SoC
xTo evaluate biomarker levels
Study Endpoints: The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is:
xProportion of patients with disease progression on Day 14. Disease 
progression is defined as the proportion of patients who are not alive or who 
have respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_190293] a 
score of 2, 3, or 4 on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

oNo criteria met for critical COVID -19
To standardize the assessment of COVID -19 severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO 2, and 
heart rate will be measured when the patient is on room air at sea level (ie, no 
supplemental oxygen) and at rest for at least [ADDRESS_225950] the information from each patient at  the same time each day (±1 hour). 
Please note: Patients who ar e receiving oxygen therapy at baseline for a chronic 
condition (eg, emphysema, c hronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 
pulmonary arterial hypertension [PAH], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [IPF], etc) 
must be considered as having severe C OVID-19 (unless the patient meets the 
definition for critical COVID -19). For questions related to COVID- [ADDRESS_225951] ed SoC will be used in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and 
may include drugs under an emergency use authorization.
This study co nsists of 3 periods: (1) screening, (2) treatment, and (3) follow- up. 
During the screening period, each potential patient (or patient’s legally acceptable 
representative) will provide informed consen t before starting any study- specific 
procedures. The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed MetrioPharm AG

patient’s best interest, or the patient has any condition or critical illness,
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], that will not allow the protocol to be 
followed safely.
Planned Sample Size: The primary efficacy endpoint “proportio n of patients with disease progression on 
Day 14” is assumed to be 10% in the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC treatment 
group (Arm A) and 30% in the placebo pl us SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using 
the Chi -square test with type I error alpha =10% two-sided for this proof-of-
concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio , with 114 randomized patients (76 in 
Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistica l power of 83% can be achieved. Considering 
about 5% early study terminations, the ne cessary sample size to randomize results 
is 120 patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct of 
the study the early study termination rate is  higher than the estimated 5%, then an 
increase in the randomized number  of patients may be necessary. 
Sample size estimation was performed using nQuery 8, Version [IP_ADDRESS].
A subset of randomized patients will be consented for the collection of blood 
samples for PK measurements. The PK subset consists of approximately 
20patients from the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approximately 
10patients from the placebo plus SoC group, up to a total of approximately 
30patients.
Study Drug, Dose, and 
Mode of Administration:All randomized patients will receive study drug from Day 1 to Day 28 according 
to their assigned treatment and according to the randomization scheme .Patients
will receive 6 capsules in the morning and 6 capsules in the evening (ie, 
approximately every [ADDRESS_225968] 8 hours apart) according to their ra ndomized treatment arm assignment as 
described below :
xArm A: MP1032 (300 mg [6 × MP [ADDRESS_225969] gelatin capsules 50 mg]
BID) for oral administration
xArm B: 6 × placebo capsules ( ie, matching MP1032 hard gelatin 
capsules 50 mg) BID for oral administration
Standard of Care Each site will treat all p atients with SoC for the duration of the study. The 
selected SoC will be used in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and 
may include drugs under an emergency use authorization.
Treatment Duration: Patients will be treated with study drug fo r 28 consecutive days (unless study drug 
is discontinued for safety reasons )to provide a fixed duration of treatment across 
all patients . Patients who progress to the use of an invasive ventilation 
(mechanical ve ntilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study 
drug (>2 days [ie, 2-day interruptio n is acceptable]) must discontinue the study 
drug; but whenever possible, the study assessments will be performed on Day 8,
Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 60 .If the patient is discharged home before 
Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned 
blinded study drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue 
treatment at home on the day -of-discharge; for these patients, treatment 
compliance will be conducted v ia a diary. If the patient do es not feel comfortable 
to complete the diary, the s ite will alternatively provide the patient with the option 
to be called, twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is taken as instructed.MetrioPharm AG

Planned Analyses:Analysis Sets:
Intention -to-Treat Set
The   Intention-to -Treat (ITT) set, correspond with randomized set, will include 
allrandomized patients irrespective of an y deviation from the protocol or 
premature discontinuation from study drug/withdrawal from study . The treatment 
group assignment will be designated ac cording to initial ran domization. The ITT
will serve as the basis for the analysis of  efficacy and summa ry of demographics 
and baseline characteristics.
Per Protocol SetThe Per Protocol 
Set (PPS) will include all patients from ITT who received at 
least [ADDRESS_225972] any major protocol deviations 
impacting the efficacy assessments. The PP S will be used for supportive analyses 
of efficacy.
Safety SetThe 
Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized patients who received at least 
1dose of study drug. The treatment group assignment in the SS will be defined by 
[CONTACT_115378]. The SS will be used for the analysis of safety.
PK Analysis Set
The PK Analysis Set (PKS) will include all the patients who have been 
administered active study drug and have  at least 1 postdose evaluable plasma 
concentration after Day 1 dose.
Analyses: 
The estimand s for the primary efficacy endpoint and for the 4 key secondary 
endpoints comparing the 2 treatment groups will be tested with consideration of a 
two-sided alpha of 10% on each test- level on the ITT. Additionally, 95% 
confidence intervals will be provided . Also, the treatment comparison with 
regards to the other efficacy endpoints wi ll be performed using a two- sided alpha 
level of 10%..
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as a binary 
variable indicating disease prog ression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 14. 
Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other 
treatment before Day 14 will be handled using the treatment- policy strategy (ie, 
the NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of the failure in such 
patients). Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_225973]- baseline data for patients  randomized but not 
treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190401] (baseline observation 
carried forward, BOCF). The comparison between the treatment groups 
considering all randomized patients after having imputed missing values will be

Similar MH analyses will be conducted for the main e stimand of the first key 
secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a binary variable indicating 
disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 28, and the main 
estimand for the second key secondary ef ficacy endpoint, which is defined as a
binary variable indicating disease resolution (alive and have a score of 6, 7 or 8 
on NIAID) at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation 
and/or switch to other treatment befo re Day 28 will be handled using the 
treatment -policy s trategy for these estimands (ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will 
be used for definition of the failure or response, respectively) in such patients.

treatment -policy strategy (ie, th e life status at Day 28 will be considered). No 
missing data of life status on Day 28 is expected. 
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of 
clinical status related to COVID -19 on Day 28 compared with baseline according 
tothe NIAID 8-point ordinal scale, will be compared using the risk difference 
from the analysis of covariance mod el with treatment and the 2 binary 
stratification factors (ie, severity and age -class) as independent factors and the 
baseline value of NIAID as independent c ovariate. Intercurrent events that lead to 
study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be 
handled using the treatment -policy strategy for these es timands (ie, the NIAID 
score at Day 28 will be used). Missing data on Day 28 will be imputed by 
[CONTACT_190402]. 
Sensitivity analyses for the main estimands of the primary and key efficacy 
estimands will be performed by [CONTACT_190403] 14 or Day 28 as 
failure or non -resolution for the binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190337] 8-
point ordinal scale.
All above analyses for the main estima nds of the primary efficacy and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be repe ated on PPS as supportive analysis. 
Additionally, for the primary efficacy and binary key secondary efficacy 
endpoints logistic regression model with tr eatment and the 2 stratification factors 
as covariables will be performed on the ITT.
The proportion of patients with dise ase resolution at Day 14 and the all -cause

5. 1 Background on COVID- 19 On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organi zation (WHO) was informed of a cluster of 
cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in . Severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_190249] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative 
virus by [CONTACT_190344] 07 January 2020 ( WHO 2020a ). Coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) was identified as the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-[ADDRESS_225985] 2020, the WHO estimated the case fatality ratio, which estimates the 
proportion of deaths among confirmed cases, to vary from 0.1% to >25%. Whereas, the true severity of COVID-19 as measured by [CONTACT_190345], which estimates the proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, is estimated to be approximately 0.5% to 1% 
(WHO 2020b). In a more recent summary of Levin et al ( 2020) it could be clearly shown that the 
infection fatality ratio is highly age dependent, be ing in average as low as 0.004% for patients 
younger than 35 and as high as 28.3% in patients at the age of 85 and older.
Presentations of COVID-19 range from an asymptomatic course or mild symptoms to severe 
illness and mortality. Common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, 
congestion or runny nose, naus ea or vomiting, and diarrhea ( Cennimo 2021 ). Less common 
symptoms are sputum production, malaise, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], and neurologic symptoms, such as altered mental state. While most patients with COVID-[ADDRESS_225986] 
common serious manifestation of COVID-19. Further, major deterioration such as an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) can lead to the imperative need of an intensive care unit 
(ICU) and might even require mechanical ventilat ion via intubation. Other complications that 
might occur during the course of the disease include sepsis, acute kidney injury, thyrotoxicosis, 
and neurologic manifestations such as myasthenia gravis. The elderly, as well as patients with pre-existing chronic conditions (eg, asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, immune system deficiencies, liver disease, and cardiac diseases, etc), seem to be more vulnerable to a severe disease course.
Although, to date, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding COVID-19 is still limited,
it seems to be clear that the course of the di sease, and particularly severe complications, areMetrioPharm AG

Page 25of 89based on an overshooting immune response. De tails on and a deeper understanding of how the 
virus causes such a reaction will be a centr al part of future investigations ( Hillienhof 2020 ).
Patients with COVID-19 show increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rothan 
and By[CONTACT_41386] 2020 ). From a pathophysiological point of view, in severe cases the viral 
infection seems to trigger an excessive immune reaction in the host, a so-called cytokine storm,
leading to extensive tissue damage. A key player of this mechanism is interleukin (IL)-6. IL-[ADDRESS_225987] viral infection of the endothelial cells and diffuse endothelial inflammation in the whole

Recently the first vaccines to prevent COVID-[ADDRESS_225988] been approved by [CONTACT_177015], including

take years until the majority of people will be vaccinated and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_190301]. Hence, there is stil l an urgent need for therapeutic agents to cure 
COVID-19 and/or ameliorate its symptoms. Among the antiviral treatment options, remdesivir has shown to be effective in reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190302] ( Beigel et al 2020 ); however, in the meantime the WHO has issued a conditional 
recommendation against the use of remdesivir in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190260] ( WHO 2020c ) Among immune modulating drugs low-dosed dexamethasone could 
significantly lower the incidence of deaths wh en applied at a later time point of the disease 
course ( WHO-REACT 2020 ) but is not recommended early in disease or in patients with mild 
symptoms only (WHO 2020c ). Hence, there is still no antiviral treatment or otherwise effective 
curative agent that could really lower the burden of this pandemic. Thus, COVID-19 still 
presents an urgent unmet medical need.
5.2 Background on MP 1032, Including Benefit Risk Assessment 
MP1032 is a purely synthetic, new chemical entit y. MP1032 is a mono sodium salt derived from 
the aromatic system phthalazinedione, containing an additional amino group. MP1032 is 
water-soluble and hydrophilic.
The primary mechanism of action of MP1032 is a ssumed to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavenging action in inflamed tissues (ie, tissu es that experience oxidative stress). A unique 
pharmacologic property of MP1032 is that the ROS-scavenging function of the molecule is only 
activated in tissues with pathologically high ROS concentrations (oxidative stress), which is the 
case in inflamed tissue. By [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-establishing a physiologic redox balance in activated immune cells, MP1032 is putatively inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B is expected to lead to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6 and TNF-Į) (Gloire et al 2006 ). In addition, MP1032 is a specific inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose-
polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARP1 is a nuclear enzyme involved in inflammation ( Ke et al 2019 ).MetrioPharm AG

Page 26of 89Further identified potential targets are the kinases human Aurora-B, human Aurora-C, 
serine/threonine-protein kinase, tyrosin e kinase, and the metalloprotease TNF- Į-converting 
enzyme —however, at relatively high molarity only. Therefore, the administration of MP1032 (as 
shown nonclinically, both in vitro and in vivo), in pathological conditions only, leads to a 
reduced concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines without completely blocking them. In 
addition to this broadly anti-inflammatory potential, MP1032 exhibits direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that could be shown by a clear and dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-
CoV-2 reproduction in Vero B4 cells (African green monkey [Chlorocebus aethiops ] kidney 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_190261]) ( Schumann et al 2020 ).
MP1032 could attenuate prolonged virus replication by [CONTACT_190346] 
(Khomich et al 2018 ) and/or by [CONTACT_190347]-ribosylation of the viral nucleocapsid protein via 
PARP1 inhibition (Grunewald et al 2018 ). PARP1 inhibitors also have been suggested for the 
treatment of COVID-19 ( Curtin et al 2020).
Based on the basic chemical mechanism of MP1032 as an electron donor to ROS, the molecule 
acts similarly across a wide range of species and is thus not an agent with a high degree of 
species specificity. Further, MP1032 has no specific immune-system targets as known from 
various biologicals. MP1032 is not expressed by [CONTACT_190406] (cells) or using raw 
materials of human or animal origin.
Nonclinical Studies
In vivo safety studies showed no evidence of neurotoxic potential or negative 
cardiohemodynamic effects; no local intolerance was observed. There was no dose-limiting or 
target organ toxicity and no s ubstance-related findings in histopathology in rats or dogs. 
However, after [ADDRESS_225989] dose 
(1000 mg/kg/d), liver organ weight was elevated compared with that of controls and histopathologically associated with hepatocellu lar hypertrophy. This finding was not considered 
adverse because of its adaptive character, as hi stopathological changes were not present at the 
end of the recovery period (ie, ef fect was reversible after 8 weeks).
In reproduction toxicity studies on fertility, early embryonic, and embryo-fetal development, nopathological effects were found. On the basis of results from [ADDRESS_225990] dose (300 mg/kg) of MP1032. No pulmonary effects 
have been observed in any of the long-term animal toxicity studies. The maximum plasma levels 
reached in humans are over 1000 times (oral) lower than for the abovementioned dose. Thus, 
pulmonary effects are not considered a potential risk for patients and volunteers.
Emesis sporadically occurred in various repeat-d ose toxicology studies in dogs; the emesis was 
present in the dogs more often at the high doses of 150 mg/kg twice daily (BID) intravenous than
at 125 mg/kg BID (oral). The lowest experimental oral dose inducing emesis was 25 mg/kg BID MetrioPharm AG

Page 27of 89(oral) in dogs, corresponding to 1.8 g (oral; conversion based on human-equivalent dose) for a 
65-kg human. Dogs are well known to be susceptible to emesis; in addition, the maximum doses administered in humans are [ADDRESS_225991] with safety margins between 2 to 20 times. Therefore, a phototoxic risk for patientsseems to be unlikely.
Further, a slight to moderate increase in serum cr eatinine level combined with a slight decrease 
of kidney weights was observed after a 90-day treatment period in male mice in a dose-range 
finding, repeated dose (oral) toxicity study at high dosed animals. However, as there were no 
associated histopathological findings in kidneys of th e respective animals, this effect is also not 
considered to be adverse in nature. In the sc ope of extensive laboratory controls in the clinical 
studies completed so far, no respective treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) have been 
reported. 
The probability of pharmacokin etic interactions of MP1032 regarding the inhibition or induction 
of Cytochrome P450 or inhibition of well-known drug transporters is rather low. However, based 
on in vitro experiments there are hints that a combination of MP1032 and dexamethasone might 
act (supra-)additive regarding the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-6). Thus, 
currently, a potential drug-drug interaction of MP1032 and dexamethasone regarding their anti-
inflammatory action cannot be excluded.
For further details of the completed nonclinical studies conducted with MP1032, readers are 
referred to the current version of the investigator’s brochure (IB).

No deaths occurred in the scope of the MP1032 clinical development program.
MP1032 was well tolerated in all studies, and safe ty analyses did not reveal any clinically 
important safety issues. In general, incidence, intensity, causality, and spreading of TEAEs over 
system organ classes (SOCs) were comparable between groups. In the recent Phase II study, theincidence, intensity, relationship to investigati onal medicinal product (IMP), and causality to 
IMP for adverse events (AEs) were even lower for both MP1032 dose groups compared with
those of the placebo group and statistically significantly lower for the [ADDRESS_225994] be considered as 
common (1/100 to <1/10); while neutropenia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], abdominal pain u pper, fatigue, 
feeling drunk, influenza-like illness, cystitis , and headache can be regarded as uncommon 
(1/1,000 to <1/100). Regarding the general spread ing of AEs over SOCs and the comparison 
between groups, currently none of them can be considered a significant clinical risk.
Regarding efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, the MP1032-CT02 study 
showed that after only 6 weeks of treatment, there was a clinically meaningful response in 
patients who entered the study with moderate to  severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI) score of 10 to 20 and achieved the appropriate drug-exposure levels. 
Hence, only patients with a PASI score of 10 to 20 at baseline were randomized to the 
MP1032-CT04 study. After 12 weeks, a significant PASI reduction could be shown in the 
300 mg MP1032 BID group compared with those in the placebo group; however, this only
occurred in a prespecified subgroup of patients with PASI 15 at baseline.

Page 29of 895.3 Risk Management of MP 1032 
In the scope of planning and conducting future clinical studies, all potential risks associated with 
MP1032 will be considered, and measures will be taken as applicable. 
On the basis of limitations in the amount of preclinical and clinical data available so far, MP1032 
shall not be administered to patients for >[ADDRESS_225995] already been described in the clinical program so far, as well as 
any suspected AEs arising from risks associated with preclinical data will be evaluated 
extensively on a case-by-case base during ongoing and/or upcoming studies.
Because of potential phototoxicity, patients in upcoming studies will be advised to avoid strong 
sun exposure (sunbathing) and strong ultraviolet exposure. Furthermore, the use of sunscreen will be recommended when spending an exten ded period outdoors. It should be ensured that 
exposure to ultraviolet light (eg, from lasers in procedures) is limited while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].
To avoid risks associated with potential low eff icacy in serious and life-threatening conditions, 
such as COVID-19, MP1032 is only recommended to be used as add-on to standard of 
care (SoC) until a respective proof-of-concept is demonstrated.
As dexamethasone is expected to be part of So C in most institutions treating patients with
COVID-19 investigators should be aware that a (supra-)additive synergism between MP1032 
and dexamethasone regarding their anti-inflammatory activity cannot be excluded.
Further details regarding known or anticipated risks,  as well as reasonably anticipated AEs for 
MP1032 may be found in the current version of the IB.

leads to a reduced concentration of pathologically increased pro-inflammatory cytokines without
completely blocking them. This downregulation to physiologic levels was shown in vivo and in
vitro for IL- 1ȕ, IL -6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF- Į in activated macrophages/neutrophils ; most data
are available on the downregulation of IL-[ADDRESS_225997] treatments,
MP1032 may prevent and/or ameliorate any overstimu lation of the immune system in the course
of a COVID-19, thereby [CONTACT_190349][INVESTIGATOR_190262]. A t the same time, the probability of a severe 
course of the disease is reduced because of a poten tial direct antiviral capacity of MP1032. This 
combinative approach makes MP1032 a promising ca ndidate for the treatment of COVID-19. In
addition, synergistic effects may be obtained when using MP1032 as an add-on to other 
medicinal products currently under investigation for treating patients with COVID-19.
There is a substantial medical need for preventive and/or therapeutic options for the COVID-19
pandemic. COVID-19 is a viral disease with a considerable mortality rate that is not yet 
completely determined and it significantly aff ects healthcare systems. Considering the strong 
safety profile and good tolerability of MP1032 based on both preclinical and clinical data,
combined with the signals of meaningful therapeutic effects of MP1032, it is justified that a 
proof-of-concept for MP1032 in the treatmen t of patients with COVID-19 is started.
As such, this proof-of-concept study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of MP1032
plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC treatment in hosp italized adults with confirmed moderate to 
severe COVID-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 infection. Additional exploratory 
objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) of MP1032 in a PK subset of patients and the effect of 
MP1032 on biomarker levels.
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, resulting in capacity 
issues at many medical facilities and concerns about the safety of healthcare providers caring for 
these seriously sick patients. Consequently, th is study is designed to minimize the burden on 
clinical sites, including minimizing the number of  required assessments and interventions. To 
allow close monitoring and oral administration, the intended patient population shall include 
only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 that do not  require intubation at the time of screening 
and/or randomization. Only adults shall be in cluded. Additionally, pregnant and breastfeeding 
women shall be excluded.
The study drugs will be indistinguishable to blinded study personnel to limit bias in study 
assessments. Most interventions and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with the 
schedule dictated by [CONTACT_190350]. An independent data monitoring comm ittee (DMC) will be established 
by [CONTACT_190407] (as per the
DMC charter) throughout the study to ensure the safety of patients and review overall study 
conduct.MetrioPharm AG

The stratification factor for randomization will include baseline  COVID-19 severity (moderate 
versus severe) and age- class (aged 65 years versus >65 years) . COVID-19 severity will be 
determined using the following criteria:
xModerate COVID-19:
oPositive SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_225999] reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay or equivalent test 
oSymptoms of moderate illness with COVID-19, which could include any 
symptom of mild illness or shortness of breath with exertion
oClinical signs suggestive of moderate illness with COVID-19, such as 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 20 breaths per minute, SpO 2>93% (on room air at sea level, 
if possible), heart rate 90beats per minute 
oNo clinical signs indicative of severe or critical COVID-19

Page 35of 89This study consists of 3 periods: (1) screening, (2) treatment, and (3) follow-up. During the 
screening period, each pote ntial patient (or patient’s legally acceptable representative) will 
provide informed consent before starting any study-specific procedures. The randomization of 
patients to treatment groups will be perform ed centrally by [CONTACT_190331]-response 
system (IWRS) using a randomization scheme that will be developed by [CONTACT_161698], 
independent statistician. During the treatment period, randomized patients will be provided their assigned treatment and assessments according to the protocol. All patients will be treated for 
28 days unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug kit(s) to take home along with inst ructions on how to continue treatment at home on 
the day-of-discharge; for these patients, treatmen t compliance will be conducted via a diary. If 
the patient does not feel comfortable to complete th e diary, the site will alternatively provide the 
patient with the option to be called, twice a day,  to confirm that the study drug is taken as 
instructed. The treatment period will end with the Day 28 (End of Treatment Visit) assessments. The follow-up period will consist of Day 60 (Follow-up Visit) assessments.
Please note: Patients will be assessed while hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If patients are discharged from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], they must have study visits at Day 7, Day 8 (in case of early discharge), Day 14,
Day 21, Day 28, Day 60, and at Early Termination (as applicable) as an outpatient visit (ie, at the study site). Patients discharged early will continue to receive study drug through Day 28. For 
patients discharged early, it is sufficient to conduct the visits Day 2 to Day 6 and Day 9 to 
Day 13 (as applicable) as a telephone/virtual call (the patient’s caregiver may assist during the 
telephone/virtual call). All telephone/virtual call visits must be conducted by a physician.
The study duration for an individual patient will be as follows:
xScreening period: up to 7 days
xTreatment period: 28 consecutive days (ie, Day 1 to Day 28)
xFollow-up period: 32 days after Day 28 (ie, Day 60)
As such, the approximate study duration (including screening and the follow-up period) for an 
individual patient is up to 67 days (±3 days).
An independent DMC will be established by [CONTACT_190353] (as per the DMC ch arter) throughout the study to ensure the safety 
of patients and review overall study conduct. The DMC can recommend in writing to the sponsor
whether to continue, modify, or stop the clinical study on the basis of safety considerations (see 
Section 15.8 for further details).
No interim analysis is planned.MetrioPharm AG

Page 36of 897.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC 
versus placebo plus SoC treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190305]-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 infection. 
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 
capacity issues at many medical facilities. Additionally, the highly contagious nature of 
COVID-19 (compounded by a shortage of personal protective equipment) has caused concerns about the safety of healthcare providers caring fo r these seriously sick patients. Consequently, 
this study is designed to minimize any additi onal burden on clinical sites, including minimizing 
the number of assessments and interventions that the study will require in addition to SoC, while 
still ensuring the safety of patients.
This study will be double-blinded and placebo-controlled to limit bias in study assessments. 
Either MP1032 or placebo will be administered as add-on therapy to SoC. Most interventions 
and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with SoC, without requiring additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190266].
The dose, dosing regimen, and duration of tr eatment planned for this study (300 mg MP1032
BID for 28 days) were selected on the basis of:
xThe highest repeated dose was 300 mg MP1032 BID applied to both healthy volunteers 
(7 days) and psoriasis patients (3 months). MP1032 was well tolerated in all studies and 
safety analyses did not reveal any clinically important safety issues (see the current 
version of the IB for further information).
xAcute treatment for symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_190267] [ADDRESS_226003] duration of time included in the WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19 (WHO 2020d ).
All patients will be treated for 28 days (unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons)
to provide a fixed duration of treatment across al l patients. As it is impractical to require the 
study site to continue to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190268], if the patient is discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of 
the assigned blinded study drug kit( s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue 
treatment at home on the day-of-discharge. Any patient who is discharged during the study 
should complete the day-of-discharge assessments before release from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190269] ( Table 1). Patients who progress to the use of an invasive 
ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study drug(>2 days [ie, 2-day interruption is acceptable]) must discontinue the study drug; but whenever 
possible, the study assessments will be performed on Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 
60.MetrioPharm AG

Page 37of 89This proof-of-concept study will neither include pregnant nor breastfeeding females. In 
reproduction toxicity studies of MP1032 on fertility  and early embryonic as well as on embryo-
fetal development, no pathological effects were found. Genotoxicity testing as well as the 
repeated dose toxicity studies (up to 12 months in dogs and 6 months in rats) did not indicate any 
toxicological effects. Hence, MP1032 is considered as IMP with unlikely human 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy (see the current version of the IB for more information). However, due to the early clinical stage of development, only women who are 
neither pregnant nor breastfeeding will be randomized in this study. Women of childbearing 
potential (WOCBP) and non-sterile male patients with female partners who are WOCBP will be required to use a highly effective method of cont raception from the time of first dose of study 
medication until at least [ADDRESS_226004] fulfilled the requirements for study completion if/when the patient has

In Arm A, the planned total daily dose of MP1032 is 600 mg. In Arm B, the planned total daily dose of MP1032 is 0 mg.
Study drug will be administered to each patient with water (ad libitum) for oral administration.For all patients (except on Day 1 and Day 7 for pa tients in the PK subset): Patients should not eat 
within the [ADDRESS_226023] the date and time of dosing (recorded as th e time when the first capsule is administered).
For patients in the PK subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours
before planned study drug administration and w ithin the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when feasible. Thus, study drug shou ld be administered in fasted state ( 4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within  the 4 hours before their planned administration, 
study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) 
within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing s hould be recorded. The PK samples should be 
collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fa sted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered).
Any missed dose study drug may be administered as soon as possible and the next scheduled 
dose may be administered according to the planned schedule as long as the doses are at least 6 to

9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Randomization 
The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_190358] 
a randomization scheme that will be produced by [CONTACT_161698], independent statistician. During 
the randomization process, IWRS will assign a randomization num ber. Each patient will be 
assigned one kit number at randomization and a se cond kit number at the Day 14 visit. The study 
drug kits will contain the respective blinded treatment available at the study site. Further 
information on IWRS process will be provided in the IWRS Manual.
Approximately 120 patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) as follows: 
xArm A (300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC): approximately 80 patients
xArm B (placebo BID plus So C): approximately 40 patients
The stratification factor for random ization will include baseline  COVID-19 severity (moderate 
versus severe) and age- class (aged 65 years versus >65 years) . COVID-19 severity will be 
determined using the following criteria:
xModerate COVID-19:MetrioPharm AG 
MP1032MP1032-CT05 
Final
07-Feb-[ADDRESS_226025] 
oSymptoms of moderate illness with COVID-19, which could include any 
symptom of mild illness or shortness of breath with exertion
oClinical signs suggestive of moderate illness with COVID-19, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 20 breaths per minute, SpO
2>93% (on room air at sea level, if possible),
heart rate 90 beats per minute 
oNo clinical signs indicative of severe or critical COVID-19
xSevere COVID-19:
oPositive SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_226026], or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_190274]-19, such as 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] 30 breaths per minute, heart rate 125 beats per minute, SpO 2
93% (on room air at sea level, if possible), PaO 2/FiO 2<300, or diagnosed with 
ARDS (according to the Berlin definition; see Table 3 )
oNo criteria met for critical COVID-19
To standardize the assessment of COVID-19 severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO 2, and heart rate will 
be measured when the patient is on room air at sea level (ie, no supplemental oxygen, if possible) 
and at rest for at least [ADDRESS_226027] the information from each 
patient at the same time each day (±1 hour). 
Please note: Patients who are receiving oxygen therapy at baseline for a chronic condition (eg, 
emphysema, COPD, PAH, IPF, etc) must be considered as having severe COVID-19 (unless the 
patient meets the definition for critical COVID-19). For questions related to COVID-[ADDRESS_226028] the medical monitor.
Blinding
The study is double-blinded. Study drug will be identical in appearance and labeled in a blinded manner. All patients (and their LARs), investigators , and all study staff involved in the conduct 
of the study (including sponsor personnel or sponsor designees), including data management and biostatistics, will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
Exception: An unblinded, independent statistician  will be assigned to produce the randomization 
schedule and unblinded tables, figures, and listings for the DMC. The unblinded statistician will 
not otherwise participate in study procedures.
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given patient because of AEs or 
concerns for the patient’s safety or well-being, the investigator may break the randomization 
code for the patient via the IWRS, by [CONTACT_190359]. The 
investigator is responsible for no tifying the medical monitor and/or sponsor of such an event as 
soon as possible. The unblinding and its cause will also be documented in the eCRF.MetrioPharm AG

Page 45of 89If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given patient’s study drug, that patient will be 
discontinued from the study drug unless there are ethical reasons for that patient not to be 
discontinued; approval from the sponsor’s medical monitor must be obtained in such instances.
9.4 Treatment Modifications and Discontinuations 
Dose reductions and adjustments are not permit ted; any dose reductions and adjustments that 
occur will be recorded and considered protocol deviations.
Delays and omissions of study drug administrati on because of medical or non-medical reasons 
are allowed. All delays and omissions of study dr ug that occur during the study will be recorded 
and considered protocol deviations.
All patients will be treated for [ADDRESS_226029] immediately notify the medical monitor. 
A patient may voluntarily discontinue the study drug or be discontinued from the study drug at 
any time for reasons including, but not limited to, the following:
xprogressive disease (related to COVID-19). Plea se note: Patients who progress to the use 
of an invasive ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study drug (>2 days [ie, 2-day in terruption is acceptable]) must discontinue 
the study drug; but whenever possible, the study assessments will be performed on Day 8,Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 60.

The reason and date for the patient’s discontinuation from study drug must be recorded on the 
eCRF.
Please note: It is expected that patients who discontinue study drug early remain in the study, 
whenever possible, until the completion of the Day [ADDRESS_226030] or other designated individual w ill maintain records of study drug delivered to 
the study site, the inventory at the study site, the distribution to and use by [CONTACT_6904], and the 
return of materials to the sponsor for storage or disposal. These records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659], in-clinic temp erature log, and unique code 
numbers assigned to the product and patients.
During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the administration of the study drug will be performed by [CONTACT_093] 
(or qualified blinded designee) to ensure comp liance. If the patient is discharged home before 
Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study 
drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions to continue treatment at home; for these patients, 
treatment compliance will be conducted via a diar y. If the patient does not feel comfortable to 
complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the patient with the option to be called, 
twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is ta ken as instructed. Patients are to be reminded of 
the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on taking their 
study drug on schedule and maintaining th e prescribed interval between doses.
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the patients were provided 
with the correct study drug kit(s) and reconcil e the products received from the drug dispensing
center. Investigational product will not be returne d to the sponsor until accountability has been 
fully monitored.
Noncompliance is defined as taking <80%  or >120% of study drug. Discontinuation for 
noncompliance is at the investigator’s discretion and is to be noted on the eCRF.

f. Medical/surgical medical history includes all active and chronic diseases (eg, asthma and COPD), and any di seases diagnosed in  the past 1 year (before screening) that the 
investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-existin g conditions present at the time when informed consent is g iven and up to the time of first dosing 
(Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include documentation of social beha viors, including use of tobac co, nicotine (including use of electronic 
cigarettes), and soft or hard drugs (includi ng cannabis), as well as alcohol consump tion, if applicable. Smoking history also must be documented as part of medical history 
and includes never, light (<100 cigarettes/lif etime), active smoker, and former smoker (quit date). History of number packs/day,  number of smoking years, and quitting 
time for former and active smokers must also be  documented. Additionally, the investigators will document at screening the patient’ s Charlson score via the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (see Section 12.1 for further details) ( Appendix 1 ).
g. A complete physical examinat ion will be performed at screening. Physical exam inations will be performed by a physician. The c omplete physical examination includes 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; sk in; cervical and axillary lymph node s; and neurological and muscul oskeletal systems. A limited physical 
examination to verify continued patient eligibility and to follow -up regarding any chan ge in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated above. Symptom-
driven, limited physical examinations may be performed as c linically indicated during the study (according to SoC).
h. Vital signs include systolic an d diastolic blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO 2, and body temperature. All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been 
resting for at least [ADDRESS_226036] ( 5minutes). 
k. For WOCBP, a serum sample for pregnancy testing must be co llected at screening and a urine samp le for pregnancy testing must be collected before the first dose on 
Day 1. Pregnancy tests must be negative for the patient to be ra ndomized and treated. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated on Day 14 (± 7 days). If the patient is 
discharged before Day 14, uri ne pregnancy test at day of discharge should be done, an d urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_226037] at day of discharge is not required (wh ichever comes first ). Patients with a positive

Page 53of 891 0. 1 Informed Consent 
Before performing any study-related procedures, the investigator (or designee) will obtain 
informed consent from the patient to particip ate in the study or, for adults incapable of 
consenting due to their medical condition (eg, too weak or debilitated, severe shortness of breath) 
or due to literacy issues, the patient’s LAR must  be willing give informed consent on behalf of 
the patient to participate in the study as permitted by [CONTACT_31665], IRBs/IECs, or 
local laws.
Please note: The patient/LAR w ill be expected to provide th e study site with their contact 
[CONTACT_190369]/LAR in the event that the 
patient is discharged before the end of the study. Additionally, at the time of informed consent, 
the study site may also request for the patient/LAR to provide alternative contact [CONTACT_3031]. In 
the event that rescreening occurs, the investigator  (or designee) must reconsent the patient (or the 
patient’s LAR) and the patient must be assigned a new identification number.
1 0.2 Study Procedures 
Assessments and their timing are to be performed  as outlined in the Sc hedule of Assessments 
(Table 1). Section 12.5 specifies clinical laboratory asse ssment samples to be obtained.

Page 58of 8911 .4 Health-related Quality of Life Assessment 
The HRQoL will be assessed via the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire ( Appendix 2). The EQ-5D-5L is a 
standardized questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_190372] a measure of HRQoL that 
consists of a descriptive system and a VAS. The descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiety/depression. The VAS records 
the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative measure of 
health outcome that re flects the patient’s own judgment. The patient is asked to indicate his/her 
current health state (ie, describe their health “today”). The scores on these 5 dimensions can be 
presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number that
describes the patient’s current health state. The EQ -5D-5L questionnaire has been validated in a 
diverse patient population in 6 countries and is  available in multiple languages. The EQ-5D-5L
questionnaire is suitable for completion by [CONTACT_67022] ( EuroQol Research Foundation 2020 ).
The results of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be  recorded at the visits specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). Please note: This assessment will only be performed in patients who have been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5107] 60. 
11 .5 COVID- 19 Testing  
Samples for COVID-19 testing will be obtained at the visits specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). At the screening visit, the local laboratory may perform COVID-[ADDRESS_226057] be 
available in order for the patient to be random ized on Day 1. If the patient has a previous 
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 (within 7 days of Day 1), the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_226058] at screening is notrequired. The result of the COVID-19 tests (positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF
On Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 60, samples w ill be sent to the central laboratory for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_226059] RT-PCR assay. The result of the COVID-19 tests 
(positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF. Further details will be described in the laboratory manual. 
Please note: If COVID-19 tests are performed at unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), 
findings (ie, positive/negative result) must be recorded in the eCRF.
1 2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety assessments (medical/surgery history, demographics, prior and concomitant medications, 
vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, clinica l laboratory assessments, and AEs) are to be 
performed at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).
1 2. 1 Medical/Surgical History and Demographics

Page 59of 89screening) that the investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-existing 
conditions present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing (Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Me dical history will include documentation of social 
behaviors, including use of tobacco, nicotine (incl uding use of electronic cigarettes), and soft or 
hard drugs (including cannabis), as well as a lcohol consumption, if applicable. Smoking history 
also must be documented as part of medical history and includes never, light 
(<100 cigarettes/lifetime), active smoker, and former smoker (quit date). History of number 
packs/day, number of smoking years, and quitting time for former and active smokers must also 
be documented.
Additionally, the investigators will document at screening the patient’s Charlson score via the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Charlson et al 1987 )(Appendix 1). The Charlson Comorbidity 
Index may be used to identify patients with higher risk of COVID-19 progression ( Garibaldi et al
2020) via the COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (online calculator available via: 
https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_predict/). The 14-item Charlson score is based on thepatient’s comorbidities that are associated with mortality: myocardial infarction, congestive heart 
failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes, hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, malignancy, a nd acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human
immunodeficiency virus (online calculator availab le via: https://www.orthotoolkit.com/charlson-
comorbidity-index/). The investigator should record each individual component of the 14-item Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Appendix 1) as well as the overall score. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 12.6.[ADDRESS_226060] be recorded as AEs.
Additionally, demographic data will be collected  for all patients and include sex, age, and race
and/or ethnicity.1 2.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pre ssure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO
2, and body 
temperature) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).
All vital signs will be measured after the patien t has been resting for at least 5 minutes. Blood 
pressure measurements are to be taken in the sa me arm for the duration of the study. Moreover, 
additional vital signs may be performed as needed in case of any cardiac AE.
Additionally, body weight (without shoes) will be recorded at screening, Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, 
Day 60, and day of discharge (applicable); height (without shoes) will be recorded at screening 
only. Body mass index will be calculated whenever weight is recorded.
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clin ically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate measurements, or SpO 2will be MetrioPharm AG

1 2.3 Physical E xaminations 
A complete physical examination will be performed at screening. Physical examinations will be 
performed by a physician. The complete physical examination includes head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and 
musculoskeletal systems. 
A limited physical examination to verify continue d patient eligibility and to follow-up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed  at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). Symptom-driven, limited physical examinations may be performed as 
clinically indicated during the study (according to SoC).Please note: The limited physical examination on Day 8 (± 3 days) will be collected in all 
patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patient is discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days), these
assessments should only be done if the physician determines during the outpatient visit (ie, at the study site) that the limited physical examination is clinically indicated.
1 2.4 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained locally at screening as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). At screening, the investigator must examine the ECG traces for clinically 
significant abnormalities that could exclude the pat ient from the study. If ECGs are performed at 
unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), findings must be recorded in the eCRF.
ECGs should always be obtained in supi[INVESTIGATOR_190283] ( 5 minutes). An
assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the ECG is considered abnormal, the 
abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be repeated if clinically significant 
abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present. Any ECG considered by [CONTACT_190373]. Moreover, additional ECGs may be obtained as needed in case of any cardiac AE and will be recorded on the eCRF.

at the study site). If the physician determines during the outpatient visit (ie, at the study site) that 
the clinical laboratory assessments are clinically indicated, then the site should arrange to collect 
this assessment.
1 2.6 Adverse Events
Adverse Events
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) 
present at screening will be documented on the medical history eCRF. Changes in these conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syn dromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be 
recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the patient was randomized in the 
study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical 
condition should be reported in the patient’s medical history.
Patients will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with  reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the follow-up period (Day 60).
Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of study completion, is required (if possible) if the AE 
persists. The follow-up should continue until the event resolves (returns to normal or baseline 
values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_190374].
It is understood that if a patient withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be possible for the study site to follow the AE to resolution.
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the event should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).MetrioPharm AG

Page 64of 89Table 7: Classification of Adverse Even ts by [CONTACT_190376] : This category applies to thos e AEs that are clearly and incontr overtibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).
UNLIKELY :This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the study drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be consider ed unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the study drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.
POSSIBLY : This category applies to thos e AEs for which a connection with the study drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reas onable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.
PROBABLY: This category applies to those AE s that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the study drug. An AE may be considered probably  related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be

dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pa ttern of response to the study drug.
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to 
study drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of defi nitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal se quence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_941] k nown characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmenta l or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it disappears or decre ases on cessation or reduction 
in dose and recurs with reexposure  to drug (if rechallenge  occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern of 
response to the study drug.

Page 65of 89Other important medical events that may not be im mediately life-threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judg ment, are considered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the patient and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the spons or’s assessment. If either the sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_102673].
Serious Adverse Event Reporting
An SAE occurring from the time the patient give s informed consent until the end of the follow-
up period (Day 60) or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648] (whichever is longer) must be 
reported to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to 
the sponsor. Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be 
reported within 24 hours the investigator ’s awareness of the event. Notification can be made 
using the dedicated fax line or email for the S yneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group:
xSyneos Health Safety and Pharmacovi gilance fax number: 
xSyneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance email address: 
If the investigator contacts the Syneos Heal th Safety and Pharmacovigilance group by [CONTACT_756], 
then a written report must follow within [ADDRESS_226064] report all additional follow-up
evaluations to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the additional information. All SAEs will be followed up until the 
investigator and sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.
Any SAE that is not resolved by [CONTACT_80221]’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up, if possible, until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is  available), or is shown to not be attributable to 
the study drug or procedures. It is understood that if a patient withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be possible for the st udy site to follow the SAE to resolution.MetrioPharm AG

Suspected Une xpected Serious Adverse Reactions
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be  classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting:
xserious
xunexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the reference safety information in thecurrent version of the IB)
xthere is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study drug
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to the study drug. Syneos Health 
will consider the investigator’s assessment and de termine whether the event meets the criteria for 
being reportable as a 7-day or 15-day safety report. S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life-threatening 
must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the IRBs/IECs (where required) within 7 days 
after Syneos Health/MetrioPharm has first knowledge of them, with a follow-up report (when 
applicable) submitted within a further [ADDRESS_226065] be reported to the 
relevant regulatory authorities and the IRBs/IECs within 15 calendar days after 
Syneos Health/MetrioPharm first has knowledge of them.
Syneos Health is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs  and any other events required to be reported 
in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorit ies and for informing investigators of reportable 
events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes.
Investigators will notify the relevant IRBs/IECs of reportable events within the applicable timeframes.
Pregnancy
WOCBP must have a negative se rum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy 
test before the first dose on Day 1. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated on Day 14 (± 7 days).If the patient is discharged before Day 14, urine pregnancy test at day of discharge should be
done, and urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_226066] at day of
discharge is not required (whichever comes first). Pati ents with a positive pregnancy test will be 
discontinued from study drug. After administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy 
in female patients will be reported until the pa tient completes or withdraws from the study. The 
pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_190416]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to 
Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow up with the patient until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not >30 days after completion of the pr egnancy. (It is understood that if a patient 
withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it ma y not be possible for the study site to follow 
the pregnancy to completion.) The investigator should notify Syneos Health Safety and MetrioPharm AG

1 3 PHARMACOKINETICS
1 3. 1 Pharmacokinetic SamplingBlood samples for PK analysis of MP1032 plasma concentrations will be collected at the time
points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) from a PK subset of approximately 
30 patients (who give optional consent). In summary, PK samples will be collected via sparse sampling from these 30 patients (approximately) in a 2:1 ratio (approximately 20 patients from 
the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approxim ately 10 patients from the placebo group
plus SoC group) to assess the PK of MP1032 on Day 1 (single dose) and Day 7 (steady state). A
total of 16 samples (approximately 4.9 mL per time point for a total of approximately 78.4 mL)
will be collected relative to the first dose on Day [ADDRESS_226068] dose on Day 7. Samples on 
Day 1 and Day 7 will be collected predose (wit hin [ADDRESS_226069] daily dose) and 
postdose at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 8 hours (before next 
dose), and 24 hours before the next morning dose (i f applicable), if possible. Patients who MetrioPharm AG

Final
07-Feb-[ADDRESS_226070] 
Day 7 PK samples collected.
For patients in the PK subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours
before planned study drug administration and w ithin the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administered in fasted state (4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within  the 4 hours before their planned administration, 
study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) 
within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be recorded. The PK samples should be 
collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fa sted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered).
Intravenous cannulas may be used for blood collection to avoid multiple skin punctures, when 
appropriate. Otherwise, blood samp les will be collected by [CONTACT_37277]. The actual date 
and time of each blood sample collection will be  recorded. Sample collections completed outside 
the predefined time windows (windows to be specified in the laboratory manual) will not be 
considered as protocol deviations because actual postdose sampling times will be used for PK 
and statistical analyses.
PK samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory facility (Prolytic GmbH). Details of PK 
blood sample collection, processing (including separation of plasma), storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_190314] a separate laboratory manual.
1 3.2 Pharmacokinetic Analytical Methodology 
The concentration of study drug will be determi ned from the plasma samples using a validated 
analytical method. Details of the method validation and sample analysis will be included with the 
final clinical study report (CSR).
1 4 OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
1 4. 1 Biomarkers Blood samples will be obtained at the visits  specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1)
on Day 1 (before the first study drug administration) and Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and [ADDRESS_226071] be collected on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60
if a patient is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If a patien t is discharged, the study site should arrange an 
outpatient visit (ie, at the study site) to ac commodate the collection of blood samples for 
biomarkers on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60.
Biomarkers will potentially include, but will not be limited to cytokines (eg, C-reactive protein,
IL-1E, IL-6, TNF- Į, and IFN- J) and other coagulation/inflammatory biomarkers (eg, D-dimer 
and ferritin). Samples may be collected at the same time that samples are collected for the
clinical laboratory assessments. Blood samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory facility.MetrioPharm AG

1 5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide further details regarding the definition of 
analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will be 
finalized before any statistical output (eg, DSM B output) is produced. The SAP will serve as a 
companion document to the protocol. The SAP will further describe the statistical analyses. All 
data will be included with the final CSR. 
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS®software version 9.4 or higher 
(® ). 
Summary statistics will be present
ed by [CONTACT_3227]. Continuous and ordinal variables will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_190378] (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum for actual values and change from baseline. Additionally, for ordinal data, the number 
and percentage of patients in each category will  be presented. Binary and categorical variables 
will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_190417].
Statistical tests for comparison between treatments  will be performed using a two-sided alpha 
level of 10%. No adjustment for multiple testing will be applied in this descriptive proof-of-
concept study.
1 5. 1 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary efficacy endpoint “proportion of patients with disease progression on Day 14” is 
assumed to be 10% in the [ADDRESS_226073] us SoC treatment group (Arm A) and 30% in 
the placebo plus SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using the Chi-square test with type I error 
alpha=10% two-sided for this proof-of-concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio, with
114 randomized patients (76 in Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistical power of 83% can be 
achieved. Considering about 5% early study terminations, the necessary sample size to 
randomize results is 120 patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct of the study the early study termination rate is hi gher than the estimated 5%, then an increase in 
the randomized number of patients may be necessary.

include all randomized patients irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature 
discontinuation from study drug/withdrawal from study. The treatment group assignment will be 
designated according to initial randomization. The ITT will serve as the basis for the analysis of 
efficacy and summary of demographics and baseline characteristics.

Page 71of 89The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as follows:
xTreatment: 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC in Arm A and placebo BID plus SoC in Arm 
B. If a patient terminates the study drug, but  still remains in the study and is followed up, 
then the patient will continue to receive either SoC alone or SoC+ additional treatment.These treatments are defined with regards to intercurrent events as ‘other treatments’.
xPopulation: Of all patients defined by [CONTACT_190418]/exclusion criteria, the analysis 
population will include patients who were randomized to study drug (ITT population).
xVariable: A binary variable indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at 
Day 14. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_190245] a score of 2, 3, or 4 on the 
NIAID 8-point ordinal scale.
xIntercurrent events: All events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to 
other treatment before Day 14 will be handled  using the treatment-policy strategy (ie, the
NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of the failure in such patients).
xPopulation-level summary: Common risk difference resulting from the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) test considering the 4 strata out of the combinations of the 
2 randomization stratification factors disease severity (moderate versus severe) and age-
class (aged 65 years versus >65 years) at baseline.
Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_226076]-baseline data 
for patients randomized but not treated will be im puted by [CONTACT_190419] (baseline 
observation carried forward [BOCF]). The comp arison between the treatment groups will be 
performed on the ITT after imputation of missing values using MH test for common riskdifference considering the 4 strata resulting fr om the 2 randomization stratification factors 
disease severity (moderate versus severe) and age-class (aged 65 years versus >65 years). The 
95% confidence intervals will be provided for the risk difference.
Similar MH analyses and presentation of 95% conf idence intervals will be applied to the main 
estimand of the first key secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a binary variable 
indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 28, and the main estimand of 
the second key secondary efficacy endpoint that is defined as a binary variable indicating disease 
resolution (alive and have a scor e of 6, 7 or 8 on NIAID) at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead 
to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to othe r treatment before Day 28 will be handled 
using the treatment-policy strategy for these 2 esti mands (ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will be 
used for definition of the failure or response, re spectively) in such patients. Missing data on Day 
[ADDRESS_226077]-baseline data for patients randomized but not treated will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_190381].
A similar MH approach and presentation of 95% confi dence intervals as described above will be

switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy (ie,
the life status at Day 28 will be considered). No  missing data of life status on Day 28 is expected. 
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of clinical status related to COVID-19 on Day 28 compared with ba seline according to the NIAID 8-point ordinal 
scale, will be compared using the risk difference from the analysis of covariance model withtreatment and the 2 binary stratification factor s (eg, severity and age-class) as independent 
factors and the baseline value of NIAID as independent covariate. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy for this estimand ( ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will be used). 
Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_226078]-bas eline data for patients randomized but not 
treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190381]. The 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the risk difference.
The population for all above described estimands of the key secondary endpoints is the ITT.
Sensitivity analyses for the main estimands of  the primary and key efficacy endpoints will be 
performed by [CONTACT_190336] 14 or Day 28 as failure or non-resolution for the 
binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190420] 8-point ordinal scale.
All above analyses for the main estimands of the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be repeated on PPS as supportive analysis. Additionally, for the primary efficacy 
and binary key secondary efficacy endpoints l ogistic regression model with treatment and the 
2 stratification factors as covariables will be performed on the ITT. Further estimands for the
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoi nts will be provided in the SAP.
The proportion of patients with disease resolution at Day 14 and the all-cause mortality rate at Day 14 and Day 60 will be analyzed using simi lar MH methods as described above for Day 28. 
Cumulative proportion of patients with disease resolution will be plotted by [CONTACT_5586].

clinical status improvement from baseline on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale (ie, an 
improvement of at least 1 category) at Day 14 a nd Day 28 will be analyzed using a logistic 
regression with consideration of the 2 stratification factors.
The time to recovery of all at baseline present COVID-19 symptoms (stuffy or runny nose, sore 
throat, red or irritated eyes, shortness of br eath, cough, low energy or tiredness, muscle or body

Total number of days in ICU, duration of inva sive mechanical ventilation, and duration of 
ECMO will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_190383] 
90% confidence intervals and additionally by [CONTACT_190421]. To consider death 
sufficiently unfavorable in these measures, in case of death the duration of the respective

patient’s best interest, or the patient has any condition or critical illness,
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], th at will not allow the protocol to be 
followed safely.
Planned Sample Size: The primary efficacy endpoint “proportio n of patients with disease progression on 
Day 14” is assumed to be 10% in the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC treatment 
group (Arm A) and 30% in the placebo pl us SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using 
the Chi -square test with type I error alpha =10% two-sided for this proof-of-
concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio , with 114 randomized patients (76 in 
Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistical power of 83% can be achieved. Considering 
about 5% early study terminations, the ne cessary sample size to randomize results 
is 120 patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct of 
the study the early study termination rate is  higher than the estimated 5%, then an 
increase in the random ized number of patients may be necessary. 
Sample size estimation was performed using nQuery 8, Version [IP_ADDRESS].
A subset of randomized patients will be consented for the collection of blood 
samples for PK measurements. The PK  subset consists of approximat ely 
20patients from the 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC group and approximately 
10patients from the placebo plus SoC gr oup, up to a total of approximately 
30patients.
Study Drug, Dose, and 
Mode of Administration:All randomized patients will receive stu dy drug from Day [ADDRESS_226113] ing to the randomization scheme. Patients 
will receive 6 capsules in the morning and 6 capsules in the evening (ie, 
approximately every [ADDRESS_226114] 8 hours apart) according to their ra ndomized treatment arm assignment as 
described below: 
xArm A: MP1032 (300 mg [6 × MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg]
BID) for oral administration
xArm B: 6 × placebo capsules ( ie, matching MP1032 hard gelatin 
capsules 50 mg) BID for oral administration
Standard of Care Each site will treat all patients with So C for the duration of the study. The 
selected SoC will be used in accordance with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s SoC procedures and 
may include drugs under an emergency use authorization.
Treatment Duration: Patients will be treated with study drug fo r 28 consecutive days (unless study drug 
is discontinued for safety reasons) to pr ovide a fixed duration of treatment across 
all patients. For patients discharged early, study visits at Day 8, Day 14, Day 21,

Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:Analysis Sets:
Intention -to-Treat Set
The Intention-to-Treat (ITT) set, correspond with randomized set, will include all
randomized patients irrespective of any devi ation from the protocol or premature 
discontinuation from study drug/withdrawal from study. The treatment group 
assignment will be designated acco rding to initial randomization. The ITTwill
serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy and summary of demographics and 
baseline characteristics.
Per Protocol SetThe Per Protocol 
Set (PPS) will include all patients from ITT who received at 
least [ADDRESS_226118] any major protocol deviations 
impactin g the efficacy assessments. The PPS will be used for supportive analyses 
of efficacy.
Safety SetThe Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized patients who receive
dat least 
1 dose of study drug. The treatment group assignment in the SS will be defined by
[CONTACT_190428]. The SS will be used for the analysis of safety.
PK Analysis Set
The PK Analysis Set (PKS)  will include all the patients who have been 
administered active study drug and have  at least 1 postdose evaluable plasma 
concentrat ion after Day 1 dose.
Analyses: 
The estimand s for the primary efficacy endpoint and for the 4 key secondary 
endpoints comparing the 2 treatment groups  will be tested with consideration of a 
two-sided alpha of 10% on each test -level on the ITT. Additionally, 95% 
confidence intervals will be provided . Also, the treatment comparison with 
regards to the other efficacy e ndpoints will be performed using a two- sided alpha 
level of 10%.
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as a binary 
variable indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 14. 
Intercurrent events that lead to study dr ug discontinuation and/or switch to other 
treatment before Day 14 will be handled using the treatment -policy strategy (ie, 
the NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of th e failure in such 
patients). Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_226119]- baseline data for patients  randomized but not 
treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190429] e baseline value (baseline observation 
carried forward, BOCF). The compar ison between the treatment groups MetrioPharm AG

Page 15of 80considering all randomized patients after having imputed missing values will be 
performed using Mantel -Haenszel (MH) test for risk difference considering the [ADDRESS_226120] ratification factors disease severity 
(moderate versus severe) and age -class (ag ed 65 years versus >65 years) at 
baseline.
Similar MH analyses will be conducted for the main estimand of the first key 
secondary efficacy endpoint, which is defined as a binary variable indicating 
disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at Day 28, and the main 
estimand for the second key secondary ef ficacy endpoint, which is defined as a 
binary variable indicating disease resolution (alive and have a score of 6, 7 or 8 
on NIAID) at Day 28. Intercurrent events  that lead to study drug discontinua tion 
and/or switch to other treatment befo re Day 28 will be handled using the 
treatment -policy strategy for these estimands ( ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will 
be used for definition of the failure or response, respectively) in such patients. 
Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_226121] key seco ndary efficacy endpoint, which is the all-cause 
mortality at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation 
and/or switch to other treatment befo re Day 28, will be handled using the 
treatment -policy strategy (ie, th e life status at Day 28 will be considered). No 
missi ng data of life status on Day 28 is expected. 
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of 
clinical status related to COVID -19 on Day 28 compared with baseline according 
to the NIAID 8 -point ordinal scale, will be comp ared using the risk difference 
from the analysis of co variance model with treatment and the 2 binary 
stratification factors (ie, severity and age -class) as independent factors and the 
baseline value of NIAID as independent c ovariate. Intercurrent events that lead to 
study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be 
handled using the treatment -policy strategy for these es timands (ie, the NIAID 
score at Day 28 will be used). Missing data on Day 28 will be imputed by 
[CONTACT_190402]. 
Sensitivity analyses for the main estima nds of the primary and key efficacy 
estimands will be performed by [CONTACT_190403] 14 or Day 28 as 
failure or non- resolution for the binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190430] 8 -
point ordinal scale.
All above analyses for the main estima nds of the primary efficacy and key 
secondary efficacy endpoints will be repe ated on PPS as supportive analysis. 
Additio nally, for the primary efficacy and binary key secondary efficacy 
endpoints logistic regression model with tr eatment and the 2 stratification factors 
as covariables will be performed on the ITT.
The proportion of patients with disease resolution at Day 14 and the all-cause 
mortality rate at Day 14 and Day 60 will be  analyzed using similar MH methods MetrioPharm AG

resolution will be plotted by [CONTACT_5586].
A similar analysis of covariance approach as described above for Day 28 will be 
applied for the analysis of the chan ge of clinical status related to COVID -19 on 
Day 14 compared with baseline on the NIAI D 8 point ordinal scale. The endpoint 
considering the proportion of p atients requiring invasive vent ilation (mechanical 
ventilator and/or ECMO) or who are not alive, the proportion of patients in each 
NIAID category, and the proportion of patients alive and testing negative for 
COVID -19 on Day 14, Day 28, and Day 60, respectively, will be compared 
betwee n the treatment groups using MH tes t. Overall survival, time to (first) 
improvement of at least 1 category on the NIAID scale and total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190299] (from baseline to discharge; with death censored on last day of the 
observed period - at Day 28 or Day 60, respectively - depending on the analyses) 
will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and will be compared 
between treatment groups using log -rank tests. Additionally, Cox proportional 
hazards model will be applied with treatment and the 2 stratification factors as
covariables.
The odds ratio between MP1032 and SoC and placebo and SoC for the number of 
patients with clinical status improveme nt from baseline on the NIAID 8 -point 
ordinal scale (ie, an improvement of at least 1 category) at Da y 14 and Day 28 
will be analyzed using a logistic regr ession with consideration of the 
2 stratification factors.
The time to recovery of all at baseline present COVID- 19 symptoms (stuffy or 
runny nose, sore throat, red or irritated eyes, shortness of breath, cough, low 
energy or tiredness, muscle or body aches, headache, chills or shivering, feeling 
hot or feverish, nausea, and number of times  of vomit, times of diarrhea, sense of 
smell, sense of taste in the last 24 hours) will be presented by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier 
estimates and figure. The ch ange from baseline will be presented in shift tables
for each single symptom , with the number and percentage of subjects in each 
category at post -baseline assessment time-point compared to baseline for each 
treatment group .
Total number of days in ICU, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
duration of ECMO will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_190338] 90% confidence intervals and additionally by [CONTACT_190431]. To consider death sufficiently unfavorable in these measures, in case of 
death the duration of the respective measure will be considered with the longest 
duration possible (eg, if a summary of the first 28 days is presented, then dea th 
before Day 28 will be considered as duration 28 days, and if the summary also 
includes follow -up period until Day 60, then death before Day 60 will be 
considered as duration of 60 days). Both summaries (up to Day 28 and up to 
Day 60) will be provided.
For HRQoL assessments at discharge and Day 60, the EQ index value and the EQ 
VAS, both based on the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire will be calculated and 
summarized by [CONTACT_3232].  Additionally, change at Day 60 from

5. 1 Background on COVID- 19 On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organi zation (WHO) was informed of a cluster of 
cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in . Severe 
acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_190249] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causative 
virus by [CONTACT_190344] 07 January 2020 ( WHO 2020a ). Coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) was identified as the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-[ADDRESS_226129] 2020, the WHO estimated the case fatality ratio, which estimates the 
proportion of deaths among confirmed cases, to vary from 0.1% to >25%. Whereas, the true severity of COVID-19 as measured by [CONTACT_190345], which estimates the proportion of deaths among all infected individuals, is estimated to be approximately 0.5% to 1% 
(WHO 2020b). In a more recent summary of Levin et al (2020) it could be clearly shown that the 
infection fatality ratio is highly age dependent, being in average as low as 0.004% for patients 
younger than 35 and as high as 28.3% in patients at the age of 85 and older.
Presentations of COVID-19 range from an asymptomatic course or mild symptoms to severe 
illness and mortality. Common symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or 
difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, 
congestion or runny nose, naus ea or vomiting, and diarrhea ( Cennimo 2021 ). Less common 
symptoms are sputum production, malaise, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], and neurologic symptoms, such as altered mental state. While most patients with COVID-[ADDRESS_226130] 
common serious manifestation of COVID-19. Further, major deterioration such as an acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) can lead to the imperative need of an intensive care unit 
(ICU) and might even require mechanical ventilation via intubation. Other complications that 
might occur during the course of the disease include: sepsis, acute kidney injury, thyrotoxicosis, and neurologic manifestations such as myasthenia gravis. The elderly, as well as patients with pre-existing chronic conditions (eg, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], 
diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, immune system deficiencies, liver disease, and cardiac 
diseases, etc), seem to be more vulnerable to a severe disease course.
Although, to date, knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and corresponding COVID-19 is still limited, 
it seems to be clear that the course of the disease, and particularly severe complications, are MetrioPharm AG

Page 25of 80based on an overshooting immune response. De tails on and a deeper understanding of how the 
virus causes such a reaction will be a cen tral part of future investigations (Hillienhof 2020 ).
Patients with COVID-19 show increased levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines (Rothan 
and By[CONTACT_41386] 2020 ). From a pathophysiological point of view, in severe cases the viral 
infection seems to trigger an excessive immune reaction in the host, a so-called cytokine storm, 
leading to extensive tissue damage. A key player of this mechanism is interleukin (IL)-6. IL-[ADDRESS_226131] viral infection of the endothelial cells and diffuse endothelial inflammation in the whole 
body ( Varga et al 2020).
Recently the first vaccines to prevent COVID-[ADDRESS_226132] been approved by [CONTACT_177015], including 
the Food and Drug Administration in the [LOCATION_002] and the European Medicines Agency in 
Europe, and numerous further vaccine projects are still under development. Nonetheless, it will 
take years until the majority of people will be vaccinated and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_190258]. Hence, there is stil l an urgent need for therapeutic agents to cure 
COVID-19 and/or ameliorate its symptoms. Among the antiviral treatment options, remdesivir has shown to be effective in reducing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190324] ( Beigel et al 2020 ); however, in the meantime the WHO has issued a conditional 
recommendation against the use of remdesivir in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190260] ( WHO 2020c ) Among immune modulating drugs low-dosed dexamethasone could 
significantly lower the incidence of deaths wh en applied at a later time point of the disease 
course ( WHO-REACT 2020 ) but is not recommended early in disease or in patients with mild 
symptoms only (WHO 2020c ). Hence, there is still no antiviral treatment or otherwise effective 
curative agent that could really lower the burden of this pandemic. Thus, COVID-19 still 
presents an urgent unmet medical need.
5.2 Background on MP 1032, Including Benefit Risk Assessment 
MP1032 is a purely synthetic, new chemical entity. MP1032 is a mono sodium salt derived from 
the aromatic system phthalazinedione, containing an additional amino group. MP1032 is water-soluble and hydrophilic.
The primary mechanism of action of MP1032 is assumed to be a reactive oxygen species (ROS)
scavenging action in inflamed tissues (ie, tiss ues that experience oxidative stress). A unique 
pharmacologic property of MP1032 is that the ROS-scavenging function of the molecule is only 
activated in tissues with pathologically high ROS concentrations (oxidative stress), which is the 
case in inflamed tissue. By [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-establishing a physiologic redox balance in activated immune cells, MP1032 is putatively inhibiting nuclear factor-kappa B activation. Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B is expected to lead to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6 and TNF-Į) (Gloire et al 2006 ). In addition, MP1032 is a specific inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribose-
polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARP1 is a nuclear enzyme involved in inflammation ( Ke et al 2019 ).MetrioPharm AG

Page 26of 80Further identified potential targets are the kinases human Aurora-B, human Aurora-C, 
serine/threonine-protein kinase, tyrosin e kinase, and the metalloprotease TNF-Į-converting 
enzyme —however, at relatively high molarity only. Therefore, the administration of MP1032 (as 
shown nonclinically, both in vitro and in vivo), in pathological conditions only, leads to a 
reduced concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines without completely blocking them. In 
addition to this broadly anti-inflammatory potential, MP1032 exhibits direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 that could be shown by a clear and dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-
CoV-2 reproduction in Vero B4 cells (African green monkey [ Chlorocebus aethiops ] kidney 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_190261]) ( Schumann et al 2020 ).
MP1032 could attenuate prolonged virus replication by [CONTACT_190346] 
(Khomich et al 2018 ) and/or by [CONTACT_190347]-ribosylation of  the viral nucleocapsid protein via 
PARP1 inhibition ( Grunewald et al 2018 ). PARP1 inhibitors also have been suggested for the 
treatment of COVID-19 ( Curtin et al 2020).
Based on the basic chemical mechanism of MP1032 as an electron donor to ROS, the molecule 
acts similarly across a wide range of species and is thus not an agent with a high degree of 
species specificity. Further, MP1032 has no specific immune-system targets as known from 
various biologicals. MP1032 is not expressed by [CONTACT_190406] (cells) or using raw 
materials of human or animal origin.
Nonclinical Studies
In vivo safety studies showed no evidence of neurotoxic potential or negative 
cardiohemodynamic effects; no local intolerance was observed. There was no dose-limiting or 
target organ toxicity and no s ubstance-related findings in histopathology in rats or dogs. 
However, after [ADDRESS_226133] dose (1000 mg/kg/d), liver organ weight was elevated compared with that of controls and histopathologically associated with hepatocellu lar hypertrophy. This finding was not considered 
adverse because of its adaptive character, as hi stopathological changes were not present at the 
end of the recovery period (ie, effect was reversible after 8 weeks).
In reproduction toxicity studies on fertility, ea rly embryonic, and embryo-fetal development, no 
pathological effects were found. On the basis of resu lts from [ADDRESS_226134] dose (300 mg/kg) of MP1032. No pulmonary effects 
have been observed in any of the long-term animal toxicity studies. The maximum plasma levels 
reached in humans are over 1000 times (oral) lower than for the abovementioned dose. Thus, 
pulmonary effects are not considered a potential risk for patients and volunteers.
Emesis sporadically occurred in various repeat-dose toxicology studies in dogs; the emesis was 
present in the dogs more often at the high doses of 150 mg/kg twice daily (BID) intravenous than 
at 125 mg/kg BID (oral). The lowest experimental oral dose inducing emesis was 25 mg/kg BID MetrioPharm AG

Page 27of 80(oral) in dogs, corresponding to 1.8 g (oral; conversion based on human-equivalent dose) for a 
65-kg human. Dogs are well known to be susceptibl e to emesis; in addition, the maximum doses 
administered in humans are [ADDRESS_226135] with safety margins between 2 to 20 times. Therefore, a phototoxic risk for patients seems to be unlikely.
Further, a slight to moderate increase in serum cr eatinine level combined with a slight decrease 
of kidney weights was observed after a 90-day treatment period in male mice in a dose-range 
finding, repeated dose (oral) toxicity study at hi gh dosed animals. However, as there were no 
associated histopathological findings in kidneys of th e respective animals, this effect is also not 
considered to be adverse in nature. In the sc ope of extensive laboratory controls in the clinical 
studies completed so far, no respective treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) have been 
reported. 
The probability of pharmacokin etic interactions of MP1032 regarding the inhibition or induction 
of Cytochrome P450 or inhibition of well-known drug transporters is rather low. However, based 
on in vitro experiments there are hints that a combination of MP1032 and dexamethasone might 
act (supra-)additive regarding the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (ie, IL-6). Thus, 
currently, a potential drug-drug interaction of  MP1032 and dexamethasone regarding their anti-
inflammatory action cannot be excluded.
For further details of the completed nonclinical studies conducted with MP1032, readers are 
referred to the current version of the investigator’s brochure (IB).

Page 28of 80Among the subjects enrolled in MP1032 studies, 146 subjects were administered MP1032 orally. 
Among them, 24 male subjects participated as healthy volunteers in the Phase I study, while both 
male (n=89) and female (n=33) patients with psoria sis participated in the Phase II studies. The 
age of participants administered MP1032 ranged from [ADDRESS_226137] repeated dose was 300 mg MP1032 BID, applied to both healthy volunteers (7 days) and 
patients with psoriasis (3 months).
No serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in any of the subjects administered MP1032.No deaths occurred in the scope of the MP1032 clinical development program.
MP1032 was well tolerated in all studies, and safe ty analyses did not reveal any clinically 
important safety issues. In general, incidence, intensity, causality, and spreading of TEAEs over 
system organ classes (SOCs) were comparable between groups. In the recent Phase II study, the incidence, intensity, relationship to investigat ional medicinal product (IMP), and causality to 
IMP for adverse events (AEs) were even lower for both MP1032 dose groups compared with 
those of the placebo group and statistically significantly lower for the [ADDRESS_226138] be considered as 
common (1/100 to <1/10); while neutropenia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], abdominal pain upper, fat igue,
feeling drunk, influenza-like illness, cystitis , and headache can be regarded as uncommon 
(1/1,000 to <1/100). Regarding the general spread ing of AEs over SOCs and the comparison 
between groups, currently none of them can be considered a significant clinical risk.
Regarding efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, the MP1032-CT02 study 
showed that after only 6 weeks of treatment, there was a clinically meaningful response in 
patients who entered the study with moderate to  severe psoriasis with a Psoriasis Area and 
Severity Index (PASI) score of 10 to 20 and achieved the appropriate drug-exposure levels. 
Hence, only patients with a PASI score of 10 to 20 at baseline were randomized to the 
MP1032-CT04 study. After 12 weeks, a significant PASI reduction could be shown in the 
300 mg MP1032 BID group compared with those in the placebo group; however, this only occurred in a prespecified subgroup of patients with PASI 15 at baseline.

Page 29of 805.3 Risk Management of MP 1032 
In the scope of planning and conducting future clinical studies, all potential risks associated with 
MP1032 will be considered, and measures will be taken as applicable. 
On the basis of limitations in the amount of preclinical and clinical data available so far, MP1032 
shall not be administered to patients for >[ADDRESS_226139] already been described in the clinical program so far, as well as 
any suspected AEs arising from risks associated with preclinical data will be evaluated 
extensively on a case-by-case base during ongoing and/or upcoming studies.
Because of potential phototoxicity, patients in upcoming studies will be advised to avoid strong 
sun exposure (sunbathing) and strong ultraviolet exposure. Furthermore, the use of sunscreen will be recommended when spending an extended period outdoors. It should be ensured that 
exposure to ultraviolet light (eg, from lasers in procedures) is limited while the patient is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].
To avoid risks associated with potential low eff icacy in serious and life-threatening conditions, 
such as COVID-19, MP1032 is only recommended to be used as add-on to standard of 
care (SoC) until a respective proof-of-concept is demonstrated.
As dexamethasone is expected to be part of SoC in most institutions treating patients with 
COVID-19 investigators should be aware that a (supra-)additive synergism between MP1032 
and dexamethasone regarding their anti-i nflammatory activity cannot be excluded.
Further details regarding known or anticipated risks,  as well as reasonably anticipated AEs for 
MP1032 may be found in the current version of the IB.

leads to a reduced concentration of pathologica lly increased pro-inflammatory cytokines without 
completely blocking them. This downregulation to physiologic levels was shown in vivo and in 
vitro for IL- 1ȕ, IL -6, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF- Į in activated macrophages/neutrophils; most data 
are available on the downregulation of IL-[ADDRESS_226141] treatments, 
MP1032 may prevent and/or ameliorate any overstimulation of the immune system in the course 
of a COVID-19, thereby [CONTACT_190349][INVESTIGATOR_190262]. At the same time, the probability of a severe 
course of the disease is reduced because of a poten tial direct antiviral capacity of MP1032. This 
combinative approach makes MP1032 a promising ca ndidate for the treatment of COVID-19. In 
addition, synergistic effects may be obtained  when using MP1032 as an add-on to other 
medicinal products currently under investigat ion for treating patients with COVID-19.
There is a substantial medical need for preventive and/or therapeutic options for the COVID-19
pandemic. COVID-19 is a viral disease with a considerable mortality rate that is not yet 
completely determined and it significantly aff ects healthcare systems. Considering the strong 
safety profile and good tolerability of MP1032 based on both preclinical and clinical data, 
combined with the signals of meaningful therap eutic effects of MP1032, it is justified that a 
proof-of-concept for MP1032 in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is started.
As such, this proof-of-concept study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of MP1032 
plus SoC versus placebo plus SoC treatment in ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_190263]-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-2 infection. Additional exploratory 
objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK) of MP1032 in  a PK subset of patients and the effect of 
MP1032 on biomarker levels.
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, resulting in capacity 
issues at many medical facilities and concerns about the safety of healthcare providers caring for 
these seriously sick patients. Consequently, th is study is designed to minimize the burden on 
clinical sites, including minimizing the number of required assessments and interventions. To allow close monitoring and oral administration, the intended patient population shall include 
only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374]-19 that do not  require intubation at the time of screening 
and/or randomization. Only adults shall be included. Additionally, pregnant and breastfeeding 
women shall be excluded.
The study drugs will be indistinguishable to blinded study personnel to limit bias in study 
assessments. Most interventions and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with the 
schedule dictated by [CONTACT_190350]. An inde pendent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be established 
by [CONTACT_190407] (as per the 
DMC charter) throughout the study to ensure the safety of patients and review overall study
conduct.MetrioPharm AG

Page 35of 80This study consists of 3 periods: (1) screening, (2) treatment, and (3) follow-up. During the 
screening period, each potential patient (or pati ent’s legally acceptable representative) will 
provide informed consent before starting any study-specific procedures. The randomization of 
patients to treatment groups will be perform ed centrally by [CONTACT_190331]-response 
system (IWRS) using a randomization scheme that will be developed by [CONTACT_161698], 
independent statistician. During the treatment period, randomized patients will be provided theirassigned treatment and assessments according to th e protocol. All patients will be treated for 
28 days unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue treatment at home on the day-of-discharge; for these patients, treatmen t compliance will be conducted via a diary. If 
the patient does not feel comfortable to complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the 
patient with the option to be called, twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is taken as instructed. The treatment period will end with the Day 28 (End of Treatment Visit) assessments. The follow-up period will consist of Day 60 (Follow-up Visit) assessments.
Please note: Patients will be assessed while hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. For patients discharged early, study 
visits at Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, and Day [ADDRESS_226147] be performed as an outpatient visit (ie, at the 
study site). Patients discharged early will continue to receive study drug through Day 28.
The study duration for an individual patient will be as follows:
xScreening period: up to 7 days
xTreatment period: 28 consecutive days (ie, Day 1 to Day 28)
xFollow-up period: 32 days after Day 28 (ie, Day 60)
As such, the approximate study duration (including screening and the follow-up period) for an 
individual patient is up to 67 days (±3 days).
An independent DMC will be established by [CONTACT_3433] e sponsor or designee to review accumulating 
study data at regular intervals (as per the DMC ch arter) throughout the study to ensure the safety 
of patients and review overall study conduct. Th e DMC can recommend in writing to the sponsor 
whether to continue, modify, or stop the clinical study on the basis of safety considerations (see 
Section 15.8 for further details).
No interim analysis is planned.
7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC 
versus placebo plus SoC treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190265]-19, the disease caused by [CONTACT_7544]-CoV-2 infection. 
This study will be executed during a worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 that has resulted in 
capacity issues at many medical facilities. Additionally, the highly contagious nature of 
COVID-19 (compounded by a shortage of personal protective equipment) has caused concerns MetrioPharm AG 
MP1032MP1032-CT05 
Final
07-Feb-[ADDRESS_226148] interventions 
and assessments may be accomplished in conjunction with SoC, without requiring additional 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190266].
The dose, dosing regimen, and duration of trea tment planned for this study (300 mg MP1032 
BID for 28 days) were selected on the basis of:
xThe highest repeated dose was 300 mg MP1032 BID applied to both healthy volunteers 
(7 days) and psoriasis patients (3 months). MP1 032 was well tolerated in all studies and 
safety analyses did not reveal any clinically important safety issues (see the current version of the IB for further information).
xAcute treatment for symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_190267] [ADDRESS_226149] duration of time included 
in the WHO R&D Blueprint for COVID-19 (WHO 2020d ).
All patients will be treated for 28 days (unless the study drug is discontinued for safety reasons)to provide a fixed duration of treatment across all patients. As it is impractical to require the 
study site to continue to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190268], if the patient is 
discharged home before Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of 
the assigned blinded study drug kit( s) to take home along with instructions on how to continue 
treatment at home on the day-of-discharge. Any patient who is discharged during the study should complete the day-of-discharge assessments before release from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190269] ( Table 1). For patients discharged early, study visits at Day 8, 
Day 14, Day 21, and Day [ADDRESS_226150] be performed as an outpatient visit (ie, at the study site). 
Patients who progress to the use of an invasive ventilation (mechanical ventilator and/or ECMO) or who can no longer swallow the study drug (> 2 days [ie, 2-day interruption is acceptable]) 
must discontinue the study drug; but whenever possible, the study assessments will be performed 
on Day 8, Day 14, Day 21, Day 28, and Day 60.
This proof-of-concept study will neither incl ude pregnant nor breastfeeding females. In 
reproduction toxicity studies of MP1032 on fertili ty and early embryonic as well as on embryo-
fetal development, no pathological effects were found. Genotoxicity testing as well as the 
repeated dose toxicity studies (up to 12 months in  dogs and 6 months in rats) did not indicate any 
toxicological effects. Hence, MP1032 is considered as IMP with unlikely human 
teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy (see the current version of the IB for more 
information). However, due to the early clinical stage of development, only women who are MetrioPharm AG

only 1 time.
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Patients 
Patients who terminate the study before Day 28 wi ll be asked to complete the day-of-discharge 
study procedures. Patients who terminate the stud y after Day 28 will be asked to complete the 
Day 60 study procedures. Please note: It is expected that patients who discontinue the study drug 
early remain in the study, whenever possible, until the completion of the Day [ADDRESS_226168] Day 28.
Once a patient is withdrawn from the study, the patient may not return to the study.
A patient may voluntarily withdraw or be withdra wn from the study at any time for the following 
reasons: 
xpatient withdrawal of consent (at any time, a patient's participation in the study may be
terminated at his/her request) 
xlost to follow-up: the patient stopped comi ng for visits, and study personnel were unable 
to contact [CONTACT_102]. 
Please note: In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (eg, telephone calls, letter to the patient’s last known mailing address, or local equivalent methods). In cases where the patient’s LAR provides informed consent on behalf of the patient, the study site should attempt 
to contact [CONTACT_55639]. Additionally, the study site should attempt to regain contact [CONTACT_190434]/LAR at the time of informed consent. These contact [CONTACT_190357]’s medical record s.
The reason and date for patient withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
Additionally, the sponsor or DMC may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or 
other reasons aligned with good clinical practice (GCP). This study may be terminated at the MetrioPharm AG

authorized personnel only. In the pharmac y, both MP1032 capsules and matching placebo 
capsules must be stored in the primary and/or secondary packaging at room temperature (15°C to 
25°C [59°F to 77°F]) and protected from light. If the patient is discharged home before Day 28,the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study drug 
kit(s) to take home along with in structions on the day-of-discharge.
Further details of the blinded study drug kits will be described in a Pharmacy Manual.
9.2 Dosage Schedule 
All randomized patients will receive study drug from Day 1 to Day 28 according to their 
assigned treatment and according to the randomization scheme. 
Please note: Patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] 28 days of consecutive treatment with study
drug are not eligible for additional treatments with  study drug. Patients will receive 6 capsules in 
the morning and 6 capsules in the evening (ie, approximately every [ADDRESS_226170] 8 hours apar t) according to their randomized treatment arm 
assignment as described below: 
xArm A: MP1032 (300 mg [6 × MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg] BID) for oral 
administration
xArm B: 6 × placebo capsules (ie, matching MP1032 hard gelatin capsules 50 mg) BID for 
oral administration 
In Arm A, the planned total daily dose of MP1032 is 600 mg. In Arm B, the planned total daily 
dose of MP1032 is 0 mg.
Study drug will be administered to each patient wi th water (ad libitum) for oral administration.
For all patients (except on Day 1 and Day 7 for patients in the PK subset): Patients should not eat 
within the [ADDRESS_226171] the date and time of dosing (recorded as th e time when the first capsule is administered).MetrioPharm AG

Page 43of 80For patients in the PK subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours
before planned study drug administration and w ithin the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administered in fasted state ( 4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within  the 4 hours before their planned administration, 
study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) 
within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be recorded. The PK samples should be collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fa sted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered).
Any missed dose study drug may be administered as soon as possible and the next scheduled 
dose may be administered according to the planned schedule as long as the doses are at least 6 to 
8 hours apart. If study drug administration is interrupted for >[ADDRESS_226172] their

9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
Randomization 
The randomization of patients to treatment groups will be performed centrally by [CONTACT_190358] 
a randomization scheme that will be produced by [CONTACT_161698], independent statistician. During 
the randomization process, IWRS will assign a randomization number. Each patient will be 
assigned one kit number at randomization and a se cond kit number at the Day 14 visit. The study 
drug kits will contain the respective blinded tr eatment available at the study site. Further 
information on IWRS process will be provided in the IWRS Manual.
Approximately 120 patients will be randomly assigned (2:1) as follows: 
xArm A (300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC): approximately 80 patients
xArm B (placebo BID plus So C): approximately 40 patients
The stratification factor for randomization will include baseline COVID-19 severity (moderate 
versus severe) and age- class (aged 65 years versus >65 years). COVID -19 severity will be 
determined using the following criteria:
xModerate COVID-19:
oPositive SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_226173] 
oSymptoms of moderate illness with COVID-19, which could include any 
symptom of mild illness or shortness of breath with exertionMetrioPharm AG

oNo criteria met for critical COVID-19
To standardize the assessment of COVID-19 severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO 2, and heart rate will 
be measured when the patient is on room air at sea level (ie, no supplemental oxygen, if possible) 
and at rest for at least [ADDRESS_226175] the information from each patient at the same time each day (±1 hour). 
Please note: Patients who are receiving oxygen therapy at baseline for a chronic condition (eg, 
emphysema, COPD, PAH, IPF, etc) must be considered as having severe COVID-19 (unless the 
patient meets the definition for critical COVID-19). For questions related to COVID-[ADDRESS_226176] the medical monitor.
Blinding
The study is double-blinded. Study drug will be iden tical in appearance and labeled in a blinded 
manner. All patients (and their LARs), investigators, and all study staff involved in the conduct of the study (including sponsor personnel or sponsor designees), including data management and biostatistics, will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
Exception: An unblinded, independent statistician  will be assigned to produce the randomization 
schedule and unblinded tables, figures, and listings  for the DMC. The unblinded statistician will 
not otherwise participate in study procedures.
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given patient because of AEs or 
concerns for the patient’s safety or well -being, the investigator may break the randomization 
code for the patient via the IWRS, by [CONTACT_190359]. The 
investigator is responsible for notifying the medical monitor and/or sponsor of such an event as soon as possible. The unblinding and its cause will also be documented in the eCRF.
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a gi ven patient’s study drug, that patient will be 
discontinued from the study drug unless there are ethical reasons for that patient not to be 
discontinued; approval from the sponsor’s medical monitor must be obtained in such instances.MetrioPharm AG

During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the administration of the study drug will be performed by [CONTACT_093] 
(or qualified blinded designee) to ensure comp liance. If the patient is discharged home before 
Day 28, the study team will provide the patient with the remainder of the assigned blinded study 
drug kit(s) to take home along with instructions to  continue treatment at home; for these patients, 
treatment compliance will be conducted via a diar y. If the patient does not feel comfortable to 
complete the diary, the site will alternatively provide the patient with the option to be called, twice a day, to confirm that the study drug is ta ken as instructed. Patients are to be reminded of 
the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining th e prescribed interval between doses.
Investigators will maintain records that adequate ly document that the patients were provided

order for the patient to be randomized on Da y 1. If the patient has a previous confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 (with in 7 days of Day  1), the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_226183] RT-PCR assay. The result of the 
COVID-19 tests (positive/negative) mu st be documented in the eCRF. Further details will be described in the laboratory manual. Please note: If COVID-19 tests are 
performed at unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), find ings (ie, positive/negative result)  must be recorded in the eC RF.
e. Not all assessments will be able to be perf ormed if the Day 60/Early Termination visit is conducted via a telephone/virtual call (the patient’s caregiver may assist during 
the telephone/virtual call). If the assessment  can be conducted via a telephone/virtu al call, the study site should record the details; otherwise, the missed assessment will
not be considered a protocol deviation. All efforts should be made to collect clinical laboratory assessments on Day 14 (± 2 days) and Day 28 (± 3 days). Please note: In 
cases in which the patient is deem ed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee  must make every effort to regain contact w ith the patient (eg, telephone calls, letter to 
the patient’s last known mailing address, or local equivalent methods). In cases wher e the patient’s LAR provides informed cons ent on behalf of the patient, the stud y site 
should attempt to contact [CONTACT_55639].  Additionally, the study site should attempt to regain contac t with the patient using the alt ernative contact [CONTACT_190438]/LAR at the time of informed cons ent. These contact [CONTACT_190439]’s medical records.
f. Demographics will include sex, age, and race and/or ethnicity.
g. Medical/surgical medical history includes all active and chronic diseases (eg, asthma and COPD), and any di seases diagnosed in  the past 1 year (before screening) that the 
investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-existing conditions presen t at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing 
(Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Medical history w ill include documentation of social be haviors, including use of toba cco, nicotine (including use of electronic 
cigarettes), and soft or hard drugs (including cannabis), as w ell as alcohol consumption, if applicable. Smoking history also mu st be documented as part of medical history 
and includes never, light (<100 cigarettes/ lifetime), active smoker, and former smoke r (quit date). History of number packs/day,  number of smoking years, and quitting 
time for former and active smokers must al so be documented. Additionally, the invest igators will document at screening the pa tient’s Charlson score via the Charlson 
Comorbidity Index (see Section 12.1 for further details).
h. A complete physical examinat ion will be performed at screening. Physical exam inations will be performed by a physician, nurse , or other appropriately trained staff. The 
complete physical examinatio n includes: head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cervical and axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and 
musculoskeletal systems. A lim ited physical examination to verify  continued patient eligibility an d to follow-up regarding any change in medical history will be 
performed at the visits indicated above. Symptom-driven, limited phys ical examinations may be performed as clinically indicated  during the study (according to SoC).
i. Vital signs include systolic an d diastolic blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO 2, and body temperature. All vital signs will be measured after the patient has been 
resting for at least [ADDRESS_226184] ( 5minutes). 
l. For WOCBP, a serum sample for pregnancy testing must be collected at screening and a urine samp le for pregnancy testing must be collected before the first dose on 
Day 1. Pregnancy tests must be negative for the patient to be ra ndomized and treated. A urine pregnancy test will be repeated on Day 14 (± 7 days). If the patient is 
discharged before Day 14, urine preg nancy test at day of discharge should be done an d urine pregnancy test at Day [ADDRESS_226185] at day of discharge is not required (whatever comes first). Patients with a positive pregnancy 
test will be discontinued from study drug.

(single dose) and Day 7 (steady state). A total of [ADDRESS_226186] dose on Day 1 and the firs t dose on Day 7. Samples on Day 1 and Day 7 
will be collected predose (within [ADDRESS_226187] daily dose) and postdose at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60  minutes, 120 minutes, 8 hours (before 
next dose), and 24 hours before the next morning dose (if appli cable), if possible. Patients who pr ovide consent for the PK sampl ing, but are no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190277] 7, will not have Day 7 PK samples collected. 
o. Blood samples to be obtained on Day 1 (before the first study drug administration) and Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 (when possi ble). Blood samples for biomarkers must be 
collected on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60 if  a patient is still hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If a patient is discharged, the study site should at tempt to arrange an outpatient (ie, at the study site)
visit to accommodate the collection of  blood samples for biomarkers on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60. 
p. To standardize the assessment of COVID-19 severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], SpO 2, and heart rate will be measured when the pa tient is on room air at sea level (ie, no 
supplemental oxygen, if possible) and at re st for at least [ADDRESS_226188] the information from  each patient at the same time each day 
(±1 hour).

not required for patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_190279].
s. The limited physical examination and clin ical laboratory assessments on Day 8 (± 3 days) will be collected in all patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patient is 
discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days), these as sessments should only be done  if the physician determines during the outpatient (ie,  at the study site) vi sit that the limited 
physical examination and clin ical laboratory assessme nts are clinically indicated.
t. For all patients (except on Day 1 and Day 7 for patients in th e PK subset): Patients should not e at within the [ADDRESS_226190] the date an d time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered). For patients in the PK 
subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours before planned study drug administration and within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when fe asible. Thus, study drug should be  administered in fasted state (  4 hours), when feasible. However, if a patient has eaten w ithin the 4 hours before their planned 
administration, study drug dosing may proceed.  The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be 
recorded. The PK samples sh ould be collected as planned regardless of the p atients’ fasted/fed state. The study site should r ecord the date and time of dosing (recorded as 
the time when the first capsule is administered).
u. The clinical laboratory assessments on Day 8 and Day 21 will be collected in all patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the pat ient is discharged before Day 21, the 
physician should assess the patient at the outpatient (ie, at the study site) vis it. If the physician determines during the out patient (ie, at the study site) visit that the clinical 
laboratory assessments are clinically  indicated, then the site should arrange to collect this assessment.

Page 58of 8011 .4 Health-related Quality of Life Assessment 
The HRQoL will be assessed via the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized 
questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_190372] a measure of HRQoL that consists of a 
descriptive system and a VAS. The descriptive sy stem consists of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-
care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and a nxiety/depression. The VAS records the patient’s 
self-rated health on a vertical VAS. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient’s own judgment. The pati ent is asked to indicate his/her current health 
state (ie, describe their health “today”). The scores on these 5 dimensi ons can be presented as a 
health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number that describes the patient’s current health state. The EQ-5D-5L questionna ire has been validated in a diverse patient 
population in 6 countries and is available in mu ltiple languages. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is 
suitable for completion by [CONTACT_67022] ( EuroQol Research Foundation 2020 ).
The results of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be  recorded at the visits specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Please note: This assessment will only be performed in 
patients who have been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5107] 60. 
11 .5 COVID- 19 Testing  
Samples for COVID-19 testing will be obtained at the visits specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). At the screening visit, the local laboratory may perform COVID-[ADDRESS_226205] be 
available in order for the patient to be randomized on Day 1. If the patient has a previous 
confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 (within 7 days of Day 1), the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_226206] at screening is not 
required. The result of the COVID-19 tests (positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF
On Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, and Day 60, samples w ill be sent to the central laboratory for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_226207] RT-PCR assay. The result of the COVID-19 tests 
(positive/negative) must be documented in the eCRF. Further details will be described in the laboratory manual. 
Please note: If COVID-19 tests are performed at  unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), 
findings (ie, positive/negative result) must be recorded in the eCRF.
1 2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Safety assessments (medical/surgery history, demographics, prior and concomitant medications, 
vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, clinical laboratory assessments, and AEs) are to be 
performed at the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).

Page 59of 80screening) that the investigator considers clinically significant. Additional pre-existing 
conditions present at the time when informed consent is given and up to the time of first dosing (Day 1) are to be regarded as concomitant. Me dical history will include documentation of social 
behaviors, including use of tobacco, nicotine (incl uding use of electronic cigarettes), and soft or 
hard drugs (including cannabis), as well as a lcohol consumption, if applicable. Smoking history 
also must be documented as part of medical history and includes: never, light 
(<100 cigarettes/lifetime), activ e smoker, and former smoker (quit date). History of number 
packs/day, number of smoking years, and quitting ti me for former and active smokers must also 
be documented. 
Additionally, the investigators will document at screening the patient’s Charlson score via the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index ( Charlson et al 1987). The Charlson Comorbidity Index may be 
used to identify patients with higher risk of COVID-19 progression ( Garibaldi et al 2020) via the 
COVID-19 Inpatient Risk Calculator (online calculator available via: 
https://rsconnect.biostat.jhsph.edu/covid_predict/). The 14-item Charlson score is based on thepatient’s comorbidities that are associated with mortal ity: myocardial infarction, congestive heart 
failure, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, diabetes, hemiplegia or paraplegia, renal disease, malignancy, a nd acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human 
immunodeficiency virus (online calculator availab le via: https://www.orthotoolkit.com/charlson-
comorbidity-index/). The investigator should record each individual component of the 14-item Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as the overall score. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF in accordance with Section 12.6.[ADDRESS_226208] be recorded as AEs.
Additionally, demographic data will be collected  for all patients and include sex, age, and race 
and/or ethnicity.1 2.2 Vital Signs 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], SpO
2, and body 
temperature) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1).
All vital signs will be measured after the patien t has been resting for at least 5 minutes. Blood 
pressure measurements are to be taken in the sa me arm for the duration of the study. Moreover, 
additional vital signs may be performed as needed in case of any cardiac AE.
Additionally, body weight (without shoes) will be recorded at screening, Day 1, Day 14, Day 28, 
Day 60, and day of discharge (applicable); height (without shoes) will be recorded at screening only. Body mass index will be calculated whenever weight is recorded.
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clin ically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate measurements, or SpO

measurements must be recorded as AEs.
1 2.3 Physical E xaminations 
A complete physical examination will be performed at screening. Physical examinations will be 
performed by a physician, nurse, or other appropriately trained staff. The complete physical 
examination includes head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cervical and 
axillary lymph nodes; and neurological and musculoskeletal systems. 
A limited physical examination to verify conti nued patient eligibility and to follow-up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed  at the visits indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1). Symptom-driven, limited physical examinations may be performed as 
clinically indicated during the study (according to SoC).Please note: The limited physical examination on Day 8 (± 3 days) will be collected in all 
patients who remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. If the patien t is discharged before Day 8 (± 3 days), this 
assessment should only be done if the physician determines during the outpatient (ie, at the study
site) visit that the limited physical examination is clinically indicated.
1 2.4 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained locally at screening as indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 1). At screening, the investigator must examine the ECG traces for clinically 
significant abnormalities that could exclude the patient from the study. If ECGs are performed at 
unscheduled time points (eg, according to SoC), findings must be recorded in the eCRF.
ECGs should always be obtained in supi[INVESTIGATOR_190283] ( 5 minutes). An 
assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorde d; if the ECG is considered abnormal, the 
abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs wi ll be repeated if clinically significant 
abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present. Any ECG considered by [CONTACT_190440]. Moreover, additional ECGs may be obtained as needed in case of any cardiac AE  and will be recorded on the eCRF.

1 2.6 Adverse Events
Adverse Events
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) 
present at screening will be documented on the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syn dromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were pl anned before the patient was randomized in the 
study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the patient’s medical history.
Patients will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached.
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with  reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the 
time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the follow-up period (Day 60). 
Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of study  completion, is required (if possible) if the AE 
persists. The follow-up should continue until the event resolves (returns to normal or baseline 
values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by [CONTACT_190374]. 
It is understood that if a patient withdraws consent to further follow-up, then it may not be 
possible for the study site to follow the AE to resolution.
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the event should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).Each AE will be assigned a grade which refers  to the severity of the AE based on the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The Common Terminology Criteria for MetrioPharm AG

Table 7: Classification of Adverse Even ts by [CONTACT_190376] : This category applies to thos e AEs that are clearly and incontr overtibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AE s that are judged to be unrelated to the study drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be consider ed unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the study drug; (2) it could readily have been produc ed by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical s tate, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to  the patient; (3) it does no t follow a known pattern of 
response to the study drug; or (4) it does not rea ppear or worsen when the drug is readministered.
POSSIBLY : This category applies to thos e AEs for which a connection with the study drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled ou t with certainty. An AE may be cons idered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reas onable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced  by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical s tate, environmental or tox ic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the study 
drug.
PROBABLY: This category applies to those AE s that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the study drug. An AE may be considered pr obably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state, envi ronmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappea r upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example,  as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pa ttern of response to the study drug.
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels ar e incontrovertibly related to 
study drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of defi nitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable tem poral sequence from administratio n of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_190441]’s clinical state , environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the patient; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose and recurs with reexposure  to drug (if rechallenge  occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern of 
response to the study drug.

the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_102673].
Serious Adverse Event Reporting
An SAE occurring from the time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the follow-up period (Day 60) or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648] (whichever is longer) must be 
reported to the Syneos Health Safety and Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to

follow-up, then it may not be possible for the study site to follow the SAE to resolution.
Suspected Une xpected Serious Adverse Reactions
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be  classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting:
xserious
xunexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the reference safety information in the 
current version of the IB)
xthere is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the event and the study drug
The investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to the study drug. Syneos Health 
will consider the investigator’s asses sment and determine whether the event meets the criteria for 
being reportable as a 7-day or 15-day safety report. S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are fatal or life-threatening 
must be reported to the regulatory authorities and the IRBs/IECs (where required) within 7 days after Syneos Health/MetrioPharm has first knowledge of them, with a follow-up report (when

Page 67of 80total of 16 samples (approximately 4.9 mL per time point for a total of approximately 78.4 mL)
will be collected relative to the first dose on Day [ADDRESS_226216] dose on Day 7. Samples on 
Day 1 and Day 7 will be collected predose (wit hin [ADDRESS_226217] daily dose) and 
postdose at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 8 hours (before next dose), and 24 hours before the next morning dose (if applicable), if possible. Patients who provide consent for the PK sampling, but are no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 7, will not have Day 7 PK samples collected.
For patients in the PK subset on Day 1 and Day 7 only: Patients should not eat within the 4 hours
before planned study drug administration and w ithin the 120 minutes after study drug dosing, 
when feasible. Thus, study drug should be administered in fasted state (4 hours), when 
feasible. However, if a patient has eaten within  the 4 hours before their planned administration, 
study drug dosing may proceed. The patient’s fed or fasted state, as well as food intake (yes/no) 
within the 120 minutes after study drug dosing should be recorded. The PK samples should be 
collected as planned regardless of the patients’ fa sted/fed state. The study site should record the 
date and time of dosing (recorded as the time when the first capsule is administered).
Intravenous cannulas may be used for blood collection to avoid multiple skin punctures, when 
appropriate. Otherwise, blood samp les will be collected by [CONTACT_37277]. The actual date 
and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Sample collections completed outside the predefined time windows (windows to be specified in the laboratory manual) will not be 
considered as protocol deviations because actual postdose sampling times will be used for PK 
and statistical analyses.

1 5 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide furt her details regarding the definition of analysis 
variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. The SAP will be finalized 
before any statistical output (eg, DSMB output) is produced. The SAP will serve as a companion 
document to the protocol. The SAP will further describe the statistical analyses. All data will be included with the final CSR. 
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS
®software version 9.4 or higher 
(®). 
Summary statistics will be present
ed by [CONTACT_3227]. Continuous and ordinal variables will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_190378] (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum for actual values and change from baseline. Additionally, for ordinal data, the number 
and percentage of patients in each category will  be presented. Binary and categorical variables 
will be summarized for each treatment group by [CONTACT_190417].
Statistical tests for comparison between treatments  will be performed using a two-sided alpha 
level of 10%. No adjustment for multiple testing will be applied in this descriptive proof-of-
concept study.
1 5. 1 Determination of Sample Size 
The primary efficacy endpoint “proportion of patients with disease progression on Day 14” is 
assumed to be 10% in the [ADDRESS_226219] us SoC treatment group (Arm A) and 30% in 
the placebo plus SoC treatment group (Arm B). Using the Chi-square test with type I error alpha=10% two-sided for this proof-of-concept study and 2:1 randomization ratio, with 114 randomized patients (76 in Arm A and 38 in Arm B) a statistical power of 83% can be achieved. Considering about 5% early study terminations, the necessary sample size to 
randomize results is 120 patients in total (80 in Arm A and 40 in Arm B). If during the conduct MetrioPharm AG

Sample size estimation was perf ormed using nQuery 8, Version [IP_ADDRESS].
A subset of randomized patients will be consen ted for the collection of blood samples for PK 
measurements. The PK subset consists of approximately [ADDRESS_226220] listings with exce ption of the listing presenting screening failures and 
the respective reason(s) for screen failure.
Intention-To-Treat Set
The  Intention-To-Treat (ITT) set, correspond with randomized set, will include all randomized 
patients irrespective of any deviation from the protocol or premature discontinuation from study 
drug/withdrawal from study. The treatment group assignment will be designated according to 
initial randomization. The ITT will serve as the basis for the analysis of efficacy and summary of 
demographics and baseline characteristics.
Per Protocol SetThe Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include all pati ents from ITT who received at least [ADDRESS_226221] any major protocol deviations impacting the efficacy 
assessments. The PPS will be used for supportive analyses of efficacy.
Safety Set
The Safety Set (SS) will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study
drug. The treatment group assignment in the SS will be defined by [CONTACT_80222]. The SS will be used for the analysis of safety.

Page 70of 801 5.3 Efficacy Analysis 
The estimands for the primary efficacy endpoint and for the 4 key secondary endpoints 
comparing the 2 treatment groups will be tested w ith consideration of a two-sided type-1 error 
alpha of 10% for each test on the ITT. Additionally, 95% confidence intervals will be provided.
Also, the treatment comparison with regards to the other secondary eff icacy endpoints will be 
performed using a two-sided alpha level of 10%.
The main estimand for the primary efficacy endpoint is defined as follows:
xTreatment: 300 mg MP1032 BID plus SoC in Ar m A and placebo BID plus SoC in Arm 
B. If a patient terminates the study drug, but still remains in the study and is followed up, 
then the patient will continue to receive either SoC alone or SoC+ additional treatment. 
These treatments are defined with regards to intercurrent events as ‘other treatments’.
xPopulation: Of all patients defined by [CONTACT_190380]/exclusion criteria, the analysis 
population will include patients who were randomized to study drug (ITT population).
xVariable: A binary variable indicating disease progression (death or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]) at 
Day 14. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_190245] a score of 2, 3, or 4 on the NIAID 8-point ordinal scale.
xIntercurrent events: All events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 14 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy (ie, the NIAID score at Day 14 will be used for definition of the failure in such patients). 
xPopulation-level summary: Common risk difference resulting from the Mantel-
Haenszel (MH) test considering the 4 strata out of the combinations of the

used for definition of the failure or response, respectively) in such patients. Missing data on Day 
[ADDRESS_226223]-baseline data for patients randomized but not treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190381].
A similar MH approach and presentation of 95% confi dence intervals as described above will be 
applied also to the main estimand of the third key secondary efficacy endpoint, which is the all-
cause mortality at Day 28. Intercurrent events that lead to study drug discontinuation and/or 
switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy (ie, 
the life status at Day 28 will be considered). No mi ssing data of life status on Day 28 is expected. 
The main estimand of the fourth key secondary efficacy endpoint, change of clinical status 
related to COVID-19 on Day 28 compared with ba seline according to the NIAID 8-point ordinal 
scale, will be compared using the risk difference from the analysis of covariance model with 
treatment and the 2 binary stratification factor s (eg, severity and age-class) as independent 
factors and the baseline value of NIAID as independe nt covariate. Intercurrent events that lead to 
study drug discontinuation and/or switch to other treatment before Day 28 will be handled using the treatment-policy strategy for this estimand ( ie, the NIAID score at Day 28 will be used). 
Missing data on Day [ADDRESS_226224]-baseline data for patients randomized but not 
treated will be imputed by [CONTACT_190381]. The 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the risk 
difference.
The population for all above described estimands  of the key secondary endpoints is the ITT.
Sensitivity analyses for the main endpoints of th e primary and key efficacy estimands will be 
performed by [CONTACT_190336] 14 or  Day 28 as failure or non-resolution for the 
binary endpoints, and by [CONTACT_190420] 8-point ordinal scale.
All above analyses for the main estimands of the primary efficacy and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be repeated on PPS as supportive analysis. Additionally, for the primary efficacy 
and binary key secondary efficacy endpoints l ogistic regression model with treatment and the 
2 stratification factors as covariables will be performed on the ITT. Further estimands for  the
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be provided in the SAP.
The proportion of patients with disease resolution at Day 14 and the all-cause mortality rate at 
Day 14 and Day 60 will be analyzed using simil ar MH methods as described above for Day 28. 
Cumulative proportion of patients with disease resolution will be plotted by [CONTACT_5586].
A similar analysis of covariance approach as described above for Day 28 w ill be applied for the

Total number of days in ICU, duration of inva sive mechanical ventilation, and duration of 
ECMO will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_190383] 90% confidence intervals and additionally by [CONTACT_190421]. To consider death 
sufficiently unfavorable in these measures, in case of death the duration of the respective measure will be considered with the longest duration possible (eg, if a summary of the first 28 
days is presented, then death before Day 28 will be considered as duration 28 days, and if the 
summary also includes follow-up period until  Day 60, then death before Day 60 will be 
considered as duration of 60 days). Both summ aries (up to Day 28 and up to Day 60) will be

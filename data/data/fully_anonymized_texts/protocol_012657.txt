Title:
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Single-arm St udy to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Tirbanibulin Ointment 1% Applied  to a Field of Approximately 100 cm2on the Face or 
Balding Scalp in Adult Patients with Actinic KeratosisInvestigators:A Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231701] a 
Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231702]. The name, address, 
and affiliation of each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231703] (CSR).Trial Center(s):The trial is planned to be conducted at approx imately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US).
Trial Duration:The duration of the entire study from first patient,  first visit to last patient, last visit is 
anticipated to be approximately 8 months.
Phase of Development:
This is a Phase 3 trial.Rationale:
Tirbanibulin is an antiproliferative agent that causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In two 
well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, tirbanibul in ointment 1% was demonstrated to be an 
effective and safe treatment for actinic keratosi s (AK) of the face or balding scalp, when applied 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_231704] 5 consec utive days to a field of 25 cm
2containing 4 to 8 clinically 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, and discrete AK lesions.On the basis of the Phase 3 trial results, ti rbanibulin ointment 1% was approved in the US and 
Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231705], over a field up to 25 cm
2. However, 
AK often affects larger areas of ultraviolet (UV) light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a 
product to treat AK patients with affected fields larger than 25 cm2.
This study will assess the safety and tolerabili ty of tirbanibulin ointment 1% administered 
under the same posology (once daily for 5 days) to a field of approximately 100 cm2on the 
face or balding scalp containing 4 to 12 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, and discrete AK lesions.
Objectives:
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety  and tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% 
when applied to a field of approximately [ADDRESS_279425] of tirbanibul in ointment 1% when applied to a field of 
approximately [ADDRESS_279426]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 6/61Trial Design:
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, si ngle-arm trial to evaluate safety and local 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% admini stered topi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 5 days over a field of 
approximately 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp in adult patients with AK.
The study consists of a 4-week (28-day) Scre ening Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and a
Response Assessment Period of approximately 7 weeks (see Table 1 , Schedule of 
Assessments):
xDuring the Treatment Period, patients will a pply tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily for 
5 days beginning on Day 1.
xAll patients will be evaluated for safety, tole rability, and the presence of AK lesions in the 
treatment field (TF) until completion of the Response Assessment Period at Day 57.
Number of Patients:
Approximately 125 patients will be screen ed to initiate treatment in approximately 
100 patients.
Trial Population:Male and female AK patients, aged 18 years or ol der, having 4 to 12 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, 
and discrete AK lesions over a field of approximately 100 cm
2on the face or the balding scalp. 
A minimum of 50% of patients will be older than [ADDRESS_279427],  Dosage, and Mode of Administration:
Substance code/name: [CONTACT_231830]: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_231706]: 1%
Dosage form: Ointment
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% will be applied once da ily for one 5-day treatment course. On Day 1, 
treatment application will occur at the investig ational site in the morning under the supervision 
of clinical trial site staff. Between Days 2 and 5, the treatment will be self-administered once
daily at home.Reference Investigational Medicinal Produc t, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:
Not applicable. No control arm will be included in this study.
Methodology:Study visits and assessments will be perf ormed in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 ).
Duration of Treatment:
The duration of each patient’s treatment is [ADDRESS_279428]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 7/61Duration of P atients’ Participation in the Trial:
The total duration of each patient’s participation in  the trial, including screening, treatment, 
and response assessment is estimated to be approximately [ADDRESS_279429] one local 
tolerability sign of approximately 90%, the preci sion in the estimation of that percentage will 
be approximately 11%. The precision is defined as the width of the 95% confidence interval.
Furthermore, 100 patients will provide approxim ately 10% and 13% precision in the estimation 
of the percentage of patients with the local tolerabi lity events of particular interest, specifically 
vesiculation/pustulation (assuming an expected percentage of 8%) and erosion/ulceration 
(assuming an expected percentage of 12%), respectively.

5 Introduction
A summary on the indication, mec hanism of action, and comple ted nonclinical and clinical 
studies is provided below. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% is provi ded in the Athenex KX2-391 (tirbanibulin) 
Investigator’s Brochure.
5.1 Background Information
5.1.1 Indication
Actinic keratosis (AK) is an ultra-violet (U V) light-induced pre-cancerous lesion of the skin 
that represents the initial clinical manifestatio n of intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_231712] M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279447]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 19/61proliferation ( Röwert-Huber, 2007 ;Fernandez Figueras, 2017 ). Given the demonstrated 
potential for progression to invasive squamo us cell carcinoma (SCC), dermatologists 
encourage and actively pursue treatment, as re commended in current na tional and international 
guidelines ( Hofbauer, 2014 ;Werner, 2015 ;de Berker, 2017 ;Leitlinienprogramm Onkologie, 
2019).
Actinic keratosis presents as erythematous, scal y patches on the skin of sun-exposed areas and 
so particularly affecting the face, scalp, and ex tremities, either as a single lesion or multiple 
lesions and may present in as an entire field (“field cancerization”) with widespread actinic 
damage, such as in areas on the forehead or the back of the hand ( Dodds, 2014 ;Figueras Nart, 
2018). Actinic keratosis is common in older, fa ir-skinned populations of European ancestry, 
and is more frequent ly observed in men ( Flohil, 2013).
Precise estimates of AK prevalence are difficult, owing to its strong association with increased 
age. The prevalence of AK in the US has b een reported to range from 11% to 26% ( Salasche, 
2000). Recent studies in Europe suggest that AK pr evalence there ranges from 33% to 49% for 
men and 14% to 28% for women ( Eder, 2014 ,Tizek, 2019, Flohil, 2013 ,Ferrándiz, 2016 ,
Fargnoli, 2017 ,Dziunycz, 2018 ).
In some cases, AK represents a carcinoma in situ of the skin, and when left untreated, AK can 
progress to invasive SCC ( Röwert-Huber, 2007 ;Werner, 2013 ;Fernandez Figueras, 2017 ).
Cutaneous SCC represents 20% to 50% of skin cancers ( Que, 2018 ) and poses a significant 
threat due to its ability to metastasize to any organ in the body ( Burton, 2016 ). Up to 65% of 
SCCs arise from pre-existing AK; however, the  risk of progression to SCC of a single AK 
lesion per year has been reported to be very lo w, 0% to 0.075% in patients without a previous 
history of non-melanoma skin cancer ( Marks, 1988 ), and up 0.53% per lesion in patients with 
a prior history of non-melanoma skin cancer ( Werner, 2013 ;Green, 2017 ).
5.1.2 Unmet Medical Need
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% is approved in the US and Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231713], over a field up to 25 cm2. However, AK often affects larger areas of UV 
light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a product to treat AK pa tients over fields larger 
than 25 cm2.
Although a limited number of AK field-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231714] 25 cm2, there remain unmet needs for patients with AK in terms of tolerability 
and treatment convenience/adherence. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as 5-fluorouracil and 
imiquimod, frequently present safety and tolera bility events during treatment that may lead to 
treatment discontinuation. While d iclofenac sodium 3%, which is also used over larger fields, 
has a good safety and tolerability profile, it is  administered over a longer treatment period (60 to
90 days) and drugs with shorter treatment durations are desirable, as they are associated with 
better adherence ( Goldenberg, 2017 ). In a survey of [ADDRESS_279448] ed topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]
(Savary, 2019 ). Thus, there is a need in the current armamentarium for well-tolerated, short-
duration therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231715] [ADDRESS_279449]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 20/61microtubule network via direct binding to tubulin s. Furthermore, it is associated with disruption 
of Src tyrosine kinase signaling.
5.1.4 Nonclinical Studies
5.1.5 Clinical Studies
The clinical development program on topi[INVESTIGATOR_231716] 10 completed clinical trials 
that enrolled a total of 1338 subjects, 989 subjects who received tirbanibulin ointment 1% and 
349 subjects who received vehicle ointment. Of  the 989 subjects treated with tirbanibulin 
ointment 1%, 597 were patients with AK and 392 were healthy adults.
PharmacokineticsPharmacokinetic studies showed that tirbanibul in ointment 1% was minimally absorbed in 
patients with AK after to pi[INVESTIGATOR_231717] 25 cm
2on the face or balding scalp once daily for 
5 consecutive days. Exposure (C max, AUC 0-24) was higher when tirbanibulin ointment 1% was 
applied to the face versus the scalp. A propo rtional increase in systemic exposure (C max,
AUC 0-24) was observed when tirbanibulin ointment 1% was applied to an area measuring 
[ADDRESS_279450]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 21/61Efficacy and Safety
The efficacy and safety studies included tw o Phase 3 double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 
randomized trials, KX01-AK-003 (N=351) and KX01-AK-004 (N=351), that were conducted 
in the US to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% compared to vehicle 
ointment in patients with AK on face or bald ing scalp. Tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily 
for 5 days was effective in the treatment of AK on either the face or balding scalp, with 
statistically significantly higher rates of complete  and partial clearance at Day 57 in the treated 
field as compared to control vehicle (complete c learance, 49% vs 9%, respectively). Treatment-
related adverse events (AEs) were few (16% vs 10%, respectively) and consisted of mostly 
transient mild to moderate application site prur itus and pain that required no treatment; there 
were no treatment-related SAEs. Signs assessing local tolerability were mostly mild to 
moderate erythema and flaking/scaling. Mean co mposite scores for local tolerability signs
peaked at Day 8 and were mostly resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29.
The safety of treating larger AK fields (>25 cm2) was evaluated in a Phase 1, maximal usage 
trial (MUsT), in which tirbanibulin ointment 1% was applied to an area measuring [ADDRESS_279451] frequently reported treatment-related 
AEs were application site pruritus and application site pain. All AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity; no severe AEs were reported. The most  frequently reported local tolerability signs 
were erythema and flaking/scaling. Most local tolerability signs were mild or moderate, with
severe erythema and flaking/scaling reported in 14.3% of patients each. Local tolerability sign 
composite scores peaked around Day 7 to 8 and were mostly resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29.
A detailed description of the completed clinica l studies is provided in the Athenex KX2-391 
Ointment 1% (tirbanibulin) Investigator’s Brochure.
5.2 Summary of the Known Potential Risks and Benefits
Actinic keratosis is a UV light –induced pre-cancerous lesion of the skin that represents the 
initial clinical manifestation of intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_231718]. Given the 
demonstrated potential for progression to SCC,  dermatologists generally encourage and 
actively pursue treatment, with a goal of comp letely eliminating AK lesions, thereby [CONTACT_231753].
Data from the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies demons trate that treatment with tirbanibulin ointment 
1% once-daily for 5 days is effective in th e treatment of AK of the face or balding scalp.
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], the safety profile of tirbanibulin ointment 1% showed a low rate of 
treatment-emergent AEs and no unexpected or unanticipated safety findings. The overall 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) wa s similar between the tirbanibulin ointment
1% and vehicle groups, and there were no treatment-related trea tment-emergent serious AEs
(TESAEs) or discontinuations due to a TEAE. Th ere were also no long-term safety concerns 
related to tirbanibulin ointment 1% in patients followed up to [ADDRESS_279452] frequently reported local tolerability si gns were transient, mild to moderate erythema 
and flaking/scaling. Treatment-related AEs were  mostly transient, mild to moderate 
application-site pruritus or pain, and most did not require treatment.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279453]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22/61The safety profile of tirbanibulin ointment 1%  observed in the Phase 1 maximal-use trial
M-[ZIP_CODE]-01, in which study drug was applied to 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp, was 
consistent with that observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].
Based on the available efficacy and safety data from the completed clinical and nonclinical 
studies, the benefit-risk assessment is posit ive and supports the evaluation of tirbanibulin 
ointment 1% in this Phase [ADDRESS_279454] 
under investigation, is provided in the Athenex KX2- 391 (tirbanibulin) Investigator’s 
Brochure.
5.[ADDRESS_279455] and apoptosis. In two 
well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, tirbanibul in ointment 1% was demonstrated to be an 
effective and safe treatment for AK of the face or balding scalp, when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_231719] 5 consecutive days to a field of 25 cm2containing 4 to 8 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, 
and discrete AK lesions.
On the basis of the Phase 3 trial results, ti rbanibulin ointment 1% was approved in the US and 
Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231705], over a field up to 25 cm2. However, 
AK often affects larger areas of UV light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a product to 
treat AK patients with affected fields larger than 25 cm2.
This study will assess the safety and tolerabi lity of tirbanibulin ointment 1% administered 
under the same posology (once daily for 5 days) to a field of approximately 100 cm2on the 
face or balding scalp containing 4 to 12 clinicall y typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, a nd discrete AK lesions.

7 Trial Design and Rationale
7.1 Trial Design
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, si ngle-arm trial to evaluate safety and local 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% admini stered topi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 5 days over a field of 
approximately 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp in adult patients with AK.
The study consists of a 4-week (28-day) Scre ening Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and a
Response Assessment Period of a pproximately 7 weeks (see Table 1 , Schedule of 
Assessments):
xDuring the Treatment Period, patients will a pply tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily for 
5 days beginning on Day 1.
xAll patients will be evaluated for safety, tole rability, and the presence of AK lesions in the 
TF until completion of the Response Assessment Period at Day 57.
7.2 Trial Rationale
7.2.1 Rationale for Trial Design
Since tirbanibulin ointment 1% is an approved product and there is no change in the 
formulation or posology, the main objective of this  study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% applied over an extended field (100 cm2) in adult 
patients with AK on the face or balding scalp.
The duration of the study considers both safety and efficacy. From a local tolerability 
perspective, most of the local signs are expec ted to be resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29. However, the study 
duration is extended up to Day 57, in order to assess the treatment effect as exploratory 
endpoints.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279459]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 24/61In addition to the overall incidence of local tole rability events, the sample size considers
detection of local tolerability signs of particu lar interest, specifically, vesiculation/pustulation 
and erosion/ulceration (see Section 11.1). When severe, these local tolerability signs can lead 
to permanent local events such as dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_231720].
7.2.[ADDRESS_279460] in terms of age a nd treated area. A minimum of 50% of patients 
older than [ADDRESS_279461] on the scalp.
7.2.3 Rationale for Trial Dose and Regimen
In this study patients will be treated with tirbanibulin ointment 1% daily for 5 consecutive days 
beginning on Day 1. Treatment will be a pplied to a field measuring approximately 100 cm2on
the face or balding scalp. There are no change s in treatment duration or posology. Tirbanibulin 
ointment 1% has shown effectiveness in the tr eatment of AK lesions and the good safety and 
tolerability profile supports the field extension to a higher area to satisfy medical needs.
In a Phase 2 trial (KX01-AK-002), efficacy a nd safety results of 3 and 5-day treatment 
regimens over 25 cm2were compared. The 5-day regimen showed substantial clinical activity 
and acceptable local tolerability. The 5-day treatment regimen showed a higher proportion of 
patients with 100% clearance at Day 57 compared with the 3-day regimen (43% vs 32%,respectively), as well as a higher proportion of patients maintaining their treatment response at 
12 months (43% vs 30%, respectively). Patients in th e 5-day regimen experienced slightly more 
mild/moderate erythema and flaking/scaling, bu t local signs were self-limited with both 
regimens and by [CONTACT_2006] 29 had essentially returned to baseline values. 
7.2.4 Rationale for Trial Assessments
In prior studies, mild to moderate erythema an d flaking/scaling were the most frequently 
observed signs when assessing local tolerability. Local tolerability signs following treatment 
will be characterized and assessed throughout this study and reported separately from AEs.
Standard safety assessments will be performed  throughout the study including the capture of 
AEs, SAEs, concomitant medications, laboratory testing for hematology, blood chemistry, and
urinalysis, PEs and vital signs measures, and ECGs.
Lesion counts in the TF will be performed at Screening, Day 1/Ba seline (predose), and at every 
visit from Day [ADDRESS_279462] of tirbanibulin ointment 1%,

9.[ADDRESS_279478]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 31/61At Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose), the Investigator will confirm the TF on the face or balding scalp 
that was identified at Screening and the patients  will receive instructions on how to apply the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_231726].
Patients will be provided with 5 single-dos e packets containing tirbanibulin ointment 1%.
The first dose will be administered by [CONTACT_231760] 1 at the site. The patient will self-admin ister the remaining single-dose packets once daily 
at home for the next 4 consecutive days. The fi fth dose should be applied by [CONTACT_231761] 5 site visit.
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% will be applied to  cover the treatment field of approximately 
100 cm2, corresponding to approximately 0.5% of the body surface area. Study medication 
should be applied each day at approximately th e same time. The treatment field should not be 
wet, should be kept dry for a pproximately 8 hours after application, and should not be touched 
or covered with dressing. The ointment should not be applied near the eyes, mouth, or lips.Patients will return the used medication packagin g (all parts of each packet, including the torn 
opening part) and any unused study medication back to the clinical site at the next visit to check 
compliance and for drug reconciliation purposes. F urther details will be given in the study 
manuals (see Section 9.5).
9.5 Treatment Compliance
Compliance with the study treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_231762] 5. Compliance 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_231763] d returned used tirbanibulin ointment 1% single-
use packets. Patients will be instructed to return both the used and unused study treatment back 
to the clinical site. This information will be recorded in the eCRF.Deviations from the prescribed dosage regimen should be also recorded in the eCRF.Patients will record dates and ti mes of study treatment application, including dates for study 
treatment delays in the electronic diary of  the study mobile application (Study App).
The amount of study drug applied will be determi ned based on weight. The site will record the 
weight, as a whole, of the 5 packets each one in  their respective closed zipper storage bags 
before and after dosing to quantify the amount used  by [CONTACT_102]. Patients will be required to
bring back to the site the respective two torn pa rts of each packet in their respective closed 
zipper storage bags. The weighing of the 5 pack ets will be performed on a balance with 
sufficient precision to calculate the weight by [CONTACT_231764]. To avoid losing any study drug by [CONTACT_231765], the total weight of 5 packets 
will be measured as a whole in their respective re-sealable zipper storage bags. Additional 
details for this process are provided in the study manuals.
The dosing logs for each patient will be kept during the study. The Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) will review treatment compliance during monitoring site visits.

Physical Examination
A complete Physical Examination includes hei ght, weight, and an assessment of head, eyes, 
ears, nose and throat, integumentary/dermatol ogical, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], musculoskeletal, neurological systems, and an expanded dermatological 
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279490]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 36/61examination to cover sun-exposed areas where photo-damage is likely. Height is measured at 
Screening only. Physician examinations will  be conducted in accordance with schedule 
detailed in Table [ADDRESS_279491] a nd measure the anatomical area (eg, approximately 
mid face or an area on the scalp) and will outline  the TF with a marker pen over the skin. Each 
AK lesion within the TF will be also identif ied with a label. A photograph will be captured 
using imaging devices to be used to support th e location of the same TF identified at Screening 
during the follow up study visits assessments. 
At Baseline (Day 1), the area of the TF and the number and location of lesions inside it will be 
confirmed. A baseline photograph is only required in case of a ny significant change from 
Screening is detected in the TF as per the investigator judgement or if the quality of the image 
captured at screening is not appropriate. If  no photograph is needed at baseline, then the 
screening photograph will be considered the ba seline assessment. The same field will be 
located during the study with the aid of imag ing software before performing the study 
assessments. Study Manuals will be provided to describe the image procedures in detail. The 
number of AK lesions in the TF will be recorde d in the eCRF and photographs will be taken 
according to the schedule in Table 1.
Pregnancy Testing
In females of childbearing potential, a highly sensitive urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at the Screening visit and accordi ng to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). Urine pregnancy 
test kits will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].
Any pregnancy, whether occurring in  a female patient or in the fe male partner of a male patient, 
for which the estimated date of conception was during the patient’s study participation must be 
reported. In addition, pregnancies  in female partners of male pa tients for which the estimated 
date of conception was within [ADDRESS_279492] be reported.
10.3.2 Response Assessment Period
Response Assessment Period visits and assessments will be performed in accordance with the 
schedule detailed in Ta ble 1. See Sections 10.4 and10.5 for details on the lesion and safety 
assessments, respectively.
The trial visit at Day 5 cannot be repeated nor skipped. The trial visits at Day 8, Day 15, Day 29,
and Day 57 may be rescheduled within the time windows allowed in this protocol, in case of:
xscheduling conflicts (weekends or holidays),
xtechnical problems with the equipment necessary for the visit (eg, ECG), 
xany AEs that impede conduct of the visit, 
xrestrictions related to the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279493]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 37/6110.3.[ADDRESS_279494](s) can be performed at any time 
during the trial in order to follow-up the progr ess of any clinically relevant abnormal finding, 
investigate any potential new adverse event, e tc. These additional tests outside of the initial 
schedule of the trial will be considered "unsche duled tests" and will not be associated with any 
trial visit.Repeated Tests
Any safety test may be repeated at the Invest igator’s discretion under either of the following 
situations:
xWhen there is any kind of problem with the fi rst test (ie, technical problem with the ECG 
machine, blood sample hemolyzed, presence of  artifacts, etc.). The Investigator should 
repeat the individual test as soon as possible.
xAt the screening visit any individual test(s) may be reasonably repeated during the screening 
window to confirm the eligibility criteria (eg, laboratory sample when there is any clinically 
significant abnormality, etc.).
10.4 Lesion Assessments
To the extent possible, the Investigator who conducts the lesion count at Baseline/Day 1 and through the study visits according to  the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 )must be the 
same for an individual patient. All o ther intermediate assessment visits should be conducted 
by [CONTACT_49238], to the extent possible.
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator)  will count all lesions in the TF for all 
subjects, according to the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Details on whether the lesion 
present in the TF is new or an existing lesion at  baseline will be rec orded at each visit in the 
eCRF.
Lesions identified at baseline w ill be followed during the study using appropriate tools such as 
imaging software, where baseline lesions will be identified and new lesions appearing along 
the study recognized.
10.5 Safety and Tolerability Assessments
Safety will be assessed peri odically during the study by [CONTACT_88668], including SAEs, local 
tolerability, pi[INVESTIGATOR_231727], and AESI s. Safety assessments also include PEs and 
vital signs measures, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations and pregnancy testing for WOCBP 
(see Table 1 ).
10.5.1 Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
At each study visit, patients will be asked a general question “How have you been since the 
last visit?” before assessment of local tolerab ility, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the TF.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279495]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 38/61Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECGs, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline which are determined to  be clinically significant in th e medical and scientific judgment 
of the Investigator, are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.
Local tolerability signs will be report ed separately from AEs (see Section 10.5.2 ). The 
Investigator, or designee, may report an AE based on his or her judgement. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]
for definitions and reporting of AESIs.All patients who have unresolved treatment-related AEs at Day 57/Early Termination (ET) will 
return for additional follow-up every [ADDRESS_279496] returned to 
the baseline value, or are deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366].
Adverse event and SAE definitions and reporting requirements are detailed in Section 10.7.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following have been identified as AESIs based on their relevance for the current intended 
use:
Skin CancersSkin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) appearing within or outside the TF during 
the study will be reported as AESIs. Details of the skin cancer and any other associated AE 
will be recorded in the AE form in the eCRF and by [CONTACT_231773]. The 
location and treatment will be recorded. In the ca se of an SCC arising within the TF, it will be 
recorded if an AK had been present at the same location at baseline. See Section 10.7.[ADDRESS_279497] also be completed and 
sent along with Skin Cancer Report Form, as specified in Section 10.7.4.
10.5.2 Focused Dermatological Examination of the Treatment 
Field
The focused dermatological examin ation will include evaluations for local tolerability signs, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the TF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Local Tolerability
Local tolerability assessments in the TF will be recorded per the schedule in Table 1. The 
assessment for local tolerability is to be done  after the assessment for AEs. The evaluation of 
local tolerability is done by [CONTACT_737] (or an appropriate trained designee). The local 
tolerability signs to be assessed and the c orresponding grading scale for each sign are provided 
in Table 3.

Application site symptoms such as itching, burning, stinging, tenderness, pain etc., are not 
classified as local tolerability signs and will be reported as AEs.
All patients who have unresolved  local tolerability signs in the TF at Day 57/ET will return for 
additional follow-up every [ADDRESS_279499] retu rned to the baseline 
value, or are deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_737].Any sign of local tolerability leading to tempor ary or permanent discontinuation of the study 
drug application or requiring the use of concomitan t medications should be reported as an AE. 
If a sign of local tolerability leads to an AE meeting the criteria of seriousness (ie, an SAE), 
the SAE form will be completed with all the av ailable information and reported within the same 
timeframe and following the same routing as for an SAE (see Section 10.7.4 ).
In case of occurrence of possible contact [CONTACT_231774], an evaluation (patch test) will be 
made to confirm or rule out the diagnosis (see Appendix 2 ).

10.5.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs
Physical Examinations
A complete PE includes height, weight, and an as sessment of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, 
integumentary/dermatological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], musculoskeletal, 
neurological systems, and an expanded dermatolog ical examination to cover sun-exposed areas 
where photo-damage is likely. Height is measured at Screening only.Vital SignsMeasurement of vital signs will include blood pre ssure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body
temperature. Measurements of systolic and dias tolic blood pressure will be conducted after at 
least [ADDRESS_279501]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 40/61Significant findings that are observed after th e patient has signed the ICF and that meet the 
definition of an AE must also be recorded in the AE form in the eCRF.
10.5.[ADDRESS_279502] also be recorded on the AE form in the eCRF.
10.5.5 Laboratory Testing
Routine laboratory assessments will be performed  at a designated central laboratory (refer to
the laboratory manual). Tests to be performed at  the central laboratory are detailed in Table 4 .
Table 4 Laboratory Testing Parameters
Assessment Specific Tests
Hematology Red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, and white blood 
cells (WBC) with differential (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, basophils)

administration of concomitant medications (if any), and after vital signs measures and ECGs
are performed. Significant findings that are obser ved after the patient has signed the ICF and 
that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded on the AE form in the eCRF.
Urine pregnancy testing for WOCBP will  be performed at the study site in accordance with the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279503]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 41/6110.6 Other
Standardized Photography
Standardized ph otography of each patient’s TF will be  performed prior to dosing while on 
treatment (see Table 1) for illustrative purposes and to support the TF and AK lesion 
identification within the TF. Each AK lesion within the TF will be identified at the 
screening/baseline visit with a label placed over the skin, a photo will be captured as a reference 
to support AK lesion follow up during the stud y. Refer to the study manuals for detailed 
instructions.
Care must be taken to ensure that the sa me lighting, background, subject positioning relative 
to the camera, and camera settings are used  for each photograph. Equipment, supplies, and 
detailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be provided to the 
clinical study site prior to the initiation of patient enrollment.
10.[ADDRESS_279504] medical occurre nce in a clinical trial participant, regardless 
of the administration of the IMP and its causal relationship to it.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended medical occurrence during the 
patient’s participation in the trial, including deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition, 
an abnormal value in a laboratory assessment, ECG abnormality, or an abnormal finding in the 
physical examination.
Adverse events must be temporally associated with the patient’s participation in the trial, ie,
occur after signing the ICF. At the time of the occurrence of an AE, the administration of the 
IMP does not need to have already been initiated . If initiated, it does not necessarily need to 
have a positive causal relationship to the event.
Serious Adverse EventAn SAE is an adverse event, which falls in to one or more of the following categories:
xresults in death
xis life-threatening (ie, an event which, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.) It does not mean that the event might 
hypothetically have caused death if it was more severe or lasted longer
xrequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231732] a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279505]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 42/61xis any other medically important event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other above outcomes.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exer cised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in  death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231733] . These are considered “other important medical 
events. ”

xThe nature of the AE will be described in pr ecise, standard medical terminology (ie, not 
necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_11581] t). If known, a specific diagnosis should be 
recorded instead of listing signs and symptoms (eg, allergic contact [CONTACT_8748])
xThe duration of the AE will be described by [CONTACT_231776] d ate and end date
xThe location for cutaneous adverse events will  be described as at or just around the TF
(≤2 cm from the TF) or distant (>2 cm from the TF)
xThe intensity of the AE will be described in terms of mild, moderate , or severe according to 
the Investigator’s clini cal judgment, using the following definitions:
oMild : Awareness of event, symptoms, or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable)
oModerate : Sufficient discomfort and interferes with usual activity (disturbing)
oSevere : Incapacitating with inability to do normal  daily living activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention (unacceptable)
xThe causal relationship of the event to use of the IMP will be described in terms of:
oNot related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, de finitely not related to trial drug, as 
related to other drug, chemicals, or underlying disease
oUnlikely related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that 
makes a relationship improbable; disease or other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations
oPossibly related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
relationship to drug intake; could also be e xplained by [CONTACT_231777]; information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear
oRelated : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with  a reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake, unlikely to be attributed to unde rlying disease or othe r drugs or chemicals; 
response to withdrawal clinically reasonable (positive dechallenge)
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279507]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 43/61‘Possibly related ’and ‘related’ will be considered as ‘related ’terms for reporting purposes. 
If the events are assessed as ‘unlikely related ’or ‘not related ’to the suspect IMP, the event
does not qualify for reporting purposes. In the absence of information on causality from the 
reporting Investigator, the CRO will immediate ly contact [CONTACT_231778] a causality assessment. The case will  be updated with the follow-up information and 
reported accordingly. If no causality is provide d by [CONTACT_737], the Sponsor assessment 
will be considered for submission purposes.
xThe outcome of the event will be described in terms of:
oRecovered/resolved
oRecovering/resolving
oRecovered/resolved with sequelae
oNot recovered/not resolved
oFatal
oUnknown
xThe action taken on the IMP will be captured as:oDrug withdrawn
oDose not changed
oNot applicable
An AE will be collected only once with its max imum severity, except when the AE started 
before first IMP administration and persisted after it and worsened in severity any time after 
first IMP application. In this latter case, the AE wi ll be collected with e ach respective severity. 
The AE term recorded must be exactly the same at the different time points where this AE is 
reported again in the eCRF.
10.7.3 Recording of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected from signature [CONTACT_231832] 57/ET. Any AE reported 
by [CONTACT_231779] [ADDRESS_279508] (Day 57/ET) should also be captured in 
the eCRF.
Medical disorders present at the time of signing the informed consent that are part of the 
patient’s medical history will only be considered AEs if they worsen after this time.
Abnormalities detected before IMP administration in the PE, laboratory tests, ECGs, or other safety assessments will not be considered AEs if already known as part of the medical history 
or in relation to prior medical conditions and will be recorded in the eCRF/CRF Medical 
History/physical examination form/page. However, abnormalities detected in screening/baseline tests, thought to be due to  a trial procedure, will be considered AEs.
Abnormalities (newly occurring or worsening of previously known abnormalities) detected 
after IMP administration in physical exam, labor atory tests, ECGs, or other safety assessments, 
which are considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator, or which require an intervention 
or a diagnosis test, or may result in the IMP discontinuation, should be reported as AEs.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279509]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 44/61Reported terms should accurately characterize the adverse event. When a patient experiences
an unspecified injury, signs or symptoms, activ e investigation should be conducted to reach a
final diagnosis. If reached, then the diseas e diagnosis is the preferred reported term.
Adverse events will be elicited by [CONTACT_231780]-leading questions (eg, "How do/did 
you feel? ”) and by [CONTACT_231781] 
a designee.
All AEs elicited by [CONTACT_231782]. In addition, when an AE meets the criteria of seriousness (ie, an SAE), it must 
also be recorded on the SAE form and report ed following the defined timelines in Section 
10.7.4.
10.7.[ADDRESS_279510]
Serious adverse events and AESIs will be collected from signature [CONTACT_231832] 57/ET.
Any SAE or AESI reported by [CONTACT_231779] [ADDRESS_279511] (Day 57/ET)
should be collected in the eCRF.
The Investigator must report any SAE or AESI within 24 hours from the moment she/he first 
learns of it to the CRO pharmacovigilance unit on a SAE report form. This reporting will take place regardless of whether the Investigator consid ers the event to be causally related to the 
IMP(s), to any other medicinal product(s), to the clinical trial procedure or to any intervention 
undergone by [CONTACT_102].
Original reports are to be kept by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator in the Investigator’s File. 
Contact [CONTACT_231783].
The minimum information that must be included in the initial report is:
xAn event meeting the criteria of SAE or AESI.
xA qualifiable reporter, defined as an Invest igator of this trial or his/her delegate.
xA qualified patient, defined as a pa tient who has consented to this trial.
xA suspect medicinal product.
xThe I nvestigator’s causality assessment.
Unless the SAE or AESI has been sufficiently documented in the initial report, the Investigator 
will provide all available additional information in follow-up reports by [CONTACT_2329] a new form and adhering to the same routing and time frames as defined for the initial report. This will be 
continued until the event has been fully documented and reported.
An event reported to the CRO pharmacovigilan ce unit which does not meet the SAE or AESI 
criteria shall be nullified by [CONTACT_231784] a follow up report.
Depending on the local requirements, a regulatory report of the SAE or AESI (if serious) will 
be produced by [CONTACT_231785] t and submitted to relevant Competent 
Authorities and Investigators, when appl icable according to local regulations.

10.7.5 Follow-up of Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events
Those AEs and SAEs, including AESIs, recorded for Screening failure patients will be 
followed-up until resolution or until otherwise agreed between the Sponsor and the 
Investigator.
All AEs and SAEs, including AESIs, that are still pre sent after the last study visit (including 
AEs that have led to premature discontinuation), will be followed-up at least [ADDRESS_279513] 
or visit (whichever is considered more appropriat e by [CONTACT_737]). In case the AE/SAE is 
still ongoing after that time point, this will be followed-up until its resolution or until otherwise 
agreed between the Sponsor and the Investig ator. The same timeframes will apply for AEs 
from screening failures which are ongoing at the time the patient is withdrawn from the trial.
Additional safety data collected at a contact/ visit to follow-up the ongoing AE will not be 
included into the clinical database, if this was already locked; therefore, the clinical database 
lock will not be delayed due to this situati on. Any SAE will be followed up if needed after 
clinical database lock and the information w ill be only stored in the safety database.

Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a female pati ent or in the female partner of a male patient, 
for which the estimated date of conception was duri ng the patient’s study participation must be 
reported. In addition, pregnancies in female partne rs of male patients for which the estimated 
date of conception was within [ADDRESS_279515] be reported.
In case of pregnancy during the participation in  the trial, the patient will be immediately

must complete a study specific pregnancy for m upon confirmation of a pregnancy and send it 
to the CRO Safety Contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of confirmation of the pregna ncy. Pregnancy is not 
itself an AE or SAE; however, maternal/fetal co mplications or abnormalities will be recorded 
as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. 
The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until  pregnancy termination 
and, in the case of a live-born offspring, the follo w-up period will be d eemed to have ended 
when the health status of the child has been determined on its birth or after an appropriate 
period post-delivery considered necessary to monitor the development of the new-born is 
completed.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279516]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 46/61The patient will be asked to provide informati on on the outcome of the pregnancy, including 
premature termination should the case arise. S pontaneous miscarriage, developmental delay, 
fetal death, SAE in a neonate, and congenital ab normalities will be reported as SAEs. The 
Investigator will inform the CRO Safety Contac t of the outcome as a follow-up to the initial 
pregnancy form. All pregnancies s hould be reported to the sponsor and, when applicable, to 
the ethics committee.

be developed and maintained by [CONTACT_231790].
The eCRF is an auditable electronic record of information reported to the Sponsor on each trial 
patient, according to this clinical investig ation protocol. The eCRF enables clinical 
investigation data to be systematically captur ed, reviewed, managed, stored, analyzed, and 
reported.
12.1 Data Collection
12.1.1 Identification of the Trial Data Sources
Source data includes all information in original rec ords and certified copi [INVESTIGATOR_95937], observations, or other activi ties in a clinical investigation used for 
reconstructing and evaluating the investigation.
When a device or instrument is the data origina tor (eg, blood pressure monitoring device or 
glucometer) and data are automa tically transmitted directly to  the eCRF, the eCRF is the 
source.
Access to source data is critical to the review a nd inspections of clinical investigations. Source 
data should be attributable, legible, contempor aneous, original, and accurate (ALCOA) and 
must meet the regulatory requirements for recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
The trial data sources are outlined below:
xSigned informed consent forms
xPatient medical history records will include tr ial diagnosis and inclusion/exclusion criteria 
age, sex, demographics, physical examinat ion, medical history, vital signs, previous 
medication, original or certified copy of a lab oratory reports, instrument printout, trial 
progress notes of the physician
xLaboratory test results reports (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, etc)
xDigital photographs
xePatient diary (Study App)
xeCRF
12.1.[ADDRESS_279524] be maintained by [CONTACT_231791] (eg, an original or certified copy of a laboratory report, instrument printout, progress 
notes of the physician, the trial patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), nurses’ notes).
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279525]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 50/61Direct Entry of Data Into the eCRF
The direct entry of data can eliminate errors by [CONTACT_50337] a paper transcription step before entry 
in the eCRF. For the following data elements, the eCRF may be the source:
xDate of ICF signature (in the case of a paper ICF; in the case of an electronic ICF the 
eConsent will be the source)
xInclusion and exclusion criteria confirmation (checking)
xPatient demographics and physical examinati on, including. age, gender, race, ethnicity 
height, weight, and F itzpatrick skin type
xRelevant previous and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231737]-to-date relevant medical hi story, including trial diagnosis
xTF measurements and location (face or scalp)
xNumber of lesions in the TF and identificati on of whether each lesion is new or existed at 
baseline
xVital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])
xPregnancy test results
xTrial/visit dates 
xVisit assessment (checking compliance, trial diary data, drug application, blood sample 
collection, tolerability score, end of treatment)
xDrug accountability (medication given and re turned and product weight before and after 
application)
xAdverse events
For the above trial data elements, the eCRF is the source. If a paper transcription step is used, 
then the paper documentation should be retain ed and made available for monitoring or 
inspection.
Direct data entry should meet ALCOA+ principles for  data integrity in life sciences. In case 
trial data cannot be entered at the time of the pa tient visit, eg, laboratory tests results, then 
Investigators are requested to make their entries at the time when the report with the results is 
received.
All non-CRF entered external data (ie, images) will  not be loaded into the eCRF, but it will be 
integrated in SAS datasets and reconciled fr equently with the eCRF data by [CONTACT_231792].
The information directly collected in the eCRF  must match the source documents. The source 
data verification will be performed by [CONTACT_231793] (monitor) 
according to the requirements specified in the Monitoring Plan.At the trial end, the CRO will generate a PDF copy of the completed CRFs which will be sent
to the Investigator(s) for all patien ts enrolled at his or her location.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279526]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 51/6112.1.[ADDRESS_279527] the patients at the Day1/Baseline 
visit, and as many times as dee med necessary. Patients will also  receive written instructions on 
the Study App use. The Study App will be installed onto the patient’s own mobile phone, and
there will also be the possibility to provide patients with a mobile phone, if necessary. The Study App will be installed onto the mobile phone  during the baseline visit. Clinical personnel 
will check and confirm the correct in stallation of the Study App during the visit.
On the Study App, patients will:
xReceive notifications, communications, and re minders through the patient retention tool
xComplete the eDiary: Patients, and assisted by [CONTACT_50633], as needed, will complete a diary 
to record daily the study treatment appli cation dates and times of application. The eDiary
will be completed by [CONTACT_231794] (or designee) in 
accordance with the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).
At the study end, the Investigator will receive a CD/DVD with the mobile application data (in PDF) from the patients enrolled at his/her lo cation. The Investigator will keep this CD/DVD
with the rest of the original data for as l ong as required by [CONTACT_427]. The mobile 
application files are relevant documentation for registration.
The mobile application data is the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be available in 
any form to third parties without the written  permission of the Sponsor, except to authorized 
representatives of appropriate Competent Authorities.
12.2 Data Management and Quality Control
Data Management of the trial will be perform ed by [CONTACT_231795], according to 
Almirall SOPs.
In order to facilitate the collection of accurate a nd complete data, the CRO will target the risks 
associated with critical trial data and these will be documented into the Data Management Plan 
(DMP) and the Monitoring Plan.Investigators will respond to any query gene rated by [CONTACT_231796].Main Data Management activities and procedures will be accurately described in the DMP, 
created by [CONTACT_231797].Database checks will be programmed by [CONTACT_2024] , based on the Data Validation Plan. The 
listings will be documented in the DMP. The checks and listings  programming will be 
appropriately validated by [CONTACT_2024].
Reconciliation of trial da ta and SAEs between Clinical and Drug Safety databases will be 
performed by [CONTACT_231798] e database lock. Procedures to be followed 
will be detailed in the DMP.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279528]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 52/61Encoding of specific data will  be conducted by [CONTACT_2024]. For this  trial, medical history, AEs, 
and concomitant medications (including resc ue medications) will be coded; Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  and WHO-DRUG Enhanced dictionaries will 
be used, version number of each dictionary will be documented in the DMP.
A Quality Control check to ensure the accur acy of the data will be done by [CONTACT_2024], when
data are cleaned on an ongoing basis and just before the database lock. Specifications of the 
Quality Control check will be found in the DMP.An audit trail will be maintained in order to prot ect the authenticity and integrity of the clinical 
data.
12.3 Investigator and Trial Master Files
The Investigator's file and Sponsor Trial Master File (TMF) will contain all trial documents 
indicated in the ICH GCP guidelines and local regulations. At the trial end the Investigator will receive one CD/DVD/USB key with the electronic data 
capture (EDC) data, as well as one CD/DVD wi th the tablet PC and electronic Patient Diary 
data from the patients enrolled at his/her loca tion. The Investigator will keep these in the 
Investigator’s file.
The CRO will provide Almirall with an electron ic TMF (eTMF). Almirall will have on-line 
access to the eTMF during the study and study documents will be reviewed, approved, and 
managed within the system. At the end of the st udy the eTMF and complete audit trail will be 
transferred to the TMF-dedicated Sponsor server for long-term storage. Information about 
eTMF contents, index, structure, nomenclatu re, metadata, and oversight metrics will be 
detailed in other documents (ie, eTMF Management Plan, CROOP, etc.).
All records must be stored in a secure fa cility protected from fire, flood, and unauthorized 
access where they may be readily accessed in the event of an audit or inspection.
12.[ADDRESS_279529] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_231738] (ie, completed and signed eCRF or 
certified copy of the eCRF). The Investigator maybe requested by [CONTACT_231799]. When data elements are transcribed from paper sources into an eCRF, the Investigator must 
also retain the paper sources, or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , for later review. Other records (electronic and 
paper) required to corroborate data in the eCRF  may also be requested during an inspection.
All trial data (including elect ronic data), all hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_231739], consent forms, 
CRFs, queries and printouts, and all essential doc uments relating to the conduct of the clinical 
trial will be stored at the research site for a period of 25 years after completion of the trial, 
unless otherwise communicated in writing by [CONTACT_1034].CROs/vendors will store the databases, including audit trails and related documentation, for a 
period of [ADDRESS_279530]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 53/61without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location 
or party without written notification to the Sponsor.
13 Quality Control and Quality Assurance
13.1 Training of Staff
During the set-up phase of the tr ial, appropriate kick-off meetings will be performed between 
Almirall and the CRO and/ or vendors (eg, eCRF, laboratories, ce ntral ECG), in order to train 
CRO staff on trial procedures.
An Inve stigators’ meeting will be performed, including training on GCP procedures, trial 
protocol, efficacy and safety assessments, la boratory procedures, eCRF completion, usage of 
any specific device and any other appl icable process/procedure/method, as applicable.
An initiation visit will be performed at each  site by [CONTACT_231800] (eg, eCRF , IMP) arrived in good conditions and to train 
the site staff for protocol compliance.
Appropriate study manuals will be provided to the re search sites as written help to support all 
trainings on all trial procedures (eg, laboratory samples, eCRF). 
13.2 Monitoring
The trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_231801]/Monitors  according to the details specified in the 
Monitoring Plan.
The trial CRA/Monitor will conduct monitoring visits according to a pre-agreed schedule and 
with enough frequency to perform  source data verification, check the accuracy of entries in the
CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to GCP, the progress of enrollment and to ensure that trial medication is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for, according to specifications and 
report any deviation as soon as possible to the Clinical Trial Manager. 
Standard monitoring reports will be produced by  [CONTACT_231802]/Monitor after each visit and 
filed in the TMF. Key trial personnel must be available to assist the field CRA/Monitor during 
these visits.
The Investigator must also keep the original  informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_231803], case and visit notes medical records, 
all information in eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient´s file.
A close out visit to solve pending issues and to agree on the shipment of remaining trial 
materials to the Sponsor (eCRF and other data source, medication) will be performed by [CONTACT_231804]/Monitor once all patients have completed the trial.
13.3 Inspections and Audits
The trial site, trial processes, CRO, providers and/or trial documents  may be subject to Quality 
Assurance audits by [CONTACT_231805] (or authorized partner companies) as well as to inspection by

17.3 Protocol Amendments
Modifications of the original protocol are referred to as “ amendments ” to the trial protocol. 
Modifications of the original protocol may only be  made with Almirall approval. Two types of 
amendment maybe produced:
xSubstantial Amendments (related to the safety or physical or men tal integrity of the patients, 
scientific value of the trial, conduct or managem ent of the trial or the quality or safety of 
any IMP used) must be notified to the IR B and/or Competent Authorities and approved by 
[CONTACT_231816].
xNon-substantial Amendments do not require not ification but should be recorded and be 
available on request for inspection at the tr ial site and/or Sponsor premises as appropriate.
17.[ADDRESS_279539] of the trial will be recorded by [CONTACT_2689]/Monitors
as detected or derived from data collected in the clinical database. 
Relevant deviations will be promptly reported to Almirall after detection. Major protocol 
deviations will be included in the corresponding listing of the CSR.
Additionally, protocol deviations will be re ported to the IRBs/IECs and/or Competent 
Authorities according to the local regulation in each country.

Title:
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Single-arm St udy to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Tirbanibulin Ointment 1% Applied  to a Field of Approximately 100 cm2on the Face or 
Balding Scalp in Adult Patients with Actinic KeratosisInvestigators:A Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231701] a 
Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231745]. The name, address, 
and affiliation of each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_231703] (CSR).Trial Center(s):The trial is planned to be conducted at approx imately 20 centers in the [LOCATION_002] (US).
Trial Duration:The duration of the entire study from first patien t, first visit to last patient, last visit is 
anticipated to be approximately 8 months.
Phase of Development:
This is a Phase 3 trial.Rationale:
Tirbanibulin is an antiproliferative agent that causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In two 
well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, tirbanibul in ointment 1% was demonstrated to be an 
effective and safe treatment for actinic keratosi s (AK) of the face or balding scalp, when applied 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_231704] 5 consec utive days to a field of 25 cm
2containing 4 to 8 clinically 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, and discrete AK lesions.On the basis of the Phase 3 trial results, ti rbanibulin ointment 1% was approved in the US and 
Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231705], over a field up to 25 cm
2. However, 
AK often affects larger areas of ul traviolet (UV) light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a 
product to treat AK patients with affected fields larger than 25 cm2.
This study will assess the safety and tolerabili ty of tirbanibulin ointment 1% administered 
under the same posology (once daily for 5 days) to a field of approximately 100 cm2on the 
face or balding scalp containing 4 to 12 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, and discrete AK lesions.
Objectives:
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety  and tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% 
when applied to a field of approximately [ADDRESS_279557] of tirbanibul in ointment 1% when applied to a field of 
approximately [ADDRESS_279558]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 6/61Trial Design:
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, si ngle-arm trial to evaluate safety and local 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% admini stered topi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 5 days over a field of 
approximately 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp in adult patients with AK.
The study consists of a 4-week (28-day) Scre ening Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and a
Response Assessment Period of approximatel y 7 weeks (see Table 1, Schedule of 
Assessments):
xDuring the Treatment Period, patients will a pply tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily for 
5 days beginning on Day 1.
xAll patients will be evaluated for safety, tole rability, and the presence of AK lesions in the 
treatment field (TF) until completion of the Response Assessment Period at Day 57.
Number of Patients:
Approximately 125 patients will be screen ed to initiate treatment in approximately 
100 patients.
Trial Population:Male and female AK patients, aged 18 years or ol der, having 4 to 12 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, 
and discrete AK lesions over a field of approximately 100 cm
2on the face or the balding scalp. 
A minimum of 50% of patients will be older than [ADDRESS_279559],  Dosage, and Mode of Administration:
Substance code/name: [CONTACT_231830]: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_231706]: 1%
Dosage form: Ointment
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% will be applied once da ily for one 5-day treatment course. On Day 1, 
treatment application will occur at the investig ational site in the morning under the supervision 
of clinical trial site staff. Between Days 2 and 5, the treatment will be self-administered once
daily at home.Reference Investigational Medicinal Produc t, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:
Not applicable. No control arm will be included in this study.
Methodology:Study visits and assessments will be perf ormed in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1).
Duration of Treatment:
The duration of each patient’s treatment is [ADDRESS_279560]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 7/61Duration of Patients’ Participation in the Trial:
The total duration of each patient’s participation in the trial,  including screening, treatment, 
and response assessment is estimated to be approximately [ADDRESS_279561] one local 
tolerability sign of approximately 90%, the preci sion in the estimation of that percentage will 
be approximately 11%. The precision is defined as the width of the 95% confidence interval.
Furthermore, 100 patients will provide approxim ately 10% and 13% precision in the estimation 
of the percentage of patients with the local tolerabi lity events of particular interest, specifically

5 Introduction
A summary on the indication, mec hanism of action, and comple ted nonclinical and clinical 
studies is provided below. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% is provi ded in the Athenex KX2-391 (tirbanibulin) 
Investigator’s Brochure.
5.1 Background Information
5.1.1 Indication
Actinic keratosis (AK) is an ultra-violet (U V) light-induced pre-cancerous lesion of the skin 
that represents the initial clinical manifestatio n of intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_231712] M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279579]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 19/61proliferation ( Röwert-Huber, 2007 ;Fernandez Figueras, 2017 ). Given the demonstrated 
potential for progression to invasive squamo us cell carcinoma (SCC), dermatologists 
encourage and actively pursue treatment, as recommended in current national and international 
guidelines ( Hofbauer, 2014 ;Werner, 2015 ;de Berker, 2017 ;Leitlinienprogramm Onkologie, 
2019).
Actinic keratosis presents as erythematous, scal y patches on the skin of sun-exposed areas and 
so particularly affecting the face, scalp, and ex tremities, either as a single lesion or multiple 
lesions and may present in as an entire field (“field cancerization”) with widespread actinic 
damage, such as in areas on the forehead or the back of the hand ( Dodds, 2014 ;Figueras Nart, 
2018). Actinic keratosis is common in older, fa ir-skinned populations of European ancestry, 
and is more frequently observed in men (Flohil, 2013 ).
Precise estimates of AK prevalence are difficult, owing to its strong association with increased 
age. The prevalence of AK in the US has b een reported to range from 11% to 26% ( Salasche, 
2000). Recent studies in Europe suggest that AK pr evalence there ranges from 33% to 49% for 
men and 14% to 28% for women ( Eder, 2014 ,Tizek, 2019, Flohil, 2013 ,Ferrándiz, 2016 ,
Fargnoli, 2017 ,Dziunycz, 2018 ).
In some cases, AK represents a carcinoma in situ of the skin, and when left untreated, AK can 
progress to invasive SCC ( Röwert-Huber, 2007 ;Werner, 2013 ;Fernandez Figueras, 2017 ).
Cutaneous SCC represents 20% to 50% of skin cancers ( Que, 2018 ) and poses a significant 
threat due to its ability to metastasize to any organ in the body ( Burton, 2016 ). Up to 65% of 
SCCs arise from pre-existing AK; however, the  risk of progression to SCC of a single AK 
lesion per year has been reported to be very lo w, 0% to 0.075% in patients without a previous 
history of non-melanoma skin cancer ( Marks, 1988 ), and up 0.53% per lesion in patients with 
a prior history of non-melanoma skin cancer ( Werner, 2013 ;Green, 2017 ).
5.1.2 Unmet Medical Need
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% is approved in the US and Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231713], over a field up to 25 cm2. However, AK often affects larger areas of UV 
light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a product to treat AK pati ents over fields larger 
than 25 cm2.
Although a limited number of AK field-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231714] 25 cm2, there remain unmet needs for patients with AK in terms of tolerability 
and treatment convenience/adherence. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as 5-fluorouracil and 
imiquimod, frequently present safety and tolera bility events during treatment that may lead to 
treatment discontinuation. While d iclofenac sodium 3%, which is also used over larger fields, 
has a good safety and tolerability profile, it is  administered over a longer treatment period (60 to
90 days) and drugs with shorter treatment durations are desirable, as they are associated with 
better adherence ( Goldenberg, 2017 ). In a survey of [ADDRESS_279580] ed topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786]
(Savary, 2019 ). Thus, there is a need in the current armamentarium for well-tolerated, short-
duration therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231715] [ADDRESS_279581]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 20/61microtubule network via direct binding to tubulin s. Furthermore, it is associated with disruption 
of Src tyrosine kinase signaling.
5.1.4 Nonclinical Studies
5.1.5 Clinical Studies
The clinical development program on topi[INVESTIGATOR_231746] 10 completed clinical trials 
that enrolled a total of 1338 subjects, 989 subjects who received tirbanibulin ointment 1% and 
349 subjects who received vehicle ointment. Of  the 989 subjects treated with tirbanibulin 
ointment 1%, 597 were patients with AK and 392 were healthy adults.
PharmacokineticsPharmacokinetic studies showed that tirbanibul in ointment 1% was minimally absorbed in 
patients with AK after to pi[INVESTIGATOR_231717] 25 cm
2on the face or balding scalp once daily for 
5 consecutive days. Exposure (C max, AUC 0-24) was higher when tirbanibulin ointment 1% was 
applied to the face versus the scalp. A propo rtional increase in systemic exposure (C max,
AUC 0-24) was observed when tirbanibulin ointment 1% was applied to an area measuring 
[ADDRESS_279582]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 21/61Efficacy and Safety
The efficacy and safety studies included tw o Phase 3 double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 
randomized trials, KX01-AK-003 (N=351) and KX01-AK-004 (N=351), that were conducted 
in the US to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirbanibulin ointment 1% compared to vehicle 
ointment in patients with AK on face or bald ing scalp. Tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily 
for 5 days was effective in the treatment of AK on either the face or balding scalp, with 
statistically significantly higher rates of complete  and partial clearance at Day 57 in the treated 
field as compared to control vehicle (complete c learance, 49% vs 9%, respectively). Treatment-
related adverse events (AEs) were few (16% vs 10%, respectively) and consisted of mostly 
transient mild to moderate application site prur itus and pain that required no treatment; there 
were no treatment-related SAEs. Signs assessing local tolerability were mostly mild to 
moderate erythema and flaking/scaling. Mean co mposite scores for local tolerability signs
peaked at Day 8 and were mostly resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29.
The safety of treating larger AK fields (>25 cm2) was evaluated in a Phase 1, maximal usage 
trial (MUsT), in which tirbanibulin ointment 1% was applied to an area measuring [ADDRESS_279583] frequently reported treatment-related 
AEs were application site pruritus and applicati on site pain. All AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity; no severe AEs were reported. The most  frequently reported local tolerability signs 
were erythema and flaking/scaling. Most local tolerability signs were mild or moderate, with 
severe erythema and flaking/scaling reported in 14.3% of patients each. Local tolerability sign 
composite scores peaked around Day 7 to 8 and were mostly resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29.

Ointment 1% (tirbanibulin) Investigator’s Brochure.
5.2 Summary of the Known Potential Risks and Benefits
Actinic keratosis is a UV light –induced pre-cancerous lesion of the skin that represents the 
initial clinical manifestation of intra-epi[INVESTIGATOR_231718]. Given the 
demonstrated potential for progression to SCC,  dermatologists generally encourage and 
actively pursue treatment, with a goal of completely eliminating AK lesions, thereby [CONTACT_231819].
Data from the two pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies demons trate that treatment with tirbanibulin ointment 
1% once-daily for 5 days is effective in th e treatment of AK of the face or balding scalp.
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], the safety profile of tirbanibulin ointment 1% showed a low rate of 
treatment-emergent AEs and no unexpected or unanticipated safety findings. The overall 
incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) wa s similar between the tirbanibulin ointment
1% and vehicle groups, and there were no treatm ent-related treatment-emergent serious AEs
(TESAEs) or discontinuations due to a TEAE. Th ere were also no long-term safety concerns 
related to tirbanibulin ointment 1% in patients followed up to [ADDRESS_279584] frequently reported local tolerability si gns were transient, mild to moderate erythema 
and flaking/scaling. Treatment-related AEs were  mostly transient, mild to moderate 
application-site pruritus or pain, and most did not require treatment.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279585]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22/61The safety profile of tirbanibulin ointment 1%  observed in the Phase 1 maximal-use trial
M-[ZIP_CODE]-01, in which study drug was applied to 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp, was 
consistent with that observed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491].
Based on the available efficacy and safety da ta from the completed clinical and nonclinical 
studies, the benefit-risk assessment is posit ive and supports the evaluation of tirbanibulin 
ointment 1% in this Phase [ADDRESS_279586]

Brochure.
5.[ADDRESS_279587] and apoptosis. In two 
well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, tirbanibul in ointment 1% was demonstrated to be an 
effective and safe treatment for AK of the face  or balding scalp, when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_231719] 5 consecutive days to a field of 25 cm2containing 4 to 8 clinically typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, 
and discrete AK lesions.
On the basis of the Phase 3 trial results, tirba nibulin ointment 1% was approved in the US and 
Europe for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_231705], over a field up to 25 cm2. However, 
AK often affects larger areas of UV light-damaged skin; thus, there is a need for a product to 
treat AK patients with affected fields larger than 25 cm2.
This study will assess the safety and tolerabi lity of tirbanibulin ointment 1% administered 
under the same posology (once daily for 5 days) to a field of approximately 100 cm2on the 
face or balding scalp containing 4 to 12 clinicall y typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], visible, and discrete AK lesions.
6 Objectives and Endpoints

7 Trial Design and Rationale
7.1 Trial Design
This is a Phase 3 multicenter, open-label, si ngle-arm trial to evaluate safety and local 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% admini stered topi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] 5 days over a field of 
approximately 100 cm2on the face or balding scalp in adult patients with AK.
The study consists of a 4-week (28-day) Scre ening Period, a 5-day Treatment Period, and a
Response Assessment Period of approximately 7 weeks (see Table 1, Schedule of 
Assessments):
xDuring the Treatment Period, patients will a pply tirbanibulin ointment 1% once daily for 
5 days beginning on Day 1.
xAll patients will be evaluated for safety, tole rability, and the presence of AK lesions in the 
TF until completion of the Response Assessment Period at Day 57.
7.2 Trial Rationale
7.2.1 Rationale for Trial Design
Since tirbanibulin ointment 1% is an approved product and there is no change in the 
formulation or posology, the main objective of this  study is to evaluate the safety and 
tolerability of tirbanibulin ointment 1% applied over an extended field (100 cm2) in adult 
patients with AK on the face or balding scalp.
The duration of the study considers both safety and efficacy. From a local tolerability 
perspective, most of the local signs are expec ted to be resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 29. However, the study 
duration is extended up to Day 57, in order to assess the treatment effect as exploratory 
endpoints.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279591]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 24/61In addition to the overall incidence of local tole rability events, the sample size considers
detection of local tolerability signs of particu lar interest, specifically, vesiculation/pustulation 
and erosion/ulceration (see Section 11.1). When severe, these local tolerability signs can lead 
to permanent local events such as dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_231720].
7.2.[ADDRESS_279592] in terms of age a nd treated area. A minimum of 50% of patients 
older than [ADDRESS_279593] on the scalp.
7.2.3 Rationale for Trial Dose and Regimen
In this study patients will be treated with tirbanibulin ointment 1% daily for 5 consecutive days 
beginning on Day 1. Treatment will be a pplied to a field measuring approximately 100 cm2on
the face or balding scalp. There are no change s in treatment duration or posology. Tirbanibulin 
ointment 1% has shown effectiveness in the tr eatment of AK lesions and the good safety and 
tolerability profile supports the field extension to a higher area to satisfy medical needs.
In a Phase 2 trial (KX01-AK-002), efficacy a nd safety results of 3 and 5-day treatment 
regimens over 25 cm2were compared. The 5-day regimen showed substantial clinical activity 
and acceptable local tolerability. The 5-day treatment regimen showed a higher proportion of
patients with 100% clearance at Day 57 compared with the 3-day regimen (43% vs 32%,respectively), as well as a higher proportion of patients maintaining their treatment response at 
12 months (43% vs 30%, respectively). Patients in th e 5-day regimen experienced slightly more 
mild/moderate erythema and flaking/scaling, bu t local signs were self-limited with both 
regimens and by [CONTACT_2006] 29 had essentially returned to baseline values. 
7.2.4 Rationale for Trial Assessments
In prior studies, mild to moderate erythema an d flaking/scaling were the most frequently 
observed signs when assessing local tolerability. Local tolerability signs following treatment 
will be characterized and assessed throughout this study and reported separately from AEs.
Standard safety assessments will be performed  throughout the study including the capture of 
AEs, SAEs, concomitant medications, labor atory testing for hematology, blood chemistry, and 
urinalysis, PEs and vital signs measures, and ECGs.
Lesion counts in the TF will be pe rformed at Screening, Day 1/Base line (predose), and at every 
visit from Day [ADDRESS_279594] of tirbanibulin ointment 1%,

9.4 Treatment Administration
Treatment will begin on Day 1, following confir mation of patient eligibility and collection of 
all pre-dose samples and assessments.
At Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose), the Investigator will confirm the TF on the face or balding scalp 
that was identified at Screening and the patients will receive instructions on how to apply the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_231726].
Patients will be provided with 5 single-dos e packets containing tirbanibulin ointment 1%.
The first dose will be administered by [CONTACT_231760] 1 at the site. The patient will self-admin ister the remaining single-dose packets once daily 
at home for the next 4 consecutive days. The fi fth dose should be applied by [CONTACT_231761] 5 site visit.
Tirbanibulin ointment 1% will be applied to  cover the treatment field of approximately 
100 cm2, corresponding to approximately 0.5% of the body surface area. Study medication 
should be applied each day at approximately th e same time. The treatment field should not be 
wet, should be kept dry for a pproximately 8 hours after application, and should not be touched 
or covered with dressing. The ointment should not be applied near the eyes, mouth, or lips.
Patients will return the used medication packagin g (all parts of each packet, including the torn 
opening part) and any unused study medication back to  the clinical site at the next visit to check 
compliance and for drug reconciliation purposes. F urther details will be given in the study 
manuals (see Section 9.5).
9.5 Treatment Compliance
Compliance with the study treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_231762] 5. Compliance 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_231763] d returned used tirbanibulin ointment 1% single-
use packets. Patients will be instructed to return both the used and unused study treatment back 
to the clinical site. This information will be recorded in the eCRF.
Deviations from the prescribed dosage regimen should be also recorded in the eCRF.Patients will record dates and ti mes of study treatment application, including dates for study 
treatment delays in the electronic diary of  the study mobile application (Study App).
The amount of study drug applied will be determi ned based on weight. The site will record the 
weight, as a whole, of the [ADDRESS_279612]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 32/61zipper storage bags. The weighing of the 5 pack ets will be performed on a balance with 
sufficient precision to calculate the weight by [CONTACT_231820]. To avoid losing any study drug by [CONTACT_231765], the total weight of 5 packets 
will be measured as a whole in their respective re-sealable zipper storage bags. Additional 
details for this process are provided in the study manuals.
The dosing logs for each patient will be kept during the study. The Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA) will review treatment compliance during monitoring site visits.
9.[ADDRESS_279613] the patient identity and data confidentiality, each patient will be identified 
in the trial with one unique patient number. Th e unique patient number is a combination of 
his/her site number and a sequential num ber assigned by [CONTACT_737]. 
The site number will be predetermined, but the sequential num ber is assigned by [CONTACT_231766] (ICF). At each site, the first patient is 
assigned patient number 001, and subsequent patients are assigned the next consecutive 
number.Once assigned to a patient, the patient number wi ll not be reused. The patient number will be 
used to identify the patient throughout the trial.

and vitamins, taken within [ADDRESS_279616]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 33/61taken during the course of the study will be mad e. Information regarding the total daily dose, 
route of administration, start and di scontinuation dates, and indication are to be captured in the 
patient’s eCRF.
A complete study disease treatment history will be recorded in the eCRF.Any medication taken for medical reasons (mainly diseases concomitant with studied disease) 
prior to trial entry, will be continued at the same dose and conditions during the entire 
experimental phase of the trial.
9.9.2 Concomitant Medications
No concomitant therapy will be  allowed during the entire duration of the trial, other than the 
prior allowed medication or any other required for the treatment of AEs or local tolerability. In 
such cases, the drug will need to be prescribed by [CONTACT_231767]. The following item s should be specified: trade name, dose and 
frequency of dosing, route, indication, date an d time of first dose, and date and time of last 
dose, when applicable.
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (medication and non-medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) not restricted by [CONTACT_231768]. The use of non-medicated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, sunscr een and moisturizers) will also be recorded 
in the Concomitant Medication eCRF. The use of or change in the dose of any of the 
concomitant medications, either prescription or OTC, during the study will be recorded. The 
reason for use or change of dose of a concomitant therapy may need to be reported as an AE. 
Patients must be instructed to  inform the Investigator of plans to take any new treatment during 
the participation in the trial, incl uding OTC medicinal and herbal products.
9.9.3 Prohibited Concomitant Medications
The use of any non-study drug on the TF is prohibited during the study. 
The use of moisturizers and sunscreens in th e TF is prohibited during the study, but can be 
applied outside of the TF, as needed. Patients will be reminded that AK lesions located  outside the treatment field may be treated by 
[CONTACT_231769]-directed treatment only (eg, cryotherapy) at the Investigator’s discretion.
All medications requiring wash-out (see Exclusion Criteria, Section 8.3) are prohibited during 
thepatient’s participation in the study.
9.9.[ADDRESS_279617]-trial Medications
Once study treatment and all visits and relate d study measurements are complete, patients 
should continue to take their usual medications allowed during the study and may resume other 
medications interrupted prior to study enrolment , as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_737]. It 
is not planned to treat patients with tirbanibulin ointment 1% any further than scheduled in this 
study. No intervention or additional care is planned to follow the end of the study.

(documented in the patient’s medical records ) to confirm that the Investigator has ensured the 
informed consent process was done correctly, and that the patient understood what to expect, 
he/she had the opportunity to ask any questions an d consider other treatment options and agreed 
to participate.
The ICF can be either in paper or electronic form. Patients will be able to download the signed 
ICF (in case of completing the electronic ICF) or will be given a hard copy (in case of 
completing the paper ICF).Trial visits must be scheduled w ith respect to Baseline/Day 1. In order to adapt appointments 
to local holidays, patients´ availability or site internal organization needs, time windows are
allowed as indicated in Table 1. The CRA or CRO Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_231770].
As applicable, laboratory tests and other assessments will be performed using supplies or 
equipment provided by [CONTACT_231821] a specialized provider who will 
perform centralized assessment and reporting.
Optimally, the evaluations for each patient (lesi on counts, review of trial drug compliance, etc.) 
should be performed by [CONTACT_49238] (or other suitably qualified and experienced 
designee) throughout the trial to avoid inter-assessor bias. 
Unless specified otherwise, the study assessmen ts scheduled during the study visits must be 
performed before the study product administra tion, except on Day 5, when the study product 
application will be done by [CONTACT_231772]. If assessments are 
scheduled for the same nominal time, then the assessments should occur in the following order:
1. Vital signs
2. ECG
3. Blood draw for laboratory tests
Table 1 summarizes the trial proc edures to be performed at each visit. Individual trial 
procedures are described in the following sections.
10.2 Patient’s General Conditions During the Trial
After the screening evaluation and while not at th e research site, patients will maintain normal 
daily activities, following the instructions of the Investigator. Any event likely to interfere with 
the objectives of the trial will be communicated to the Investigator and reported without delay 
to the Sponsor.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279620]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 35/6110.3 Scheduled Activities and Trial Visits
10.3.1 Screening Period
All screening assessments will be performed af ter the patient provides informed consent. The 
Screening Visit (Visit 1) will occur between Day -[ADDRESS_279621] and current medical s tatus, as documented in the patient’s medical 
history, to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the trial.
Eligible patients will receive a detailed descript ion of all activities and requirements before 
signing the ICF to ensure their understanding and compliance with sample collection and 
clinical examinations. 
Patients who require a washout period from prohi bited concomitant treatments should be seen 
and sign the ICF prior to the Screening visit, to ensure the necessary washout before. No trial 
assessments will be performed on that date and th e Screening visit will be scheduled according 
to the washout length required for the specific medication stopped.
The Screening visit and assessments will be pe rformed in accordance with schedule detailed in 
Table 1.
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Data on demographic (sex, age, race, ethnicity) and baseline character istics (body weight, 
height, smoking and alcohol habi ts) will be collected during Screening. Height will be 
measured at Screening only.
Skin type will be recorded according to the Fitzpatrick scale (Table 2).

Medical and Actinic Keratosis History
Medical history at Screening will include:
xSignificant medical and surgical history during the last 5 years (eg, a common cold would 
not be captured unless it was ongoing at Screening)
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279622]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 36/61xThe initial diagnosis date of AK on the face or balding scalp and on any other part of the 
body
xAny AK treatment history of the face or ba lding scalp including all commercial and 
investigational products and surgical modalities dating back to the initial diagnosis
xHistory of and location of cancers including skin cancers, eg, BCC, SCC, melanoma
Prior Medications
All medications, including OTC drugs, food supple ments, herbal remedies, and vitamins, taken 
within 30 days prior to screening will be recorded at the Screening visit (see Section 9.9.1 ).
Physical Examination
A complete Physical Examination includes hei ght, weight, and an assessment of head, eyes, 
ears, nose and throat, integumentary/dermatol ogical, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], musculoskeletal, neurological systems, and an expanded dermatological 
examination to cover sun-exposed areas where photo-damage is likely. Height is measured at 
Screening only. Physician examinations will  be conducted in accordance with schedule 
detailed in Table 1.
Treatment Field Identification
The size of the TF must be approximately [ADDRESS_279623] a nd measure the anatomical area (eg, approximately 
mid face or an area on the scalp) and will outline  the TF with a marker pen over the skin. Each 
AK lesion within the TF will be also identif ied with a label. A photograph will be captured 
using imaging devices to be used to support th e location of the same TF identified at Screening 
during the follow up study visits assessments. 
At Baseline (Day 1), the area of the TF and the number and location of lesions inside it will be 
confirmed. A baseline photograph is only required in case of a ny significant change from 
Screening is detected in the TF as per the investigator judgement or if the quality of the image 
captured at screening is not appropriate. If  no photograph is needed at baseline, then the 
screening photograph will be considered the ba seline assessment. The same field will be 
located during the study with the aid of imag ing software before performing the study 
assessments. Study Manuals will be provided to describe the image procedures in detail. The 
number of AK lesions in the TF will be recorde d in the eCRF and photographs will be taken 
according to the schedule in Table 1.
Pregnancy Testing
In females of childbearing potential, a highly sensitive urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at the Screening visit and according to the Sche dule of Assessments (Table 1). Urine pregnancy 
test kits will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].
Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a female patient or in the fe male partner of a male patient, 
for which the estimated date of conception was during the patient’s study participation must be 
reported. In addition, pregnancies in female partners of male pati ents for which the estimated 
date of conception was within [ADDRESS_279624]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 37/6110.3.2 Response Assessment Period
Response Assessment Period visits and assessments will be performed in accordance with the 
schedule detailed in Ta ble 1. See Sections 10.4 and10.5 for details on the lesion and safety 
assessments, respectively.
The trial visit at Day 5 cannot be repeated nor skipped. The trial visits at Day 8, Day 15, Day 29,
and Day 57 may be rescheduled within the time windows allowed in this protocol, in case of:
xscheduling conflicts (weekends or holidays),
xtechnical problems with the equipment necessary for the visit (eg, ECG), 
xany AEs that impede conduct of the visit, 
xrestrictions related to the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) pandemic.
10.3.[ADDRESS_279625](s) can be performed at any time 
during the trial in order to follow-up the progr ess of any clinically relevant abnormal finding, 
investigate any potential new adverse event, e tc. These additional tests outside of the initial 
schedule of the trial will be considered "unscheduled tests" and will not be associated with any 
trial visit.
Repeated Tests
Any safety test may be repeated at the Invest igator’s discretion under either of the following 
situations:
xWhen there is any kind of problem with the first test (ie, technical problem with the ECG 
machine, blood sample hemolyzed, presence of  artifacts, etc.). The Investigator should 
repeat the individual test as soon as possible.
xAt the screening visit any individual test(s) may be reasonably repeated during the screening 
window to confirm the eligibility criteria (eg, lab oratory sample when there is any clinically 
significant abnormality, etc.).
10.4 Lesion Assessments
To the extent possible, the Investigator who c onducts the lesion count at Baseline/Day 1 and 
through the study visits according to th e Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1) must be the 
same for an individual patient. All o ther intermediate assessment visits should be conducted 
by [CONTACT_49238], to the extent possible.
A dermatologist (Investigator or Subinvestigator)  will count all lesions in the TF for all 
subjects, according to the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1). Details on whether the lesion 
present in the TF is new or an existing lesion at  baseline will be rec orded at each visit in the 
eCRF.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279626]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 38/61Lesions identified at baseline w ill be followed during the study using appropriate tools such as 
imaging software, where baseline lesions will be identified and new lesions appearing along 
the study recognized.
10.5 Safety and Tolerability Assessments
Safety will be assessed peri odically during the study by [CONTACT_88668], including SAEs, local 
tolerability, pi[INVESTIGATOR_231727], and AESI s. Safety assessments also include PEs and 
vital signs measures, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations and pregnancy testing for WOCBP 
(see Table 1).
10.5.1 Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
At each study visit, patients will be asked a general question “How have you been since the 
last visit?” before assessment of local tolerability, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the TF.
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECGs, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline which are determined to be clinically si gnificant in the medical and scientific judgment 
of the Investigator, are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.
Local tolerability signs will be report ed separately from AEs (see Section 10.5.2 ). The 
Investigator, or designee, may report an AE based on his or her judgement. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]
for definitions and reporting of AESIs.
All patients who have unresolved treatment-related AEs at Day 57/Early Termination (ET) will 
return for additional follow-up every [ADDRESS_279627] returned to 
the baseline value, or are deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_32366].
Adverse event and SAE definitions and reporting requirements are detailed in Section 10.7.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following have been identified as AESIs based on their relevance for the current intended 
use:
Skin CancersSkin cancers (including BCC, SCC, and melanoma) appearing within or outside the TF during 
the study will be reported as AESIs. Details of the skin cancer and any other associated AE 
will be recorded in the AE form in the eCRF and by [CONTACT_231773]. The 
location and treatment will be recorded. In the ca se of an SCC arising within the TF, it will be 
recorded if an AK had been present at the same location at baseline. See Section 10.7.[ADDRESS_279628]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 39/6110.5.2 Focused Dermatological Examination of the Treatment 
Field
The focused dermatological examin ation will include evaluations for local tolerability signs, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and scarring in the TF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Local Tolerability
Local tolerability assessments in the TF will be recorded per the schedule in Table 1. The 
assessment for local tolerability is to be done  after the assessment for AEs. The evaluation of 
local tolerability is done by [CONTACT_737] (or an appropriate trained designee). The local 
tolerability signs to be assessed and the c orresponding grading scale for each sign are provided 
in Table 3.

Erythema
Flaking/scalingCrusting SwellingVesiculation/pustulation
Erosion/ulceration0=absent
1=mild (slightly, barely perceptible)2=moderate (distinct presence)3=severe (marked, intense)
Application site symptoms such as itching, burning, stinging, tenderness, pain etc., are not 
classified as local tolerability signs and will be reported as AEs.
All patients who have unresolved  local tolerability signs in the TF at Day 57/ET will return for 
additional follow-up every [ADDRESS_279629] retu rned to the baseline 
value, or are deemed stabilized by [CONTACT_737].Any sign of local tolerability leading to tempor ary or permanent discontinuation of the study 
drug application or requiring the use of concomitan t medications should be reported as an AE. 
If a sign of local tolerability leads to an AE meeting the criteria of seriousness (ie, an SAE), 
the SAE form will be completed with all the av ailable information and reported within the same 
timeframe and following the same routing as for an SAE (see Section 10.7.4 ).
In case of occurrence of possible contact [CONTACT_231774], an evaluation (patch test) will be 
made to confirm or rule out the diagnosis (see Appendix 2 ).

Physical Examinations
A complete PE includes height, weight, and an as sessment of head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, 
integumentary/dermatological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], musculoskeletal, 
neurological systems, and an expanded dermatolog ical examination to cover sun-exposed areas 
where photo-damage is likely. Height is measured at Screening only.Vital SignsMeasurement of vital signs will include blood pre ssure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body
temperature. Measurements of systolic and dias tolic blood pressure will be conducted after at 
least [ADDRESS_279631] also be recorded on the AE form in the eCRF.
10.5.5 Laboratory Testing
Routine laboratory assessments will be performed  at a designated central laboratory (refer to
the laboratory manual). Tests to be performed at the central laboratory are detailed in Table 4 .

Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279632]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 41/61Blood and urine samples for laboratory testing will be collected in appropriate sampling tubes
according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1) . Blood samples are to be collected before 
administration of concomitant med ications (if any), and after vital signs measures and ECGs
are performed. Significant findings that are obser ved after the patient has signed the ICF and 
that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded on the AE form in the eCRF.
Urine pregnancy testing for WOCBP will  be performed at the study site in accordance with the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).
10.6 Other
Standardized Photography
Standardized photography of each patient’s TF w ill be performed prior to dosing while on 
treatment (see Table 1) for illustrative purposes and to support the TF and AK lesion 
identification within the TF. Each AK lesion within the TF will be identified at the 
screening/baseline visit with a label placed over the skin, a photo will be captured as a reference 
to support AK lesion follow up during the stud y. Refer to the study manuals for detailed 
instructions.
Care must be taken to ensure that the sa me lighting, background, subject positioning relative 
to the camera, and camera settings are used  for each photograph. Equipment, supplies, and 
detailed instructions for obtaining and managin g the photographs will be provided to the 
clinical study site prior to the initiation of patient enrollment.
10.[ADDRESS_279633] medical occurre nce in a clinical trial participant, regardless 
of the administration of the IMP and its causal relationship to it.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable a nd unintended medical occurrence during the 
patient’s participation in the trial, including deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition, 
an abnormal value in a laboratory assessment, ECG abnormality, or an abnormal finding in the 
physical examination.
Adverse events must be temporally associated with the patient’s participation in the trial, ie,
occur after signing the ICF. At the time of the occurrence of an AE, the administration of the 
IMP does not need to have already been initiated . If initiated, it does not necessarily need to 
have a positive causal relationship to the event.
Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is an adverse event, which falls into one or more of the following categories:
xresults in death
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279634]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 42/61xis life-threatening (ie, an event which, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it oc curred.) It does not mean that the event might 
hypothetically have caused death if it was more severe or lasted longer
xrequires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231732] a congenital anomaly or birth defect
xis any other medically important event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other above outcomes.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exer cised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in  death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231733] . These are considered “other important medical 
events. ”
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231734].
Prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222970]-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_231735]/required in relation to the original reason for the initial admission,

10.7.[ADDRESS_279635] be recorded 
in the AE page of the eCRF and should be described in the following manner:
xThe nature of the AE will be described in pr ecise, standard medical terminology (ie, not 
necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_11581] t). If known, a specific diagnosis should be 
recorded instead of listing signs and symptoms (eg, allergic contact [CONTACT_8748])
xThe duration of the AE will be described by [CONTACT_231776] d ate and end date
xThe location for cutaneous adverse events will  be described as at or just around the TF
(≤2 cm from the TF) or distant (>2 cm from the TF)
xThe intensity of the AE will be described in terms of mild, moderate , or severe according to 
the Investigator’s clinical judgment , using the following definitions:
oMild : Awareness of event, symptoms, or signs, but easily tolerated (acceptable)
oModerate : Sufficient discomfort and interferes with usual activity (disturbing)
oSevere : Incapacitating with inability to do normal  daily living activities or significantly 
affects clinical status and warrants intervention (unacceptable)
xThe causal relationship of the event to use of the IMP will be described in terms of:
oNot related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, defi nitely not related to trial drug, as 
related to other drug, chemicals, or underlying disease
oUnlikely related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that 
makes a relationship improbable; disease or other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279636]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 43/61oPossibly related : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
relationship to drug intake; could also be e xplained by [CONTACT_231777]; information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear
oRelated : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with  a reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake, unlikely to be attributed to unde rlying disease or othe r drugs or chemicals; 
response to withdrawal clinically reasonable (positive dechallenge)
‘Possibly related ’ and ‘related’ will be considered as ‘related ’terms for reporting purposes. 
If the events are assessed as ‘unlikely related ’or ‘not related ’to the suspect IMP, the event
does not qualify for reporting purposes. In the absence of information on causality from the 
reporting Investigator, the CRO will immediate ly contact [CONTACT_231778] a causality assessment. The case will  be updated with the follow-up information and 
reported accordingly. If no causality is provide d by [CONTACT_737], the Sponsor assessment 
will be considered for submission purposes.
xThe outcome of the event will be described in terms of:
oRecovered/resolved
oRecovering/resolving
oRecovered/resolved with sequelae
oNot recovered/not resolved
oFatal
oUnknown
xThe action taken on the IMP will be captured as:oDrug withdrawn
oDose not changed
oNot applicable
An AE will be collected only once with its max imum severity, except when the AE started 
before first IMP administration and persisted afte r it and worsened in severity any time after 
first IMP application. In this latter case, the AE wi ll be collected with e ach respective severity. 
The AE term recorded must be exactly the same at the different time points where this AE is 
reported again in the eCRF.
10.7.3 Recording of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be collected from signature [CONTACT_231832] 57/ET. Any AE reported 
by [CONTACT_231779] [ADDRESS_279637] (Day 57/ET) should also be captured in 
the eCRF.
Medical disorders present at the time of signing the informed consent that are part of the 
patient’s medical history will only be considered AEs if they worsen after this time.
Abnormalities detected before IMP administration in the PE, laboratory tests, ECGs, or other 
safety assessments will not be considered AEs if already known as part of the medical history 
or in relation to prior medical conditions and will be recorded in the eCRF/CRF Medical 
History/physical examination form/page. However, abnormalities detected in 
screening/baseline tests, thought to be due to  a trial procedure, will be considered AEs.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279638]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 44/61Abnormalities (newly occurring or worsening of previously known abnormalities) detected 
after IMP administration in physical exam, labor atory tests, ECGs, or other safety assessments, 
which are considered clinically relevant by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator, or which require an intervention 
or a diagnosis test, or may result in the IMP discontinuation, should be reported as AEs.
Reported terms should accurately characterize the adverse event. When a patient experiences
an unspecified injury, signs or symptoms, active investigation should be conducted to reach a
final diagnosis. If reached, then the diseas e diagnosis is the preferred reported term.
Adverse events will be elicited by [CONTACT_231780]-leading questions (eg, "How do/did 
you feel? ”) and by [CONTACT_231781] 
a designee.
All AEs elicited by [CONTACT_231782]. In addition, when an AE meets the criteria of seriousness (ie, an SAE), it must 
also be recorded on the SAE form and report ed following the defined timelines in Section 
10.7.4.
10.7.[ADDRESS_279639]
Serious adverse events and AESIs will be collected from signature [CONTACT_231832] 57/ET.Any SAE or AESI reported by [CONTACT_231779] [ADDRESS_279640] (Day 57/ET)
should be collected in the eCRF.
The Investigator must report any SAE or AESI within 24 hours from the moment she/he first 
learns of it to the CRO pharmacovigilance unit on a SAE report form. This reporting will take place regardless of whether the Investigator consid ers the event to be causally related to the 
IMP(s), to any other medicinal product(s), to the clinical trial procedure or to any intervention 
undergone by [CONTACT_102].
Original reports are to be kept by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator in the Investigator’s File. 
Contact [CONTACT_231822].
The minimum information that must be included in the initial report is:
xAn event meeting the criteria of SAE or AESI.
xA qualifiable reporter, defined as an Invest igator of this trial or his/her delegate.
xA qualified patient, defined as a patient who has consented to this trial.
xA suspect medicinal product.
xThe I nvestigator’s causality assessment.
Unless the SAE or AESI has been sufficiently documented in the initial report, the Investigator 
will provide all available additional information in follow-up reports by [CONTACT_2329] a new form and 
adhering to the same routing and time frames as defined for the initial report. This will be 
continued until the event has been fully documented and reported.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279641]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 45/61An event reported to the CRO pharmacovigilan ce unit which does not meet the SAE or AESI 
criteria shall be nullified by [CONTACT_231784] a follow up report.
Depending on the local requirements, a regulatory report of the SAE or AESI (if serious) will 
be produced by [CONTACT_231785] t and submitted to relevant Competent 
Authorities and Investigators, when appl icable according to local regulations.
Serious adverse events NOT considered to require reporting to the CRO pharmacovigilance 
unit will be:

pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the participation in the trial.
10.7.5 Follow-up of Adverse Ev ents / Serious Adverse Events
Those AEs and SAEs, including AESIs, recorded for Screening failure patients will be 
followed-up until resolution or until otherwise agreed between the Sponsor and the 
Investigator.
All AEs and SAEs, including AESIs, that are still present after the last study visit (including 
AEs that have led to premature discontinuation), will be followed-up at least [ADDRESS_279642] 
or visit (whichever is considered more appropriat e by [CONTACT_737]). In case the AE/SAE is 
still ongoing after that time point, this will be followed-up until its resolution or until otherwise 
agreed between the Sponsor and the Investig ator. The same timeframes will apply for AEs 
from screening failures which are ongoing at the time the patient is withdrawn from the trial.
Additional safety data collected at a contact/ visit to follow-up the ongoing AE will not be 
included into the clinical database, if this was already locked; therefore, the clinical database 
lock will not be delayed due to this situati on. Any SAE will be followed up if needed after 
clinical database lock and the information w ill be only stored in the safety database.

Any pregnancy, whether occurring in a female patien t or in the female partner of a male patient, 
for which the estimated date of conception was duri ng the patient’s study participation must be 
reported. In addition, pregnancies in female partne rs of male patients for which the estimated 
date of conception was within [ADDRESS_279644] be reported.
In case of pregnancy during the participation in  the trial, the patient will be immediately

must complete a study specific pregnancy form upon confirmation of a pregnancy and send it 
to the CRO Safety Contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of confirmation of the pregna ncy. Pregnancy is not 
itself an AE or SAE; however, maternal/fetal co mplications or abnormalities will be recorded 
as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. 
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279645]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 46/61The Investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion or until  pregnancy termination 
and, in the case of a live-born offspring, the follo w-up period will be d eemed to have ended 
when the health status of the child has been determined on its birth or after an appropriate 
period post-delivery considered necessary to monitor the development of the new-born is 
completed.
The patient will be asked to provide informati on on the outcome of the pregnancy, including 
premature termination should the case arise. S pontaneous miscarriage, developmental delay, 
fetal death, SAE in a neonate, and congenital ab normalities will be reported as SAEs. The 
Investigator will inform the CRO Safety Contact [CONTACT_231823] a follow-up to the initial 
pregnancy form. All pregnancies s hould be reported to the sponsor and, when applicable, to 
the ethics committee.

[CONTACT_231788]. Any data en try and corrections made in the eCRF must 
have a respective audit trail where the correcti on is dated, the individual making the correction 
is identified, the reason for the change is s tated, and the original data are not obscured. Only 
data required by [CONTACT_231789].
A list of all authorized data originators (ie, persons, systems, devices, and instruments) should 
be developed and maintained by [CONTACT_231790].
The eCRF is an auditable electronic record of  information reported to the Sponsor on each trial 
patient, according to this clinical investig ation protocol. The eCRF enables clinical 
investigation data to be systematically captur ed, reviewed, managed, stored, analyzed, and 
reported.
12.1 Data Collection
12.1.1 Identification of the Trial Data Sources
Source data includes all information in original rec ords and certified copi [INVESTIGATOR_95937], observations, or other activi ties in a clinical investigation used for 
reconstructing and evaluating the investigation.When a device or instrument is the data origina tor (eg, blood pressure monitoring device or 
glucometer) and data are automa tically transmitted directly to the eCRF, the eCRF is the 
source.Access to source data is critical to the review a nd inspections of clinical investigations. Source 
data should be attributable, legible, contempor aneous, original, and accurate (ALCOA) and 
must meet the regulatory requirements for recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].The trial data sources are outlined below:
xSigned informed consent forms
xPatient medical history records will include tr ial diagnosis and inclusion/exclusion criteria 
age, sex, demographics, physical examinat ion, medical history, vital signs, previous 
medication, original or certified copy of a lab oratory reports, instrument printout, trial 
progress notes of the physician
xLaboratory test results reports (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, etc)
xDigital photographs
xePatient diary (Study App)
xeCRF
12.1.[ADDRESS_279652]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 50/61For trial data elements transcri bed from paper or electronic to the eCRF, the electronic or paper 
documents from which the data elements are transcribed are the source. 
These data must be maintained by [CONTACT_231824] (eg, an original or certified copy of a laboratory report, instrument printout, progress 
notes of the physician, the trial patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), nurses’ notes ).
Direct Entry of Data Into the eCRF
The direct entry of data can eliminate errors by [CONTACT_50337] a paper transcription step before entry 
in the eCRF. For the following data elements, the eCRF may be the source:
xDate of ICF signature (in the case of a paper ICF; in the case of an electronic ICF the 
eConsent will be the source)
xInclusion and exclusion criteria confirmation (checking)
xPatient demographics and physical examinati on, including. age, gender, race, ethnicity 
height, weight, and Fitzpatrick skin type
xRelevant previous and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_231737]-to-date relevant medical hi story, including trial diagnosis
xTF measurements and location (face or scalp)
xNumber of lesions in the TF and identificati on of whether each lesion is new or existed at 
baseline
xVital signs (blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])
xPregnancy test results
xTrial/visit dates 
xVisit assessment (checking compliance, trial diary data, drug application, blood sample 
collection, tolerability score, end of treatment)
xDrug accountability (medication given and re turned and product weight before and after 
application)
xAdverse events
For the above trial data elements, the eCRF is the source. If a paper transcription step is used, 
then the paper documentation should be retained and made available for monitoring or 
inspection.
Direct data entry should meet ALCOA+ principles for  data integrity in life sciences. In case 
trial data cannot be entered at the time of the pa tient visit, eg, laboratory tests results, then 
Investigators are requested to make their entries at the time when the report with the results is 
received.All non-CRF entered external data (ie, images) will  not be loaded into the eCRF, but it will be 
integrated in SAS datasets and reconciled freq uently with the eCRF data by [CONTACT_231792].
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279653]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 51/61The information directly collected in the eCRF  must match the source documents. The source 
data verification will be performed by [CONTACT_231793] (monitor) 
according to the requirements specified in the Monitoring Plan.
At the trial end, the CRO will generate a PDF copy of the completed CRFs which will be sent
to the Investigator(s) for all patien ts enrolled at his or her location.
12.1.[ADDRESS_279654] the patients at the Day1/Baseline 
visit, and as many times as dee med necessary. Patients will also  receive written instructions on 
the Study App use. The Study App will be installed onto the patient’s own mobile phone, and
there will also be the possibility to provide patients with a mobile phone, if necessary. The 
Study App will be installed onto the mobile phone  during the baseline visit. Clinical personnel 
will check and confirm the correct in stallation of the Study App during the visit.
On the Study App, patients will:
xReceive notifications, communications, and re minders through the patient retention tool
xComplete the eDiary: Patients, and assisted by [CONTACT_50633], as needed, will complete a diary 
to record daily the study treatment appli cation dates and times of application. The eDiary
will be completed by [CONTACT_231794] (or designee) in 
accordance with the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1).
At the study end, the Investigator will receive a CD/DVD with the mobile application data (in 
PDF) from the patients enrolled at his/her lo cation. The Investigator will keep this CD/DVD
with the rest of the original data for as l ong as required by [CONTACT_427]. The mobile 
application files are relevant documentation for registration.
The mobile application data is the sole property of the Sponsor and should not be available in 
any form to third parties without the written  permission of the Sponsor, except to authorized 
representatives of appropriate Competent Authorities.
12.2 Data Management and Quality Control
Data Management of the trial will be perform ed by [CONTACT_231795], according to 
Almirall SOPs.
In order to facilitate the collection of accurate a nd complete data, the CRO will target the risks 
associated with critical trial data and these will be documented into the Data Management Plan 
(DMP) and the Monitoring Plan.
Investigators will respond to any query gene rated by [CONTACT_231796].
Main Data Management activities and procedures will be accurately described in the DMP, 
created by [CONTACT_231797].
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279655]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 52/61Database checks will be programmed by [CONTACT_2024] , based on the Data Validation Plan. The
listings will be documented in the DMP. The checks and listings  programming will be 
appropriately validated by [CONTACT_2024].
Reconciliation of trial da ta and SAEs between Clinical and Drug Safety databases will be 
performed by [CONTACT_231798] e database lock. Procedures to be followed 
will be detailed in the DMP.
Encoding of specific data will  be conducted by [CONTACT_2024]. For this  trial, medical history, AEs, 
and concomitant medications (including resc ue medications) will be coded; Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and WHO-DRUG Enhanced dictionaries will 
be used, version number of each dictionary will be documented in the DMP.
A Quality Control check to ensure the accur acy of the data will be done by [CONTACT_2024], when 
data are cleaned on an ongoing basis and just before the database lock. Specifications of the 
Quality Control check will be found in the DMP.
An audit trail will be maintained in order to prot ect the authenticity and integrity of the clinical 
data.
12.3 Investigator and Trial Master Files
The Investigator's file and Sponsor Trial Master File (TMF) will contain all trial documents 
indicated in the ICH GCP guidelines and local regulations. 
At the trial end the Investigator will receive one CD/DVD/USB key with the electronic data 
capture (EDC) data, as well as one CD/DVD wi th the tablet PC and electronic Patient Diary 
data from the patients enrolled at his/her loca tion. The Investigator will keep these in the 
Investigator’s file.
The CRO will provide Almirall with an electro nic TMF (eTMF). Almirall will have on-line 
access to the eTMF during the study and study documents will be reviewed, approved, and 
managed within the system. At the end of the st udy the eTMF and complete audit trail will be 
transferred to the TMF-dedicated Sponsor serv er for long-term storage. Information about 
eTMF contents, index, structure, nomenclatu re, metadata, and oversight metrics will be 
detailed in other documents (ie, eTMF Management Plan, CROOP, etc.).
All records must be stored in a secure fa cility protected from fire, flood, and unauthorized 
access where they may be readily accessed in the event of an audit or inspection.
12.[ADDRESS_279656] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_231738] (ie, completed and signed eCRF or 
certified copy of the eCRF). The Investigator maybe requested by [CONTACT_231799]. 
When data elements are transcribed from paper sources into an eCRF, the Investigator must 
also retain the paper sources, or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , for later review. Other records (electronic and 
paper) required to corroborate data in the eCRF  may also be requested during an inspection.
Clinical Trial M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279657]-0002178 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL 53/61All trial data (including elect ronic data), all hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_231739], consent forms, 
CRFs, queries and printouts, and all essential doc uments relating to the conduct of the clinical 
trial will be stored at the research site for a period of 25 years after completion of the trial, 
unless otherwise communicated in writing by [CONTACT_1034].
CROs/vendors will store the databases, including audit trails and related documentation, for a 
period of 25 years after completi on of the trial, unless local regulations or institutional policies 
require a longer retention period. No records  may be destroyed during the retention period 
without the written approval of the Sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location 
or party without written notification to the Sponsor.
13 Quality Control and Quality Assurance

Letter of Protocol Clarification - Administrative Change 1
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label, Single-arm Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Tolerability of Tirbanibulin Ointment 1% Applied to a Field of
Approximately 100 cm2on the Face or Balding Scal p in Adult Patients with 
Actinic Keratosis
Protocol Number: M-[ZIP_CODE]-32
Date: 03-JAN-2023
Dear Investigator(s), 
After the issuance of M-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_279675] 
development of the trial, clarifications were determi ned to be needed in relation to the completion 
of patient's eDiary.
At section “12.1.3 Patient Diary”, the protocol details the usage of an electronic diary (Study App) 
to record daily the study treatment applicat ion dates and times of application for the above-
mentioned study, to be completed by [CONTACT_1766]. However, in case of need, a paper diary was also 
developed as an alternative when needed.
This contingency plan was not included in the protoc ol by [CONTACT_86966], and therefore it is not listed in 
the section “12.1.1 Identification of the Tr ial Data Source” as a valid source document.
The mentioned paper diary was developed, submitte d, and approved by [CONTACT_231827]. However, since this cont ingency plan was not included in the Protocol,
there was the need to issue this clarification letter to specify that both the Study App and the paper 
diary, when applicable, are considered trial data sources for study treatment application dates and
times.
Since this is a minor correction, an ame ndment to the Protocol is not expected.

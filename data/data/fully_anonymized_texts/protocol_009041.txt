1. SIGNIFICANCE  
1.1. Improving caries detection is a high oral health priority  
 
Caries  is the world’s most common dental disease . The WHO estimates that 60-
90% of school children and nearly all adults 
have dental caries at some point in time (1). 
If carious lesions are detected early enough, 
i.e. before cavitation, they can be arrested  
and remineralized by [CONTACT_105] -surgical means.  
When left undetected , they could evolve into 
more serious and destructive conditions that 
may require expensive  restorations, 
endodontic treatment, and , in some cases 
extractions. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_900558] (CT) , the diagnostic 
accuracy for caries h as not seen significant 
improvement in many years and  remain s low.   
The sensitivity  of 2D intraoral radiography , the current gold standard  for caries 
diagnosis,  ranges  from 3 0% to 70% for  different types of caries , due to the fundamental 
limitation  of structure superimposition  (2, 3) . Cone -beam CT (CBCT)  requires as much 
as 100X the radiation , but does NOT  improve caries detection  due to its inferior 
resolution and imaging  artifacts  compared with intraoral imaging (4-8). The diagnostic 
accuracy for some other common dental conditions such as root fractures, and 
periodontal bone loss (Figure 1) have also remained low  (9, 10) . There  is a clear 
clinical and market need  for better diagnostic technologies . 
1.2. We have invented a new technology with significantly increased sensitivity   
Our invention , stationary intraoral tomosynthesis (s -IOT), overcomes the 
limitations of the current dental imaging technologies for diagnosis of dentoalve olar 
diseases (11, 12) . It provides depth information and removes structural overlaps  that 
obscure anatomical details  in 2D imaging. It offers better in -plane resolution, less   
  
Figure 1: 1st row: 2D intraoral x -ray 
(left) and dental CBCT (right). 2nd row: 
schematics of caries, vertical root 
fracture and periodontal bone loss, 
which are difficult to detect with the 
current technologies.  

 [ADDRESS_1262758]  (Figure 2). Our 
preliminary results have shown 
that s-IOT provide s significantly 
increased detection sensitivity , 
more accurate assessment of 
lesion depth and improved 
interpretation ease across a 
wide variety of clinical settings  
compared to the current dental 
imaging technologies .  
The clinical applications  of s-IOT are not limited to caries detection, but include 
secondary caries detection, root fracture detection, alveolar bone ass essment, root 
anatomy and periapi[INVESTIGATOR_900559] , 3D assessment of dental developmental 
anomalies, and preliminary implant site assessment.  Early disease detection and 
treatment will promote the oral health of patients worldwide.  
1.3. Pathway for clinical translation and commercialization  
 The dental community has received the s -IOT technology enthusiastically . Over 
80% of the [ADDRESS_1262759] from the  dental association , and 
was recently featured in “ Dentistry Today ” and on the WRAL Evening News 
(http://wral.com/14923174 ). 
Steps toward t ranslation and commercialization : (1) The f easibility study was 
performed with funding from a recently completed NIH SBIR grant; (2) Two patent 
applications were filed by [CONTACT_900564] ; (3) Xintek formed a new 
subsidiary  XinVivo to commercialize the technology;  (4) S eed equity investment  has 
been secured  to construct the first clinical prototype ; and (5) Potential partnershi ps with 
market leaders (Carestream Dental and Planmeca ) are under discussion.   Key features:  
 Significantly higher 
sensitivity than 2D x -ray 
and CT  
 Low dose (same as 2D 
intraoral)  
 Low cost compared to 
CT 
 Short image time (1 s)  
 Seamless integration 
with current data 
management system  
 Perform all tasks of 
current 2D intraoral  
Figure 2:  An illustration of the s -IOT device and its k ey 
advantages comparing to 2D intraoral and CBCT.  

 [ADDRESS_1262760] (13).  A variation of this technique called Tuned 
Aperture CT (14) (TACT) was shown to improve  the diagnostic accuracy for a number of 
tasks compared to 2D intraoral x -ray in bench -top phantom studies (14, 15) . The 
technology  however was not feasible for patient imaging . It took ~30 minutes for a scan 
(vs. ~ 1 s for a 2D x -ray) and required high operator skills for positioning, because the x-
ray tube needed to be precisely moved and positioned at different locations to acquire 
the multiple  projection images . The image reconst ruction time was also very long due to 
inefficient algorithm.   
The working mechanism of s -IOT is illustrated in Figure 3:  (1) A carbon nanotube 
(CNT) x -ray array technology invented by [CONTACT_87220] (16-18) is utilized to 
generate a scanning x -ray from different directions without any mechanical motion; (2) A 
high-frame -rate digital intraoral sensor captures the projection images in 
synchroni zation with the x -ray exposure; (3)  
 6  An optical pattern recognition 
method developed in our lab is used to 
determine the imaging geometry; and  
(4) A high -speed iterative 
reconstruction algorithm written by [CONTACT_3019] 
(19) processes the projection images to 
generate tomosynthesis image slices in 
real-time.  In s-IOT, a complete 3D 
scan ta kes less than 1 second;  the total 
imaging dose used is the same as a 
single 2D intraoral  radiograph .  The 3D 
tomosynthesis slices are reconstructed 
and displayed layer by [CONTACT_900565] “virtually dissect” the 
object.  
2.2. Preliminary results : s-IOT outperform s current dental imaging modalities.   
 A bench -top s -IOT device  was constructed and used for evaluation and system 
optimization. The performance was compared with clinical 2D intraoral x -ray by [CONTACT_900566] (20) and extracted human t eeth. Figure 3 shows examples of phantom 
images where : (1) carious lesions are missed or bar ely discernable on the 2D image 
(B), but are clearly visible in the tomosynthesis reconstruction slices  (C,D) ; (2) s-IOT 
clearly resolved the front and back roots  of the up per molar teeth (C, D) that was 
overlapped in the 2D image (B);  and (3) s -IOT identified root fractures  (D) that was 
missing in 2D (B).  
A reader study was performed  with e ight experien ced UNC dental radiologists 
reviewing the images of the extrac ted huma n teeth taken from s -IOT and 2D intraoral. 
Micro -CT images served as the ground truth.  The results showed that  the average 
sensitivity  of s-IOT increased  by 36%  compared to that of 2D intraoral , the largest 
reported  increase  by [CONTACT_900567] , without compromising  
specificity  or increasing the  imaging dose .

intraoral x -ray. Reconstructed s -IOT image 
slices of the same phantom, at two different 
depths, showing: 1) mesial and distal buccal 
roots (C) and the palatal (D), 2) all 3 simulated 
caries, and 3) fracture (D). In contrast, 2D x -ray 
(B) did not resolve the root structure, missed 
one caries, and missed the fracture (12).  

 [ADDRESS_1262761] an experienced interdisciplinary team  
Our team of physicists  (Zhou, Lu ) and maxillofacial radiolog ists (Platin,  Mol) are the 
inventors of  the s -IOT technology, with extensive  experienc e in developi[INVESTIGATOR_900560] (21-23), clinical dental imaging, and commercialization. NC 
TraCS statistician ( Zeng ) will help perform the statistical data analysis. Zhou and Lu 
invented the C NT x -ray source array, the key enabling tech nology . We developed a  
novel micro -CT scanner , installed at UNC and Iowa for biomedical research; a 3D 
mammography sys tem and a 3D lung imaging device , currently  under clinical  
evaluation . Zhou and Lu have equity stakes in Xint ek, the UNC spin -off.  
A conflict of interest  committee has been es tablish ed at UNC to oversee potential  COI 
issues.  
3. APPROACH  
3.1. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Characterization and C ertification of Prototype Device  
System characterization : The s-IOT prototype system will be characterized using 
phantoms  following our previously established procedure (20). X-ray collimation , which  
is essential for safety and reducing the imaging dose , will be evaluated. The dose at the 
patient position will be measured using a calibrated solid -state dosimeter  to insure FDA 
compliance.  The geometry calibration  procedure  will be e valuated against an 
established method (24). Quanti tative image quality evaluation  will be performed. Key 
system performance parameters including the system modulation transfer function 
(MTF), artifacts spread function (ASF), contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and signal 
differential to noise ratio (SdNR) will be measured (25, 26) . Imaging time and 
consistency  will be evaluated . The custom -made iterative reconstruction software will be 
evaluat ed against commercial reconstruction software .  All the facilities needed for this 
study are available in the PI’s lab.  
Certification : The system will be installed in the UNC -School of Dentis try (SOD)  
Radiology C linic. Product safety testing and certification will be perform ed by [CONTACT_900568] ( www.metlabs.com ), which we have previously engaged for two ot her x -
ray imaging systems (27).   We will work with the UNC EHS to ensure the system 
satisfies radiation safety requirement . SOD has committed the space for this study.  
 8 3.2. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Clinical Evaluation and Patient E xperience  
Patient selection and image acquisition:  Fifty patients referred to the UNC Section of 
Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology for bitewing or full -mouth series exams will be recruited 
following completion of their ordered radiographic exams.  Patients with moderate 
caries will be approached about participation in the study. Consenting patients will then 
receive a 4-bitewing  exam using the s -IOT sys tem. We  will acquire both the ordered 
conventional radiographic exam and the s -IOT exam. The sam e group of patients will 
be tested  for both car ies detection evaluation and patient care experience.   
Caries detection: Three UNC SOD dentists will be recruited to independently review 
each radiographic exam to diagnose caries presence/absence. Discrepancies between 
reviewers will be reconciled by [CONTACT_21128].  
Verification:  In vivo assessment of the true state of a proximal tooth surface is 
challenging. For the purpose of this study, cases where a proximal tooth surface 
received a caries diagnosis on the s -IOT images and not on the conventional im ages, or 
vice versa, are of particular interest. For these cases, the patient’s clinician will be 
contact[CONTACT_900569].  
Data analysis : The goal of the data analysis is t o test (1) whether differences in the 
caries detection rate between s -IOT and conventional radiographs are present and (2), 
if so, whether these differences result from s -IOT being more sensitive. With 50 patients 
x 4 images/patient x ~4 teeth/image x 2 su rfaces/tooth = [ADDRESS_1262762] for paired nominal data, such as the McNemar’s test, would be used to 
test the first hypothesis while accounting for within -patient a nd within -tooth/image 
correlations. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy are calculated from the 
clinically verified cases to characterize and quantify the modalities and will be compared 
regarding the second component of the hypothesis. To obt ain proper inference to 
account for complex correlations within the same patient, or the same tooth, or the 
same image, resampling approach based on bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_181898] [ADDRESS_1262763] variances for all statistics. NC TraCS statis tician (Zeng) will help 
perform the above data analysis . 
 9 Patie nt experience: Each subject will be given a brief survey regarding the overall 
comfort, time, and experience differences between the two imaging systems. The 
investigators will also complete a similar brief survey regarding the overall confidence in 
diagnosis, time, and the number of required radiograph ic re-takes. The statistical 
different between two images systems will be analyzed.  
4. RISK AND REMEDY  
Our team has conside rable experience in characterizing, and certifying medical 
devices. We do not anticipate any risk in this aspect of the project. Prior to 
implementation, the Radiation Safety Committee and IRB will assess  this study . There 
is minimal risk to participants, investigators, and s tudy personnel. The radiation dose 
from the s -IOT exam is comparable to the dose from the conventional 2D bitewing 
exam, dictating that the additional radiation burden to the patient represents no greater 
than minimal risk and technically does not require review and approval by [CONTACT_138305] (5 or 
fewer dental x -rays). Given the high patient volum e at the UNC SOD , we do not 
anticipate problems with patient availabil ity and recruitment . The sampling, [ADDRESS_1262764] the diagnostic 
differences.

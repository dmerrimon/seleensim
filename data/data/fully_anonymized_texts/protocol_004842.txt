Version: [ADDRESS_901796] Goals : Type 2 diabetes is a complex disease where hyperglycemia occurs as a result of the 
development of insulin resistance.  It is often associated with obesity and is characterized by [CONTACT_157710], 
hyperinsulinemia, as well as hyperleptinemia.  In addition to the problems associated with poor glucose control, 
type 2 diabetes is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory state.  This  chronic  inflammatory  state leads to a 
number of associated complications, including cardiovascular disease.  Diabetes increases one’s r isk for 
cardiovascular disease by  2-4 fold1, highlighting the importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_667622]’s risk of cardiovascular di sease.   The monetary  impact of diabetes  on our 
healthcare system continues to grow as well.  C urrently 25.8 million children and adults (8.3% of the 
population) in the [LOCATION_002] suffer from diabetes2.  In addition to established traditional treatment options, 
one new approach has focused on blocking glucose reabsorption by [CONTACT_667631].  This project will elucidate molecular and cellular mechan isms behind the 
potential cardio protective  effects of a new class of antihyperglycemic, sodium glucose co -transporter 2 
(SGLT2) inhbitors.   We will also investigate clinically a potential mechanism underlying the effect of these 
drugs on lowering blood pr essure ( BP) and raising potassium (K) . 
 
Rationale : Clinical trials of two SGLT2 inhibitors, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, have reported drops in 
systolic blood pressure of ~5 mmHg3, 4. Inappropriate activation of intrarenal renin -angio tensin system (RAS) is 
a major contributor to the increased arterial pressure and tissue injury including diabetic nephropathy. A key 
factor in the intrarenal RAS activation is stimulation  of intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT)  which is the 
precursor of angiotensin peptides5.  In animal models of type1  and type [ADDRESS_901797] treatment of rat renal 
proximal tubular cells (PTC) with high glucose results in stimulation of AGT prod uction9.  These findings 
suggest that h yperglycemia  augments intrarenal AGT levels in diabetes mellitus leading to the development of 
high blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy.   
 
 
By [CONTACT_667632], SGLT2 inhibition has the potential to block the AGT 
elevating effect of hyperglycemia. We therefore submit the following : 
 
Hypothesis  1: SGLT2 inhibition attenuates renal AGT  elevation  by [CONTACT_667633], renoprotection and cardio protection  in diabetes mellitus.  This effect can be elucidated by 
[CONTACT_667634] 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABPM)  
 
We will test this hypothesis in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_667623]: 
 
Aim 1.  Explor ing the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on intra -renal AGT production in subjects with diabetes  
mellitus , who are known to have augmentation of intra – renal AGT.  
 
This will be a  cross -over pi[INVESTIGATOR_667624], as well 
as the rise in K, in humans with diabetes.

Background  
 
 
Specific Aim: Explore the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on intra -renal AGT 
production in subjects with diabetes, who are known to have augmentation of intra 
– renal AGT.  
Rationale : We have recently demonstrated that urinary AGT is increased in patients 
with diabetes, incl uding patients with diabetes without microalbuminuria and 
hypertension  (not yet published) . The increase is greatest in those with established 
nephropathy and hypertension, suggesting that this activation occurs early and may contribute to both 
hypertensio n and proteinuria.  Since SGLT2 inhibitors are approved only for type [ADDRESS_901798] of the BP reduction on vasc ular compliance and augmentation index – indirect 
measures of endothelial function that are non -invasive and have been shown to be predictors of CV outcomes.  
 
The RAS has been portrayed as an endocrine, paracrine, autocrine and intracrine system and thus it has been 
difficult to delineate the quantitative contributions of systemically delivered versus locally formed Ang peptides 
to the levels existing in any given tissue. Emerging evidence indicates that local formation is of major 
significance in the regu lation of the Ang levels  in many organs and tissues. Various studies have demonstrated 
the importance of tissue RAS in the brain, heart, adrenal glands, vasculature, as well as in the kidney. While 
every organ system in the body has elements of the RAS, th e kidney is unique in having every component of the 
RAS with compartmentalization in the tubular and interstitial networks as well as intracellular accumulation.  In 
this regard, the kidneys, as well as the adrenal glands, are unique in terms of the tissue  concentrations of Ang II 
which are much greater than can be explained by [CONTACT_667635]. 
Indeed, the major fraction of Ang II present in renal tissues is generated locally from AGT delivered to the 
kidney as well a s from AGT locally produced by [CONTACT_667636].  Ang I delivered to the kidney can also 
be converted to Ang II.   
 
Additional studies demonstrated that urinary excretion rate of AGT is closely correlated with systolic blood 
pressure and kidney Ang II  content, but not with plasma Ang II concentration. This increase was not just due to 
increased proteinuria, or increased filtration of AGT into the tubular fluid.  The results indicate that urinary 
AGT originates primarily from the kidneys and not from th e plasma.   
 
The principal action of ACE inhibition is a disruption of the conversion of Ang I to Ang II and consequently, 
inhibition of the Ang II effects such as vasoconstriction.  Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may trigger 
additional events as  a result of protection of other peptides. Inhibition of ACE also prevents degradation of 
kinins into inactive peptides.  Kinins act as endogenous vasodilators via stimulation of nitric oxide and release 
vasodilatory prostaglandins; thus kinins contribute to renal vasodilatory actions of ACE inhibitors, particularly 
in the medullary circulation.  Indeed, blockade of ACE or deletion of kidney ACE reduces the severity of the 
hypertension that develops with chronic Ang II or Ang I infusions showing that ACE me diated de novo 
formation of Ang II is an essential step in the full development of hypertension.  Ang II receptor blockers 
(ARB) are a specific class of antagonists that block AT 1 receptors at the tissue level.  Angiotensin II, generated 
by [CONTACT_105] -ACE mechani sms, could be blocked at the receptor level by [CONTACT_667637].  However, increases in Ang II 
concentration after ARB therapy may stimulate AT 2 receptors  if receptors are not fully blocked .   
 

 
Version: [ADDRESS_901799] in the potential hope for reduction in morbidity and mortality by [CONTACT_667638] 1 or oth er ore 
steps in the RAS. Accordingly, the assessment of urinary AGT as an early biomarker of the status of the 
intrarenal RAS may be of substantial importance. It may be particularly helpful in serving as a means to 
determine efficacy of the treatment to r educe intrarenal angiotensin II levels.  
 
In our experience urinary AGT remains elevated in patients treated with ACEI or ARBs and present a novel 
treatment target (with an easily measurable biomarker)  
 
 
Hypothesis  2:  SGLT2 inhibition will reduce urinary AGT in subjects with 2 diabetes, and this reduction will 
correlate with reduction in BP .  
 
Rationale:  
Progression of hypertension and nephropathy in diabetes mellitus (DM). Elevated levels of angiotensinogen 
(AGT) are found in the urine of patients with type 1 DM and RAS blockade is commonly used to slow or 
prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy.  AGT is upregulated in proximal tubular cells (PTC) exposed 
to high glucose conditions in response to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (R OS). AGT forms 
angiotensin II (Ang II) which further upregulates AGT via angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) 
activation.AT1R signaling is another major source of ROS generation in PTC11 and AT1R blockade attenuates 
high glucose -induced AGT expression.[ADDRESS_901800] completely reabs orbed in the proximal 
tubules. Sodium -glucose co -transporter 2 (SGLT2) is located in the early segment of the proximal tubule and is 
responsible for the majority of glucose reabsorption. Increased expression of SGLT2 and glucose reabsorption 
are observed i n DM, but the mechanisms remain unclear.  Ang II increases SGLT2 expression in hypertensive 
rats, but it is not known if AT1R activation in PTC is responsible. Recently, pharmacological blockade of 
SGLT2 has been developed as a treatment strategy for DM whi ch normalizes blood glucose levels by [CONTACT_667639]. SGLT2 inhibition also leads to decreased blood pressure and renoprotective effects.22, 
23, [ADDRESS_901801] a  potential role for SGLT2 in the activation of the intrarenal RAS. H owever, it is 
not known if glucose entry via SGLT2 mediates high glucose -induced AGT expression in PTC.  
 
 
Preliminary Studies  
Immortalized mouse proximal tubule cells consists of cells originating from the early segment of the mouse 
proximal tubule.To demonstrate the effects of high glucose on AGT expression in this cell line, mPTCs were 
seeded on 6 -well plates at a density of 5. 0 x 105 cells per well. Before treatment in high glucose, the cells were 
rinsed with PBS and treated in 1.5 mL serum -free DMEM (5 mM glucose) for 8 hours. For high glucose 
treatment, serum -free Dulbecco Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) was  supplemented with glucose to a final 
concentration of 5 mM (control), 15 mM, or 25 mM (n = 4). The  cells were incubated at 37 ºC for 24 hours. 
After treatment, cell lysates were prepared. AGT protein was detected via western blot analysis.  
The results of this experiment sho wed that our mPTC cell line exhibits a significant increase in AGT expression 
under high glucose conditions (15 mM and 25 mM glucose) compared to normal glucose (5 mM glucose).  
To test the effects of high glucose on AGT mRNA, cells were cultured as previou sly described in serum -free 
DMEM with 5 mM or 25 mM glucose (n = 3) and incubated at 37 ºC.  
 
Version: 062019  Page 5 
 After 24 hours, AGT mRNA was quantified via qRT -PCR. AGT mRNA relative to GAPDH mRNA was found 
to be significantly higher after treatment in 25 mM glucose.  
 
The res ults of these preliminary experiments demonstrate that our mPTC line exhibits very low expression of 
AGT under normal glucose conditions (5 mM).  
 
The impact of treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor on intra –renal AGT production is unknown. Additionally, it 
is unclear what the impact of having significant glycosuria will have on AGT production. Finally, it is important 
to determine if there are differential effects on AGT production between SGLT2 inhibition and other methods 
of improving glycemic control, such  as Sulfonylurea therapy  
 
 
Proposed Studies   
 
We propose to conduct a  single -center  randomized , double blind , cross over study of the effect of Dapagliflozin  
over 6 weeks , followed by [CONTACT_667640] 6 weeks  on the other treatment allocation  (those getting pl acebo first 
will cross over to Dapagliflozin and vice versa) . Treatment will be stratified according to the underlying 
presence or absence of hypertension.

6 weeks, patients will then undergo another assessment before being provided SU for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 
weeks, patients will undergo assessment again.  The aim is to determine whether any effects seen with 
Dapagliflozin are specific to that drug or related simply to improved glycemic control.

Measurements:  
1- Blood pressure will be measured as per clinical practice and we will also do a 24 hr . ambulatory 
blood pressure monitoring before and after 6 weeks of treatment in the Dapagliflozin / placebo  arm 
as well as before and 6 weeks after treatment in the Sulfonylurea/placebo arm  
2- We will also measure vascular compliance/ endothelial function using  the EndoPAT  test at the  same  
visits  as the ABPM  only in the Dapagliflozin/placebo arm . 
3- Spot and 24 hour urine will be collected. Urine samples will be obtained, before and after treatment . 
After appropriate processing, the samples will be  quickly stored a t -20°C, and analyzed for 
concentrations of AGT, albumin, and creatinine within one week of collection as previously 
described. The urinary AGT concentrations and urinary albumin concentrations will be normalized 
by [CONTACT_667644]. Urine  creatinine will also be measured and urine AGT/ 
creatinine calculated to correct the AGT for volume of excretion. Plasma K, renin and AGT will be 
measured at these visits.   
4- Fasting plasma glucose will be measured for the Dapagliflozin/placebo and sulfonyl urea arm at the 
following time points: a) at baseline and end of period 1 and b) at baseline and end of period 2.  
Blood and urine will be stored at -70°C, for future testing of other biomarkers of renal and 
cardiovascular disease.

V2 12/30/[ADDRESS_1039074] of practice at Indiana University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_758913]  (QL)  block using liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB) for these patients to help 
with postoperative analg esia. With the current  literature  (mostly orthopedic surgery)  suggesting 
that LB might not provide superior analgesia compare d to standard bu pi[INVESTIGATOR_40473] 
(SB), our study  aims to compare the difference in duration of analgesia between the two dru gs 
when it’s used for colorectal surgeryTo date, there are no data published on these two drugs 
being compared in colorectal surgery, which is significantly different from orthopedic surgery.  
 
LB has good analgesia coverage for up to 72 hours postoperativ e when compared to normal 
saline and has been suggested to reduce postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_391617]. [6, 7] Yu et al 
performed a meta -analysis looking at the effectiveness of LB vs SB in total knee arthroplasty, 
and found that LB resulted in decreased VAS p ain scores at 72 hours, but not at 24 or 48 hours. 
[8]. In contrast, Ma et al showed that LB provided better pain relief as assessed by [CONTACT_485680] 24 
hours in total hip arthroplasty, but not at 48 or 72 hours.[9] When Knudson et al studied LB vs 
SB in colorect al surgeries, they found no difference in the use of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_758914].[10] In these studies, LB shows promise in providing superior postoperative 
analgesia compared to SB, but few studies directly compare them. Our study direc tly compares 
equal volumes of LB and SB in QL blocks for laparoscopic colorectal surgery.  
 
The QL block, first described by [CONTACT_758928]  2007, provides postoperative regional anesthesia 
targeting the T7-T12 branches of thoracolumbar nerves. There are at least  four described 
techniques to performing the QL block,  with studies still needing to be performed to compare 
their efficacy .[1-3] Our study will utilize the intramuscular approach to the QL block. In this 
technique, an ultrasound  probe is used to follow the needle tip into the QL muscle. Local 
anesthetic is injected and its spread between the fascia and the muscle to provide the block ade of 
the nerves. [3]  
 
We plan to use Expa rel®, or a liposomal form ulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], as the analgesia for the 
study arm and SB for the control arm. [4-7] Because Expa rel® is in liposomal form, the lipid 
solubility allows bupi[INVESTIGATOR_758915]. It is reported to 
provide long -lasting analgesia for up to 72 hours and may result in decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_758916].  Exparel® use for QL block is our current standard of 
practice.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1039075] been used as postoperative analgesia in 
prior studies. [8-15] The specific aim of this study is to compare the difference between the pain 
control methods in achieving the following:  
 
3 
  
1. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_174061]  
2. Improved postoperative pain scores  
3. Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293] (Nausea, sedation, ileus, urinary ret ention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826])  
 
The primary endpoint of this study will be VAS pain score. The VAS scores will be taken with 
both rest and movement.  
 
The secondary endpoint includes intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_242616] 
(nausea, sedation, ileus, urinary retention, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]). The IV and PO opi[INVESTIGATOR_391618] 1, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_1039076] flatus, incidence of 
urinary retention, incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], ambulation activity, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7947].

4.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
All laparoscopic colorectal surgery cases scheduled by [CONTACT_758929][INVESTIGATOR_242620]. Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_242640] -to-face prior to surgery  by 
[CONTACT_352718] . They will be informed about the study and all questions will 
be answered. The potential subjects will be given a copy of the informed consent form and 
authorization form. The subj ects will then be contact[CONTACT_242640] -to-face in POCU on the day of 
surgery and if participation is agreed, written consent will be taken.  All patients will undergo a 
 
[ADDRESS_1039077] designed and agreed upon by [CONTACT_758930].  
 
A total of 100 subjects will be randomized by a computer program into two groups ( 50 in each 
group):  
 
1. LB QL block – placed by [CONTACT_2207] u sing 266mg Exparel  (20ml)  and 40ml of 0.125%  
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . 30ml on each side.  
2. SB QL block – placed by [CONTACT_242641] 60ml of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. 30ml on each 
side.  
 
Randomization will be performed using Research Randomizer. The primary investigator will 
inform the person doing the block as to what  group the patients are randomized to. Both the 
patients and the research staff  doing assessments will be blinded to the randomization.  
 
5.0 Study procedures:  
 
Both of the QL blocks will be done intraoperatively after induction. All procedures will be done 
using sterile technique with masks, hats, and sterile gloves. All procedures will be placed under 
the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist on the acute pain service.  
 
All patients will receive [ADDRESS_1039078] between the q uadratus lumborum and psoas major muscles. For the LB group, 0.125% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 20ml plus Exparel®10ml will then be injected into the fascial plane  on each side . For 
the SB group. 30ml 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_758918]. Saline will be used fo r 
hydro -dissection until the QL block target is confirmed on ultrasound.  
 
As part of the ERAS protocol, all patients will receive ketamine and lidocaine drip during 
surgery, which is our current standard of practice.  
 
All patients will be scheduled on PO  acetamino phen and PO gabapentin daily post operatively  
per ERAS protocol . PO oxycodone PRN will be started once patients tolerate diet. PRN IV 
dilaudid may be given for severe breakthrough pain.  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_391620] 1, 24, [ADDRESS_1039079] and on movement (knee flexion) will be measured by [CONTACT_578674] (VAS). Nausea will be measured using a categorical 
 
5 
 scoring system (none=0; mild=1; moderate=2; severe=3). Sedation scores will also be assessed 
by a member of the study team using a sedation scale (awake and alert=0; quietly awake=1; 
asleep but easily roused=2; deep sleep=3). All these parameters will be measured at 1, 24, [ADDRESS_1039080] 
annually.      
 
6.0 Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_391633], and any adverse 
events or unanticipated problem s such as local anesthetic toxicity or any injury to the bowel or 
kidney as a result of the block  will be reported to the acute pain service  and research team. All 
adverse events or unant icipated problems that meet the criteria for prompt reporting will  be 
reported to the IRB within 5 business days.  
 
 
7.0 Study withdrawal/DC  
 
The patient can withdraw from the study at any time by [CONTACT_391634]. In such an event, patient may still have access to all the IV and oral pain 
medications. Anesthesia acute pain team will continue to follow the patient for 24 hours. After 
24 hours, the anesthesia acute pain team will sign off and all further pain manageme nt will be 
done by [CONTACT_96204].  
 
8.0 Statistical consideration  
 
Primary outcome: VAS score at 24 and 48 hours  
 
Primary Research Hypothesis : Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_758919] r laparoscopic colorectal surgery as 
measured by  [CONTACT_391635] [ADDRESS_1039081].    
 
Secondary outcomes: Narcotic usage after 1, 24, [ADDRESS_1039082] 
and on knee flexion at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Nausea scores at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Sedation 
scores at 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours.  If the patient is discharged within 72 hours, every effort will be 
made to obtain data points, but we will not consider these data points deviati ons since our 72 -
hour data point will not change the integrity of the study.  
 
Secondary Research Hypotheses:   LB QL block will show improved patient satisfaction scores  
 
[ADDRESS_1039083] statistical program (SAS or SPSS). All 
data will be summarized (means, standard deviations, standard errors, and ranges for continuous 
variables; frequencies and percentages for categorical variables)  by [CONTACT_19313]. Demographic data 
will be compared between the two groups using ANOVA or chi -square tests as appropriate. The 
primary outcome, VAS at 24 and 48 hours, will be compared between the groups using repeated 
measures ANOVA; the model will include fixed  effects for group, time, and the group by [CONTACT_758931]. Pain and satisfaction scores and opi[INVESTIGATOR_758920]. Nausea and sedation scores will be compared 
between groups at each time point using Mantel -Haenszel chi -square tests for ordered categorical 
data. Distributions of the continuous variables will be examined, and a transformation of the data 
(e.g. natural logarithm) or nonparametric tests will be used as necessary. A 5% significance level 
will be used for all comparisons.  
 
Based on prior studies, the coefficient of variation for the VAS score at [ADDRESS_1039084] a 60% 
decrease in VAS score between any two groups, assuming two -sided tests each conducted at a 
5% significance level.  We assume a dropout rate of up to 40%, hence we’ll enroll up to 50 
patients  per group for this study.  
 
 
9.0 Privacy  
 
All study papers containing patient identifiers will be kept in each subjects  confidential study file 
accessible to only the research team.  All records will be kept in a locked room in a locked 
cabinet that only authorized staff enters.  Collected data from each enrolled participant will be 
recorded on Redcap, which is a secure we b-based data collection tool. Three years after 
completion of the study , all electronic information and paperwork containing patient identifiers 
will be deleted or shredded.  
 
10.0 Follow -up/record retention  
 
The study will start in the middle of [ADDRESS_1039085] been enrolled, the study will be stopped and the data collected will be analyzed using 
statistical methods.  
 
Three years after completion of the study , all study papers with patient identifiers will be 
shredded and only data without any patient identifiers will be retained by [CONTACT_758932].

Title: Problem -Solving Training for Care Partners of A dults with T raumatic Brain Injury  
 1. Introduction and Purpose:  The purpose of this project is to:  
AIM 1:  Assess the feasibility of delivering up to 6 sessions of Problem Solving Training (PST) to care 
partners of individuals with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) during the inpatient rehabilitation stay.  
• Hypothesis 1a:  Care partners will complete at least three intervention sessions (in person 
and/or via telephone) prior to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and will report high 
satisfaction.  
• Aim1a : Determine the number of sessions that it is feasible to complete during the inpatient 
rehabilitation stay and factors associated with non- compliance. 
AIM 2:  Assess the efficacy of PST plus TBI -specific education compared to TBI -specific education 
alone for improving the outcomes of care partners of individuals with TBI.  
• Hypothesis 2a:  PST will reduce care partners’ burden and depressive symptoms (primary), 
while improving care partners’ copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (secondary) at one- month post discharge more 
than TBI -specific education alone.  
• Hypothesis 2b:  Effects of the PST intervention on care partner burden, depress ive symptoms, 
and copi[INVESTIGATOR_572973] [ADDRESS_752222] -intervention.   
 
2. Background:  The chronic consequences of TBI are recognized, but ongoing support for adults 
with TBI living in the community is limited. This puts undue burden on care partners, particularly 
during the transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104]. It often leads to adverse consequences among care 
partners, such as emotional distress and increased substance abuse.
1,2 Care partners of individuals 
with TBI often experience high levels of burden, which may result in depression, anxiety, increased somatic symptoms, and reduced quality of life.
1,3,4 Care partner burden is largely predicted by [CONTACT_572984]’ perceived needs are met.1,5,6 As the consequences of TBI continue to 
change over time, so too do the perceived needs of care partners.7–11 One study suggests that only 
55% of care partner needs are perceived as being met.[ADDRESS_752223] to experiences, needs, and preferences of care partners during inpatient rehabilitation.
13 Care partners expressed a desire to be 
included, informed, and recognized as a stakeholder in recovery, the need to navigate an alien culture 
and environment, and the need to manage the transition home.13 The authors c oncluded that “we 
need to make deliberate efforts to provide a more inclusive environment that better supports and prepares carers for their new role”.
13 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_572974], 
there are currently no evidence- based interventions for care partners of adults with TBI to prepare 
them for their new role prior to discharge of care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_572975].  Hence, there 
is a critical need to provide care partners of individuals with TBI with the necessary skills to navigate 
this difficult transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104].14 Self-management training for care partners of adults 
with other chronic conditions demonstrates strong potential for application to care partners of adults with TBI.  
 
Problem -Solving Training (PST) is an evidence- based, self -management approach that teaches a 
simple, systematic method for evaluating problems, generating and selecting solutions, creating and implementing realistic goals and action plans, and evaluating whether those plans effectively 
addressed the specific goal.
15,[ADDRESS_752224] -discharge is 
associated with reduced distress among care partners of adults with TBI.17–[ADDRESS_752225], FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_16, 06- 02-20 (1)    
      Version <insert version number and date>  
Page [ADDRESS_752226] + Education 
will be more effective than Education alone for reducing caregiver burden and depressive symptoms and improving positive copi[INVESTIGATOR_572976]. This study will provide evidence for effective 
strategies to support and improve outcomes for care partners during the transition from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572977]. This will benefit the TBIMS as a whole by [CONTACT_572985] -based and feasible 
intervention for care partners, upon whom the TBIMS relies heavily for participant enrollment and data collection, in addition to the ongoing support that care partners provide to the primary beneficiaries of 
TBIMS services, individuals with TBI. PST is an evidence- based, self -management approach with a 
strong theoretical foundation that has demonstrated efficacy for care partners of individuals with disabilities. Early work indica tes that it is also effective for care partners of adults with TBI.  However, 
there are no studies evaluating whether delivery of PST to care partners is feasible and effective during inpatient rehabilitation. The proposed project builds upon this foundation of evidence to 
address this critical gap in the literature.  
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  Participants are care partners of adults with TBI who are inpatient 
patients at Zale Lisphy Hopsital or Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  They will complete baseline testing 
and follow -up testing at [ADDRESS_752227] -intervention.  They will participant in up to 6 
sessions of the Problem Solving Training intervention, delivered in person or via telephone.  These data will be used to assess the feasibility of delivering this intervention. These data will also be used for sec ondary analysis to determine relationships between baseline measures, demographics, and 
outcomes among care partners of adults with traumatic  brain injuries . 
 
 
4. Study Procedures:  This will be a randomized controlled trial, with blocked randomization stratified 
by [CONTACT_572986], of PST + Education vs Education alone for care partners of adults with TBI 
admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. Baseline assessment and all intervention sessions will occur 
during the time the patient with TBI is in inpatient rehabilitation, with the exception of the last intervention session, which can occur via telephone post -discharge. Follow -up assessments will occur 
at 1-month and 6 -months after the completion of the intervention.   
 
Description of Interventions:  Care partners in the intervention group will receive PST training in 
addition to TBI -specific education. Participants in the Control group will receive TBI -specific education 
alone. Both groups will receive up to 6 sessions, delivered in person or via telephone. Trained 
members of the research team with master’s level education or equivalent experience will provide both interventions using a specific curriculum that has been validated in our previous research 
studies . These activities will take place prior  to discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Sessions will 
occur face -to-face whenever possible and over the telephone circumstances when face- to-face is not 
feasible. Up to 6 sessions will be delivered, with a target of 2/week, maximizing the likelihood of 
completing all sessions before discharge and providing sufficient time for care partners to put their 
plans into action between sessions. Sessions will conclude at discharge, with the exception of 
completing the final session via telephone if it was not completed prior to discharge.  We will audio record the delivery of the sessions to ensure fidelity and evaluate feasibility, and document 
completion, reasons for non- compliance/non -completion, method of delivery, session length, 
participant engagement, and a brief summary of the PST steps covered during each session.  
 
A trained research staff, blinded to intervention allocation, will perform all assessments in person , via 
telephone, or will send the assesments electronically to the participant through RedCap at baseline, [ADDRESS_752228], FormA -ResearchProtocol, Mod_16, 06- 02-20 (1)    
      Version <insert version number and date>

caregiver burden, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], self -efficacy, and satisfaction with the intervention (data collection 
forms for each assessment time point are attached in a later section).  
  
5. Sub-Study Procedures:  n/a 
  6. Criteria for Inclusion of Subjects:   
1. Identified as care partner of an individual with TBI admitted to inpatient rehabilitation. A care partner is defined as an individual (spouse, partner, family member, friends, or neighbor) involved in assisting 
the patient with activities of daily livin g and/or medical tasks or responsible in any way for the patient’s 
well-being after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation.  
2. >1- year relationship 
3. Ability to communicate in English.  
4. >18 years old   
5. Capacity to self -consent   
 7. Criteria for Exclusion of Subjects:   
1. Dispute over care partner’s role in the care of patient.  
2. Failure to meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
8. Sources of Research Material:  Participant -completed surveys/questionnaires. Members of the 
research team will record all data collected (demographic data, care partner relationship information,  
session- specific information,  and outcome measures) on study forms. Paper forms will be kept in 
locked filing cabinets and data will be entered directly into an electronic database managed by [CONTACT_572987]. Assessment data may also be captured through secure RedCap.  Intervention sessions will be audio-
recorded for the purpose of monitoring intervention fidelity. 
 
9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  Participants will be willing care pa rtners of 
individuals with TBI at either Zale Lipshy University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Parkland Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572978] , or 
Baylor Scott and White Rehabilitation Institute . Care partners of patients screened for the TBI Model 
Systems (STU 082010- 092) studies will be approached about participation or given a flyer by [CONTACT_572988]. No screening for eligibility/screening for patients is necessary. We will not review/collect any PHI. Study staff will recruit care partners as close as possible to 
admission of the patient with TBI into acute or  inpatient rehabilitation, to maximize the likelihood of 
completing PST training prior to discharge. Study staff will approach care partners in a private setting, 
such as the patient’s room or private office, or via telephone to discuss the purpose of the project and 
to obtain informed consent. Additionally, study staff will fully explain all study procedures and will 
answer all questions regarding the project. Care partner participants who agree to be part of the study 
will then sign an IRB- approved consent form. The informed consent forms will include contact 
[CONTACT_572989], who may be contact[CONTACT_572990]. Participants will be given a subject ID, which will be used to refer to the participant on all research 
documents.  
 10. Potential Risks:  The proposed study involves minimal risk to participants.  There is always a risk 
of a breach of confidentiality of personal information and associated privacy of participants.  The 
baseline screening, problem -solving therapy sessions, and follow up data c ollection visits may 
produce discomfort or anxiety secondary to the discussion of emotionally laden topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Questionnaire

Page [ADDRESS_752230] Safety and Data Monitoring:  A detailed Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be 
submitted to the IRB. The study staff (PI, Co- Investigators, research coordinator, interventionist) will 
be responsible for collecting and recording all data. As results are collected, all Adverse Events w ill be 
identified, graded for severity and assigned causality, reported to the required entities, and compi[INVESTIGATOR_572979].  After assigning causality, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572980]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_572981]/benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol or informed consent form 
are required.  Throughout this process, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_572982]. The 
plan to monitor participant data and safety will specifically include the following:  (1) [CONTACT_572992] will 
inspect collected data; (2) The IRB offices will be contact[CONTACT_572991]; (3) the research protocol will be revised if it is determined that the protocol or 
intervention presents an unforeseen risk to participants; (4) if an event occurs that requires immediate attention and [CONTACT_572992] is unavailable, then members of the research team will follow the 
emergency procedures put in place by [CONTACT_5051], which may include calling emergency 
medical services. [CONTACT_572992] will develop procedures  for all data management functions including 
data quality checks and verification, in collaboration with the TBI Model Systems National Data and 
Statistical Center. Internal edit and logic checks (e.g., out of range values, internal inconsistencies) 
will be developed and run quarterly. Descriptive statistics will be at calculated and included into 
quarterly reports to ensure the quality of data and progress of the s tudy.  
 
12. Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality:  In order to  assure participant confidentiality, all 
participants will be assigned a unique study identification number. Links to identifiers will be maintained at UTSW by [CONTACT_464]. All databases will use the subject ID number rather than private 
health information. The only exception will be that the RedCap database will include the participant e-
mails  and information necessary to obtain eConsents. This is necessary in order to send out the 
assessments via RedCap and to obtain participant consent through RedCap. P HI in RedCap will be 
marked as patient health information, for which only study personnel will have access. Signed consent 
forms and all paper study documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators at participating 
centers behind a locked door in a locked file cabinet  or in RedCap. 
 13. Potential Benefits:  Participants receiving the PST intervention may benefit from reduced 
symptoms of burden and depression and improvements in adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Participants receiving Education may also benefit from reduced symptoms or greater self -efficacy. Further, from this study, 
we hope to improve clinical programming to better support care partners of patients in acute 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_572983].  This could lead to improving not only the long- term health 
and well -being of care partners, but also of individuals with acquired disabilities.  
 
14. Biostatistics: Specific Aim 1: The primary outcome is the total number of sessions completed 
prior to discharge, with a threshold of 80% of participants completing a minimum of 3 sessions as an indicator of feasibility. We will descriptively present reasons for non -compliance and explor e factors 
associated with non- compliance (e.g. demographics, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], etc.). The secondary 
outcome for feasibility is satisfaction, with an item mean of > 3.5 on the CSQ -8 as an indicator of high 
satisfacti on. Specific Aim 2:  To test our first hypothesis, we will use intent -to-treat analyses to 
measure the pre -post-test differences in each outcome between baseline and 1- month follow -up using 
a paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test as appropriate. To address our second hypo thesis, we will 
use intent -to-treat analyses to measure the pre -post-test differences in each outcome between 
baseline and 6- month follow -up (all participants) using paired t -tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests. 
Effect sizes will be calculated and interpreted as follows:  < 0.2=no/minimal effect; 0.2- 0.5= small 
effect; 0.5 -0.8=medium effect; > 0.8=large effect.

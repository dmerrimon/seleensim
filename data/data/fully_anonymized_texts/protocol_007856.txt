1.Statement of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
STAGE [ADDRESS_154787] – Primary Outcomes Aim # 1: 
Compare the effectiveness of CBT, LDX, and CBT+LDX for BED on primary outcomes (1a) reducing binge-
eating and (1b) reducing weight.
STAGE [ADDRESS_154788] – Secondary Aims: 
(2a) Examine the effectiveness of CBT, LDX, and CBT+LDX for BED on secondary outcomes: categorical 
remission (zero binges/ 28 days), eating-disorder pathology, and depression.  
(2b) Explore predictors, moderators, and mediators of primary treatment outcomes (reductions in binge-
eating and weight) and in secondary categorical outcome (binge-eating remission).
STAGE [ADDRESS_154789] – Primary Outcomes Aim # 1: 
(3) Among Responders to Stage 1 acute treatments with LDX (i.e., LDX and CBT+LDX), compare the 
effectiveness of LDX versus Placebo for enhancing maintenance and longer-term outcomes. Primary outcome 
will be “relapse” and secondary outcomes will be binge-eating frequency, weight loss, eating disorder 
pathology, and depression.
STAGE [ADDRESS_154790] – Secondary Aims: 
(4a) Examine LDX and CBT effects, alone and in combination, for longer-term BED outcomes. Our two-stage 
design will allow comparison of CBT (i.e., Stage 1 CBT-only short-term) versus the Stage 2 LDX/placebo 
maintenance treatment (i.e., Stage 2 LDX/placebo following Stage 1 LDX or Stage 1 CBT+LDX) for longer-term 
outcomes through 18 months. This will inform clinical questions regarding whether LDX maintenance treatment 
following either acute LDX treatment or acute combined CBT+LDX differ and whether it offers any additional 
benefits over acute CBT-only. 
       (4b) Among Non-responders to Stage 1 acute treatments with LDX (i.e., LDX and CBT+LDX), explore the
       effectiveness of switching to an alternative medication NB vs placebo for primary outcomes (reducing 
       binge-eating and reducing weight) and secondary outcomes (binge remission, ED pathology, depression).
(5) Secondary Aims: Generate cost-effectiveness estimates of treatments. Incremental cost effectiveness 
ratios (ICERs) will be computed for LDX vs CBT and LDX+CBT vs CBT (using quality-adjusted life years).  
2.Probable Duration of Project: State the expected duration of the project, including all follow-up and data 
analysis activities.  
September 1, 2018- August 31, 2025
3.Background: Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. Provide references to 
support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
SIGNIFICANCE:  Obesity (OB) is an increasingly prevalent, refractory, and serious public health problem, with 
estimates that 34% of U.S. adults are obese (Flegal, Carroll et al. 2010). Obesity is considered one of the most 
serious public health problems of the 21st century. Economic consequences of OB are staggering; associated 
annual medical costs were estimated at $147 billion (roughly 10% of all medical spending) (Finkelstein et al. 
2009), which reflects continued escalation since estimates of $75 billion five years earlier (Finkelstein et al. 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 3 of 552004). This study focuses on testing treatments for a high-risk subgroup with binge-eating disorder (BED) 
(Hudson, Hiripi [CONTACT_2297]. 2007; Kessler et al., 2013). 
Binge Eating Disorder (BED) – An Important Clinical Subgroup of Persons with Obesity 
Obesity is a heterogeneous problem and research has highlighted the particular significance of a subgroup 
with BED. Recognized as a serious problem by [CONTACT_136354] ( 1959), only recently has BED become a research 
focus and established as a formal diagnosis in the DSM-5 (APA, 2013). BED is defined by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_136274]-eating without compensatory weight control methods that characterize bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating 
is defined as eating an unusually large amount of food given the context coupled with a subjective sense of 
loss of control and diagnosis requires binge-eating to be associated with marked distress ( Grilo and White 
2011). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_136275] ( Hudson, Hiripi [CONTACT_2297]. 2007; Kessler, Berglund et al. 2013). The prevalence of BED in the National Co-
morbidity Survey Replication ( Hudson, Hiripi [CONTACT_2297]. 2007) was 3.5% among women and 2.0% among men. 
Estimates of BED are higher in obese adults (8%) and are much higher in most clinical settings ( Wilfley, Wilson 
et al. 2003). Compared to other eating disorders, BED is prevalent across gender and ethnic/racial groups 
(Marques, Alegria et al. 2011). BED has diagnostic validity ( Striegel-Moore and Franko 2008), is a stable 
construct ( Pope, Lalonde et al. 2006), differs from other eating disorders and obesity ( Allison, Grilo et al. 
2005; Grilo, Crosby [CONTACT_2297]. 2009; Grilo, Masheb et al. 2010) and is strongly associated with obesity (Kessler et 
al., 2013) and elevated risk for medical, psychiatric, and psychosocial problems ( Hudson et al. 2007; Hudson 
et al., 2010). 
Treatment for BED: Overall Current Status and Future Needs Overall, the BED literature suggests that several 
medications have short-term efficacy relative to placebo ( Reas & Grilo 2008, Reas & Grilo, 2014, 2015) and 
certain psychological treatments have efficacy both short-term and longer-term ( Wilson et al., 2007). The few 
relevant studies performed to date suggest that certain psychological treatments hold important advantages 
over the few medications tested thus far (alone or in combination) (Grilo, Reas, & Mitchell, 2016; Reas & Grilo 
2014, 2015; Grilo et al., 2012). This application focuses on two “leading” and distinct treatments that have yet 
to be compared: a specific “specialist” psychological - cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - and the first and 
only FDA-approved medication for BED - lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX).     
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is the best-established treatment (Grilo, 2017; Iacovino, Gredysa, Altman, 
& Wilfley, 2012; National Institutes of Clinical Excellence, 2004, 2017; Wilson, Grilo, & Vitousek, 2007). 
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing CBT generally report roughly 50% - 60% remission rates from binge-
eating ( Grilo, Masheb et al. 2005; Grilo, Masheb et al. 2011; Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson, Wilfley, Agras, & 
Bryson, 2010). RCTs have demonstrated that CBT has short-term effectiveness and “treatment specificity” 
(i.e., superiority to a variety of control and active treatments) (Grilo, Masheb, & Wilson, 2005; Wilson et al., 
2010), demonstrated longer-term superiority to fluoxetine (Grilo, Crosby, Wilson, & Masheb, 2012) and other 
medications (Ricca et al., 2001), and longer-term durability of outcomes (Hilbert et al., 2012; Wilson et al. 
2010). CBT also produces significant and robust improvements in associated features of eating disorder 
pathology and depression ( Grilo et al., 2011; Wilson et al., 2010). Importantly, however, CBT fails to produce 
weight loss (Grilo et al., 2005; 2011, Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2010) as is the case with other 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported psychological treatments (Grilo, 2017) such as interpersonal therapy and dialectical 
behavioral therapy) (Wilfley al., 2002; Safer et al., 2012). CBT does appear to reliability stabilize and prevent 
future weight gain ( Hilbert et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2010) which is important in light of the concerning steep 
weight-gain trajectories characteristic of persons with BED prior to treatment ( Barnes, Blomquist, & Grilo, 
2011; Blomquist et al., 2011; Ivezaj, Kalebjian, Grilo, & Barnes, 2014; Masheb, White, & Grilo, 2013)

heightened risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_136276] ( Hudson, Lalonde et al. 2010) highlight the need to 
find methods to effectively reduce weight - in addition to binge-eating - in this subgroup of obese persons. 
Behavioral Weight Loss (BWL) for BED, has received less research support than CBT for BED. Recent rigorous 
RCTs have found BWL may be more effective than CBT for producing weight loss in BED ( Grilo, Masheb et al. 
2011), although longer-term follow-up suggests that the improvements in binge-eating and weight losses are 
less durable in BWL ( Wilson, Wilfley et al. 2010). Longer-term effectiveness of BWL combined with (a 
different) pharmacotherapy is the focus of an on-going RCT by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Grilo (HIC #[PHONE_3070]).  
Pharmacotherapy (medications) for BED has received increased research attention albeit nearly all RCTs have 
been of short duration and without follow-up to establish durability. Critical review and meta-analysis show 
that several drugs – working through varied mechanisms – have short-term efficacy relative to placebo for 
reducing binge-eating and produce weight loss ranging from modest to none (Grilo et al., 2016; Reas & Grilo, 
2008, 2014, 2015). Placebo-controlled trials of anticonvulsants ( McElroy et al. 2003; McElroy et al. 2006; 
Claudino et al. 2007) have reported effects for reducing both binge-eating and weight (mean weight loss of 
roughly 3-4 kg), but have high dropout and frequent adverse events which become nearly universal and 
troubling with longer use ( McElroy, Kotwal et al. 2004). SSRIs, initially regarded as a potential treatment 
strategy (e.g., NICE, 2004) are characterized by [CONTACT_136355] (Reas & Grilo, 2008) and 
produce no weight loss at all (Grilo et al., 2005) and are inferior to CBT (Grilo et al., 2005; Ricca et al 2001). 
FDA-Approved LDX (CNS Stimulant) Medication for BED An important recent development was the FDA 
approval in January 2015 of a CNS stimulant, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe BED based on findings from an integrated series of studies funded by [CONTACT_10188] (the 
manufacturer). The phase II (11-week) RCT demonstrated dosing response and that 50mg and 70mg were 
superior to placebo (McElroy et al., 2015). Two identically designed phase III RCTs testing LDX (50–70 mg dose 
optimization) for moderate-to-severe BED in adults (McElroy et al., 2016) found LDX superior to placebo for 
reducing binge-eating days and reported binge-eating abstinence rates of LDX versus placebo (Study 1: 40% 
versus 14%; Study 2: 36% versus 13%) at the end of [ADDRESS_154791]-size of 0.83 
and 0.97 (McElroy et al., 2016). Another much smaller RCT with N=50, also funded by [CONTACT_10188], reported weaker 
advantage of LDX over placebo (ES = 0.50), suggesting the need for further and continued investigation by 
[CONTACT_29091]. McElroy et al (2017) reported time-course data for binge-eating and associated outcomes 
to expand upon the McElroy et al (2015) report regarding the significant reductions (over 80%) in binge-
eating with LDX; these analyses suggest an early and rapid response (and are supportive of our proposed 
definition of “response” (see Research Design section). The efficacy and safety data were reviewed and 
appear to represent a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio (Citrome, 2015). 
LDX was also associated with significant acute weight loss relative to placebo (mean 4.9 kg) (McElroy et al., 
2015, 2016); weight loss was examined as a safety measure. The FDA-approval and manufacturer product 
labeling include a “Limitation of Use” highlighting that LDX is not indicated for weight loss. In the present 
study, we anticipate that LDX will produce short-term weight loss and the key and novel research goals will 
involve the questions of the utility of maintenance LDX treatment and longer-term follow-up.  
More recently, two Shire-funded studies have been reported, both providing further support for the 
proposed research. A Phase III open-label 12-month extension safety and tolerability trial of LDX for BED with 
N=604 patients who completed previous Shire RCTs (McElroy et al., 2015, 2016) was completed (Gasior et al., 
2017). Gasior et al (2017) reported the safety/tolerability profile with 12-months of LDX was consistent with 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 5 of 55short-term (12-week) BED trials and with established profile of LDX for ADHD (FDA-approved); 9% of patients 
reported treatment emergent side-effects resulting in medicine discontinuation. Hudson et al (2015 ACNP 
conference), in a double-blind RCT, reported LDX was significantly superior to placebo for preventing relapse 
following clinical response to open-label LDX (3.7% vs 32.1% relapsed, respectively). These findings suggest 
short-term treatment extension with LDX may be effective for decreasing relapse amongst initial responders 
to LDX. Importantly, Hudson et al (2015) did not report follow-up data after discontinuing the maintenance 
treatment and whether LDX enhances maintenance for responders to other treatments is unknown.         
Putative mechanisms of action for LDX.  LDX (l-lysine-dextroamphetamine), is a prodrug of d-amphetamine 
covalently linked to l-lysine, that when metabolized to d-amphetamine (active form) is a moderately potent 
inhibitor of DAT, NET, and VMAT2, with little affinity for SERT; its net effect is increased catecholamine 
availability (Guerdjikova et al., 2016; Hutson et al., 2014; Pennic, 2010; Comiran et al., 2016). LDX seems 
relevant for reducing binge-eating per preclinical and clinical (Vickers et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011), and 
neurobiologic (fMRI) findings suggestive that binge-eating is related to dysfunctions in the dopamine and 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_136277] (Balodis, Grilo, & Potenza, 2015; Balodis, Grilo et al., 2013), which play important roles 
in regulating eating behaviors and reward (Wellman, 2005; Palmiter, 2007).    
LDX Research Needs: Longer-term follow-up data are needed for this FDA-approved LDX medication for BED. 
There exists no empi[INVESTIGATOR_136278] (1) whether or not to combine with CBT, (2) 
whether maintenance treatment with LDX, which reduced relapse over the short-term amongst LDX 
responders (Hudson et al., 2015), has utility for enhancing outcomes with other treatments (e.g., CBT) and 
has any durability or shows any benefit over time after discontinuation; (3) what are longer-term outcomes 
and what is the risk/timing for relapse, and (4) what factors predict outcomes and moderate outcomes (i.e., 
for whom the LDX and CBT work best). Furthermore, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding mediators for 
how CBT and LDX (or other BED treatments) achieve (or fail to achieve) either short- or longer-term outcomes 
(which may reflect different processes). The integration of repeated behavioral measures tappi[INVESTIGATOR_136279] (CBT vs LDX) offers an important novel opportunity 
to explore possible mediators of therapeutic action in addition to the primary aims of providing important 
new information about the comparative effectiveness – both short- and longer-term – of these two “leading” 
treatments, alone and in combination. 
What About Non-Responders?:  In addition to the important need to test maintenance treatments (e.g., LDX) 
to enhance outcomes amongst initial treatment responders, studying treatment “non-responders” is also 
especially needed. To date, this issue - and “SMART” or “adaptive” integrative treatment designs tested in 
other psychiatric problems (e.g., depression) (Guidi, Tomba, & Fava, 2016) – has received very little attention 
in BED.  Grilo et al (2017 IJED plenary) reported new findings that non-responders to BWL (a “generalist” 
treatment) failed to derive any further benefit from CBTgsh but did derive some benefit from anti-obesity 
medications. How to help non-responders to CBT (a leading “specialist” treatment), however, seems 
challenging. Agras et al (1995) reported that IPT failed to benefit Non-responders to CBT and Grilo et al (2011) 
found that sequencing BWL after CBT failed to enhance outcomes (except for some modest weight loss).  The 
failure of IPT and BWL to enhance limited CBT response is striking in light of their documented effectiveness 
as initial treatments (Wilson et al., 2010). In this application, we will propose a different and novel strategy for 
treating patients with BED who fail to benefit from LDX and CBT+LDX being compared in the Stage [ADDRESS_154792]. 
Specifically, following the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) clinical trials 
(Rush et al., 2006; Rush et al., 2008; Olbert et al., 2016), we will test whether switching to a second 
(alternative) medication produces benefits. We propose to explore the utility of naltrexone/bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394].

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 6 of 55Pharmacotherapy with Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (FDA-Approved for Obesity). In 2014, the FDA approved 
combination of naltrexone and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136280] (non-BED) (Greenway et al., 2009; Greenway et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2013; Wadden 
et al., 2011). These RCTs reported significant clinically-meaningful weight losses with sustained-release 
naltrexone (32 mg/day) plus sustained-release bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (360 mg/day) combined in fixed-dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (“NB32”, 
which we will refer to as NB medication). For example, Apovian et al (2013), in a study of 1496 obese patients 
reported significantly greater weight losses relative to placebo (-6.5% vs -1.9% at week 28 and -6.4% vs -1.2% 
at week 56) and significantly greater likelihood of achieving 5% weight loss (56% vs 18% at 28 weeks). These 
findings supporting NB medication are quite consistent with earlier large RCTs which reported greater weight 
loss with NB than placebo (-6.5 vs -1.2% (Greenway et al. 2013); -8.2% vs -2.1% (Smith et al., 2013)) Overall, 
NB has been well tolerated with the most common adverse event being nausea.
Putative mechanisms of action for Naltrexone and Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136281]. Naltrexone, an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634], is approved for treatment of alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2560] (O’Malley, Sinha, Grilo, et al., 2007). Naltrexone produces weight loss in lab animals but only 
minimal weight losses in humans (Malcolm et al. 1985; Billes & Greenway, 2013). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136282], noradrenergic, and nicotinic acetyl-cholinergic mechanisms ( Slemmer, Martin 
et al. 2000; Stahl, Pradko et al. 2004; Han, Hwang et al. 2010), may target reward processes that drive eating 
behaviors, consistent with its FDA indication for treating nicotine dependence and reduced weight gain during 
smoking cessation (Hurt et al., 1997; Farley et al., 2012). Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136283] (Li et al., 2005). White & Grilo (2013) first reported preliminary support for a possible (albeit modest) 
weight loss benefit specifically in obese BED patients. 
Putative mechanisms of action for the COMBINATION NB is especially relevant for reducing binge eating and 
weight per hypothesized effects on brain regions implicated in the regulation of food intake and weight based 
on the mechanisms of action of leptin (Billes & Greenway, 2011). Leptin’s anorectic effects result from its 
excitatory effects on pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_136284] (POMC) neurons in hypothalamus melancortin system (Crowley et 
al, 2001; Marsh et al, 1999). Stimulated POMC signaling decreases food intake, increases energy expenditure, 
but is then inhibited by [CONTACT_136356] (Crowley et al., 2001). Thus, combining these two drugs is to 
stimulate POMC neurons (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) plus block endogenous feedback that inhibits POMC activity 
(naltrexone) (Greenway et al., 2009; Biles & Greenway, 2013). This synergistic model received support both in 
vitro and in vivo studies (Greenway et al., 2009; Cone et al., 2001).  Billes and Greenway (2013) noted that NB 
was associated with ability to control food intake and reduced food craving and, in turn, weight loss.

research procedures when applicable, and include any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and 
lengths. Describe the setting in which the research will take place.

[CONTACT_756]. If participants prefer to answer some of the screening questions through the Yale Qualtrics 
system, participants will indicate their consent to the recruitment/screening process in the online system. 
Potentially eligible participants will be consented and evaluated in-person by [CONTACT_136357] (doctoral level and/or advanced trainees). Participants will complete survey measures of eating 
behaviors and psychopathology and psychosocial functioning around the time of the in-person 
appointment.
Participants who provide informed consent and are determined to be eligible (see page 15-16) will then 
participate in the study as depi[INVESTIGATOR_136285]. See also Figure 1 (page 8).
Stage 1, N=180 patients with BED and obesity will be randomized to one of three 12-week treatments: CBT, 
LDX, or CBT+LDX.
In Stage 2, patients who received pharmacotherapy (Stage1 LDX or CBT+LDX) and were “Responders” 
(defined as 65% or more decrease in binge eating) will be randomly assigned in equal proportions (blocked 
randomization stratified by [CONTACT_136358]) to LDX or placebo (double blind) for 12 weeks. 
“Non-responders” to Stage 1 pharmacotherapy (LDX or CBT+LDX) will be randomized to a second medication 
(NB or placebo) in double-blind fashion for 12 weeks.  Stage 1 CBT patients will be followed without further 
treatment; this will allow controlled comparison of Stage [ADDRESS_154793] and context for Stage 2 RCTs. 
Independent assessments will determine outcomes after discontinuation of treatments through 18 months. 
Secondary aims are to produce important new data regarding predictors of outcomes and moderators of 
treatment effects to inform prescription (i.e., for whom LDX vs. CBT work best), and exploration of potential 
mediators through which the distinct treatments achieve outcomes, and cost-effectiveness estimates. Response to

Randomization to Stage 1 Treatment. Eligible participants who provide written informed consent will be 
randomized in equal proportions to one of three treatments (blocked randomization with random block 
sizes of 3 and 6 for Stage 1 to obviate any secular trends).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_136361] (overvaluation of shape/weight (based on ≥4 EDE item scores) and 
depression (based on >16 BDI-II score) (Grilo, Masheb, Crosby, 2012).  
Randomization to Stage 2 Treatments for LDX and CBT+LDX (Stage 1) “Responders”. 
“Responders” to Stage 1 LDX (i.e., LDX and CBT+LDX) treatments will be defined as 65% or greater 
reduction in binge-eating.   This cut-point is based on reliable findings regarding prognostic significance of 
such reductions (Grilo et al., 2006; 2012) and supported by [CONTACT_136362] “time course of the effects of 
LDX” (McElroy et al., 2017).   “Responders” will be randomized in equal proportions (using stratified 
blocked randomization with Stage 1 treatment as a stratifying variable) to LDX or placebo (double-blind) 
for [ADDRESS_154796] used successfully in previous RCTs (e.g., Grilo et al., 2005, Grilo et al., 
2011). CBT will be delivered in individual sessions weekly for 12 weeks following CBT manuals based on 
Fairburn et al (1993) used in our RCTs (Grilo et al., 2005, 2011) which are similar to those used in major 
RCTs testing CBT delivered via 12-24 weeks ( Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2010). The CBT manuals 
provide detailing session-by-session procedures for clinicians and parallel guides are provided to the 
patients to facilitate homework and mastery of the material. CBT, a specialist focal treatment, consists of

focusing on educating the patient about the nature of binge-eating and factors thought to maintain the 
problem. Specific behavioral strategies (e.g., self-monitoring) are used to help patients identify 
problematic eating patterns while establishing a normal structured eating pattern. Phase two integrates 
cognitive restructuring procedures, where patients learn to identify and challenge maladaptive cognitions 
regarding eating and weight/shape and thoughts that trigger binge-eating. Phase three focuses on 
maintenance of change and relapse prevention. 
LDX Pharmacotherapy Treatment Protocol. Medication will be double-blind; patients and study staff, 
physicians and investigators will be blind to medication assignment. LDX, FDA-approved for BED, will be 
prescribed per procedures found to be superior to placebo in two large-scale phase 3 RCTs ( McElroy et 
al., 2015). The LDX (dose-optimization at 50-70mg per day) protocol followed the McElroy et al (2015) 
RCT findings that 50-70mg/day dosing was significantly superior to 30mg/dosing and to placebo. 
During week 1, LDX will be 30 mg/day for initial titration. During week 2, LDX will be titrated to 50mg/day. 
During weeks 3-4, LDX increases to 70mg will be made based on acceptable tolerability and clinical need. 
If 70mg is not tolerated, downward titration to 50mg/day can occur. For the remaining treatment (weeks 
4-12), the optimized LDX dose (50 or 70 mg/day) will be maintained. 
For the Stage 2 randomized maintenance (double-blind) treatment, a similar approach to dose-
optimization will be followed for responders. “Responders” re-randomized to LDX will continue taking 
LDX at the same dose as Stage 1. “Responders” randomized to placebo will be switched from LDX to 
placebo.  Participants will be instructed to take the medication (active or placebo) once daily in the 
morning. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed during study clinic visits as will clinical compliance with the study 
medication. During the dose-optimization period, if the patient develops tolerability concerns, dosing can 
be reduced once to achieve tolerability. If the patient cannot tolerate the medication, has adverse effects, 
or is non-compliant with medication for > 7 consecutive days, s/he will be discontinued from the 
medication arm. Physician visits will be brief (10-15 minutes) and focus on compliance with dosing and 
evaluating side effects without integrating dietary, behavioral, or CBT techniques. 
In Stage 1 or Stage 2, participants taking medication for greater than 4 weeks, a taper will be provided 
(Refer to Minimizing Risk section on page 20 for details).  
Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (NB) Pharmacotherapy Treatment Protocol. During Stage 2, “non-responders” will 
be randomized to NB or placebo. Medication will be double-blind; patients and study staff, physicians and 
investigators will be blind to medication assignment. NB will be prescribed per FDA-approval for obesity 
and previous RCTs demonstrating effectiveness for weight loss in obese patients (Greenway et al., 2009, 
2010, 2013; Smith et al., 2013; Wadden et al., 2011). “Non-responders” will start talking NB or placebo 
one week following discontinuation of LDX. NB medication will comprise naltrexone (50 mg/day) 
combined with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (300 mg/day) taken daily ( matching frequency for placebo). Per previous 
RCTs, a dosing escalation approach will be used(Greenway et al., 2010; Wadden et al., 2011). See below.

such occur, the physician may reduce the dosing to achieve tolerability. If the patient cannot tolerate the 
medication, has adverse effects, or is non-compliant with medication for >7 consecutive days, they will be 
discontinued from medication arm. Physician visits will be brief (10 -15 minutes), focus on compliance 
with dosing and evaluating side effects, without using CBT or dietary/behavioral methods.  Participants 
taking medication for greater than 4 weeks, a 7-day taper will be provided (Refer to Minimizing Risk 
section on page 20 for details).  
Withdrawal From Treatment and Other Treatments. Withdrawal/attrition from treatments will be 
examined. Use of other treatments during the study will be assessed and considered in analyses. Patients 
will be asked about all forms of treatments during major assessments. Criteria for removal of patients 
from the study may include worsening depression, suicidal ideation, intensification of binge eating, or 
failure to comply with medication.  Previous experience suggests that worsening clinical status is rare; in 
such cases, [CONTACT_136399] and study physician would determine whether to remove the person from the study 
and provide referrals. 
Maintenance of Cohort.  Research staff will form on-going relationships and maintain contact [CONTACT_108806]. Our experience indicates this improves likelihood of participants’ willingness to perform follow-
up assessments. In addition: (1) At baseline, participants will be interviewed to determine whether they 
will be available for the entire study duration; (2) Participants will be excluded if unable to comply with 
birth control methods; (3) Participants will provide names and contact [CONTACT_136363]; (4) At 
each assessment, participants will be asked if they have plans to move; and (5) We requested funds in the 
budget to reimburse participants for completion of the assessments. 
Assessment Procedures. Figure 2 below shows assessment schedule and measures. Major assessment at: 
baseline, during Stage 1 treatment (month 1, 2), post-Stage 1 treatment (month 3), during Stage 2 
treatment (month 4, 5), post-Stage 2 treatment (month 6), and follow-ups at 6- and 12-months after 
completing Stage 2 treatment (i.e., 18 months after starting treatment). Outcomes assessments will be 
done by [CONTACT_136364].
Assessment Training.  Independent assessors will receive training in diagnostic interviews from 
investigators following established protocols. Interviewers, once certified, will receive ongoing 
supervision to ensure consistent use and prevent drift. [CONTACT_136399] will do inter-rater reliability studies, 
which he has published for BED (Grilo et al., 2004) and psychiatry (Zanarini et al., 2000). 
Eligibility and Baseline Assessment. Potential subjects will be assessed by [CONTACT_136365], and obtain informed consent. Baseline assessment (two meetings) will 
include two interviews, the MINI (Sheehan et al., 2014) and EDE (Fairburn et al., 1993), to generate 
lifetime and current psychiatric diagnoses and detailed current eating disorder features and (BED) 
diagnoses.

Clinical Assessments:
MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview-Version 7.0 (MINI) (Sheehan et al., 2014) is a brief 
structured interview for Axis I psychiatric disorders. Validation and reliability studies have 
supported the MINI, including good convergence with SCID (Sheehan et al 2014). The MINI 
requires much less time than the SCID and reduces subject burden while providing adequate 
psychiatric data to characterize patients and determine exclusion criteria. We will use the MINI-7 
(based on DSM-5).
Eating Disorder Examination Interview–16th Edition (EDE; Fairburn & Cooper, 2008) investigator-
based interview assesses the features of eating disorders and diagnoses. The EDE will be our 
primary assessment method for binge eating and ED pathology at baseline, post-treatment(s), 
and follow-ups. EDE focuses on past 28 days, except for diagnostic items (rated for durations 
stipulated in DSM-5). EDE assesses frequency of different forms of overeating, including objective 
bulimic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (OBE) (binge eating, i.e., unusually large amounts of food with loss of control). 
EDE also comprises four scales (restraint, eating concerns, weight concern, and shape concern) 
and a global severity score. EDE has good psychometric properties (Grilo et al., 2001a, 2001b), is 
the major outcome measure for BED RCTs (Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson, Wilfley, et al. 2010), and 
has good test-retest reliability in obese and BED groups (Grilo et al, 2004, 2005).
Trail Making Test, Parts A & B (Trails). Trails is a measure of executive attention and relevant to 
LDX models (Kessler et al., 2016). In Part A, participants connect numbered dots consecutively as 
quickly as they can and In Part B, participants connect dots labeled with numbers and letters, 
alternating between number and letter. Trails can be administered in <5 minutes (Gaudino et al., 
1995; Strauss, Sherman, & Spreen, 2006).  
We will also gather clinical data on the patient’s medical history prior to the study, which we will 
update as indicated in Figure 2. If patients begin other treatments, this will allow us to account 
for this in analyses.
Self-Report Questionnaires: 
EDE-Questionnaire Version with Instructions (EDE-Q-I; Fairburn & Beglin 1994; Celio, Wilfley et al. 
2004) generates the same eating data and scale scores as EDE interview, has good test-retest 
reliability with BED ( Grilo, Masheb et al. 2001; Reas, Grilo et al. 2006). EDEQ will be used across 
all assessment points given its low burden (in addition to EDE at major assessment points). EDEQ 
converges well with EDE as a measure of “change” ( Sysko, et al. 2005). In N=200 BED patients, 
alphas for the four scales ranged .71 to .75.
Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard & Messick, 1985) taps eating behaviors with 3 
factors: cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger; however, we will be using the restraint 
subscale for this study. TFEQ has validity (Foster et al., 1998), and shows differential response 
across treatments consistent with putative CBT mechanisms (Blomquist & Grilo, 2011; Grilo & 
Masheb, 2005; Safer et al., 2004). In N=200 BED patients, alphas for the 3 scales ranged .67 to 
.76.  
Food Craving Inventory (FCI-II; White et al., 2002) assesses general and specific food cravings 
(relevant for NB) and comprises 4 subscales for different food groups. FCI-II is validated and 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 13 of 55psychometrically supported in studies with obese and with BED groups (White et al., 2002; White 
& Grilo, 2005). Internal consistency was 0.93 for total score and ranged 0.70-0.85 for subscale 
items in N=464 BED patients. 
The Power of Food Scale (PFS; Lowe et al., 2009) assesses psychological impact of and drive to eat 
palatable foods. PFS measures appetite for – rather than consumption of – palatable foods. PFS 
has been validated in normative (Lowe et al., 2009) and treatment-seeking obese patients 
(Cappelleri et al., 2009). PFS comprises 3 scales reflecting food proximity (food available, food 
present, and food tasted) supported by [CONTACT_136366]-retest reliability and internal 
consistency (range 0.81-0.91) (Cappelleri et al., 2009). The PFS is a good measure of the hedonic 
impact of food environment cues; fMRI studies have reported associations with state cravings for 
desired foods and shifts in brain networks (Rejeski et al., 2012). 
Eating Loss of Control Scale (ELOCS; Blomquist et al., 2014) assesses the complexity of loss of 
control eating over the past four weeks. The ELOCS has demonstrated good convergent validity 
and is considered a valid self-report questionnaire that may provide important clinical 
information regarding experiences of loss-of-control eating in persons with obesity and BED. 
Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ; Godin et al., 1985) assesses mild, moderate, 
and vigorous physical activity, has good test-retest reliability (Jacobs et al., 1993) and has been 
validated using various activity measurement methods (Miller et al., 1994).
Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ; Armstrong et al., 2006) is recommended by [CONTACT_136367] (Lytle et al., 2018). 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck & Steer, 1987) 21-item version is a widely used measure 
of the symptoms of depression. A voluminous literature has documented good internal 
consistency (studies range .73 to .95), short-term test-retest reliability, and convergent validity 
(Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988).  In a recent consecutive series of N=200 obese BED patients at Yale, 
alpha coefficient was .87.
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11; Patton et al., 1995). The BIS-11 is a well established and 
widely scale of impulsivity; BIS-11 yields three second-order factors: attentional (consisting of the 
first-order factors attention and cognitive instability), motor (consisting of the first-order factors 
motor and perseverance) and non-planning (comprised of the first-order factors self-control and 
cognitive complexity) (Patton et al., 1995. These measures are relevant to disordered eating and 
reward systems (Carver & White, 1994), neurobiology of BED (Balodis et al., 2013), and to models 
of BED and possible LDX effects (Kessler et al., 2016). 
Delayed-Discounting Task (DDT), related to impulsivity, occurs when individuals choose smaller, 
more immediate rewards over larger rewards that would occur after a time delay (Green & 
Myerson, 2004). Analysis of responses with varied time delays and varied rewards indicates 
individuals’ selections fall into a hyperbola-shaped pattern balancing delay and size of rewards 
(Green & Myerson, 2004) including obesity (Thomas et al., 2015). Individuals with BED show 
steeper responses than participants with obesity (Manwaring et al., 2011). Kirby [CONTACT_832] a DDT that 
asks participants to choose between two hypothetical rewards, one of which is after a delay. 
Amount of the short-term reward, long term reward, and time delay vary across 27 items, 
allowing for the computation of a “discounting rate” (i.e., when participants do not have a 
preference between smaller immediate reward and the larger but delayed reward) fitted to a 
hyperbolic discount curve (Kirby, 2009). These discounting rates have shown evidence of stability 
over 5-week (r=.77) and 57-week (r=.63) test-retest periods. DDT is relevant to neurobiologic 
models of BED (Balodis, Grilo, & Potenza, 2015) and models of LDX (Kessler et al., 2015).

report questionnaire that adapted the 11 symptoms of substance dependence (as listed in the 
DSM-5 to assess addictive-type eating behaviors.
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) is a widely used 19-item self-report measure which assesses 
sleep quality during the prior month (Buysse et al., 1989). The PSQI generates a global score 
ranging from 0 to 21; scores greater than five are indicative of poor sleep quality.
Brief Resilience Scale is a psychometrically-sound brief measure assessing a person’s ability to 
thrive and recover from stress.
Physical Assessment:
Pregnancy test: All women of reproductive age who are sexually active will be required to have a 
pregnancy test before Stage 1 randomization. Women of reproductive age who are sexually 
active who are randomized to Stage 1 medication groups (CBT+ LDX or LDX ONLY) will also 
require a pregnancy test before Stage 2 treatment.  
Lipid profiles will be obtained following established protocols (12-hr overnight fast, no exercise 
for 48 hr, a.m. draw) (Anderson et al., 1995). 
Glycemic Control will be determined with HbA1c, a routine measure of average glucose control 
for a previous (3-month) period. 
Hepatic function panel (Liver Function) will be assessed for safety. 
Creatinine w/ EGFR (Renal Function) will be assessed for safety.
Glucose, Mean Plasma Glucose, and Insulin levels will be obtained.
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) will be assessed if patients report any history of thyroid 
disease or are taking thyroid medications. 
Body weight measured (no shoes) on high-capacity equilibrated digital scales and height measured 
on stadiometer to nearest 0.1 cm will be used to calculate BMI (kg∙m-2). Weight will be measured at 
all assessment points and will also be measured every two weeks throughout treatments. 
Blood Pressure (BP) and Heart Rate (HR).  BP readings (systolic and diastolic) and HR will be 
obtained regularly at clinic meetings.    
Urine drug testing: For non-responders in Stage 2 (those eligible for the NB versus placebo arm), 
participants will receive urine drug testing for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]. 
Perceptions of Treatment: 
Treatment Credibility ratings will be examined before beginning each stage of treatment. 
Placebo/Med Ratings Patients and clinicians will provide medication versus placebo ratings. 
Treatment Compliance for CBT will include session attendance and self-monitoring compliance 
and counts. Compliance for medication treatment(s) will include pi[INVESTIGATOR_136288] “objective” method. Medication compliance with LDX will be 
monitored through evaluation of urine levels of amphetamine.  In addition, we will be able to 
explore the relationships between compliance for CBT and LDX with the primary outcomes. 
Adverse Events will be collected during clinic visits using standard adverse event checklists of 
commonly reported adverse events for the LDX and the NB medications. Research-clinicians will 
ask open-ended and follow-up questions as needed.

Participants will be interviewed by a trained research clinician (MINI and EDE) to determine whether they 
meet criteria for binge-eating disorder. These diagnostic clinical interviews will also determine whether 
participants have any co-existing psychiatric conditions (including substance use disorders) that require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136293]/different treatment. The study physician will determine medical eligibility 
based on results of participants’ physical examination (within one year of starting the study), as well as results 
of the baseline assessment. Information obtained from the physical examination will include an EKG and a list 
of current medications, which participants will be asked to bring to their baseline assessment.  For otherwise 
healthy participants, an EKG during the past two years will be acceptable. Medical review is required for all 
participants.  Therefore, communication with treating physicians occurs for each patient.  If the study 
physician requires additional information, the study physician will contact [CONTACT_1963]. 
Source of Research Materials  
Data will be collected in the form of standardized clinical interviews, self-report questionnaires, clinical 
interviews, and traditional medical methodologies including standard laboratory blood tests.  All the 
assessments are described in the previous section (Research Design).  The data will be used for clinical and 
research purposes only.
10.Risks: Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, discomforts, or 
inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research. 
The primary risks of this study are the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the pharmacologic therapy with 
LDX, the pharmacotherapy with NB, placebo during Stage [ADDRESS_154803], the assessment procedures, and lack of 
efficacy.       
1)CBT:  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an established and widely-used psychological therapy for BED 
(and for other forms of eating disorders and obesity). The only foreseeable risks include some mild 
discomfort or embarrassment when discussing binge-eating, eating patterns, or body image concerns. 
Previous controlled clinical trials with similar interventions with large numbers of similar patients have 
not reported problems.  Any troublesome effects would be readily identifiable by [CONTACT_136369].  Thus, the risks of CBT are judged to be minimal.
2)LDX:  Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) is the only FDA-approved medication for the treatment of BED. LDX has 
demonstrated short-term effectiveness relative to placebo and safety in one phase 2 and two phase 3 
RCTs. An additional Phase 3 open-label 12-month extension safety and tolerability trial of LDX for BED 
with N=604 patients who completed previous Shire RCTs (McElroy et al., 2015, 2016) reported the 12-
month safety/tolerability profile of LDX was consistent with short-term (12-week) BED trials and with 
established profile of LDX for ADHD (FDA-approved); 9% of patients reported treatment emergent side-
effects resulting in medicine discontinuation (Gasior et al., 2017).

dry mouth and insomnia.  LDX was associated with the following side effects in less than 10%, but twice 
as often as placebo: decreased appetite, increased heart rate, feeling jittery, constipation, anxiety, 
diarrhea, decreased weight, hyperhidrosis, vomiting, gastroenteritis, paresthesia, pruritis, upper 
abdominal pain, energy increased, urinary tract infection, nightmare, restlessness, and oropharyngeal 
pain.  
Serious risks of LDX include psychiatric problems and heart complications, including sudden death in 
people who have heart problems or heart defects, and stroke and heart attack in adults. Central nervous 
system stimulants, including lisdexamfetamine, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms, such as 
hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania, even in individuals without a history of psychotic illness.
LDX is associated with increased risk of serotonin syndrome when co-administered with serotonergic 
agents, but also during overdosage situations. The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with 
co-administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors which may increase the risk with increased exposure to the active 
metabolite dextroamphetamine. 
This study will provide LDX following the same dosing and procedures and time frame (12-weeks) as the 
large phase [ADDRESS_154804]; this delivery safety is further supported by [CONTACT_136370] (2017) report of 
LDX vs placebo maintenance.  LDX is also classified as a DEA-controlled substance and product labeling 
includes a “Warning” that CNS stimulants have high potential for abuse/dependence.  
Bruxism is also a potential rare side effect. History of bruxism in response to a medication will be 
exclusionary.
NB:  Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136294] (NB) is FDA approved for the treatment of obesity.  NB has 
demonstrated safety, tolerability, and efficacy for patients with obesity treated over much longer periods 
of time (>12 months) than in the present study (Greenway et al., 2010). NB was associated with the 
following side effects in 10% or more of the time and significantly greater than rate in placebo:  nausea, 
headache, constipation, and vomiting.  NB was associated with the following side effects less than 10% of 
cases but significantly more than placebo:  dizziness, insomnia, dry mouth, and diarrhea.  Less common 
side effects include risk of seizure, increase in blood pressure and heart rate, hepatotoxicity, and angle-
closure glaucoma. Large studies (e.g., Greenway et al., 2010 with N=1742) reported that the proportion of 
participants reporting a serious adverse event did not differ between Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136295] 
(1.6% versus 1.4%) and none of the observed events were judged to be related to the study.  Since one of 
the study’s (Stage 2) medication may be a combination Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_136296], including bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the following information will be included in 
the study consent forms:

attacks (extreme fear without apparent reason)."

4)Assessments:  Completion of the assessment procedures may cause some mild anxiety or embarrassment 
to some patients.  Drawing blood from a vein to perform necessary laboratory tests is quite safe.  
Sometimes a bruise will occur at the puncture site and on very rare occasions a blood clot or infection 
may occur.  If this occurs, appropriate treatment will be instituted immediately.
5)Failure to Improve:  There is a chance that the patient's BED may fail to improve or may worsen during 
the study.  Patients will be withdrawn from the study if their clinical condition deteriorates to a significant 
degree.  Our experience with numerous RCTs is that this is quite rare. In the case of non-responders to 
Stage 1 treatments (with the “leading” active treatments), if warranted due to clinical status and/or if 
participants request, appropriate referrals will be provided.  
11.Minimizing Risks: Describe the manner in which the above-mentioned risks will be minimized.
CBT and Interviews: The research clinicians in this study and additional research staff will be carefully trained 
and supervised by [CONTACT_136371], assessments, and evaluations. The clinical evaluators 
are carefully trained and supervised research clinicians (doctoral level and/or advanced trainees).  All of these 
clinical-research staff who have multiple contacts with the participants can reasonably be expected to identify 
potential problems. They are expected given their experience and training to identify any problems or distress 
and to take appropriate action as medically indicated.  The study investigators will be continuously available 
to the research clinicians and to the independent evaluators to discuss any problems and to implement any 
needed interventions or offer appropriate referrals.  The repeated detailed assessments during the course of 
treatment (and the two follow-up assessments) will allow for additional and ample opportunity to identify 
difficulties. In the event that a participant experiences undue distress, ample resources at Yale are available.  
LDX:  Effective screening will exclude all prospective participants who would be at greater risk for 
complications because of medical or psychiatric illnesses. LDX is classified as a DEA-controlled substance and 
product labeling includes a “Warning” that CNS stimulants have high potential for abuse/dependence. Thus, 
potential participants with a history of drug and alcohol problems will be excluded and all participants in the 
RCT will be evaluated carefully at all clinic visits for any signs of medication misuse in addition to structured 
assessments of potential side-effect or adverse events per the published procedures (McElroy et al., 2015). 
The LDX pharmacologic treatment protocol follows the evidence-based dose-optimization protocol that has 
demonstrated safety, tolerability, and efficacy in the same patient group during the 12-week duration of 
treatment. Subjects will be evaluated repeatedly throughout the study and will be monitored for any signs of 
medication misuse and for side-effects and adverse reactions using structured assessments at all clinic visits.  
If any participant experiences adverse reactions, or if side effects are too severe, the medication will be 
discontinued. Regarding the risk of serotonin syndrome, all SSRI medication and strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 
will be excluded for this study.  Regarding risk of heart complications, individuals with a history of cardiac 
disease will be excluded.  Participants will be required to have an EKG before enrolling. Subjects with a 
baseline EKG that is assessed and determined to be indicative of one of the  cardiac disorders listed in the 
exclusion criteria will be excluded. Regarding psychiatric symptoms, such as mania and psychosis: At monthly 
follow-ups during Stage 1 and Stage 2, study clinicians will assess manic and psychotic symptoms using 
structured questions from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a well-established 
interview used to assess psychiatric disorders. This added specific assessment will be conducted with

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 20 of 55participants aged 30 years or less (given previous LDX trial report that 0.1% of those patients might have 
developed such symptoms). Any older patients assessed who are suspected of having such symptoms would 
also be assessed carefully. We note that subjects with history of psychotic or bipolar illness are excluded from 
participating and this should minimize such risks.  Study clinicians are supervised by [CONTACT_136372]. If participants endorse manic or psychotic symptoms (or 
any of the other potential symptoms of concern), clinicians will consult with the study investigators for safety 
management and treatment planning. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is described below.
NB: The NB pharmacologic treatment protocol (Stage 2 for non-responders to Stage 1) follows the evidence-
based dosing that has demonstrated safety, tolerability, and efficacy for obesity treated over much longer 
periods of time (>12 months) than the present study.  Large studies (e.g., Greenway et al., 2010 with N=1742) 
reported that the proportion of participants reporting a serious adverse event did not differ between 
Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136295] (1.6% versus 1.4%) and none of the observed events were judged to be 
related to the study. Warning about Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5390]: We will include this advisory pertaining to opi[INVESTIGATOR_136299]-based medications and drugs in the written consent form as well as the verbal consent 
process: Naltrexone can cause withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_136300]. You should not participate and we will not include you in the study if we know or suspect you are using 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573]-containing drugs. In addition to structured MINI and clinical diagnostic interviewing and medical record 
reviews, we will perform lab test with potential subjects suspected of opi[INVESTIGATOR_136301].   
Monitoring of Depressive Symptoms. In response to the FDA advisory described above on page 17, depressive 
symptoms will be monitored frequently. To monitor changes in depressive symptoms, patients will be asked 
to complete the BDI-II at monthly clinic visits. The research clinicians, who are trained and supervised by 
[CONTACT_136373], will review BDIs during the clinic visit, and will asked pointed 
questions pertaining to suicidality/suicidal ideation (i.e., suicidal thoughts, plan, means, and intent) using the 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. If it appears, based on the clinical judgment of the research clinician, 
that the participant is experiencing significant adverse effects of the medication, the investigators and study 
physician will be consulted and a determination of whether to discontinue the medication will be made. The 
participant will be will asked to continue to follow-up assessments (if applicable). If warranted, the participant 
will be given a referral and safety planning will be implemented.  If any participant experiences adverse 
reactions, or if side effects are too severe, the medication will be discontinued.  
Finally, risk of seizure may be minimized by [CONTACT_136374]-
administration with high-fat meal. Increase in Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Monitor blood pressure and 
heart rate in all patients, especially those with cardiac or cerebrovascular disease. Hepatotoxicity: Cases of 
hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction observed with naltrexone exposure. Angle-closure 
glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles 
treated with antidepressants. Use of Antidiabetic Medications: Weight loss may cause hypoglycemia. Monitor 
blood glucose.
Wallet Safety Card. Each participant will be given a wallet card with the code number for the medication 
assignment in the event of an emergency and the need for breaking the blind. Participants will be provided 
with contact [CONTACT_136375], as well as emergency numbers in case of adverse 
events or other concerns.
Medication Titration & Taper. 
LDX: Participants will have up to three weeks of up-titration: one pi[INVESTIGATOR_34082] (30 mg/day; 1 week), then one pi[INVESTIGATOR_136302] (50 mg/day; 1 week), then one pi[INVESTIGATOR_34082] (70 mg; 1 week) based on acceptable tolerability and clinical 
need). If [ADDRESS_154806] titration to 50 mg/day can occur.  For the remaining treatment

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 21 of 55(weeks 4-12), the optimized LDX dose (50 or 70 mg/day) will be maintained.  For the Stage 2 randomized 
maintenance (double-blind) treatment, a similar approach to dose-optimization will be followed.  LDX down-
titration for Stage 1 and Stage 2: 70 mg to 50 mg for 2 days, then 30 mg for 2 days, to discontinue 
medications. At the end of Stage 2, participants on placebo will take the same number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_136303].
Non-responders NB:  NB titration is described on pages 9-[ADDRESS_154807] 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136304]. For NB, taper off is not medically necessary for participants on the study 
medication for 4 weeks or less.
Assessments:  We will evaluate and monitor blood pressure and heart rate because studies have found that 
patients with obesity treated with NB have significantly lower drops than placebo in systolic BP changes (-0.4 
vs. -2.1), diastolic BP (-0.1 vs -1.0), pulse rate (1.0 vs -0.1) (Greenway et al., 2010).  Blood pressure and heart 
rate will be measured during all evaluation visits. Two readings will be taken at each assessment. In the event 
of systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg, or an increase in heart 
rate of ≥15 bpm (from baseline), the study physician will be notified and will determine whether additional 
intervention and/or medication discontinuation is warranted. Liver function.  Participants with severe hepatic 
disease will be excluded if this is detected at baseline, per exclusion criteria. Liver function will also be 
repeated in the Stage [ADDRESS_154808] for non-responders who are randomized to NB or placebo at month-1 clinic visits. 
The study physician will review results of a hepatic panel prior to the start of treatment and throughout 
treatment. Any changes and out-of-range values will be flagged immediately by [CONTACT_136376], and the 
study physician will determine whether additional intervention and/or medication discontinuation is 
warranted. 
Given the uncertain effects of medication during pregnancy, the following precautions will be taken for 
women of reproductive age who are sexually active: 1) a pregnancy test will be required at Stage 1 and Stage 
2 (but only for those who will be re-randomized to treatment in Stage 2), 2) will be required to use a reliable 
method of birth control while she is in the study and to alert the research team if she departs from her birth 
control plans or if, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_136305], she thinks she might be pregnant, and 3) if a woman 
becomes pregnant after study entry, her medication will be discontinued. 
Failure to Improve: There is a chance that the patient's BED may fail to improve or may worsen during the 
study.  Patients will be withdrawn from the study if their clinical condition deteriorates to a significant degree.  
Our experience with numerous RCTs is that this is quite rare. In the case of non-responders to Stage 1 
treatments (with the “leading” active treatments), Stage [ADDRESS_154809] another pharmacologic treatment 
strategy.  If warranted due to clinical status and/or if participants request, appropriate referrals will be 
provided.   
Protecting Confidentiality: To ensure confidentiality, all participant research records will be kept in locked files 
in the Department of Psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine.  All research forms, interviews, 
measures, audiotapes, and computer data will be coded to ensure anonymity and will be kept in separate 
locked files.  Data analysis and reporting will not allow for identification of any individual participants. All 
research personnel will be trained and supervised around confidentiality issues. The training will include 
formal NIH or Yale IRB modules with testing certification as well as HIPAA guidelines to follow around 
confidentiality. All information collected will remain confidential except when we are legally required to 
disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse of a child or elderly 
person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property. Research records may be the subject

for protecting human subjects, including the Yale Human Investigation Committee (HIC), may have access to 
the research records. Additionally, the funding agency (NIH) may have access to the research records. The 
subject’s identity will remain protected except as required for legal or regulatory inquiries. Individually 
identifiable health information will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996. All research personnel will be trained on HIC and HIPAA procedures.
Informed Consent:   Research clinicians (who have completed IRB and ethics training) will meet with potential 
participants to discuss the study and all procedures, treatments, and risks and obtain written informed 
consent. All potential participants will be free to decide whether or not to participate and are free to 
withdraw from the study at any time. Alternative treatments (both psychosocial and pharmacological options) 
will be discussed and referrals offered if requested. The written informed consent will be obtained after 
opportunity to discuss and address all questions. A copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to 
the participants and the original will be kept in the participant's file. A decision to not participate or to 
discontinue participation would not adversely influence future interactions with Yale, Yale School of Medicine, 
or the investigative group. 
12.Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) based on 
the investigator’s risk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make the final determination of the risk to 
subjects.)
a. What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects participating in this 
study?  
Greater than minimal risk 
Although this study qualifies as clinical trial research, it does not meet NIH criteria for Phase III 
clinical trial research. Nonetheless, this study will be monitored twice yearly by a Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) as the study involves double-blind placebo controlled evaluation of 
medication effects that may involve greater than minimal risk. Adequate surveillance and 
protections will be put in place to discover adverse events promptly and keep their effects to a 
minimum. The treatment interventions and assessment protocols are well-established and pose 
primarily low risks to subjects. The DSMP focuses on close monitoring by [CONTACT_978] (Grilo) in 
conjunction with the study MD ([CONTACT_136400]). Excessive adverse events and/or any serious events 
(should they occur) will be reported promptly to the NIH and to the IRB (Human Investigation 
Committee) at the Yale University School of Medicine.  In addition to the DSMP, the Yale IRB 
reviews all aspects of the study protocol (including progress and problems) minimally once per 
year. 
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for the 
children participating in this study? NA
c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Examples of DSMPs are

effects to a minimum. During the review process, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_136306], require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. 
Either the principal investigator, the IRB or the DSMB have the authority to stop or suspend the study or 
require modifications.
The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal. Although we do not view 
the risks associated with the study medication as minimal risk, the established safety and validity of the 
LDX (FDA-approval of Vyvanse for BED) and Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (FDA-approval of Contrave for obesity) 
medications in RCTs suggest that the study procedures and medications are not high risk. 
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible 
to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
The treatment interventions and assessment protocols are well-established and pose primarily low risks 
to subjects. The DSMP focuses on close monitoring by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_136307]. Excessive 
adverse events and/or any serious events (should they occur) will be reported promptly to the NIH and to 
the Yale Human Investigation Committee.  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor this project. This board is already in place at Yale 
for HIC [PHONE_3071]. The DSMB is composed of Yale investigators who are independent of the proposed 
trial and experienced in various aspects relevant to the current proposal including: conduct of clinical 
trials, biostatistics, primary care, and the clinical management of obesity and BED. 
We have developed a standard DSMB report form that summarizes, on a twice-yearly basis: 
1. Recruitment, retention, and follow-up rates for the study and compares them to target rates.
2. Rates of data completeness and availability of primary outcome data
3. Occurrence of AEs and SAEs
4. Report of study progress since the last report.  
5. Rates of recruitment of women and minorities with respect to targets.
These reports are generated by [CONTACT_9137], and reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_136308]. DSMB comments are documented and forwarded to the Yale IRB at the time of 
the annual review and re-approval. They will also be summarized as part of the annual progress report to 
NIDDK.  However, if adverse events occur in greater magnitude or frequency than expected these will be 
reported to the DSMB, HIC, and NIH prior to scheduled reports. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_136309]-serious and unanticipated adverse events. The DSMB may call 
an ad-hoc meeting to address emergent safety concerns.
Because the projected effect sizes may not be large enough for detection during interim analyses, we are 
not proposing a preliminary analysis of accumulating efficacy and safety data by [CONTACT_15500]. 
Instead, we propose to submit a twice-yearly report of aggregate data to the DSMB members that 
contains screening data, baseline demographics, retention data, serious adverse events data, as well as 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 24 of 55accrual status, and any other data that will help in the assessment of the clinical trial. Based on this 
report, each DSMB member will complete a form making one of two recommendations: 1) continue 
recruitment as planned; or 2) schedule formal DSMB meeting immediately. If any DSMB member 
recommends a meeting, this will be scheduled, minutes will be kept, the report will be reviewed with the 
PI, and the committee will vote on whether the study should: 1) continue recruitment unchanged; 2) 
continue with a protocol amendment; 3) stop recruiting pending further investigation; and 4) the Yale IRB 
will be informed.  
Measurement and reporting of adverse events. 
Adverse event data will be collected on an on-going basis. These data will be collected and examined with 
blindness to the medication conditions. Adverse events data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], co-investigators, 
and the safety officer throughout this trial (see Table below). A summary of adverse events will be 
provided to the Yale IRB yearly during the annual renewal review process. Any serious or unanticipated 
adverse events will be reported to the NIH and to the Yale IRB within 48 hours.   
The frequency of data review is summarized in the following table: 
TableData type Frequency of Review

Table 2 Treatment completion rates (retention/attrition) Twice Yearly Twice Yearly
Table [ADDRESS_154813] for DSMB NA Twice Yearly
Attribution of Adverse Events:  
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures by [CONTACT_136378]:
a) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to the investigational procedure/agent.
b) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to the investigational procedure/agent.
c) Possible: Adverse event may be related to the investigational procedure/agent.
d) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedure/agent.
e) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to the procedure/investigational agent.
Plan for Grading Adverse Events:  
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe adverse event 
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events: In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_136311] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered 
serious if it results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 25 of 552. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Plan for events to the Yale IRB that are unexpected AND related AND involve risk of harm to subjects or 
others:
The PIs will report any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three of these conditions to the IRB 
immediately: 
1. Unexpected (in nature, specificity, severity, or frequency); given (a) the research procedures 
described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol and informed 
consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; AND
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); AND 
3. Suggests that the research places participants or others at greater risk of harm (physical, 
psychological, economic, legal, or social) than previously known or recognized. 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-medical in 
nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse events and 
unanticipated adverse device effects.  Adverse events are reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_136312] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the appropriate 
forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt reporting 
requirements described in IRB Policy 710 should be reported to the IRB in summary form at the time of 
continuing review and/or a current DSMB report. If appropriate, such summary may be a simple brief 
statement that events have occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as previously 
documented.  
Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s research 
monitors, e.g., study sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies: 
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified: 
i. All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol 
ii. National Institutes of Health 
The investigators will conduct a review of all adverse events upon completion of every study subject. The 
investigators will evaluate the frequency and severity of the adverse events and determine if 
modifications to the protocol or consent form are required.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 26 of 55Procedures for providing follow up care:
Medical monitoring will occur at all clinic and follow up visits and medical care will be provided if 
warranted. If a study participant experiences any psychiatric symptoms or distress (e.g., depressive 
symptoms or suicidality) at any stage of study participation he/she will receive short-term treatment and 
support from the study treatment team (including psychologists and a psychiatrist) and will be connected 
to a local emergency department (e.g., the Crisis Intervention Unit at Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 
his/her physician or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136313].
Measurement and reporting of subject accrual, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Review of the rate of subject accrual and adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria will occur regularly by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-Investigators and yearly by [CONTACT_136379]. These reviews will help to assure that 
participants meet eligibility criteria and ethnic diversity goals outlined in the grant proposal. 
Measurement and reporting of participant treatment completion rates. 
Participation rates (retention and attrition) will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_136380]-
investigators to identify any potential problems, and formally by [CONTACT_136381]-yearly.  Any 
differential dropout across blinded study groups and/or higher than expected dropout will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_136382], if any, corrective action 
needs to be taken.
During the reviews, if the DSMB has concerns about whether attrition has reached a level that might 
inhibit the ability of the study to address its primary aims, they will suggest a meeting to discuss methods 
for improving subject retention. Previous pharmacotherapy studies for BED (with comparable time 
frames for pharmacotherapy) have reported attrition rates between 20% and 38%.  Studies of NB for 
obesity treatment reported attrition of 30% to 45%. Thus, “trigger points” for review and discussion by 
[CONTACT_22660] [INVESTIGATOR_136314]:  35% (“low alert”), 40% (“mid alert”), 45% (“high alert”), 
50% (“extreme alert”).  With early alerts to problems, action would be taken to avoid higher level alerts; if 
a higher level alert should arise, more drastic actions would be taken.  
Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136315], it is more likely that attrition 
or difficulty in recruiting adequate numbers of participants will require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136316].  However, as outlined, adverse events will be monitored in all participants, and the 
safety officer, together with the PI, will alert the Yale IRB and the NIH if a larger (or more serious) than 
reasonably expected adverse event rate should occur.  Other potential issues relating to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136317]: 
1.  New Information 
It is unlikely that any new information will become available during this trial that would necessitate 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  If new safety data (i.e., pertaining to short-term use of the study medication) become 
available, this will be evaluated. 
2.  Limits of Assumptions 
It is possible that baseline differences between the treatment conditions, excessive attrition, and/or 
missing data could limit the value of data analysis. Baseline differences across blinded treatment groups, 
if present, will be evaluated yearly and considered in relation to potential effects on the power to detect 
differences in the primary outcomes.  If these effects were to develop and be sizeable, alterations to the

communicated to the NIH. 
The following actions would be taken at each level of alert: 
(1) Low-level alert = Review of potential problems by [CONTACT_976].
(2) Mid-level alert = Meeting with co-investigators to discuss approaches to minimize further 
losses to follow-up/dropouts. 
(3) High-level alert = Meeting with co-investigators to determine further alterations of study 
protocol to complete the study with no further losses.
(4) Extreme-level alert = In the unlikely event of a 50% dropout rate prior to the mid-study time 
point, discontinuing the trial would be considered.
3.  Limits of Rules 
There are other situations that could occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136318]/or including a 
section on the safety report entitled “Other situations that have occurred since the last safety report that 
warrant discussion” to allow for communication of concerns. 
Finally, as currently outlined above, the DSMB has the authority to stop the trial following any serious 
adverse event or following reviews of adverse events.

DATA ANALYSIS  
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for randomized groups will be compared using chi-square 
tests for categorical variables, and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables. Continuous 
variables will be examined for adherence to normal distribution using normal probability plots and 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. If normality not satisfied and transformations do not help with achieving 
normality, alternative analytic strategies will be considered such as generalized estimating equations or 
nonparametric methods.  Dropouts and completers will be compared. Analyses will be intent-to-treat; 
patients will be followed regardless of treatment completion to minimize missing data. Primary outcomes will 
be tested at two-sided 0.05 significance level. Secondary analyses will be adjusted for multiple tests using 
Bonferroni correction. 
Overall Data Analysis Strategy will involve MIXED EFFECTS MODELS (Diggle et al, 2002, Gueorguieva & Krystal, 
2004) to compare treatments. These models allow for different numbers of observations per subject, use all 
available data on each subject, and are unaffected by [CONTACT_136383]. Further advantage is capacity to 
test and account for individual-difference contributions to treatment outcomes (Cudeck, 1996; Cudeck & 
Klebe, 2002; Hedeker et al., 1996; Hedeker & Gibbons, 1996; Singer, 1998). They provide flexibility in 
modeling the correlation structure of data. In models for each outcome, we will include fixed effects of time, 
treatment, and interaction between time and treatment, and random subject-level effects. Because we 
cannot a priori predict the shape of responses over time in each arm of the trial we will first treat time as a 
categorical predictor and will then test for polynomial trends over time. We will consider different error 
structures (e.g., AR1, independence) and select the best fitting one based on information criteria. We will

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 28 of 55compare dropout patterns between groups and if there are concerns of informative dropout or informative 
intermittent missing data, we will use pattern mixture models (Hedeker & Gibbons, 1997) to perform 
sensitivity analyses.
(1)  STAGE 1 – Primary Outcomes Aim 1 and Secondary Outcomes Aim 2a:  Compare LDX and CBT effects, 
alone and in combination, for acute BED outcomes. Analyses examining the co-primary outcomes (reduction 
in binge-eating and percent weight loss) and examining the secondary outcomes (binge remission, eating 
disorder psychopathology, depression, metabolic variables) will be intent-to-treat using mixed-effects models 
per the overall strategy described above. Mixed-model analyses on continuous (or pseudo-continuous) data 
will use SAS PROC MIXED; mixed-model analyses on binary variables will use SAS PROC GLIMMIX. Logistic 
regression will be used for categorical outcomes (i.e., remission from binge-eating (defined as 0 binges/past 
28 days on EDE interview). Significantly greater reductions in binge eating in CBT and CBT+LDX groups 
compared to LDX, and weight loss in LDX and CBT+LDX compared to CBT will be considered supportive of our 
primary aim hypotheses. We do not anticipate significant differences between CBT and CBT+LDX on binge 
eating and between LDX and CBT+LDX on weight loss but the mixed model approach will allow us to estimate 
the magnitude of the effects with associated confidence intervals.
(2)  STAGE 1 – Secondary Outcomes Aim 2b: Explore conceptually and empi[INVESTIGATOR_136319], 
moderators, and mediators for the primary outcomes (reductions in binge-eating and weight loss) and 
secondary categorical outcome (binge-eating remission). We will use the Kraemer et al (2002) approach to 
assess predictor, moderator and mediator effects by [CONTACT_136384], moderator and mediator 
variables to the models above. Predictors will be identified as variables with significant main effects on the 
outcome, moderators as variables with significant interactions with treatment on the outcome, and 
mediators will need to be significantly affected by [CONTACT_3148], to be related to the outcome and have main or 
interactive effects with treatment on the outcome. We will explore two empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675]-supported predictors and 
moderators of BED outcomes – overvaluation of shape/weight (EDE) and depression (BDI-II) (Grilo, Masheb et 
al., 2012; Grilo et al., 2013).  It is necessary to test previous findings to establish them specifically for CBT and 
LDX treatments to inform prescription (i.e., for whom these “leading” treatments work best).      
Finally, we expect that “rapid response” will have differential prognostic significance for CBT and LDX. Based 
on our prior methods (Grilo et al., 2006; Grilo, White, et al., 2012; Masheb & Grilo, 2007), we hypothesize 
that overall rapid response will predict superior outcomes in both treatments (i.e., greater weight losses in 
LDX and greater reductions in binge-eating in both CBT and LDX) and that non-rapid-response will predict no 
further improvement in LDX but not for CBT (where gradual improvement is expected).   In terms of 
mediators, per Kraemer et al (2002) models, we will explore whether differential symptom changes during 
treatment are associated with subsequent longer-term primary outcomes (binge-eating and weight loss). 
Repeated (and early) assessments of eating behaviors and cognitions (EDE-Q-I, TFEQ) constructs relevant to 
CBT, food-reward constructs (FCI-II, PFS) and executive control (Trails, BIS, DDT) constructs relevant to LDX, 
food-reward (FCI-II, PFS) constructs relevant to NB, and more general conceptually supported constructs 
(depression (BDI-II)), will yield relevant change variables for analyses of mediation (i.e., testing subsequent 
changes in binge-eating and weight). These analyses are exploratory and hence may be underpowered. 
However, they will provide valuable information in the form of variability estimates and effect size estimates 
for future more definitive studies.    
(3)  STAGE 2 – Primary Aim 1: Among Responders to Stage 1 treatments with LDX (i.e., LDX and CBT+LDX), 
compare LDX to placebo as a treatment maintenance strategy. The primary outcome will be “relapse” to 
DSM-5 level of once-weekly binge-eating and secondary outcomes will be binge-eating frequency, weight 
loss, eating-disorder pathology, and depression. For the primary outcome (predicting relapse), we will follow 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 29 of 55analytic strategy of studies testing medication for maintenance (i.e., fluoxetine) for bulimia nervosa (Romano 
et al (2002) and for anorexia nervosa (Walsh et al (2006) which was recently used in the Shire maintenance 
study of LDX for BED (Hudson et al., 2015).  Stage 2 LDX and placebo will be compared on the proportion of 
Stage 1 responders who “relapse” using chi-squared tests and Cox Proportion Hazards Tests; we will explore 
further using survival analyses to estimate whether time to relapse differs between LDX and placebo. For the 
secondary outcomes, we will use mixed effects models to assess whether there is significant change in binge 
eating or weight loss between the group who continue LDX treatment and the group who receive placebo. 
We anticipate that subjects randomized to LDX maintenance will maintain better outcomes than patients 
randomized to placebo. We will also perform parallel analyses on all three groups (CBT, LDX, CBT+LDX) to 
compare outcomes at the 6-month time point (i.e., comparing 3-month CBT and 6-month two-stage 
treatments). 
(4a) STAGE 2 – Secondary Aim 1:  Explore LDX and CBT effects, alone and in combination, for longer-term BED 
outcomes. Our two-stage design will also allow us to also compare CBT (i.e., Stage 1 CBT-only short-term) 
versus the Stage 2 LDX/placebo maintenance treatment (i.e., Stage 2 LDX/placebo following Stage 1 LDX or 
Stage 1 CBT+LDX) for longer-term outcomes through 18 months. This will inform clinical questions regarding 
whether LDX maintenance treatment following either acute LDX treatment or acute combined CBT+LDX differ 
and whether it offers any additional benefits over acute CBT-only (4b).    
  
STAGE 2 – Secondary Aim 2: Among Non-responders to Stage 1 treatments with LDX, Explore the 
effectiveness of switching to an alternative medication (NB versus placebo).  Primary outcomes will be 
reducing binge-eating and reducing weight and secondary outcomes will be binge-eating remission, eating-
disorder pathology, and depression.  We will use similar analyses to Primary Aim 1:  mixed models for the 
continuous outcome variables and logistic regression for categorical (remission) variable.     
(5) Secondary Aim: Generate estimates of cost-effectiveness. We will compute within-study costs for CBT, 
LDX, CBT+LDX and SMART Stage [ADDRESS_154814]-treatments and at follow-ups, will be used to calculate quality-adjusted life years 
(QALY) following established methods (Revicki et al., 2005) also used in BED studies of cost-effectiveness 
specifically of LDX (Agh et al., 2016) and CBTgsh (Lynch et al., 2010; Dickerson et al., 2011), as well as for 
obesity (Tsai et al., 2005; Malone et al., 2005) including obesity medications (Ara et al., 2012), and for similar 
SMART designs (switching medication for initial non-responders) in depression (Singh et al 2017). We will 
calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the various arms; in these ICERs, the numerator will 
be the incremental medical cost and the denominator will be the incremental effectiveness of the specific 
treatment compared to CBT. Confidence intervals for the ICERs will be determined using non-parametric 
bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. These ICERS will be compared to the two previous BED (Agh et al., 2016; Lynch et al., 2010) 
analyses and inform subsequent more definitive larger-scale effectiveness studies.     
POWER ANALYSIS: We calculated our sample size to have at least 80% power at 2-tailed alpha level 0.025 
(adjust for 2 outcomes) to detect clinically meaningful effects in Stage 1 for co-primary outcomes (binge 
eating and weight loss) and Stage 2 for primary outcome (relapse by [CONTACT_136385]) at 2-tailed level of 
0.05 according based on documented effects of the two treatment components (LDX and CBT).  In Stage 1, 
with 180 subjects total (60 per treatment group), accounting for up to 20% dropout, we can detect medium 
effect sizes (d=0.64, f=0.32) for the between group comparisons with more than 80% power at two-sided 
alpha level of 0.025. These effect sizes are smaller than the effect sizes calculated based on data (Telch et al., 
1990; Grilo et al., 2005; McElroy et al., 2015, McElroy 2016) which ranged d=0.69 to d=0.78 for the 
comparison of CBT to LDX on binge-eating and was d=1.53 for LDX vs CBT on percent weight loss. Dropout

and obesity medication along with the LDX RCTs (McElroy et al., 2015, 2016). For binary outcomes 
(remission), we can detect the following clinically meaningful differences in proportions (63% vs 35%, 66% vs 
38%) at 2-tailed alpha of 0.025 in Stage 1. These are in line with observed proportions for CBT (62% by [CONTACT_136386] (2010); 64% by [CONTACT_136387]-Moore et al. (2010); LDX (40% and 36% by [CONTACT_136388] (2015; 2016) in BED 
subjects uncomplicated by [CONTACT_3252]-morbidity. Thus, we are well powered for realistic and meaningful effect sizes 
for both primary and secondary outcome variables. In Stage 2, we expect to randomize 65-70% of subjects 
as Responders (per McElroy et al 2017); thus we anticipate to have about 80 subjects from the LDX and

LISDEXAMFETAMINE DIMESYLATE
An important recent development was the FDA approval in January 2015 of a CNS stimulant, 
lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), for the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED based on findings from an 
integrated series of studies funded by [CONTACT_10188] (the manufacturer). The phase II (11-week) RCT demonstrated 
dosing response and that 50mg and 70mg were superior to placebo (McElroy et al., 2015). Two identically 
designed phase III RCTs testing LDX (50–70 mg dose optimization) for moderate-to-severe BED in adults 
(McElroy et al., 2016) found LDX superior to placebo for reducing binge-eating days and reported binge-
eating abstinence rates of LDX versus placebo (Study 1: 40% versus 14%; Study 2: 36% versus 13%) at the end 
of [ADDRESS_154819]-size of 0.83 and 0.97 (McElroy et al., 2016). Another much 
smaller RCT with N=50, also funded by [CONTACT_10188], reported weaker advantage of LDX over placebo (ES = 0.50), 
suggesting the need for further and continued investigation by [CONTACT_29091]. McElroy et al (2017) 
reported time-course data for binge-eating and associated outcomes to expand upon the McElroy et al (2015) 
report regarding the significant reductions (over 80%) in binge-eating with LDX; these analyses suggest an 
early and rapid response (and are supportive of our proposed definition of “response”. The efficacy and 
safety data were reviewed and appear to represent a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio (Citrome, 2015).
LDX was also associated with significant acute weight loss relative to placebo (mean 4.9 kg) (McElroy et al., 
2015, 2016); weight loss was examined as a safety measure. The FDA-approval and manufacturer product 
labeling include a “Limitation of Use” highlighting that LDX is not indicated for weight loss (because other CNS 
stimulant medications for weight loss have been associated with cardiovascular problems and the safety and 
efficacy of LDX for obesity remains uncertain). In the present study, we anticipate that LDX will produce short-
term weight loss and the key and novel research goals will involve the questions of the utility of maintenance 
LDX treatment and longer-term follow-up.  
More recently, two Shire-funded studies have been reported, both providing further support for the 
proposed research. A Phase III open-label 12-month extension safety and tolerability trial of LDX for BED with 
N=604 patients who completed previous Shire RCTs (McElroy et al., 2015, 2016) was completed (Gasior et al., 
2017). Gasior et al (2017) reported the safety/tolerability profile with 12-months of LDX was consistent with 
short-term (12-week) BED trials and with established profile of LDX for ADHD (FDA-approved); 9% of patients 
reported treatment emergent side-effects resulting in medicine discontinuation. Hudson et al (2015 ACNP 
conference), in a double-blind RCT, reported LDX was significantly superior to placebo for preventing relapse 
following clinical response to open-label LDX (3.7% vs 32.1% relapsed, respectively). These findings suggest 
short-term treatment extension with LDX may be effective for decreasing relapse amongst initial responders 
to LDX. Importantly, Hudson et al (2015) did not report follow-up data after discontinuing the maintenance 
treatment and whether LDX enhances maintenance for responders to other treatments is unknown.

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 33 of 55Putative mechanisms of action for LDX.  LDX (l-lysine-dextroamphetamine), is a prodrug of d-amphetamine 
covalently linked to l-lysine, that when metabolized to d-amphetamine (active form) is a moderately potent 
inhibitor of DAT, NET, and VMAT2, with little affinity for SERT; its net effect is increased catecholamine 
availability (Guerdjikova et al., 2016; Hutson et al., 2014; Pennic, 2010; Comiran et al., 2016). LDX seems 
relevant for reducing binge-eating per preclinical and clinical (Vickers et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011), and 
neurobiologic (fMRI) findings suggestive that binge-eating is related to dysfunctions in the dopamine and 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_136277] (Balodis, Grilo, & Potenza, 2015; Balodis, Grilo et al., 2013), which play important roles 
in regulating eating behaviors and reward (Wellman, 2005; Palmiter, 2007).
Risks. LDX is classified as a DEA-controlled substance and product labeling includes a “Warning” that CNS 
stimulants have high potential for abuse/dependence.  Thus, as previously mentioned, potential participants 
with a history of drug and alcohol problems will be excluded and all participants in the RCT will be evaluated 
carefully at all clinic visits for any signs of medication misuse in addition to structured assessments of 
potential side-effect or adverse events per the published procedures (McElroy et al., 2015).  Research has 
found that 9% of patients reported treatment emergent side-effects resulting in medicine discontinuation 
(Gasior et al., 2017). In addition, the following side effects were reported in adults with BED taking LDX and at 
least twice as often as the placebo: dry mouth (36%), insomnia (20%), decreased appetite (8%), increased 
heart rate (7%), feeling jittery (6%), constipation (6%), anxiety (5%), diarrhea (4%), decreased weight (4%), 
hyperhidrosis (4%), and the following side effects occurred at 2% (vomiting, gastroenteritis, paresthesia, 
pruritis, upper abdominal pain, energy increased, urinary tract infection, nightmare, restlessness, and 
oropharyngeal pain. 
NALTREXONE/BUPROPI[INVESTIGATOR_45372] (Stage II Medication for Non-Responders)
In September 2014, the FDA approved (“Contrave”) the combination of naltrexone and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136320] (but not BED). 
NB medication will combine the generics naltrexone (50 mg/day) combined with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (300 mg/day) 
taken daily; matching frequency for placebo).
Mechanisms of Action. The putative mechanisms of action for NB seem relevant for binge eating in addition 
to weight loss. Naltrexone, an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2634], is approved to treat alcohol and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] 
[92]. Naltrexone produces weight loss in lab animals but only minimal weight losses in people [93, 94]. 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136321], noradrenergic, and nicotinic acetyl-cholinergic mechanisms [51-
53]. Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136322], consistent with its FDA indication for 
treating nicotine dependence and reduced weight gain during smoking cessation [54, 55]. Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136323] [56]: in a meta-analysis of five trials of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], the mean difference in weight loss 
was 2.77 kg (CI, 1.1 to 4.5) between bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136324] 6 months. White and Grilo [95] 
reported preliminary, modest support for weight loss specifically in patients with obesity and BED.
NB Combination. The putative mechanisms of action for NB is especially relevant for reducing binge eating 
and weight per hypothesized effects on brain regions implicated in the regulation of food intake and weight 
based on research on the mechanisms of action of leptin [94]. The anorectic effects of leptin result from its 
excitatory effects on pro-opi[INVESTIGATOR_136284] (POMC) neurons in the hypothalamus melancortin system [96, 97]. 
Stimulated POMC signaling decreases food intake, increases energy expenditure, but is then inhibited by 
[CONTACT_136356] [96]. Thus, combining these two drugs will stimulate POMC neurons (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) plus 
block endogenous feedback that inhibits POMC activity (naltrexone) [47, 94]. This synergistic model received 
support both in vitro and in vivo studies [47, 98].

(Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) were effective in promoting weight loss in obese patients [47-49, 99]. These RCTs 
reported significant clinically-meaningful weight losses with sustained-release naltrexone (32 mg/day) plus 
sustained-release bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (360 mg/day) combined in fixed-dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. Most recently, Apovian, Aronne [50], 
in a study of 1496 obese patients reported significantly greater weight losses relative to placebo (-6.5% vs -
1.9% at week 28 and -6.4% vs -1.2% at week 56) and significantly greater likelihood of achieving 5% weight 
loss (56% vs 18% at 28 weeks and 51% vs 17% at 56 weeks). These findings supporting NB medication are 
quite consistent with earlier (large) RCTs which reported the following percentage of patients achieving at 
least 5% weight loss: 56% vs. 18% [48]; 52% vs. 15% [100]. Thus, the proposed RCT study will test the 
effectiveness of Naltrexone/Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_136325]-eating and producing weight 
loss in obese patients with BED.
Risks. Several large-scale studies have found that this medication is safe and effective for the treatment of 
obesity [47-49, 99]. The NB combination approved by [CONTACT_1622] (Contrave) is reported to have the following 
common adverse reactions: nausea (32.5%), constipation (19.2%), headache (17.6%), vomiting (10.7%), 
dizziness (9.9%), insomnia (9.2%), dry mouth (8.1%), and diarrhea (7.1%). In addition, Contrave will have the

If use of a placebo is planned, provide a justification which addresses the following:
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 35 of 55a) Describe the safety and efficacy of other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If there are no other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], state 
this. 
Expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] [21] and critical quantitative meta-analytic reviews [28] conclude CBT is the best-established 
treatment for BED; CBT, however, does not produce clinically meaningful weight loss and is not readily 
available given the need for specialized training. Alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136327] (which also fails to produce weight loss and is not readily available since 
it requires intensive training and few practitioners employ it) and self-help versions of CBT (which will be used 
in this study). Alternative pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_136328] (SSRIs) although 
weight loss is uncertain with those agents.  
Pharmacotherapy (medications) for BED has received increased research attention albeit nearly all RCTs have 
been of short duration and without follow-up period to establish durability [20, 22]. Critical review and meta-
analysis show that several drugs – working through varied mechanisms – have short-term efficacy relative to 
placebo for reducing binge-eating and produce weight loss ranging from modest to none [20]. Placebo-
controlled trials of anticonvulsants topi[INVESTIGATOR_136329] [24-26] have reported effects for reducing 
both binge-eating and weight (with a mean improvement in weight loss of approximately 3-4 kg compared to 
placebo), but have also shown frequent dropout and adverse events which become nearly universal with 
longer use [27]. SSRI antidepressants, previously regarded as a potential treatment strategy [28] are 
characterized by [CONTACT_136355] [20] and produce no weight loss at all [38] and are 
inferior to CBT [29, 30]. 
b) State the maximum total length of time a participant may receive placebo while on the study. 
During Stage 1, participants will not receive placebo.  During Stage 2, participants who are non-responders or 
responders may receive placebo medication for up to 3 months if randomized to placebo. 
c) Address the greatest potential harm that may come to a participant as a result of receiving placebo. 
Without immediate effective treatment, the greatest potential harm is that binge eating and associated 
eating disorder features may not improve. Placebo-controlled trials have rarely reported worsening and 
generally report a positive placebo response (Reas & Grilo, 2014).
d) Describe the procedures that are in place to safeguard participants receiving placebo. 
Possible risks include failure of binge eating and associated eating disorder features to improve. Previous 
experience suggests that the frequency of these situations is rare (Reas & Grilo, 2014). To safeguard 
participants, we plan to assess potential adverse events, side effects, and clinical status. All participants will 
have monthly visits with research clinicians, who can be expected to detect the clinical changes that warrant 
concern. Participants will be removed from the study if, through the consultation of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_136330], it is determined that participant safety is at risk, including worsening depression, suicidal ideation, 
intensification of binge eating, or failure to comply with medication. If a participant is removed from the 
study, a research clinician will provide referrals. If removal is indicated, a referral for appropriate care will be 
provided.

b. Describe how potential subjects are contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
Advertisements will ask participants to contact [CONTACT_136392]. When 
potential participants call and/or respond to an online form, they will be screened to determine whether they 
are likely to be eligible. If they seem potentially eligible and interested, they will be scheduled for an initial 
assessment.
c. Who is recruiting potential subjects? 
After initial contact, research clinicians (who have completed IRB training) will meet with potential 
participants to discuss the study, the treatments, the assessments, the follow-up period, and the informed 
consent procedures and forms. Clinicians will answer any questions and obtain written informed consent. A 
copy of the signed informed consent form will be given to the participants and the original will be kept in the 
participant's file. All potential subjects and/or participating participants are free to decide whether or not to 
participate and are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Alternative treatments would be discussed 
and/or referrals provided. A decision not to participate or to discontinue participation would not adversely 
affect future interactions with Yale or the Yale School of Medicine.

SECTION IV: PROTECTION OF RESEARCH SUBJECTS
    Confidentiality & Security of Data:
1. What protected health information (medical information along with the HIPAA identifiers) about subjects will 
be collected and used for the research?   
Height, weight, medical and psychosocial history will be collected and used for research.
2. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? 
All participants will be assigned a study ID. Subsequently, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_136394]. A list of 
numbers and the corresponding names will be maintained by [CONTACT_41009] a protected research server. Any 
identifying information that is collected on paper will be kept in locked research cabinets within a locked suite. 
Interviews will be recorded using a digital recorder and recordings will be securely and separately stored and 
be identified only by a study ID and date. Any information published as a result of the study will be such that it 
will not permit identification of any participant. All information collected will remain confidential except when 
we are legally required to disclose such information by [CONTACT_2371]. These circumstances include knowledge of abuse 
of a child or elderly person, threats of harm to self or others, and plans to harm to property.
3. How will the digital data be stored? ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive  ☐Portable Hard  Drive   ☒Secured Server  
☐Laptop Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of  the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
See above, the patients will only be identified by a study ID on any digital data files. Individually identifiable 
health information will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
of 1996.
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a 
device cannot be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and Compliance 
Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]

data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data and/or 
identifiers will be secured. 
Data will continue to be stored in locked cabinets in limited access areas until the legal requirement for storage 
has been met. Electronic data files will be password protected. Electronic data files will include code numbers 
only – i.e., will not contain patient identifying information.
6. If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained? YES
SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
Subjects will receive potentially beneficial treatment for BED. There is substantial importance in the knowledge to be 
gained in this study.  BED is the most prevalent formal eating disorder (a diagnosable mental disorder) associated 
strongly with obesity and is associated with substantial psychiatric and medical co-morbidity and with functional 
impairment. Finding ways to identify, understand, and improve treatments for BED is critically important to address 
this important health problem.  The dearth of treatment research, particularly with pharmacological methods and 
longer-term outcomes, is strikingly at odds with the public health significance and prevalence of BED. Given the 
modest risks associated with the treatments and study procedures and the substantial potential knowledge to be 
gained, the benefit to risk ratio is very favorable.   
         SECTION VI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
Alternatives include community referrals for cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral weight loss, or 
medications.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to subjects, 
the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
Subjects will be paid $100 for each of the primary outcome assessments (post-treatment Stage 1, post-
treatment Stage 2, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up) for up to a total of $400. Subjects who drop 
out of the trial will be invited to return for the follow-up evaluations. Our experience with numerous treatment 
studies has indicated that this incentive results in a high retention rate for follow-ups which is essential for the 
study. 
3.Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): Clearly describe the subject’s costs associated with 
participation in the research, and the interventions or procedures of the study that will be provided at no cost 
to subjects. 
Psychological assessment, labwork, and treatment will be provided at no cost to participants, their insurance, 
health plan benefits nor other third party payer. Participants will be asked to provide information from a 
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022
APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 6/13/2022Page 43 of 55recent (within one year) physical with their primary healthcare provider. If they have not had a physical within 
the past year, we will ask them to obtain a physical prior to participating in the study. A physical exam with 
their own primary healthcare provider would be at the participant’s (or the participant’s insurance) cost. 
(Note: In research we have conducted in the past with patients diagnosed with binge eating disorder, the 
majority of patients had a physical within the past year.)
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws).
a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? Write here
Yes. Referrals for treatment will be made.
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? 
If the participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this research study, the medical 
staff at the Yale-New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136331], 
short-term hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or short-term outpatient care.
c. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? 
If the participant is injured as a direct result of participation in this research study, the treatment 
will be determined by [CONTACT_136395](s).
d. Who will pay for this treatment? 
The participant or participant’s insurance carrier will be billed for the cost of this treatment. 
There are no plans to compensate the participant for physical or mental disability, lost wages, or 
any other losses or damages occurring over the long term or if an injury becomes apparent after 
participation in the study has ended. However, by [CONTACT_4912], 
the participant is not waiving or giving up any legal rights to seek compensation. Participants who 
believe they have been injured should contact [CONTACT_079], [CONTACT_136401] at 203-
785-2792 immediately.
e. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]?
 Referrals will be provided.

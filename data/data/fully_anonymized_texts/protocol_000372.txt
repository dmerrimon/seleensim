Methods  
Participants and Study Design  
Participants were AA and EA adults, determined by [CONTACT_6270] -reported race, with T2D and 
were recruited based on the following: Inclusion criteria were diagnosis within the past 10 years; 
treated with diet, metformin, SGLT2 -inhibitors, DPP -IV inhibitors, or GLP -1 RAs; adult men 
and women aged 35 -65 yr; HbA1c <8.0; and with a BMI of 25 -50 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were 
a change in body weight of >[ADDRESS_820137] 6 months; use of glucocorticoids; and tobacco or 
recreational drug use. Medication was discontinued 1 week prior to baseline testing for 
metformin and SGLT2 -inhibitors, and 4 weeks prior to testing for DPP -IV-inhibitors and GLP -1 
receptor agoni sts. Fasting glucose was monitored throughout the study, and any patient who 
demonstrated fasting glucose >200 mg/dL on 3 consecutive days was returned to medication. 
Routine physical activity was recorded by [CONTACT_617540], and all participant s were 
asked to maintain their usual level of physical activity throughout the study.  
 The study design was a 12 -week randomized clinical trial with two arms: carbohydrate 
restricted (CR) and higher carbohydrate (HC).  Both diets were developed by a Registered 
Dietitian who met with the study participants weekly. Participants were given det ailed 
instructions on daily meal plans. Groceries were delivered to each participant weekly by a local 
delivery service. Participants prepared their own meals and snacks, at an energy level calculated 
to be weight -maintaining, based on the instructions pro vided by [CONTACT_554822]. Participants 
reported their body weight to the dietitian weekly, and their diet prescription was altered if their 
weight changed by [CONTACT_726] 1 kg. The CR diet was composed of ~9% energy from 
carbohydrate, 26% energy from prot ein, and 65% energy from fat, whereas the HC diet was 
composed of ~55% energy from carbohydrate, 25% energy from protein, and 20% energy from 
fat. The UAB Institutional Review Board approved the study.  
 
Procedures  
At baseline and after [ADDRESS_820138] (OGTT) and a hyperglycemic clamp. The OGTT was 3 hours in 
length, with blood sampled at -30, -15, -5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 m in relative to 
the start of glucose ingestion for measurement of glucose, insulin, and C -peptide.  
The clamp protocol involved three stages: a [ADDRESS_820139] phase was conducted  by [CONTACT_17801] a bolus 
of glucose over 2 min at time zero followed by [CONTACT_617541] (as D20) 
to achieve a blood glucose concentration 50 mg/dL above that morning’s fasted glucose 
concentration (G + 50). Formulas were used base d on the RISE protocol (18) to determine both 
the bolus amount [weight (kg) x 50 mg/dL x 1.1 / 180] and to estimate the glucose infusion rate 
[weight (kg) x 5 x 60 / 180]; this rate was adjusted as necessary to achieve G + 50. Blood was 
sampled at -20 and -5 min prior to the start of glucose administration; then at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 
20, 25, and [ADDRESS_820140]-phase stage, blood glucose was brought to 200 mg/dL and maintained there for the next 2 
hours to determine insulin sensitivity. During this time, blood was sampled every 5 minutes. 
After the 150 -min blood sample was collected, a second  bolus of D20 was administered over 2 
min [weight (kg) x 100 mg/dL x 1.1 / 180]. Blood glucose was brought to 300 mg/dL and 
maintained there with a variable infusion of D20. Blood was sampled every 5 minutes to minute 
180. After the 180 -min blood collection, 5 g arginine (10% in saline) was infused over 5 min. 
Blood was sampled every 2 min from 182 to 190 min to capture maximal  C-peptide secretion.  
Serum samples were stored at -70oC until analyzed.  Glucose was measured on a SIRRUS 
chemistry analyzer (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX) using glucose oxidase reagent; the 
minimum detectable value was 2 mg/dl; inter -assay CV was 4.48%; and intra -assay CV was 
1.28%. Insulin was assayed usin g immunofluorescence technology (TOSOH AIA900, TOSOH 
Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA); assay sensitivity was 0.5 uU/ml; inter -assay CV was 
3.95% and intra -assay CV was 1.49%.  C-peptide was analyzed on the TOSOH; assay s ensitivity 
was 0.04 ng/ml; inter -assay CV was 6.81% and intra -assay CV was 1.67%.  
For this study, the lipid content of pancreas and liver w as be assessed by [CONTACT_617542] 
3-point Dixon appr oach . This method provides high -resolution contiguous images of the 
abdomen in breathhold durations and its intrinsic 3D imaging capability allows whole organs and 
spatial variations in ectopic fat across any region of the imaged anatomy to be evaluated. The 3 -
point M Dixon fat fraction (FF) is computed from the separated water and fat signals on a voxel -
by-voxel basis. The accuracy of the fat fraction metric from this multi -echo fat quantification 
method has been validated in several pancreatic/hepatic fat quantification  
studies using the following equation: Fat fraction3 -point M Dixon = Signal Intensity 
(SI)FAT/(SIWATER+SIFAT) x 100%.  
We will attempt to image both the head and tail of the pancreas, however all regions of 
the pancreas show similar associations with beta -cell function. Visceral fat volume also was 
assessed in a [ADDRESS_820141]. Trans -axial abdominal images was obtained using 3D 
volumetric T1 -weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE). 
The echo time, repetition time, and pulse flip angles will be selected to optimize the signal -
intensity contrast between adipose and non -adipose tissue. Image acquisition w as done at the 
Civitan International Neuroimaging Laboratory under the oversight of [CONTACT_617546] using a state -
of-the-art Prisma 3.[ADDRESS_820142] 
closely associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity and beta -cell function.  
Body composition: Body composition w as assessed using dual -energy X -ray 
absorptiometry (DXA) in the Metabolism Core Laboratory of UAB’s Nutrition Obesity Research 
Center (NORC) with a Lunar iDXA instrument (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) with the enCORE 
2011 v15 (sp2) software package. Total body  fat mass and lean body mass (LBM) in kg, as well 
as total body %fat, w as recorded.  
Resting energy expenditure (REE) and substrate utilization (respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952], RQ): 
REE and RQ w as determined in the NORC Core Laboratory by [CONTACT_46146] (TrueOne 
2400, Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT). Participants w ere tested in the fasted (10h) condition following 
a 30-min supi[INVESTIGATOR_198620].  
Calculations  
OGTT: Fasting values were determined from the average of the -30, -15, and -[ADDRESS_820143] -phase C -peptide index (CPI) was calculated as the difference in C -peptide 
from 0 to 30 minutes divided by [CONTACT_617543] 0 to 30 minutes ([C -
peptide 30min - C-peptide 0min] / [glucose 30min – glucose 0min]). The Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index 
(ISI) was used as a measure of whole -body insulin sensitivity due to its ability to capture both 
hepatic and skeletal muscle -derived insulin sensitivity. The Disposition Index (DI), an index of 
beta-cell function, was calculated as the product of C -peptide  secretion and insulin sensitivity, as 
reported: DI = CPI x ISI.   
Hyperglycemic clamp: The RISE protocol was used to calculate first -phase C -peptide 
response as the mean incremental response above baseline over minutes 2 -10, and the maximal 
C-peptide response as the mean incremental response during minutes 184 -190 above the mean at 
min 170 -180. Insulin sensitivity was calculated as described for the hyperglycemic clamp.  
 
Statistics:  
a. Analyses . The primary analysis for each aim will be a mixed model, using all available data 
and utilizing the estimated correlation between measurement times. The mixed model is less 
biased towards  statistically significant results in the context of missing data, and/or when a 
moderate to high correlation exists  between outcome measures. For Aim 1, the primary outcome 
will be pancreas lipid. Statistical models will  include time, diet, and the time -by-diet interaction. 
Other potential covariates (e.g., gender, race, total body fat,  adherence to diet) will be explored 
in preliminary analyses. Similar analyses will be conducted for hepatic lipid  and visceral adipose 
tissue. For Aim 2, the primary  outcome will be beta -cell function, as reflected in first  phase  C-
peptide secretion from the hyperglycemic clamp. Statistical models will include time, diet, and 
the time-by-diet interaction. Other potential covariates (e.g., gender, race, total body fat, 
adherence to diet, insulin  sensitivity) will be explored in preliminary analyses. Similar analyses 
will be conducted for PhiD from the  MMTT, and insulin sensitivity from the hyper glycemic 
clamp. Food records will be coded to assess adherence as  a dichotom ous variable, and adherence 
will be defined as +/ - [ADDRESS_820144] is the race -by-diet interaction term, which will  be added to the 
models from Aims 1 and 2. If either of these interaction terms is significant, the data will be  
analyzed separately within each race group. Influential data points and outliers will be examined 
in a sensitivity analyses.  
Correlative analyses will be conducted between changes (week 12 minus baseline) in 
measures of  glucose metabolism (e.g., glucose AUC from liquid meal test, HbA1c), markers of 
inflammation, visceral fat,  and hepatic/pancreatic lipid with Pearson’s correlations coefficients 
(adjusting for relevant confounding  variables). The correlation between change in pancreas lipid 
and change in first -phase C -peptide secretion will  be examined, adjusting for insulin sensitivity. 
For all analyses, variables known to deviat e from a normal  distribution will be log transformed. 
All statistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed using an alpha  level of 0.05. 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.4®. Baseline descriptive  
characteristics will summarized as means (SD) or proportions to include demographic, clinical, 
and other  measures.  
 
b. Power calculation. Based on our published data, a sample size of [ADDRESS_820145]  
80% power to detect a difference in means of -89.700 (the difference between a Group 1 mean, 
μ1, of 6.400  and a Group 2 mean, μ2, of 96.100) in first -phase response at week [ADDRESS_820146]  elected to target a final sample size of 
15 participants per diet -race group (total of 60 participants with complete  data). Using the Fisher 
r-to-z transformation, a value of z can be calculated that can be applied to assess the  
significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients, ra and rb, found in two 
independent samples.  Given [ADDRESS_820147] a difference 
of 0.3 with a one -sided alpha of  0.05. We will recruit 80 participants (20 per diet -race group) to 
account for missing data, potential drop -outs, or  for participants who have to withdraw from the 
study due to problems with glycemic control.   
 
c. Randomization  
The study statistician ([CONTACT_617547]) will prepare a closed envelope randomization for the two  
treatment arms stratified by [CONTACT_617544]. 9.4®. Patients will receive 
their group  assignment following baseline testing.  
 
Patient management following the study:  
Given that patients were removed from medication prior  to study initiation, and were 
carefully monitored for glycemic  control during the study, it is important to ensure that they  
make a smooth transition to a free -living situation. Following  final testing, all study participants 
will be given access to  continued diet/nutrition support, provided by [CONTACT_3476], to  assure a 
smooth transition to a free -living diet. Patients will be  able to choose their preferred diet (they 
may choose to stay on  their assig ned intervention diet, or to transition to a different  diet). 
Medical management, including of medication type and dosage, will be available during this 
transition.  All patients will demonstrate stable glycemic control on a given diet and medication 
regimen before exiting the  study.

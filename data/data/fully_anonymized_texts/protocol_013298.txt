­ To set a biocollection to explore further the potential impact of S95011 on PBMC, extracted RNA and blood accordin
g to the advancement of the knowled ge on the dru g and the disease (optional samplin g). 
Methodology:  
This is a phase IIa, international, multicentre, random ised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  
The study will consist of: 
­ Screening period without study treatment: within 28 days  prior to W000, after signing the informed 
consent, in order to check eligibility of patients. 
­ Randomised and double-blind treatment  period : from W000 to W013 (study drug administration at W000, 
W002, W004, W007, W010) with 2-parallel groups (750 mg of S95011 and matching placebo),  
with stratification by [CONTACT_410780] (yes/no) and baseline intake of antimalarial 
(e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine) (yes/no). 
­ Safety follow up period without study treatment : 15 weeks with one visit at W019 and one at W028. 
This follow-up period will allow sufficient time for monitoring safety until 5 half-lives of S95011. In addition, it is anticipated that more than 97% of patients have RO < 95% at W028 (meaning that almost no 
pharmacolo gical effect of the pr oduct is expected). 
Number of included patients: Planned: 45 patients (30 patients with S95011 ; 15 patients with 
placebo)  
Diagnosis and main crit eria for inclusion:

(ACR)-EULAR criteria, with  an ESSDAI total score ≥ [ADDRESS_518034] 6 points scored within 
the 7 following domains: constitutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, hematologic and 
biologic. They should have at screening positive anti-SSA (Ro) antibodies or anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) 
≥ 1:320 or rheumatoid factor (RF) >20 IU/ml, and stimulated whole salivary flow rate >0 mL/minute. 
Main exclusion criteria are: 
Prior administration of belimumab or rituximab or other B cell depleting ag ents or abatacept or tumor necrosis 
factor inhibitors or cyclophosphamide (or any other alkylating agent) or cyclosporine (except for eye drops), or 
tacrolimus, or sirolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or azathioprine, or leflunomide in the past 3, 6, 12, 
or 24 months (depending on the drug agent) prior to randomisation (W000),  
Corticosteroids > 10 mg/day oral prednisone (or equivalent) within 4 weeks prior to W000; any change or initiation of new dose of antimalarials ( e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine) within 16 weeks prior 
to (W000), methotrexate > 25 mg/week; and any initiation or  change of dose of methotrexate within [ADDRESS_518035] drug: S95011 – Dose: 750 mg 
Dosage form:  2 mL extractable volume vials containing 100 mg of S95011 (50 mg/mL) concentrate for solution 
for intravenous administration. 
The administration schedule is one IV infusion every 2 weeks (q2w) for the first month (W000, W002, W004) 
and then ever y 3 weeks (q3w) until W010 (W007, W010). 
Comparator: placebo  2 mL extractable volume matching vials containing concentrate for solution for intravenous administration. The administration schedule is one IV infusion every 2 weeks (q2w) for the first month (W000, W002, W004) 
and then ever
y 3 weeks (q3w) until W010 (W007, W010). 
Duration of treatment:  Run-in period:  No treatment up to 4 weeks of screening period 
Active treatment period:  13 weeks (last administration at W010) 
Follow-up period:  no treatment during 15 weeks

2. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Primary Sjög
ren’s syndrome:  
Primary Sjögre n’s Syndrome (pS S) is one of the commonest chronic systemic autoimmune 
diseases , with a female- to-male predominance of 9:1 and peak incidence i n women aged 
between 55 and 65 years. The estimated prevalence of pSS worldwide is 60.82 per 100 000 
inhabitants according to a meta- analysis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_410741]ögren's 
Syndrome  (Qin et al , 2015) .  
pSS is c h
aracterized by [CONTACT_410784]. These symptoms are present in 
more than 80% of the patients with this disease, wi th a major effect on quality of life and loss 
of work productivity, primarily because of disabling fatigue. At present, pSS is diagnosed using  
the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) –European League against Rheumatism 
(EULAR) classification criteria which require the presence of anti -SSA (Ro) antibodies in 
serum and/or focal lymphocytic sialadenitis in labial salivary gland biopsy (Shiboski  et al , 
2017) . 
Systemi c
 manifestations occur in approximately 30 to 40% of the patients wi th pSS. They can 
affect different organs or systems such as joint, lung, nervous system, kidney or non-exocrine glands such as the thyroid (Rosas  et al, 2019).  The risk
  of B -cell lymphoma is 15 to 20 times 
higher among pSS relative to the gene ral population (Mariette  et al, 2018) , with 2.7% to 9.8% 
patients eve
ntually developi[INVESTIGATOR_410742]  (Rosas  et al, 2019 ). Thus, the c linical phenotype of 
pSS varies 
significantly between patients  and over time. 
pSS is considered to be a multifactorial disease, in which envir onmental factors trigger 
inflamma tion in genetically prone individuals. The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of the 
disease are not yet fully el ucidated. A complex interplay of immune cell types such as T -cells, 
B-cells, dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages and NK cells and their eff ector molecules, is 
thought to cause the disease, leading eventually to B -cell hyperactivity, autoantibody 
production and formation of germinal  center -like structures in the salivary glands (Van der 
Heijden  et al , 2018).  
To 
date, no systemic treatment has been proven effective in altering the course of pSS and the 
medical need o f
 pSS remains unmet. The trea tment of pSS mostly relies on symptomatic agents 
(Nocturne  et al, 2015). Severe o rgan manifestations are treated in accordance with guidelines 
for system
ic lupus erythematosus and other connecti ve ti ssue disorders . Agents t hat are 
commonly used include steroids, hydroxychloroquine, immunosuppressants (including methotrexate, mycophenolate sodium, azathioprine and cyclosporine)  (Mariette et al, 2018)  but 
the evi 
dence-based 
medicine demonstrati ng the efficacy of these drugs is scarce  (Nocturne et 
al, 2015;  Saraux  et a
l, 2016; Del Papa et al, 2018) . One rece nt study sugge sted the clinic al 
efficacy fo r leflunomide and hydroxychloroquine combination therapy. However, this study 
has to be confirmed by [CONTACT_410785] (Radstake et al , 2018) .

© I.R.I.S. - 24 march 2022 -    25/[ADDRESS_518048] studies conducted with rituximab failed to reach the ir primary 
endpoints of efficacy , but some secondary outcome measures were improved  
(Nocturne et al, 2015).  Methodological progresses in conducting the studies and validation of 
new primary 
endpoints (ESSDAI, ESSPRI) could help to demonstrate treatment efficacy. In 
the light of a better understanding of pSS pathophysiology, new approac hes are cur rently 
investiga ted including T cell costimulation and inhibition of ectopic germinal centre formation 
(Bombardieri  et al , 2018).  
IL-7 and I
L-7R 
S95011 (also call
ed OSE -127) is a hum anized immunoglobulin (Ig)  G4 monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) conjointly developed by [CONTACT_410786]. S95011 targets CD127, 
the α chain of the Interleukin 7 (IL -7) receptor (IL -7R), and blocks access of IL -7 to the IL -7R.  
IL-7 is a limiting and non -redundant cytokine  that is mainly produced by e pi[INVESTIGATOR_410743]- hematological tissues (intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], lungs, skin) and in thymus. It regulates 
T cell homeostasis, proliferation and survival  (Mackall  et al, 2011;  Lundstrom et  al, 2013)  for 
both me
mory and 
naïve T cell subsets. Upon activation, IL -7R delivers proliferative and anti -
apoptotic signals. Almost all conventional mature T lymphocytes express high levels of IL -7R, 
with the notable exception of naturally- occurring regulatory T cell s (Tregs). This specific 
expres sion pattern provides an opportunity for a selective targeting of pathogenic effectors 
while preserving regulatory immune mechanisms ( Seddiki et al , 2006; Liu et al, 2006).  
IL-7 may be a
 driving factor  for the per sistence of autoimmune disease (Dooms, 2013) a nd 
targeting IL -7R
 . may be beneficial for inflammatory conditions  (Dooms, 2013;  Katzman, et al, 
2011) . In pSS
, the cytokine IL -7 is prominen tly expressed in the labial salivary glands 
(Bikker et al , 2010) . IL-7 seems  to contribute to local T cell dependent B cell  activatio n in 
pati
ents. In particular, based on in vitro  data, it is suggested that IL -7 associated with an 
increased number of IL -7Rα T cells could lead to an increased and continuing pro- inflammatory 
response (as IFNγ and IL-17A cytokines) in salivary glands of patients with pSS  (Bikker  et al , 
2010) , thus lea
ding to tissue destruction. In concordance with these findings, elevated numbers 
of IL -7-producing 
cells in patients with pSS  correlate with increased glandular inflammation, 
as indicated by [CONTACT_410787] (L FS) and a decreased percentage of IgA+ 
plasma cells in labial salivary glands  (Bikker et al, 2010) . In additi on, in the labial  salivary 
gland 
of patients, increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ IL -7Rα cells are found in comparison 
to non Sjögren- sicca patients and increased IL -7Rα expression on T cells in the labial salivary 
glands of pSS patients was associated with the severity of glandular inflammation 
(i.e. sialadenitis)  (Bikker et al, 2012) . Moreover, IL- 7Rα cells n umbers also strongly correlate 
with IL -7 expression, numbers of CD3 T cells, CD20 B cells, and CD1a and CD208 myeloid 
dendritic cells (Bikker et al,  2012) . At ser um level, soluble IL -7Rα co ncentrations are 
signiﬁcantly higher in pSS patients compared to healthy controls (Hillen et al,  2016).  
In addition, I
nnate
 Lymphoid Cells (ILCs), known to produce pro- inflammatory cytokines, are 
also CD127+  and hence represent a valid cell target to inactivate in order to decrease tissue 
response to inflammation (Wenink et al,  2017) . Collect ively, S95011 is expected to inhibit IL -7 
depe
ndent T- cell as well as ILC responses in pSS p atients.

data set, a thorough side by [CONTACT_410788] -127 and S95011 (or 
OSE -127) regarding in vitro potency (ELISA), affinity, productivity and trend to aggregation. 
This analysis revealed similar potency and affinity for both mAbs but S95011 demonstrated 
higher productivity and was less prone to aggregation as compared to Hz -127, validating the 
sequence optimization process and confirming S95011 as the final lead candidate for further 
preclinical and clinical development. Potency of S95011 on inhibition of the IL -7-induced 
STAT5 phosphorylation was further confirmed in human volunteers and was demonstrated to be similar in  Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells  (PBMCs ) of Sjögren patients. A strong 
correlation between IL -7 receptor occupancy (RO) and signaling inhibition (pSTAT5) was also 
observed in PBMCs of human volunteers and Sjögren patients. These data in connection with 
the fact that receptor occupancy profiles of S95011 in cynomolgus monkey were found similar 
with RO observed in human volunteers have supported the PK/PD modeling approach.

partner (OSE Immunotherapeutics) conducted in vivo  pharmacology studies in 
non-conventional humanized mice of  colitis models  since S95011 is also developed in 
ulcerative colitis  disease. For Sjögren pathology, rodent models were not considered as relevant 
to human physiopathology for assessing the activity of a humanized IgG4 mAb, thus  S95011 
was not tested in such models.

 In sum, the involvement of T lymphocytes in the pathophysiology of pSS, the elevated 
levels of IL -7 and IL -7R in the blood and tissues of pSS patients, together with the 
properties of the S95011 antibody provide a strong rationale for investigating it s potential 
therapeutic use in Sjögren patients . 
Toxicological data 
A toxicological program for S95011 was carried out in accordance with ICH guidelines. In vitro  
studies we
re performed, including a tissue cross reactivity analysis on human healthy tissues  
and a cytokine release assay on healthy human PBMCs and on whole blood culture, without 
issues of concern. The potential toxicity of S95011 in vivo  was evaluated in the cynomolgus 
monkey, selected as relevant species for S95011. A non GLP -compliant escalat ing dose study 
and a GLP -compliant [12 + 8] -week repeat -dose study (IV or SC treatment + recovery periods) 
were conducted  in cynomolgus monkey. The  latter study included safety pharmacology primary 
endpoints regarding central nervous system and cardiorespi [INVESTIGATOR_263576]. S95011 was given 
either by [CONTACT_2736] (15- minute infusion) once or twice a week for 12 weeks at 20, 50 and 
100 mg/kg/day or by [CONTACT_51211] (SC) route once a week for 6 weeks at 50 mg/kg/day. Reversibility was evaluated in selected  animals kept for an 8- week treatment -free period.  
During the dosing phase, significant changes in the RO and toxicokinetic (TK) profiles were observed as a res
ult of anti -drug antibody (ADA) occurrence. Therefore, only results from 
animals without ADA an d with significant sustained RO were considered as relevant in terms 
of pharmacokinetics, for the evaluation of S95011 of targets for toxicity.  Overall, in the GLP -compliant toxi
 city study, there were no drug- related mortalities, and there 
were no significant findings in any in- life parameters.  
At histomorphologic examination, a slight periva scular inflammatory cell infiltrate with 
evidences of gliosis in the brain and pi[INVESTIGATOR_410745]- dose male, with an unusual wide  extension. A  relationship to the test item cannot be 
completely ruled out. Thus, t he NOAEL was cautiously set at the mid -dose, 
50 mg/kg/administration, IV.  
Clinical data  
The phase I first -in-human (FIH) 
 OSE -127- C101 study, sponsored by [CONTACT_410792], was conducted in Belgium and included 63 healthy adult male and female 
volunteers. Among them, 45 participants were exposed to S95011 up to 10 mg/kg (single and 
multiple doses  (one administration every 2 weeks (q2w) for 4 weeks) ).  
Clinical safety  
No serious adverse events were reported. None of the subjects prematurely discontinued their 
participation in the study for safety issue. No remarkable differences or dose- dependent trend 
in AE incidence could be observed between the different S95011 doses a nd placebo or between 
IV and SC administration of S95011. Overall, 36 (57.1%) subjects of the study, all treatment groups combined, experienced at least 
one Treatment Em
ergent Adverse Events ( TEAE) and treatment -related TEAEs were reported 
in 19 (30.1%) subjects.  The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache ( in 20 [31.7%] 
subjects overall ), nasopharyngitis (in 6 [9.5%] subjects overall) and diarrhoea (in 5 [7.9%] 
subjects overall) . The most frequently reported treatment -related TEAE was headache 
(in 13 [20.6%] subjects, all treatment groups combined). There w ere no clinically significant 
abnormalities in vital signs, physical examination, laboratory data and ECG. No cytokine release (IFNγ, IL12p70, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, TNFα) has been observed following S95011 administration in healthy volunteers. Overall, the d rug is considered to be safe in healthy 
volunteers.

Immunogenicity  
No anti -S95011 antibodies ( Abs) were formed after single IV. infusion of S95011 0.002 mg/kg 
and 0.02 mg/kg. Abs were forme d as of Day 15 (0.2 mg/kg; [ADDRESS_518053]), Day 29 (1  mg/kg; 
2 subjects and 4 mg/kg; [ADDRESS_518054]), or FU1 -Day 71  (10 mg/kg; 2 subjects). The   last sampling 
timepoint the Abs were present was Day 43 (0.2 mg/kg; [ADDRESS_518055]), FU1 -Day 71  (1 mg/kg; 
4 subjects), FU2- Day 85 (4 mg/kg; 6 subjects), or FU4-Day 113 (10  mg/kg; 5 subjects). 
After s.c. administration (1 mg/kg), Abs were formed on Day 29 (2 subjects) and present until 
FU1-Day 71 (4 subje
cts). 
In Par t 2, Abs were formed on Day 57 (6 mg/kg; [ADDRESS_518056]) or FU2 -Day 85  (10 mg/kg;  [ADDRESS_518057]) 
and were present until FU5- Day 127  (6 mg/kg; 6 subjects) or FU6- Day 141 (10 mg/kg; 
5 subjects).  
To date, no saf ety concern arose either from the non -clinical safety stu dies or from the 
clinical study.   
Study design  
This is a proof-of-concept, phase IIa study.  
This st
udy is designed to evaluate preliminary therapeutic efficacy of multiple intravenous 
infusions of 750 mg of S
[ZIP_CODE], the safety, tolerability, pharmacokineti cs and 
pharmacodynamics in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome. 
This phase IIa study is a prospective, international, multicentre, randomised (2:1), double -blind, 
placebo -contr
olled study. It is expected to include 45 patients (30 receiving S95011, 
15 Placebo).

© I.R.I.S. - 24 march 2022 -    29/[ADDRESS_518058] exploratory study in pSS patients.  
Patients  will be randomized to S95011 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio in order to minimize exposure 
to placebo and to gather mor e data on S95011. Stratified  randomization is done in order to limit 
imbalances between active and placebo arms in baseline intake of oral corticosteroids  and 
baseline intake of antimalarials . The placebo to S95011 will be used as comparator to provide 
objective clinical efficacy as well as safety data generated from patients exposed to the 
experimental therapy. Since there is no established, clinically effective disease modifying 
treatment fo r patients with pSS, potential treatment with placebo (on top of  standard of care 
therapy, if necessary) is justified.  
Study Population 
Patients with  primary Sjögr e n’s Syndrome have to be diagnosed according to the 2016 
American College of Rheumatology (AC R)–European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) 
classification crite ria which require the presence of serum anti -SSA antibodies and/or focal 
lymphocytic sialadenitis on biopsy of labial salivary glands (Shiboski et al , 2017)  
(Appendix 2 ). 
T
o be eli gible, t he patient s should have an ESSDAI total score ≥ 6. For this study with a primary 
endpoint assessed at 13 weeks, the minimal baseline total score of 6 points on the ESSDAI is  
needed within the 7 following domains which are expected to change within 3 months of treatment: cons titutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, hematologic and 
biologic. This population represents patients with moderate to high activity disease level ( i.e. 
systemic manifestations). Furthermore, these patients should have an active immun ological 
profile with posit ive anti -Sjögren’s syndrome A (SSA) antibodies or anti -nuclear (ANA) 
antibodies or rheumatoid factor (RF).  (Bournia et al, 2012) . This is a
  population considered for 
treatment with biologic therapie s. 
In order to ensure popul ation homogeneity, patients with secondary Sjögren’s Syndrome are 
excluded from the study.  
Study primary outcome 
ESSDAI is a physician -administer e d clinical index which has been validated to objectively 
assess systemic manifestations in pSS patients (Nocturne et al , 2015; Seror  et al, 2015)  
(Appendix 3).
 ESSDAI content validity has been established through a rigorous consensus 
process and a
dditional consultation with an expert steering committee. Evidence presented in 
the literature suggested that ESSDAI is a reliable and valid measure that is able to dete ct change 
over time (Bombardieri, 2018) . ESSDAI has been found sensitive t o change in open label 
studies, (Mariette et al, 2015)  as well a s in some randomised controlled trials  (Moerman, 2014) . 
Recently, r
esu
lts were obtained on the ESSDAI total score as a primary efficacy endpoint in 
pSS patients with moderate to high activity in a randomis ed, double blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi- centric, phase IIa proof of concept (PoC) study with CFZ533 (i scalimab) monoclonal 
antibody against CD40 (Fisher et al, 2020) . Therefore , it is cur rently considered that the 
ESSDAI total score is an appropriate outcome criterion to evaluate systemic manifestations in pSS patients and can be used as a primary efficacy measure in populations similar to the one included in this study. The primary endpoint will be evaluated  after [ADDRESS_518059] an early onset of acti on, as demonstrated in animals 
(See Investigator’ s Brochure ). Indeed, 
 by [CONTACT_410793]-7R from the first month  of 
administration , it is expected to induce a prompt impact on glandular inflammation by 
[CONTACT_410794] T cell dependent B cell activation in patients . Furthermore,  in Sjögren’s 
Syndrome, in a recent phase IIa study with CFZ533 (i scalimab)  monoclonal antibody against 
CD40, beneficial effects based on an improvement of ESSDAI total score were observed at W12, showing the sensitivity to change of this tool in this time frame  (Fisher et al, 2020).

 Choice of doses 
The choice of the dose level was based on safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics and receptor 
occupancy (RO)
 data obtained from phase I study as well as toxicological and pharmacological 
studies.  
A minimal PBPK model was developed with da ta of the  healthy volunteers (HV)  enrolled in 
the FIH study. A covariate analysis wa s performed to test any potential effect of demographic 
characteristics on the dose -exposure- response relationship. From this a nalysis, only body 
weight was identif ied as a factor influencing the distribution volume of the product. 
The model built in healthy volunteers was then adapted to predict dose -exposure-respons e 
(i.e. receptor occupancy) in Primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS) pa tients  by [CONTACT_410795] f rom 
the literature describing expression of the soluble form of IL -7R in serum as well as salivary 
glands expression of IL-7R in Sjögren patients ( Bikker  et al , 2012; Hillen et al , 2016).  
O
ne of  the
 observations in the HV model is that the body weight was not identified as a factor 
influencing the c
learance of the product. Therefore, it was investigated whether the dose could 
be administered as a flat dose for this stu dy. The extrapolated pSS model was  used to perform 
simulations and test the effect of two different dosing strategies  in exposure and RO. The aim 
of these simulations was to choose the most appropriate dosing strategy allowing to maintain a 
RO over 95% (which corresponds to a full inhibition of the target) between two administrations 
of the drug in PBMC (considered as plasmatic) and in targeted tissues. 
One thousand patients were simulated for each dosing stra tegy: 
• 10 mg/kg of S95011 every 2 weeks (q2w) for the first month and then every 3 weeks ( q3w) 
unti
l W10, 
• 750 mg of S95011 ever y  2 weeks (q2w) for the first month and then every 3 weeks (q3w)  
until W10. 
The q2w -q3w regimen wa s chosen to increase the patients’ acceptability t o the IV infusions 
regimen  when compared to the more frequ ent administration regimen ( q2w) performed in the 
FIH trial.  
The results showed that the administration of a flat dose would lead to smaller inter -subject 
variab
ility with regards to PK exposure than when dose is normalized by t he body weight. 
Moreover, the flat dose of 750 mg would allow maintaining a higher proportion of patients  
(94,3%) with RO > 95% , resulting in a higher chance of efficacy in the pSS  patients than the 
weight-normalized dose of 10 mg/kg (91,4% of patients with RO > 95%). 
The median average concentra tion over a period of time ( Cav) simulated for the patients treated 
with 750 mg q2w -q3w are lower than the maximal observed Cav in healthy volunteers dosed 
at 10 mg/kg q2w during all the treatment. This means that more than half of the pSS pat ients 
receiving 750 mg q2w -q3w would achieve exposures lower than the maximal exposure 
observed in FIH. However, the difference increases up to +24.5 % when considering the 95th 
percentile of Cav simulated before the primary end point in pSS patients (meani ng that 95% of 
these patients would not achieve exposures higher than 29.4% of the maximal exposure 
observed in FIH).

 Nonetheless, the simulated exposure  (Cav)  in humans is lower than the one observed in 
monkeys. More accurately, the safety margin calculated from average concentration  observed 
at the NOAEL (50mg/kg) of the main toxicology GLP 12- week study in cynomolgus monkey 
and the simulated data in human at the flat dose of 750mg,  gives a value that is large enough 
(21.7) to be confident that this  choice of  dose will be safe for the patients who will be included 
in the Phase 2a.  
Benefit -Risk assessment  
Currently, lim
ited data exist regarding the use of agents that block the IL-7/IL-7R pathway . 
Benefit  
It is established  that T lymphocyt e s are involved in the pathophysiology of pSS. IL-[ADDRESS_518060]  mAbs ([COMPANY_004] 26118960 [GlaxoSmithKline] and 
PF 06342674 [[COMPANY_007]]), were developped against the same target as S95011 ( i.e., IL-7Rα). 
They  have been tested in several Phase [ADDRESS_518061] 98 healthy voluntee rs with administered single or multiple weekly doses from 
0.25 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg IV or SC. Two of these studies ( Ellis et al, 2018; Herold  et al, 2019 ) 
ha
ve been publi
she
d and partial results from the other studies can be found on 
https://clinicaltrials.gov. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  No significant adverse event nor adverse drug reaction has been descr ibed 
within the available inf ormation. 
Up to now , no safety  issue in the 
 phase [ADDRESS_518062] ion, the following reactions 
will be closely monitored : 
• Acute hypersensitivity  
Huma ns adminis
tered with foreign prot eins are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_410746], 
including anaphylaxis. Patients can present with the following symptoms: itching, flushing, 
headache, nausea/vomiting, hypotension, urticaria, bronchospasm, or angioedema. 
• Infections  
Subjects tr
eated wi th S95011 may be at an increased risk of infection. Administration of S95011 
could be expected to result in immuno modulation with a decreased capacity to mount a response 
to novel immunogens, including those of bacterial, vir al, fungal and parasitic origin when full 
receptor occupancy has been achieved .

No cytokine release has been observed in FIH study (IFNγ, IL12p70, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, TNFα). 
However, given the
 risk of cytokine release syndrome observed in certain therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies, this event cannot be ruled out in patients treated with S95011. 
•Vaccination
Vaccination o
f patients  during treatment with S95011 and pri or to clearance of S95011 is likely 
to result in non- protective vaccinal antibody titers due to the pharmacologic activity of the 
antibody.  
•Immunogenicity
Extrapolation of
 immunogenicity risks from healthy subjects to pSS patients is unknown. 
•Lymphopenia
No clinically sig
nificant lymphopenia has been observed neither in the phase 1 study nor in 
preclinical studies. However, due to S95011 mechanism of action, a possible lymphopenia 
cannot be ruled out. 
The possible risks and their mitigations are presented in the table below . 
Risks  Mitigations  
Acute hypersensitivity -Patients with history of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to

© I.R.I.S. - 24 march 2022 -   34/119 - Lymphopenia < 500x106/L (grad e 3 or higher accordi ng to
CTCAE/v5.0 grading) must be imm ediately notifie d to the sponsor 
as adve rse event  of special i nterest.
It is of note that after the treatment period, patients will enter a 15 -week follow -up period 
(until W028) to allow sufficient time for monitoring safety  until 5 half -lives of S95011. 
In addition, it is anticipated that more than 97% of patients have RO < 95% at W028 
(meaning  that almost no pharmacological effect of the product is expected). 
In summary, S95011 has never been used in patients with  pSS, so at this stage, no statement 
can be made of its efficacy in treating this disease. No safety issue was reported in the phase [ADDRESS_518067]  due to the nature a nd mechan ism of 
action of S95011and adapted measures will be taken to prevent these risks. 
In addition, patients safety will be closely monitored including an independent external DSMB 
that will mee
t regularly (and urgently if needed) in order to assess safety and tolerability data.  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP , the ethica l principles that 
have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and the applicable regulatory requirements.  
Patients with pSS  have been consu lted al ong  the process of protocol, patient information sheet 
and informed consent writing and their comments have been reviewed and integrated.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a 
phase IIa, international, multicentre, ran domised (2:1), double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study.  
The study will consist of: 
­ Screening period without study treatment: within 28 days pr ior to W000 , after signing 
the informed consent, in order to check eligibility of patients. 
­ Randomis ed and double -blind treatment  period: from W 000 to W 013 (study drug 
administration at W000, W002, W004, W007, W010) with 2 -parallel groups (750 mg of 
S95011 and matching placebo) , with stratification by [CONTACT_410799] 
(yes/no) and baseline intak e of antimalarial ( e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, 
quinacrine) (yes/no) . 
­ Safety follow up period without study treatment : 15 weeks  with one vi sit at W019 and 
one at W028. This follow-up period will  allow sufficient time for monitoring safety until 
5 half -lives  of S95011. In addition, it is anticipated that more than 97% of patients have RO 
< 95% at W028 (meaning that almost no pharmacological effect of the product is expected). 
The expected duration of patient participation will be 32 weeks maximum.

 For each patient, there will be a screening period between W - 4 and W000. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria at screening will be admitted to inclusion visit 
(W000).  
 The time windows that are given for the visits (±2d etc..) are given compared to W000  
 Lip biopsy sh
ould not be perform ed before the sialometry  
 Physical examination, vital signs and 12- lead ECG w ill be performed pre -dose 
* The results of the examinations should be available at W000, to assess the inclusion criteria. 
**Two follow -up visits will b e scheduled for safety and PK/PD assessments: the first visit will be performed at W0 19, and the second visit a t W028. Between visits, the patient 
will be able to contact  [CONTACT_410801].  In case of premature IMP discontinuation, the FU visits will be performed [ADDRESS_518068] IMP administration, 
for safety assessments.  
*** Schirmer, OSS and Sialometry can be performed within 2 days before the  scheduled vis it’s date at W000 and W004. At W013 these tests can be performed in the time 
window allowed by [CONTACT_760] (+/ - 2 days).  
# One blood sample will be performed between W011 and W012 for PK assessment. The blood sample will be performed at site  or not according to local facili ties 
## One blood sample will be performed at W16 ± 5 days  for PK assessment. The blood sample will be performed at site or not according to local facilities  
1 At W000 and W002, patients will be monitored closely for 2 hours after completion of IV. infusion (or longer, at the discretion of the Investigator) for vital signs, physical 
examina
tion, and signs or symptoms of adverse events including development of a n injection reaction. At all other visits with IMP administration , post dose assessments will 
similarly include assessing infusion site, physical examination and vital signs before dismissing the patient from the clinical site  
2 At each ESSDAI assessment, cryoglobulins measurement will be performed locally and the result will be used for ESSDAI scoring. Cryoglobulin result obtained from a 
previous sampling performed within 1 month before screening  visit could be used for ESSDAI scoring at screening . In case of presence of cryoglobulinaemia, cryoglobulin will 
be identifie d (type I, II or III).  In addition, for assessments not listed in the protocol as mandatory tests but which may be needed to estim ate ESSDAI, including Chest X -ray, 
pulmonary high resolution computer tomography (HRCT), lung function test (Diffusing -capacit y of the lung for carbon monoxyde (DLCO), forced vital capacity (FVC)), 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), electromyogra phy (EMG), muscle (or any other) biopsy, it is at the investigator’s discretion to have these assessed based on the 
signs and symptoms of the patient so to provide correct ESSDAI readout  (see section 7.2 ). 
[ADDRESS_518069] be repeated 
(central or lo cal) within a maximum of two week s before W000. These tests repeated should be obtained within the allowed screening period, and must be considered for the 
patient inclusion.   
4 Blood samples for biochemistry/haematology will be performe d after 10 hours  fasting.  
5.Only in women of childbearing potential  
 
For all blood samples planned at visit with IMP administration, only one pre -dose sample has to be performed (before Investigational medicinal product (IMP)  administration . 
Except for :  
6. PK samples:  One pre-dose s ample (before IMP) + [ADDRESS_518070] dose samples (one right after the end  of the infusion and one in the [1-3h] interval after the end of the IMP infusion  
at W000 and W010  
7. Receptor occupancy (RO)  samples:  One pre-dose sample (before IMP) and one sample right after the end  of the infusion of the IMP (just after PK sample)  at W000 and 
W010 
8. Cyt okine release panel:  One pre -dose sa mple (before IMP) and one post -dose sample right  after the end of IMP infusion  at W000 and W002  
9. Lip biopsy can be performed the day before and up to 2 days after the scheduled visit’s da te. In any case sialometry  has to be performed before biopsy. T he consent for 
participating in the lip biopsy can be proposed an other time to the patients during the course of the study until W013

Patients will be randomised to S95011 or placebo in an overall 2:1 ratio in order to minimise 
exposure to placebo and to gather more data on S95011. The randomisation wi ll be  
non-adaptive,  stratified by [CONTACT_410799] (yes/no) and baseline intake 
of antimalaria ls (e.g.: chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, quinacrine) (yes/no).  
Treatment randomis ations and al locations will be centralized by [CONTACT_410802] (IWRS). The structure responsible for designing and constructing the randomis ation  
lists in blind will be the biostatistics department of I.R.I.S .  
The questionnaires and patient’s NRS  will b e administered to the patient with an elec tronic 
patient outcome  (e-COA ) in the local language. The same electronic device will be provided to 
each study patient. Data will be entered by [CONTACT_102]. The aim of this technology is to enhance 
quality of patient reported outcomes by [CONTACT_410803]. 
Stability of the corticosteroi ds and disease background treatment(s) will be required during a 
pre- specified period before screening  and during the study. 
ESSDAI score will be completed by a trained investigator . The  training will be performed

of unused IMP will be defined by [CONTACT_410809]. 
An IMP collection and destruction form will be completed before the shipment of IMP to 
destr uction. Des
truction of IMP may be possible (after drug accountability and sponsor 
authorization) w hen the product has been used, has expi[INVESTIGATOR_410751] . 
The IMP should be stored in a secure area with restri cted access.  
Spec i
fic storage conditions  are mentioned on IMP labelling. The investigator/pharmac ist is 
responsible for the IMP temperature monitoring on a daily basis using FONT -CIRT -FORM -
311 “Therapeutic Unit temperature log sheet - centre” (recording Mi n-Max temperature every 
working day) or an equivalent document.  
In case of temperature deviation , the investiga tor/pharmacist should immediately: 
­ block the IWRS for the concerned IMPs and place them in quarantine,  
­ alert the monitor or the local project manager if the monitor is absent, forward him all needed 
information a
nd implement the instruction s received.  
Furthermore, the investigator/pharmacist must put in place an adequate corrective/preventive action once th
e first temperature deviation occurs in order to avoid recurrence.  
IMP management will be verified on a regular basis by [CONTACT_11200]. 
The investigator and/or the pharmacist of the medical institution and/or a designated person 
from their stu
dy team must complete in real time all the docume nts provided by [CONTACT_410810] (therapeutic unit tracking form or an equiva lent document). 
Therapeutic unit tracking form, or an equivalent document, is the source document to fulfil. 
The investigator and/or the pharmacist of the medical institution should only use the IMP 
provided for the pa tient
s involved in the study. 
All def ects or deterioration of IMPs or their packaging are to be reported to the study monitor, 
and to the IWRS . 
The investigator will notify the monitor of all complaints set out by a 
patien t/pharmacist  (change of appearance…).  
In the event of anticipated retur n of IMPs to t he sponsor (batch recall), the sponsor will prepare 
an information letter intended for the investigator and/or pharmacist of the medical institution. This letter will be sent by [CONTACT_410811].  
4.3.3. Management of blinding systems 
The blind for 
any study patient  should only be  broken by [CONTACT_410812].  The reason for unblinding 
must be recorded in the IWR S.

 The circumstances under which the blind may be broken are: 
­ when knowledge of the treatment allocation will influence patient management. 
For example, af
ter overdose of the study treatment, or 
­ when the outcome of a life -threatening medical emergency dep ends on knowing which 
treatment the patient has received.  
In the cases where the study treatment blind needs to be broken by [CONTACT_410813], a centralised decoding system integrated to IWRS is 
adopted for the study. No sealed envelopes will be used. 
The centralised decoding procedure will be performed by [CONTACT_410814]. The system will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
The procedure to be followed is det ailed in the IWRS manual.  
If IWRS is not available, the helpdesk of the IWRS will be contact[CONTACT_3012]. Additionally, decoding will be poss
ible by [CONTACT_410815] I.R.I.S. ([PHONE_8487] 60 
00) 7/7d and 24/24h) which will either trans mit the request to the Immuno- inflammatory 
disease centre for therapeutic innovation or will reach the external out -of-office hours contact 
[CONTACT_410816] a decoding list (available only to authorized and identified persons during the study). 
The DSMB may also ask f

concerned.  
4.4. Discontinuation of the study  
4.4.1. Premature dis
continuation  of the study or  temporary halt 
After having informed the  national coordi nators/investigators , this study may be temporarily 
halted or prematurely discontinued at any time for any sufficient reasonable cause (including 
unsatisfactory patient enrolment, new  scientific knowledge or other conditions which would 
place the patient at undue risk if continuing in the study) by [CONTACT_456]  (or by [CONTACT_410817] a recommendation from Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)) or by [CONTACT_98405] (IRB )/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or the Competent Authorities.  
Specific safety criteria for which the study  can be discont inued or temporary halted by [CONTACT_410818]/events for which urgent DSMB m eetings will be triggered, will be defined in the DSMB charter. 
In case of prematur e study disconti
 nuation or t empora ry halt, two copi[INVESTIGATOR_410752] /investigators . The IRB/IECs and 
Competent Authorities will be informed according to local regulations.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, the on-going patient s should b e seen as soon as 
possible and the same assessments as described in Section 5.6.2 should be performed.  
Under some circumstances, the investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followed in order
 to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient ’s 
interests.

 In case of study suspension (temporary halt), the study may resume once concerns about safety, 
protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and satisfy the Sponsor  and the DSMB 
following approval from the IRB/  IEC and Com petent Authorities , according to local 
regulations. 
The patient withdrawal criteria are described in Section 5.6.

remature discontinuation of the s tudy in an investi gator site (early site closure)  
The sponsor reserves the right to close a study site at any time for any sufficient reasonable 
cause at the sol
e discretion of the sponsor.  
 The investigator may also initiate study -site closure 
 at any tim e, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_277488]:  
­ Failu
re of the investigator to co mply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or 
local Competent Authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
­ Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093] 
­ Discontinuation of further study intervention development 
The IRB /IEC( s)

 Contraception methods : 
Definition of highly effective contraception methods for the study:  
Highly effective methods of birth control refer to thos e which resu lt in a low failure rate 
(i.e. less than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, such as combined hormonal 
contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal), 
progestogen- only hormonal contracept ion when associated with inhibition of ovulation 
(oral,  injectable, implantable), some intra u terine devices (IUDs), intrauterine 
hormone- releasing system (IUS), true sexual abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the patient), bilateral tubal occlusion, male sterilization (vasectomy).  
5.4. Retest management during screening period  
A patient who ha s
 a laboratory result(s) that does not satisfy the entrance criteria may have the 
test (s) r
epeated once providing that the investi gator judges it relevant according to the patient 
previous results, or medical history and if s/he considers laboratory abnormalities are likely to be transient. Results of the test(s) repeated should be obtained within the allowed screening period. In thi s case the patient will not be required to sign another informed consent, and the 
original patient  ID number assigned by [CONTACT_64151]. 
In any case, the last result available for each parameter must be considered for the patient inclusion.  
In th e 
particular case where the ASSE visit is performed more than [ADDRESS_518077] be repeated (central or local) within a 
maximum of two week s before W000. These tests repeated should be obtained withi n the 
allowed screening period, and must be considered for the patient inclusion.  Furthermore, laboratory tests can be repeated during the study (retest) in case of samples lost, 
broken, or if the the i
nvestigator judges it relevant according to the patient previous results. 
5.5. Additional information recorded at the selec tion/inclusion visit  
The following information will be recorded in the e -CRF: race and eth nicity , life habits 
(smoking habits, alcoh ol and caffeinated drinks consumption), date of diagnosis of pSS. 
5.6. Patient  withdrawal  
5.6.1.
 Withdrawal criteria  
Study drug dose a
djustments and/or interruptions are not allowed in this study. However, 
in case of del
ay in dosing administration for any reason ( e.g. AE,…), continuation of IMP 
should be discussed and agreed with the sponsor. 
Patients may voluntarily discontinue the study for any reason at any time. The Investigator should discontinue IMP for a given pat
 ient if, on balance, he/she believes that 
continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.

 The reasons for premature discontinuation of IMP are: 
­ Adverse events according to the judgement of the investigator or according to the following 
predefined cr
iteria:  
• Any adverse event ≥ Grade 3 (acco rding to CTCA E/v5.0 grading) c onsidered as related 
to the IMP administration,  
• Study treatment related cytokine release syndrome of grade 2 or higher ( CTCAE v5.0  
grading
), 
• Major wor
sening of primary Sjögren’s syndrome as judged by [CONTACT_737].  
­ Pregnancy of the patient , 
­ Major devia
tion to protocol  if it jeopardis es patient ’s safety, e.g. any medical event 
requiring administration of an unauthorised concomitant treatment (see Section  6.3). 
­ Non-medical reason (to be carefully desc ribed) e.g. cons ent withdrawal, patient’s removal.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment should not be considered withdrawn from the study 
unless they withdraw their consent. They will perform a  withdrawal  visit (with all investigations 
described at W013 visit) and two FU visits , [ADDRESS_518078] IMP administration  
(see investigations in the investigational schedule table).  
Information to be collected during the last visit of these patient s is gi ven in Section  5.6.2. 
These follow-up modali ties are used to ensure the efficacy and safety evaluation of all patient s 
who received the IMP. 
5.6.2. Procedure  
The investig
ator must record in the medical file and in the e -CRF, the re ason and the date for 
the premat ure discontinuation of treatment / for the withdrawal from the study, the main 
assessment criteria, and the medical follow -up data.  
If there are several reasons, the investigator must indicate the main reason.  
A withdrawal  visit ( with inv estigations plan ned at W013) and FU visits  respectively [ADDRESS_518079] IMP administration  should always be suggested to the patien t.  
In the case of premature withdrawal from the study due to an adverse event (event re quiring 
immediate no
tification or not), the  investigator must make every effort to col lect the 
information relating to the outcome of the event. If necessary, the information wil l be collected 
afterwards (see Section 8.9). This information is recorded in that part o f the electronic case 
report fo rm which concerns adverse events. If the investigator cannot collect the information 
from a visit, he must collect it from the doctor ensuring the follow-up of the patient . 
If the study is stopped / IMP is discontinued as a result of an event requiring imm ediate 
notificat
ion, the procedure described in S ection [IP_ADDRESS] is  to be implemented.  
The dispositions
 to be taken after the IMP discontinuation are described in Section  6.5.  
If a 
patient withdraws from further participation in the study  (consent withdr awal), then no 
further study visits or data collection should take place.

When the investigator has no news of the patien t, he/she must make every effort to contact 
[CONTACT_12552]/her or a person around him/her (phone calls, letters including registered ones…etc.), 
to establish the reason for the discontinuation of  IMP and to suggest the patient comes to an 
end-of-study visit. If all these attempts to co ntact the patient fail, the investigator can then 
declare the patient “lost to follow-up”. The inve stigator should document all these attempts in 
the corresponding medical file. 
6. TREATMENT OF PATIENTS 
6.1. IMPs administered 
S95011/matching placebo will be provided to th e site in 2 mL extractable volume vials 
containing 100 mg of S95011/matching placebo (50 mg/mL) concentrate for solution. IMP will 
be stored in the original pack aging in a limited access area at  the temperature specified on the 
drug label and protected from light.  
Instructions for handling the IMP to prepare a nd administer the infusion solutions are provided 
in the pharmacy manual, addresse d to the investigator’s site. 
Preparation of the IMP solution will be performed by [CONTACT_410820] 0,9%, in the site  pharmacy or site dedicated area under aseptic 
conditions under a laminar air fl ow cabinet or equivalent equi pment by a qualified staff, 
according to instructions provide d in the Pharmacy Manual.  
After preparation, the infusion bag of S95011/placebo diluted in NaCl will be stored in controlled temperature room (≤ 25°C), up to 4 hours in infusion bag (including infusion).  
IMP in the infusion bag will be administered by [CONTACT_410821] 60 min. If infusion related 
adverse reactions occur, the infusion flow rate  will be decreased. If related adverse reactions 
continue, S95011/placebo will be stopped. In case of any signs of an acute reaction, 
clinical treatment will be provided as determ ined by [CONTACT_30036] a case-by-case basis 
and depending on the severity, using sympto matic treatment, anti-histamines, NSAIDs, 
acetaminophen, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, or adrenalin.  In addition, at the [ADDRESS_518081] visits with IMP administrations (W000 and W002), patients will be 
monitored closely for 2 hours after completion of infusion (or longer, at the discretion of the 
Investigator) for vital signs, physical examinatio n and signs or symptoms of adverse events 
including development of an in jection reaction. At all other visits with  IMP administration 
(W004, W007 and W010), post-dose assessments will similarly include assessing infusion site, 
physical examination and vital signs before dismissing the pa tient from the clinical site. 
All the details for preparation and administrati on will be provided in the pharmacy manual.  
6.2. IMPs dispensing 
The treatment group will be allocated via IWRS using a central ra ndomisation (2:1) to S95011 
or placebo with stratification by [CONTACT_410822] (yes/no) and baseline 
intake of antimalarial ( e.g. chloroquine, hydroxychloroqu ine, quinacrine) (yes/no). 
At inclusion visit (W000), patient will be  randomised to S95011 or placebo by [CONTACT_10966]. 
A connection to the IWRS should be performed at each concerned vis it (from W000 to W010) 
to know the allocated kit numbers to be used for the infusion bag preparation (see details in 
IWRS manual).

For each patient , the IMP w ill only be di spensed during the study. At W010 visit, the last 
administration of the IMP will be performed.  
At last study visit, the in vestigator will propose a treatment adapted to the nature of the clinical 
state of the patient. 
6.3. Previous and concomitant treatments  
For treatme
nts prohibited and authorised before the study, refer to S ection  5. 
Previous
 treatments  are all treatme nts received and stopped within 12 months before 
screening visit ( inclu ding vaccinations *). 
Concomitant treatments  are treatmen ts ongoing at screening visit as well as new treatments 
initiated during the study. 
*for this study, all vaccinations deemed necessary by [CONTACT_410823]. Therefore, the corresponding last vaccinations and last boosters 
will be considered and reported as previous treatment (even if administered more than 
12 months prior to the screening visit).  
Previous and concomitant  treatment (pre scriptions or o ver-the- counter medications) must be 
report ed in the e -CRF. Reported information will include a description of the type of the drug, 
treatment period, dosing regimen, route of administration and its indication.  
Any change in dosage must also be reported i n the Conco mitant Treatments e -CRF section.  
Data on concomitant medication will be collected up to the last follow -up visit, even after 
withdrawal of a patient.  
Those patients who are receiving permitted medications for pSS [oral corticosteroids at a dose 
of max 10 mg per day (prednisone or equival ent), anti -malarials, methotrexate at a stable dose 
(up to 25 mg per week), NSAIDs, artificial tears and artificial saliva/salivary stimulants 
(e.g. cevimeline, pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]) , cyclosporine eye drops and lifitegrast ], and/or regular use of 
medications know n to cause dry mouth/eyes as major side effects , must be maintained on a 
stable regimen  (and for methotrexate, route of administration) throughout the treatment pe riod 
compared to baseline.  These treatments are cons idered “usual” background therapy in the 
absence of recognized standard of care. The IMP  is evaluated as add -on to background 
treatment and not as a monotherapy. 
The safety profile of such combinations is  considered acceptable taking into account the 
mechanism of action of S95011 and the knowledg e acquired with other biologics. 
The salivary stimulants ( e.g. cevimeline, pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]) , cyclosporine eye drops  and lifitegrast  
should not be used during the 12 hours prior to , and during the assessment of clinical disease 
outcome measurements (Schirmer test  and sialometry). Artificial tears and artificial saliva 
should not be used during the 4 hours prior to , or during the assessment of clinical disease 
outcome measurements (Schirmer test and sialometry).

 Prohibited  Concomitant Medications 
Patients are not p ermitted to receive any of the following immunosuppressants or biologic al 
therapy (monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins ) while  receiving IMP . These treatments act as 
S95011 on the immune system  and the safety profile of such combinations are not yet know n. 
Duration of wash out periods depends on half lifes of products and immune system recovery.  
­ Corticoids greater than 10mg/day prednisone or equivalent  
­ Methotrexate > 25 mg/week  
­ Belimumab  
­ Rituximab  
­ Abatacept  
­ Tum or necrosis f actor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, 
infliximab  and biosimilars ) 
­ Tocilizumab  
­ Cyclophosphamide (or any other alkylating agent),  
­ cyclosporine (except for eye drops), tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, 
azathioprine, or le f
lunomide 
­ JAK inhibitors 
Furthermore, a ny live or attenuated vaccine are forbidden. A dministration of recombinant or 
killed virus or messenger RNA or replication -incompetent vector vaccines , including SARS -
CoV-2 vaccines , are acceptable. V accination of patient s during treatment wit h S95011 and prior 
to clearance of S95011 is likely to result in non-protective antibody titers  due to the 
pharmacologic activity of S95011. Consequently, a ll vaccinations deemed necessary by [CONTACT_410824]. 
 If the patient needs to receive one of these prohibited medications, she/he will have to discontinue the 
investigational product and will perform a withdrawal visit (with all 
investigations described at W 013 visit) and two FU visits , [ADDRESS_518083]

Specific rules may be followed in some countries according to local regulation. 
7. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
7.1. Efficacy m
easurements  
Efficacy meas
urements performed du ring the study are i ndicated in Table (4.1.2) 1. 
7.2. Methods and measurement times  
- ESSDAI (EULAR Sjögren Syndrome Disease Activity Index): ESSDAI  is a physi cian-
administered clinical index used to evaluate systemic disease activity . The instrument 
contains 12 organ- specific domains contributing to disease activity ( i.e., organ systems: 
cutaneous, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], renal, articular, muscular, peripheral nervous system (PNS), central 
nervous system (CNS), haematological, gland ular, constitutional, lymphadenopathic, 
biological). For each domain, features of disease activity are scored in 3 or 4 levels according to their severity. These scores are then summed across the 12 domains in a weighted manner to provide the total score. The maximum theoretical score is 123 ( Appendix 3). 
During screening, ESSDAI total score should be ≥ 6, with at le
 ast 6 points within the 
7 following domains: constitutional, lymphadenopathy, glandular, articular, cutaneous, hematologic and biologic. 
Then, ESSDAI will be applied to the study patients at ASSE, W000, W004 and W013. 
The
 approximative total duration of the measurement is [ADDRESS_518086] be administered by a trained clinician. The training will be performed 
before the inclus
ion of any patient in the site.  
Over the course of the study, the ESSDAI should be completed by [CONTACT_410826] a given patient  (insofar as possible). If there is a change in site 
personnel over the course of the study, new investigators must be trained and certified prior to performing the ESSDAI.

 At each ESSDAI assessment, cryoglobulins meas urement will be performed locally  and the 
result will be used for ESSDAI scoring . In case of presence of cryoglobulinaemia, 
cryoglobulin will be identified  (Type I, II or III) and reported in e -CRF . Cryoglobulin result 
obtained from a previous sampling performed within 1 month before screening visit could 
be used for ESSDAI scoring at screening . 
In addition, immune panel (C3 and C4 complement fractions , CH50 (or CH100), 
quantitative immunoglobulins , and immunofixation electrophoresis) will be assessed at ea ch 
visit with ESSDAI assessme nt for exploratory endpoint, by a central laboratory. The results 
will be provided to the investigator and used for ESSDAI scoring  (see Section 9.5.1). 
For assessments not listed in the protocol as mandatory tests but which may be needed to 
estimate ESSDA
I, including Chest X -ray, pulmonary high resolution computer tomography 
(HRCT), lung function test ( Diffusing -capacity of the lung for carbon monoxyde  (DLCO ), 
forced vital capacity  (FVC)), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), electromyography 
(EMG), muscle (or any other) biopsy, it is at the investigator’s discretion to have these assessed based on the signs and symptoms of the patient so to provide correct ESSDAI 
readout. 
ESSDA I questionnaire will be filled in by [CONTACT_410827] (e -PRO  
e-COA). All 
the documentations used for the ESSDAI scoring and justification of scoring 
will be stored in the patient’s medical file and considered as source documents. 
- ESSPRI (EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Patient -Reported Ind ex ): ESSPRI is a 
patient -administered ques tionnaire to assess patient symptoms within the last 2 weeks and 
combines 0–10 numerical rating scale s for dryness, fatigue and pain (joint and muscular pain 
in legs and arms). The maximum theoretical score is 10 (mean score of the 3  subscores) 
(Appendix 4).  
ESSPRI will be applied to the study pa tients at W000, W004 and  W013. 
The approximative total duration to complete the questionnaire is 5 minutes. 
- MFI (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory): the MFI is a self -report mea sure designed to 
evaluate five dimensions of fatigue: general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced motivation, 
reduced activity, and mental fatigue. The MFI is a 20- item scale ranging from 1 to 5 to 
indicate how aptly certain statements regarding fatigue represent the individual experiences. Higher total scores correspond with more acute level of fatigue ( Appendix 5A ).  
MFI will be applied to the s
 tudy patients at W000, and W013. 
The approximative total duration to complete the questionnaire is 5-10 minutes. 
- SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey): SF -36 is a se lf-report questionnaire for the quality of 
life. It is a survey with 3 6 questions evaluating individual patients’ health status which also 
monitors and compares patients’ disease burden. It consists of eight scaled scores 
(vitality,  physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role 
functioning, emot ional role functioning, social role functioning, mental health), which are 
the weighted sums of the questions in their section ( Appendix 5B ). 
SF36 will be performed at W000 and W013. 
The approximative total duration to compl ete the questionnai re is 20 minutes.

 - Physician (PhGA) and Patient Global assessment (PGA)  of the pSS activity  assessed on 
numerical rating scales ( NRS ) (Appendix 6) :  
• The PhGA NRS  represents  the investigator’s overall assessment of  pSS disease activity 
on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 indicating ‘inactive disease’ and 10 indicating ‘very highly 
active disease’.  
Every attempt should be made to have the same investigator complete the PhGA NRS  
for each patie
nt throughout their study participation. 
• The PGA NRS  represents the patient’s overall assessment of pSS  disease activity on a 
0 to 10 scale: “Considering now your symptoms related to your Sjögren’s syndrome  
(your dryness, your fatigue, your pain and your mental fatigue) , as well as their 
consequences on your professional or personal life, how severe was you r Sjögren’s 
syndrome during the last 2 weeks?”  
PhGA and PGA NRS  will be applied  using e- PRO  and e -COA, respectively, at W000 and 
W013. 
The questionnaires (ESSPRI, SF -36, MFI, and PGA ) will be explained to the patient by [CONTACT_1275] (or a delegate person) and will be filled in by [CONTACT_410828] (e -PRO). Data entered by [CONTACT_384552] a central database via a 
secured transfer.   
Under ce rtain exceptional circumstances (for example, unexpected technical issue), the patient 
might complete the self -reported questionnaires (ESSPRI, MFI, SF36, PGA)  remotely using a 
secured  internet link provided by [CONTACT_779]. 
 
- Schirmer test :  
Cyclosporine eye dro ps and lifitegrast should not be used during the [ADDRESS_518087] . 
Both eyes are tested at the same time. Calib rated strips of a non- toxic filter paper are used. 
One free end is placed within the lower eyelid. Patient has to keep eyes gently closed for 
5 minutes and then, the paper strips are removed from each lower eyelid and the amount of wetting of the paper str ips is measured (< 5 mm = dry eye, 5 -10 mm = grey zone, >  10 mm  
= normal).   
If performed on the sam e day, t he Schirm
 er test sh ould be performed before Ocular Staining

 Corneal fluorescein staining pattern (step 1 of the OSS scoring system) 
Each cornea is examined at the slit lamp using the cobalt blue filter. Grading of the 
fluorescein pattern is initiated between 4 and 8 minutes after instillation of fluores cein.  
Alternatively, strips can be used.  
Punctate epi[INVESTIGATOR_129047] (PEEs) that stain with fluorescein are counted and scored. An additional point is added if: (1) PEE occurred in the central 4- mm diameter portion of 
the cornea; ( 2) one or more filaments is seen anywhere on the cornea; or (3) one or more 
patches of confluent staining, including linear stains, are found anywhere on the cornea. The total fluorescein score for the cornea (the PEE grade plus any extra points for modifi ers) is 
noted in the central square of the SICCA ocular staining score form. The  maximum possible 
score for each cornea is 6 (see Appendix 7).  
Conjunctival lissamine green staining pa ttern (step 2
  of the OSS scoring system)  
After t he external examination, 1 drop of 1% lissamine green dye is applied to the inferior 
conjunctival  
fornix of both eyes. Alternatively, lissamine green strips can be used and placed 
in the inferior conjunctival fornix of both eyes.  
The same method of admini stering lissam ine green should be used for an individual patient 
at each assessment time point. The conjunctivae are examined with the slit lamp at x10 
magnification, using a neutral density filter over the light source to avoid blanching of the conjunctiva. It is important to examine and grade the eyes immediately after instilling 
lissamine green dye because the intensity and extent of the ocular staining diminishes rapi[INVESTIGATOR_410756] 2 minutes. It is also important for the patient to blink several ti mes to 
keep dye from pooling in the conjunctival folds which can mimic conjunctival staining. If adequate dye is not instilled initially, a second drop can be given and the examination performed immediately thereafter. The number of dots is counted for gra ding of the scored 
dots; nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctivae graded separately). 
Because of the difficulty of counting individual dots in a moving eye at the slit lamp, any 
area of conf l
uent staining of 4 mm2 or more is considered to be more than 100 dots.  
Nasal  and temporal areas of the conjunctiva are graded separately with a maximum score of 
3 for each area or a total maximum score of 6 for each eye (nasal plus temporal) (See Appendix 7).  
Calculation of total OSS  
The total OSS  for each eye is 
 the summation of the fluorescein score for the cornea and the 
lissamine green scores for the nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctiva. The maximum possible score for each eye is 12 ( See Appendix 7 ).  
The approximative total duration of the OSS test is 20-30 minutes. 
OSS asses
sment will be performed at W000, W004  and W013. 
The resul
t of the OSS will be recorded by [CONTACT_29160] (Appendix 7) an d data will be entered by 
[CONTACT_410830] a delegate person on e- CRF .

 - Sialometry under unstimulated and stimulated conditions :  
Unstimulated whole sa liva collect ion always should precede stimulated whole saliva 
collection.  
Patients receiving standard of care for xerostomia must discontinue use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_410757] [ADDRESS_518090] 90 minutes prior 
to the collection of saliva.  
During the unsti mulated salivar y flow assessment, patient s should refrain from speaking or 
swallowing, with the exception of a single swallow, immediately prior to the initiation of the 
procedure. The entire duration of the procedure is expected to be approximately 5 minutes, during which patient s will be asked to allow saliva to accumulate in the oral cavity for a 
period of 60 seconds prior to emptying into a pre -weighed container; this is to be repeated a 
total of [ADDRESS_518091].  
Stimulated salivary flow rate  and collection s
 hould always be performed after unstimulated 
salivary flow and collection. Patient s may be  offered a single rinse with water between the 
procedures. For stimulated saliva measurements, the same procedures are followed as for the unstimulated collections, except that stimulus with 2% citric acid directly to both sides 
of the posterior lateral to ngue will be applied for [ADDRESS_518092] stimulated collection.  
The weight of the collection vial is to be determined a
 nd recorded before and after the 
collection, with the difference representing the saliva vol ume.  
As for u nstimulated  sialometry, stimulated salivary secretions are collected over 5 minutes.  
The same method of saliva collection and salivary f low rate det ermination should be used 
for an individual patient at each assessment time point and for each purpose, respectively. 
The approximative total duration of the sialometry assessment  is 20-30 minutes 
Sia
lometry assessments will be performed at ASS E (Stimulated who le salivary flow rate 
> 0 mL/minute) , W004 and W013 
The results of the sialometry tests will be recorded on paper as source  document and also in 
the e- CRF. Flow rate of saliva = Volume (mL)/minute will be calculated automatically in 
the e- CRF.   
If deemed more convenient, Schirmer, OSS and Sialometry can be performed the day before 
the scheduled visi
t’s date.  
8. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
All adverse
 events and other situations relevant to the safety of the patient s must be followed 
up and fully and precisely documented in order to ensure that the sponsor has the necessary 
information to continuously assess the benefit- risk balance of the clinical trial.

blood cel l count with differential ( e.g. neutrophils, basophi ls, eosinophils, monocytes, 
lymphocytes) and platelet count.  
CD19 B cell count  performed locally  at screening to check  eligibility criterion n°30 
(rituximab or other B cell depleting agent ). 
• Urinalysis  (local): A semi -quantitative  “dipstick” evaluation for th e following 
par
ameters will be performed: specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, 
nitrite, leukocytes and blood. If dipstick urinalysis is abnormal, microscopic examination  
for WBC, RBC, crystals, and casts will be performed. 
• Coagul ation test  (central ): Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT) will be measured.  
• Cryoglobulins (local): at each ESSDAI assessment (ASSE, W000, W004, W013), 
cryoglobulins measurement will be performed ( see Section 7.2). Cryoglobulin result 
obtained from a previous sampling performed within 1 month before screening  visit could 
be used for ESSDAI scoring at screening.  
• Pregnancy tests in WOC BP (local) : Serum pregnancy tests will be performe d at 
screening. At all other times urine pregnancy tests may be used.

 8.2. Methods and measurement times  
- Physical examination : will be per formed at ASSE, W000, W002, W004, W007, W010, 
W013, W019, W028. 
- Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body temperature):  will be assessed after [ADDRESS_518094], 
in supi[INVESTIGATOR_410758]. All  devices 
routinely used in the centre to measure blood pressure are accepted. 
Vital. signs will be performed  at ASSE, W000, W002, W004, W007, W 010, W013, W 019, 
W028. On the days of administration, the physical examination and vital signs  will be per
 formed : 
• pre-dose  
• and post dose (be
fore discharge): at W000 and W002, patients w ill be monitored closely 
for 2 hours after completion of IV infusion ( or longer, at the discretion of the Investigator) 
for vital signs, and signs or symptoms of adverse events including development of an 
injection reaction. At all other visits  with IMP administration (W004, W007, W010), post 
dose assessments will  similarly include assessing infusion site, physical examination and 
vital signs before dismissing the patient from the clinical site.  
- Body weight (kg):  will be meas ured with an empty bladder, the patient being in indoor 
clothing, without shoes at ASSE, W0 00, W004, W010, W013, W019, W028. 
- 12-lead ECG: A standard 12 lead ECG will be recorded in lying position after 5-10 minutes 
res
t. The investigator or designated physician will review and sign all ECGs. Once signed, 
the original ECG tracing will be retained with the p atient’s source documents. At the request 
of the Sponsor, a copy of the original ECG will be made available.  
Clinically significant ECG abnormalities , as judged by [CONTACT_410831], will be recorded on 
the relevant medical history CRF page prior to first dosing and on the Adverse Events page 
thereafter.  
12-Lead ECG will be perf ormed at W000, W004, W010, W013, W019, W028.  
On the days of administration, the 12- lead ECG wil l be performed pre-dose. 
- Laboratory examinations 
Laboratory
 tests analysis will be sub contracted to a c entral laboratory  except for assessments 
such as infectious disease panel, HBA1c, tuberculosis test and for ESR, cryoglobulins, urinalysis and pregnancy tests. The details for sampling, handling, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_410759] a laboratory manual .  
In the particular case where the ASSE visit is performed more than [ADDRESS_518095] be repeated (central or local) within a maximum of two week s before W000. These test s repeated should be obtained within the allowed screening 
period, and must be considered for the patient inclusion.  
All safety samples will be destroyed after analys
 is or at the latest at study end.  
The central lab will provide the investigators with a copy of the res ults and of reference values 
corresponding to the central measurements. A fully identified copy of the laboratory results 
print- out will be evaluated, dated and signed by [CONTACT_410832]. In case of a los t sample, or technical problem or if necessary for a clinical reason, 
a re-test can also be ordered by [CONTACT_093].

 Laboratory results will be assessed by [CONTACT_410833]/she will cont act the patient if an unfavourable change is observed. 
Clinically significant abnormalities will be recorded on the relevant medical history e- CRF 
page prior to first dosing and on the Adverse Events page thereafter. Abnormal laboratory 
values or tests con stitute AEs or medical history only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, 
or are considered  clinically significant, or they require therapy.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a review of va
lues outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or th e previous visit, or values which are considered to be non- typi[INVESTIGATOR_410760].  
Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of indivi dual patient  and 
identifying adverse events.   
• Serum biochemistry and ESR : will be perfo
 rmed at ASSE, W000 , W002, W004, 
W007, W010, W013, W019, W028.  
• Serum Haematology will be performed  at A SSE, W000, W002, W004, W007, W010, 
W013, W019, W028.  
At W000, W002, W004, W007, W010, W013, W019 and W028 visits, serum bioch emistry 
samples will be performed after 10 hours fasting. 
• Urinalysis : A midstream  urine sample (approximately 30 mL) will be obtained, in order 
to avoid contamination with epi[INVESTIGATOR_410761], and allow proper assessments. 
Urinalysis  will be perfo rmed at ASSE, W000, W002, W004, W007, W010, W013, W019, 
W028.  
• Coagulation test:  will be performe d at ASSE, W000, W002, W004, W007, W010, 
W013, W019, W028. 
• Serum pregnancy test : will be perform ed in WOC BP locally at ASSE . 
• Urinary pregnancy test:  will be performe d in WOC BP at W000, W002, W004, W007, 
W010, W013, W019, W028. 
8.3. Definition of Adverse events  
An adverse e
vent is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient participat ing in a 
clinical study, whether or not there is a causal relationship with the IMP and/or experimental 
procedures, occurring or detected from the date the patient  signs the information and consent 
form, irrespective of the period of the study (peri ods without administration of the IMP 
(e.g. run -in period) are also concerned). 
An adverse event can therefore be:  
- any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an a bnor mal finding from an additional 
examination such as lab tests, X -rays, ECG, …)  which is de emed clinically relevant by [CONTACT_1275],  
- any symptom or disease, 
- any worsening during the study of a symptom or a disease already present when the patient  
entere
d the study (increase in frequency and/or intensity),  
and detected during a study vi sit or at an addi tional examination or occurred since the 
previous study vi sit.

 Of note:  
Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410762], educational purpose  (e.g. learning of diabetes 
management by [CONTACT_102] ) or routine check- up should not be considered as an a dverse event 
and should not be reported in the CRF. 
The following procedures, whether planned before the study or not, whether leading to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410763], should not be reported in the e -CRF and kept in the source data 
(or patient file):  
- Therapeu tic procedures related to a non -aggravated medical history ( e.g. cataract extraction 
not due to an aggravation of the cataract during the study, haemodialysis sessions related to a renal insufficiency not aggravated during the study),  
- Prophylactic procedures (e.g. sterilisatio
 n, wisdom teeth removal),  
- Comfort procedures ( e.g. cosmetic s urgery),  
- Control procedures of a pre -existing condit ion without aggravation ( e.g. colonoscopy to 
control the remission of colon cancer). 
 Symptoms related to the studied patho logy (pSS):  
Symptom
s of pSS  occurring prior to first dosing have not to be reported in the medical history 
page of e -CRF. Only a ggravations or new occurrence of pSS symptoms from first dosing will 
be reported as adverse event . In case of major  worsening of Primary Sjögren’s syndrome, the 
patient could be prematurely withdrawn according to the judgement of the investigator . 
(see S ection s 5.6.1 and [IP_ADDRESS]).  
8.4. Definition of Seriou s adv erse events  
Any adve
rse event that at, any dose: 
- Results in death, 
- Is life -threatening(1), 
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
- Is medically significant(2), 
- Results in persistent or significant disability/inc apaci ty(3), 
- Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect(4). 
(1) Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.  
(2) Any event that might not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but 
might jeopardise the participant or might requir e intervention to prevent one of these outcomes 
(for example: oedema or allergi c bro nchospasm that required intensive treatment at home, 
blood dyscrasia, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or development of drug dependence or 
drug abuse). T he investigator should exercise his/her scientific and medical judgement to dec ide w hether 
or not such an event requires expedited reporting to sponsor. 
(3) Disability/incapacity in this context refers to any event that seriously disrupts the ability of th e 
participant to lead a normal life, in other words leads to a persistent or pe rmane nt significant change, 
deterioration, injury or perturbation of the participant's body functions or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life.  
(4) Congenital anomaly or birth defect refers to the exposure to the IMP before conception (in men or 
women) or during pregnancy that resulted in an adverse outcome in the child.

 8.5. Definition of Overdose  
This refers to any intake or administratio n of a quantity of IMP which is  above the maximum 
dose recommended in the study protocol, independently of the  occu rrence of any adverse event.  
The quantity should be considered per  administration or cumulatively  regarding the maximum 
dose recommended in the study protocol (750 mg).  
8.6. Definition of Adverse event of special interest  
An adverse event of special interest (A EOSI) is one of scientific and medical interest or concern 
regarding the IMP for which recording rules, special documentation with detailed information  
such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410764] . It may be a serious or non -serious AE that may require 
further inv estigation in order to characterize and understand.  
AEOSI include:  
- Allergic reaction grade 3 or higher according to CTCAE/v5.0 grading including infusion 
related reaction  (Note: Humans administered  foreign proteins are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_410765], including anaphylaxis). 
- Cytokine release syndr ome: No cytokine  release has been observed in FIH study 
(IFNγ,  IL12p70, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL8, TNFα) , however, given the risk of cytokine release 
syndrome observed in certain therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, this event will be 
systematically collected and closely monitored  in patients treated with S95011). In c ase of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_410766], a blood sample for cytokines assay will be performed and analysed locally.   
- Infections grade 3 or h
 igher according to CTCAE/v5.0 grading (Note: IL 7 receptor 
inhibition  may induce immunomodulation, so patient s should be monitored clinically for 
manifestations of infectious disease, and, if necessary, appropriately treated [ e.g. with 
antibiotics]) . 
- Lymphopenia <500x106/L (grade 3 or higher according to CTCAE v5.0 C riteria ) 
No safety  concern 
with S95011 (See Investigator’s Brochure ) has been identified in preclinical 
studies and phase
 I study. 
8.7. Definition of Events requiring an immediate notification (ERIN)  
An event must
 be notified imme diately  (i.e. without delay and within [ADDRESS_518096] ) to 
the sponsor if it is: - A serious adverse event,  
- An AEOSI , as defined in
  Section  8.6. 
- An overdose of the IMP even if asymptomatic,  
- Any intake of the IMP by a person ar ound the patient, 
- A pregnancy  (patient or patient’s partner). 
8.8. Classification of an adverse event (seriousness, intensity , causality , expectedness)  
It is important that the investigator gives his/her own opi[INVESTIGATOR_192614] , 
the 
intensity  of the event as well as the cause -effect relationship  between an adverse event 
and the IMP. This evaluation must be assessed by [CONTACT_192685]. 
In addition, the sponsor will be responsible for the evaluation the expectedness of the event , 
the causality and the seriousness (See Section 8.9.3).

 The Seriousness  should be evaluated according to international guidances (see definition 
Section  8.4, in accordance with  ICH Topic E 2A and the  DIRECTIVE 2001/20/EC OF THE 
EUROPEAN PARL
IAM
ENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 4 April ). 
The Intensity of AEs should be graded using the modified Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events CTCAE  v5.[ADDRESS_518097], the investigator should use 
the grade or adjectives: Grade 1 (mild), Grade 2 (moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 
(life-threatening) or Grade 5 (fatal) to de scribe the maximum intensity of the AE. For  purposes 
of consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in the table below. 
Grading of Adverse Event Intensity  
Grade  Adjective  Description  
Grade 1  Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clini cal or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Grade 2  Moderate  Local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL*  
Grade 3  Severe  Severe or medically significan t but not immediately 
life-threateni ng; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  Urgent intervention indicated  
Grade 5  Fatal  Death -related AE  
* Activities of Daily Livin g (ADL) Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_263283], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and n ot bedridde n. 
For AEs associated with labor atory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis of 
the clinical intensity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in 
agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. This is  upon the investigator’s 
assessme nt. 
The causal relationship  to the IMP or to the experimental procedures must  be assessed when 
reporti ng the AE in the AE form. Cases ticked “related” by [CONTACT_410834] a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the IMP (AE linked to the 
mechanism of action of the IMP…), will be considered as suspected Adverse Drug Reaction. 
In general, if a r elationship between AE and drug is at least reasonably possible ( i.e. the 
relationship cannot be ruled out) it is to be conside red as “related”.

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Special situations (pregn ancy, overdose, IMP intake by a person around the 
patient) 
Pregnancy   
If a female patient in the study become s pregnant, the investigator must: 
- Stop immediately the IMP, 
- Report it on an « Adverse Event » page in the e-CRF as well as on the specific paper 
pregnancy form (1st page) to be notified immediately (ERIN), 
- Contribute to the follow-up of this pregnancy and provide the sponsor with information 
concerning this follow-up (notably using the 2nd page of the specific paper pregnancy form). 
- If the partner of a patient beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, the pregnancy 
should not be reported  in the e-CRF. The investigator should immediately  contact [CONTACT_103] (contact [CONTACT_410836]’s study file) who will inform him/her 
about the procedure to be followed. 
Overdose of IMP  
- In case of overdose, the investigator should re port it on an “Adverse Event” page in the e-
CRF to be notified immediately (ERIN).  
- Overdose should be followed-up to ensure that the information is as complete as possible 
with regards to:  
• Dose details (number of units , duration,…) and, if  multiple overdose,  details regarding 
other medicinal products or substance , 
• Context of occurrence, i.e. intentional (suicide attempt,  other reason) or accidental 
(error in prescripti on, administration, di spensing, dosage),  
• Related signs and symptoms (“No related a dverse events” to be reported otherwise),  
• Outcome. 
- Insofar as possible, a blood sample should be  collected for assay of the IMP taken.  
Intake of IMP by a person around the participant 
This event should not be reported in  the e-CRF. The investigator should immediately  contact 
[CONTACT_456] (contact [CONTACT_410836]’s study file) who will inform him/her 
about the procedure to be followed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Methods in the e-CRF 
Adverse events must be documented on the « Adverse Event » page of the e-CRF.  
In case of chronic disease: 
- if the disease is known when the patient ente rs in the study, only worsening (increased 
frequency and/or intensity of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/attacks)  will be documented as an adverse event,  
- if the disease is detected during the study and if repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_192617] a 
chronic disease, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_192618] « Adverse Event » page previously 
created for the event (e-CRF) which will clearly describe the diagnosis. 
- In the specific case of Sjögren’s syndrome,  new occurence of symptoms or aggravations 
will be reported in the e-CRF as adverse ev ents. Description of the symptoms will be 
recorded in the description of these AE.

Section  14.1),  
- Provide the sponsor (person designated in the contact [CONTACT_384545]’s 
study fil
e), as they become avail able, with anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_384478], 
- Fulfil his/her regulatory obligations to the Competent Authorities and/or to the IRB/IEC   in accor 
dance with local regulations . 
If an adverse event init ially non- serious worsens and becomes serious (ERIN), this must be 
reported immediately  on an "Adverse event" page of the e- CRF.  
In case the e- CRF is unavai lable when the investigator was informed of the ERIN, he/she 
should: - Immed iately  fill in a p
 aper "Ad verse event" page:  
• For serious event on a paper "Adverse event – Initial informa tion" page,  
• For event initially non- serious on a paper "Adverse event – Initial information" page, and 
the worsening leading to seriousness on a pape r "Adverse event – Additio nal informati on" 
page,  
- Immediate ly send them by [CONTACT_152478] e -mail to the person(s) designated in the contact [CONTACT_192692]’s study file or outside working hours, the 24-hour  phone line  is 
[PHONE_4165].60.00. 
- As soon as the e -CRF becom es a vailable, the investigator sh ould enter these data in the 
« Adverse Event » page of the e- CRF.  
8.9.3. Responsibilities of the sponsor  
In accordance 
with international guidances, the assessment of the seriousness and the causality 
of adverse event
s are usually  made by [CONTACT_192693]’s duties, 
who is responsible for ensuring that all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions are reported to Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
The sponsor wil l review the s
 eriousness o f the adverse events and the caus ality of (at least) 
the serious adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_192694]. The causality and the seriousness may be upgraded (but never downgraded). Anonymized copi[INVESTIGATOR_410767], 
laboratory tests reports, reports of other examination aiding diagnosis may be asked for the event assessment. If the assessments of the investigator and the sponsor are different, both will  
be reported in the clinical study report.

to sign a specific informed consent form. This consent given can be withdrawn at any moment 
without compromising the participatio n in the overall clinical study investigations.  
If accepted by [CONTACT_102], a  lip biopsy will be performed to obtain minor salivary glands  at 
W013:  
Once incision is performed, as much glands as possible are collected (ideally, 3 to 6, but 1 or 2 glands ar e acc 
epted). Once collected, the glands can be rested on s terile gauze (slightly damp 
with physiological solution or sterile water) prior preparation of samples in frozen conditions or in formalin (refer to  the specific procedures manual for details) .  
Local anaesthetics are permitted and the patients will be clo sely followed 
 after the biopsies.  
The lip biopsy must not be performed before the sialometry. 
The biopsy will be performed by [CONTACT_410842] a procedure. A specific procedure manual w ill be provided.  
Of note : if deemed more convenient, lip biopsy can be performed the day before and up to 
2 days after the scheduled visit’s date (but the lip biopsy must always be performed after 
the sialometry).   
In addition, for patients who agreed  to perform salivary glands biopsy at W013, if  histological 
results of a previously documented lip biopsy * are available (focus score, determination 
of germinal center, number of T and B cells and ratio T/B) , these results will be 
documented in the e -CRF.   
*The previous biopsy should hav e been perfor med within [ADDRESS_518105] received any biological therapy between the time of the biopsy and W000; and the biopsy must have been collected after 5 half-lives of a prior biologica l treatment.  
The biopsy samples may be used after the end of the study for other parameters assessments  in 
relation to 
the study drug or to pSS in light of scientific knowledge or technology unknown 
today but that may appear in the literature in the co ming  years or extend the search for the

 [IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Primary est imand based on the ESSDAI  
The primary estimand of interest is the effect of the initially randomis ed trea tments on the 
clinical disease activity in all patient s assuming non- occurren ce of  intercurrent events. 
The motivation for this choice is to assess at this proof -of-concept stage the full efficacy 
potential, that is, the pharmacologic effect of the S95011 if all patients adhere to it (without  any 
intercurrent events).  
The attribute s of the primar y estimand are defined as follow: 
­ Treatment : S95011 or placebo 
­ Population: RS  
­ Variable: change in ESSDAI total score from baseline to W13 (primary efficacy endpoint). 
­ Summary measure: difference in means between treatments.  
­ Intercurrent events ( IE):  
• change or initiation  of unauthorised medication  
• study drug discontinuation for major worsening of primary Sjögren’s syndrome or AE 
rela
ted to study drug 
• study drug discontinuation for other reasons (non-medical reason, AE not- related…)  
• unexpec
ted others eve nts having a major  impact on the pharmacologic effect evaluation  
(They will be defined at the latest in the final version of the SAP).  
 
The rate of IEs is assumed to be below 10%. They will be handled by a hypothetical strategy to 
estimate what th e
 outcome would have been at the designated time point if no IE would have 
occurred through that time point, considering that patient s with IE would have efficacy 
outcomes as patient s, in their treatment group, who continue their randomised treatment witho ut 
IE. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1. Primary analysis  
The primary analysis for the primary estimand will be conducted using only data obtained prior 
to IEs. Val
ues post IE will not be taken into account and will be imputed according to the MAR 
assumption (multiple imputation by [CONTACT_64240]). This is aligned with the primary estimand 
and the hypothetical strategy. 
S95011 will be compared to placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint in the RS, using a General 
Linear Model 
including the fixed, categorical effect of treatment and randomi sation 
stratification factors (rando_factor ) as well as the continuous fixed covariate of baseline value. 
GENERAL LINEAR MODEL: change = baseline rando_factors treatment 
The assumptions underlying the model, as for instance, the normality and homoscedastic ity of 
residual
s and detection of outliers, will be checked.  
Missing data (not linked to intercurrent events) will be imputed according to the MAR 
assumption with
 a multiple imputation by [CONTACT_1570].

 The hypotheses to be tested are: 
Let μ 0 and μ 1 be the population means of the change from baseline in ESSDAI score at W13 
(primary endpoint) under placebo and S95011, respectively. The statistical hypotheses that will 
be tested are:  
 
H0: μ 0 ≥ μ 1 (S95011 is not superior to placebo) 
versus  
H1: μ 0 < μ 1 (S95011 is superior to placebo) 
 The type I error of the statistical tests will be set at 10% for unilateral situation, which is consistent wit
h the objective of demonstrating the superiority versus placebo. 
The following elements will be provided in a summary  table:  
­ Estima
te (standard error) of the difference between adjusted treatment group means. 
­ Two-sided 80% CI of the estimate  
­ Two-sided 95

[IP_ADDRESS].1.2. Sens
itivity an alyses 
In order to assess the sensitivity to the missing a t random ( MAR ) ass umption, values post the 
following IEs: 
­ change or initiation of unauthorised medication, 
­ study drug discontinuation for major worsening of primary Sjögren’s syndrome or AE 
relat
ed to study drug, 
will not be taken into account and will be imput ed according to the missing not at random  
(MNAR ) assumption. The values of outcome will be imputed using a reference based multiple 
imputation (“copy increments in placebo” approach) for S95011 group and using multiple 
imputation for the placebo group. This approach assumes that patients from S95011 will exhibit an evolution of the disease similar to patients in the placebo group but starting from the benefit already obtained ( Carpenter et al, 2013). The i
 mputed value will reflect the f act that these IEs 
are considered a moderately bad outcome. The others IEs and missing data will be handled as in the primary analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3. Supplement
 ary analyses 
Responders ESSDAI at W13 defined as patients having improvement from baseline i n ESSDAI 
total score
 of at least: 
- [ADDRESS_518107] of tr
eatment and randomisation stratification factors ( rando_factor ) as well as the 
continuous fi xed covariate of baseline value. The handling of IEs and missing data will be the 
same as the pr imary and sensitivity analysis.

The secondary estimand of interest is the effect of the randomis ed treatm ents on sym ptoms  
reported by [CONTACT_410843] s assuming non- occurrence of IEs. The motivation for this 
choice is the same as the primary estimand.  
Compared to the primary estimand, only the variable  attribute  is different and is defined as the 
change in ES SPRI  total score from baseline to W13 (secondary efficacy endpoints).  
The other attributes, main and sensitivity analyses are the same as for the primary estimand. 
In the same line
 as for the primary estimand, the supplementary analyses will be p erformed  on 
the responders ESSPRI at W13 defined as patients having improvement from baseline in 
ESSPRI  total score of at least:  
- 1 point 
- 2 points 
- 3 points. 
using the same m
odel as for responders ESSDAI. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Additional est imands based on ESSDAI and ESSPRI  
Treat ment poli cy estimands 
Treatment policy estimands are defined in order to assess the treatment effect on the clinical disease activity (ESSDAI) and also on the symptoms reported by [CONTACT_13935] (ESSPRI) regardless of whether or not the IE occurs.  
The attri butes of the additional est
 imands are defined as follow: 
­ Treatment : S95011 or placebo, regardless of whether or not the IE occurs 
­ Population: RS  
­ Variable 1: change in ESSDAI total score from baseline to W13  
­ Variable 2: change in ESSPRI total score from baseline to  W13  
­ Summary measure: difference in means between treatments.  
­ Intercurrent events : The occurrence of IEs (see list in primary estimand) is irrelevant in 
defining the treatment effect of interest. All observed values will be used regardless of 
occurrence of  an IE. 
 Main and supplementary analyses are the same as for the primary estimand.  
 
Other estimand 
This estimand of interest is the effect of the randomis ed treatments on the composite response 
to treatment taking into account a double dimension - clinical  dise ase activity from ESSDAI 
and symptoms reported by [CONTACT_410844] - in all patient s assuming non- occurrence 
of IEs. The motivation for this choice is the same as the primary estimand.   
The attributes of this estimand are defined as follow s: 
­ Treatment : S95011 or placebo. 
­ Population: all randomis ed patients (RS).  
­ Variable: Number of responders defined as patients with ≥ 3 points of improvement in 
ESSDAI and with ≥ 1 point of improvement in ESSPRI from baseline at W013. 
­ Summary measure: differen ce in proportion between treatments.

Histological analyses and exploratory biomarkers will be described by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interim analysis 
Only if the recruitment is much longer than expected, a blinded standard deviat ion reassessment 
could be  planned when  [ADDRESS_518108] completed the 13- week treatment period as 
detailed in Section 10.2. 
10.2. Determination of sample size  
The following efficacy criteria are defined:  
­ a statistically  significant reduction in ESSDAI at Week 13 in the S95011 group compared to 
placebo, at the one-sided 10% significance level  
­ an estimated  mean reduc tion in ESSDAI in the S95011 group to be 3 points or greater than 
placebo. The decrease of 3 points was chosen because it is considered as clinically minimal 
relevant ( Seror et al, 2016).  
 
Targeted sample size  
With 45 patients in the primary analysis of the primary estimand  (30 in the S95011 group and 
15 in the placebo group), the study would have around 5% chance of having a false-positive 
result, i.e., of meeting both the efficacy criteria when the true difference between S95011 and 
placebo is zero. Additionally, the chanc es of meeting both the efficacy criteria remain below 
14% for true differences between  S95011 and placebo of less than [ADDRESS_518109] approximately 70% chance of meeting both the efficacy criteria, when the true diff
erence between S95011 and placebo is [ADDRESS_518110] approximately 50% chance of meeting both the efficacy criteria. These calculations assume that the primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in ESSDAI, follows a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 6. This e stimate of the standard deviation is based on some  clinical studies (Fisher et al, 2020;  
UCB5857;  RO5459072
) in patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome in which the observed 
standard deviat
ion ranged from around 4 to 6.

The similar operational characteristics (false- positive and right -positive rate s) are obtained with 
[ADDRESS_518112] on the probability of having a false- positive result ( Kieser, 2003).  
10.3. Pharmacokinetic analy sis and PK/PD analysis  
Serum  concentrations of S95011 will be analysed by a population modelling approach, 
descri bed in a s
eparated Data Analysis Plan ( DAP ), in order to assess the pharmacokinetics of 
the drug and to investigate potential sources of variability through a covariate analysis.  
This analysis will provide pharmacokinetic parameters and their associated va riability in 
patients  and will be the object of a  separate report.  
Exploratory assessment of the relationship between exposure and pharmacodyna mics (as  safety  
and efficacy) will be performed and if applicable, population 
pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic (PK /PD) m odels will be developed and a DAP will be s et 
up and reported separately. 
11. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA / DOCUMENTS  
The investigat
or will allow the monitors, the persons responsible for the audit, 
the represe

source data / documents. 12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
12.1. Study monito r
ing 
Clinical si
te monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human p atient s 
are protected, that the reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the 
conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with 
GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_410850] S
 ection 1. 
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP). 
The CMP desc
ribes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring 
will be done, at  what level of detail monitoring will be performe d, and the distribution of 
monitoring reports.  
Independent audits may be conducte d to ensure monitoring practices are performed consistently 
across all participating sites and that monitors are following th e CMP.  
12.1.1. Before the study  
The investig
ator will allow the monitor to visit the site and facilities where the study will take 
place in order to ensure compliance with the protocol requirements.

14.1. Study data  
A 21 CRF Pa
rt 11-compliant electronic da ta capture system is going to be used for t his stu dy. 
An electronic case report form (e -CRF) is designed to record the data required by [CONTACT_410855]. 
The e- CRF will be produced by I.R.I.S. in compliance with its specifica tions. The investigator 
or a designated pers on from  his/her team will be trained for the use of the e -CRF by [CONTACT_456]. 
Data entry at the investigator’s site will be performed by [CONTACT_410856]/he
r team after completion of the patient’s Medical File.  
Upon entry, dat a will be tra nsmitted via the Internet from the study centre to the study database. 
The investigator or the designated person from his/her team agrees to complete the e -CRF, 
at each patient  vi
sit, and all other documents provided by [CONTACT_456] ( e.g. docum ents relating 
to the IMP management…).  
The e-CRF forms must be completed as soon as possible following each visit. 
All corrections of data on the e -CRF must be  made by [CONTACT_410856]/her team using electronic data clarifications according to the provided 
instructions. All data modification will be recorded using the audit trail feature of  Inform   
software, including date, reason for modification and identification of the person who has made the change.  
In order to ensure confidentiality and securit y of the dat a
 , usernames and passwords will be 
used to restrict system access to authorised personnel only, whether resident within the investigator’s sites, the sponsor or third parties. Data will be verified in accord ance wi th the moni
 toring strategy defined for the study. 
After  comparing these data to the source documents, the monitor will request correction / 
clarification from the investigator using electro nic data clarifications that should be answered 
and closed as quickly as possible. 
Data can be fr ozen during the  study after their validation. However , the investigator has the 
possibility to modify a data if deemed via a request to the sponsor. 
To demonstrate the oversight on data reported and ensure the whole content ‘ s accuracy, 
completeness and legibility in accordance with the GCP, the investigator or co -investigator 
must attest the authenticity of the data collected in the e -CRF by [CONTACT_121296]/her user name [CONTACT_25558] :  
- As soon as possible in case of SAE ( and no later than 2 weeks  after the date the SAE was 
reported in the e- CRF),  
- Before each DSMB meeting,  
- Before the interim analysis (if applicable),  
- After the last visit of the participant of the treatment period and the follow-up period. 
After the data base lock , the investigator or an author ized member of his/her team  will have to 
download from the e -CRF an electronic file containing patient  data of his/her centre for 
archiving it in the study file ( see Section 14.3).

 14.2. Data management 
Data are coll ected via a CRF an d stored in a secured database.  
For data collected on the e- CRF, the Clini cal Data Management of I.R.I.S . is responsible for 
data processing including data validation performed according to a specifica tion ma nual 
describing the checks to be carried out. As a result of data validation, data may require some 
changes. An electronic data clarification form is sent to the investigator who is required to 
respond to the query and make any necessary changes to the data.  
For data transferred from the centralised  laboratories , e-COA, IWRS  system s, the Clinical Data 
Management of I.R.I.S. is responsible for data transfer. C entralised laboratories , e-COA, IWRS  
provide electronic transfer of computerised data to the Clinica l Data Management of I.R.I.S. 
Data are transferred according to a transfer protocol issued by [CONTACT_941] I.R.I.S. data manager. 
The Medical Review Department of I.R.I.S. is responsible for data coding including: 
­ Medical / surgical history, adverse events and procedures using MedDRA, 
­ Medicatio ns using World He alth Organization, Drug Dictionary (WHO-Drug). 
The coding process is described in a specification manual. The investigator ascertains he/she will apply due dilige
 nce to avoid protocol deviations. 
Under no circumstances should the investiga tor contact [CONTACT_410857], if any, to request approval of a protocol deviation, as no deviations are 
permitted. If the investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study 
this must be cons idered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon 
by [CONTACT_138849]/IEC it cannot be implemented. All important protocol deviations will be recorded and reported in the clini cal stu dy report. 
Before each databas e lock (one for
  ASSE -W13 period , and one at the end of the study w hen 
the FU period is finished), when data validation is achieved, a blind review of the data is  
performed according to the sponsor standard operating pr ocedure . When the database has been 
declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. The IMP code will unblinded and made 
available for data analysis after the database lock of ASSE -W013 period. 
14.3. Archiving  
The inves tig
ator will keep all information relevan t to the st udy for at least 25 years  after the 
end of the study, or more if specified by [CONTACT_18600].  
At the end of the study, the investigator or an authorized member of his/her tea m will download  
an electronic copy of each patient ’s data  from t he e-CRF and should keep it in a reliable, secure 
and durable location. The file includes all data and comments reported in the e -CRF, the history 
of all queries and signatures and the full audit trail reports.  
All data reported in electronic Clinical Out come Assessment (e-COA) will b e provided to the 
investigator’s site. At the end of the study, the CRO provider will send a CD -ROM to each site 
with all data of their patients.  
The file must include appropriate restrictions (password protection) and adequat e protection 
from loss, physical damage or deterioration for the duration of the archiving period.

Appendix 1: World Medical Association Decl aration of Helsi nki 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Hu man Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_518117], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington DC, [LOCATION_003], 2002 (Note of Clarification added)

General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, 2004 (Note of Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea, October 2008  
64th WMA Gene ral Assembly , Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
Preamble 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration o f Helsi nki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects , including 
research on identifiable huma n material and data.  
 T he Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs 
should be applied wi
th consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Consistent with the m andate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to 
physicians. The  WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving 
human subjects to adopt these princi ples 
General Principles  
3. The Declaration  of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the pat ient's best interest when providing medical 
care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and right s 
of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's 
knowledge and conscience are dedicated  to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5. Medical  progress is  based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects.  
6. The primary  purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of d iseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best pr oven 
interventions must  be evaluated continually through research for their safety, 
effectiveness, efficiency, accessibili ty and quality. 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human subjects a 
nd protect their health and rights. 
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.

In clinical trials, the p rotocol must 
 also descr ibe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research  protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This 
committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, 
the sponsor and any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into 
consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries  in whi ch the research 
is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to  monitor on-going
  studies. The researcher must 
provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any 
serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. Af ter the  end of the study, the researchers 
must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and t he 
confidentiality of their personal information.

given informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the  
general outcome  a 
nd results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must be particularly 
 cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the 
physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_30388]. 
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician 
must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. 
These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], t he research cannot inst ead be performed with persons capable of 
providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk  and minimal 
burden. 
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able t o 
give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek 
that assent in addition to the consent of the legally aut horised representative. The potential 
subject’s dissent should be respected. 
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or me ntally incap a ble of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the physician must seek informed co nsent from the legally 
authorised representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that r enders them unable to give informed 
consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a

research. T
he refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to 
withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or d 
ata contained in biocollection s or similar repositories, physicians must seek 
informed consent for it s colle ction, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional 
situations where consent would be impossible or impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committe e. 
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits , risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against 
those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; 
or 
Where for c
ompelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention les
s effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention 
is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention 
and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no int
ervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible 
harm as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still n eed an interventi on 
identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process. 
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results 
35. Every research  study involving human subject s must be registered in a publicly accessible 
database before recruitment of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors , sponsors , editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with 
regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of re search.  Researchers have a 
duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human subjects and are 
accountable for the  completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere 
to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negat ive and  inconclusive as well as positive 
results must be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, 
institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publication.

It is recognized widely that the COVID -[ADDRESS_518147] is unknown at this poin t. Howeve r, challenges may arise in the next months from COVID -19 or similar 
disease. It may cause for example, quarantines self -imposed or institute imposed or 
governmental imposed, site closures, travel limitations, interruptions in the supply chain for the 
study drugs, or other considerations if s ite personnel or trial subjects become infected with 
COVID- 19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting protocol -specified procedures 
including administering the study drug or adhering to protocol -mandated vi sits and 
laboratory/diagnostic testing.  The Sponsor is providing the following exceptional options for study related patient management i n 
the event of disruption to the conduct of the study during the 
pandemic/epi[INVESTIGATOR_410775]:  
1.If scheduled visits cannot be  conducted in pe r son at the study site, it should be
performed remotely/virtually or delayed until such time that on- site visits can be
resumed. At each contact, patient s should be interviewed to collect safety data. Patients
will also be question ed regarding general health status to fulfill  physical examination
requirements.
2.Study drug administrations are allowed only at site according to the procedure described
in the protocol
. In case of any issue with study administration schedule investigator must
contact [CONTACT_410872] S ection 5.6.1.
3. E fficacy endpoint assessments should be performed if required and as feasible.  If not,
the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_410873].
4.Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified ass essments for patients on
study intervention including follow-up. Safety laboratory assessment can be performedat the local laboratory near the patient, if possible.
5.In case of patient ’s withdr awa
 l, if the withdrawal visit is done remotely, an on- site visit
will be organized once the situation is stabilized.
6. Study sites should inform the Sponsor about modifications as soon as possible.7. Missed assessment/visits should be captured as protocol deviations due to COVID-19.8.Changes to study procedures should be documented in the source notes and in the e -CRF
as advised
 by [CONTACT_1034]. Specific information for individual patients should be
captured in the e- CRF that explains the basis for missing protocol- specified information
in relationship to COVID -19, i.e., from missed study visits or study discontinuations
due to COVID-19.
I.R.I.S . as the Sponsor of the study will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the
clinical s
tudy during pandem ic/epi[INVESTIGATOR_410776] ( e.g., delay or
discontinuation in recruitment, site monitoring and audits) wi ll be communicated to the sites
and to the Health Authorities according to local guidance. Modifications made to the study

Evaluating racial and ethnic dif ferences in micropore closure rates after micropatch application

The objective of this study is to define the rate of skin barrier recovery following micropatch treatment (also referred to as a microneedle) in
subjects of dif fering racial/ethnic backgrounds. Subjects will be healthy individuals between the ages of 18 - 50 years. Subjects will be
divided into groups based on self-identified racial background and BMI. Following enrollment and consent, 9 sites will be identified on the
upper arm. Baseline measurements of hydration, electrical impedance, and water loss will be measured at all sites using noninvasive flat
probes. Three sites will be treated with a micropatch containing an array of microneedles (800 micrometers in length), followed by a repeated
measurement of water loss and impedance ; the sites will then be covered with occlusive material secured with medical tape. Three sites will
be covered with occlusive material but will not be treated with a micropatch. The remaining three sites will be untreated and uncovered
throughout the study and will serve as measurement control sites. The subjects will return at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. At each visit the
occlusive coverings will be removed and all measurements will be repeated (excluding the water loss measurements). Fresh occlusive
material will be applied after measurements are made.
I.5 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses (do not indicate "see protocol")
The research question we are seeking to answer is whether there are dif ferences in the time it takes for the skin to completely repair after
micropatch application in subjects of dif ferent race and ethnicities. W e hypothesize that the skin of non-Caucasian individuals will restore
barrier function more quickly than in Caucasians.
I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.
 (do not  indicate "see protocol")
Transdermal drug delivery (by [CONTACT_518698] a time-dependent fashion) allows for systemic drug
delivery through the skin, while avoiding many of the side ef fects and challenges associated with oral or intravenous drug delivery . One
significant challenge limiting the number of drug compounds that can be transdermally delivered is the hydrophobic nature of the skin, which
provides a highly ef ficient barrier against the absorption of drug molecules. Microneedles are a minimally invasive means of assisting the
transport of drug molecules across the skin by [CONTACT_518699]-sized channels (also called micropores) in the skin, thereby [CONTACT_518700] . Many studies have demonstrated that microneedle treatment is relatively painless and well-tolerated by [CONTACT_72023]. 
Following microneedle treatment, the skin must heal the micropores in order to restore barrier function. In young healthy individuals this
process takes approximately 48 – 72 hours when the skin is covered by [CONTACT_518701]. The timeframe for micropore closure is longer in
elderly individuals (>65 years of age), taking several days longer to restore the skin barrier . As evidenced by [CONTACT_518702], biological variation can have a significant ef fect on the skin’ s healing properties. There are almost
no data available regarding how race and ethnicity af fect skin response to microneedle insertion. It is crucial to better understand how the
rates of micropore closure vary in dif ferent racial/ethnic populations because the potential for variability in drug delivery is high if the
recovery timeframes are poorly understood. 
 
A number of drug exposure and response factors can be significantly altered in racial subpopulations; these can include pharmacokinetic
dose-proportionality , therapeutic index, bioavailability , steepness of the relationship between dose and response, and genetic polymorphisms
in metabolism pathways. Whether or not these dif ferences have an ef fect when a drug is administered via the skin, specifically with
microneedles, is unknown. The most obvious skin dif ference between individuals of varying race is pi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. A number of other
significant skin dif ferences exist that cannot be visually observed, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_518683] . Mean electrical resistance is
significantly higher in Black vs. Caucasian individuals, suggesting that the stratum corneum (outer epi[INVESTIGATOR_518684]) is thicker or more
cohesive, or both. Decreased transdermal penetration of pharmaceuticals has been observed in Black persons (relative to Caucasian). The
barrier of darkly pi[INVESTIGATOR_518685]. The
epi[INVESTIGATOR_518686]. Caucasian skin. Asian, Caucasian, and Black individuals also have dissimilar levels of skin
reactivity . Additional variables that dif fer between skin of diverse race/ethnicity include transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044], hydration, and sebum
content. All of these factors could cause clinically relevant dif ferences in micropore healing and drug exposure. 
 
In this study we will measure hydration to characterize the epi[INVESTIGATOR_518687]-identified races.
Measurements of water loss and movement of electrical current (impedance measurements) will be used to evaluate the rate of micropore
closure. The skin serves as the primary barrier to loss of water from the body , and disruptions of skin barrier function (as seen with
microneedle insertion) result in a significant increase in water loss. The skin also serves as a barrier to the movement of electrical current,
and a breach of the skin barrier leads to significant decreases in the impedance measurements. Therefore, both of these serve as surrogate
markers of barrier function and can be measured noninvasively .

informed of the purpose, nature, procedures, risks and hazards of the study . One of the important features of our screening process is the ability for
the prospective participant to review the informed consent on his/her own time, outside of the study site. This additionally demonstrates the
reliability of the subject if they schedule a follow-up meeting to sign the informed consent. 
VII.D.37 Does the study include any form of deception (e.g., providing participants with false information, misleading information, or withholding
information about certain study procedures)?
Examples:
 
Procedure includes a cover story that provides a plausible but inaccurate account of the purposes of the research.
Participants will be provided with false information regarding the particular behaviors of interest in the research.
Procedures include a confederate pretending to be another participant in the study .
Participants will be told that the research includes completion of a particular task, when in fact, that task will not be administered.
Study is designed to introduce a new procedure (or task) that participants are not initially told about.
If yes, a waiver of informed consent must be requested under question IV .3.

The time period over which procedures will occur
The time commitment for the subject for individual visits/procedures
Long-term followup and how it occurs
After a subject consents to be in the study , baseline demographic data will be collected for each subject including age, sex, height, weight, and
Fitzpatrick skin type (determined by a member of the study team); information regarding current medical conditions will also be collected.
Specifically , the subject’ s approximate duration of each condition, what treatments the subject has received, and approximate severity of the
conditions will be collected, as well as a current medication list. All of this information will be collected directly from the subject and the subject’ s
medical record will not be reviewed/abstracted for research data. After completing the questionnaire a member of the research team will determine
if the subject is eligible to continue participating in the study . Subjects will be screened out after this process if their answers to screening questions
meet the exclusionary criteria. Consent and screening procedures will require approximately [ADDRESS_672890] day of study procedures (Day 0), which may occur on the same day as the consenting process, subjects will first be asked to sit quietly
in the CRU for 30 minutes before any study procedures are started, in order for their skin to acclimate to the room temperature and humidity . Nine
sites will be identified on the upper arm and marked with a pen. At all marked sites baseline measurements of hydration, colorimetry , trans-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_7044], and impedance will be measured at each site, using noninvasive flat probes (described below). The probes are attached to a
computer that calculates measurement units. Three sites will receive the micropatch treatment (described below), and after treatment the trans-
epi[INVESTIGATOR_518692]. Three of the sites will receive no micropatch treatment but will be covered with occlusive material. Three of the sites will serve as
controls and will receive no treatment and they will remain uncovered. Study procedures on this first day (Day 0) will require approximately 2 - 3
hours. Hair may be clipped (but not shaved) at the identified sites prior to start of the study procedures, if necessary . 
 
The following procedure will be used to apply the micropatch for each subject: 
The micropatch will be placed perpendicularly to the skin surface and the microneedles will be inserted by [CONTACT_518713] (the study team member will apply this gentle pressure with their thumb or use of a hand-held applicator). The pressure will be
applied for approximately [ADDRESS_672891] study day . 
The following procedure will be used to make the baseline and all following measurements of the 9 identified sites: 
Several quick measurements will be made at each site, using noninvasive probes. 
a. Transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] (TEWL) will be measured at each site by [CONTACT_1299] a small probe on the surface of the skin for approximately 1 - 3
minutes at each site. This measurement will not be repeated after Day 0 procedures. 
b. The hydration level of the skin will be measured at each site by [CONTACT_1299] a corneometer probe lightly on the skin; each measurement takes less
than 1 minute at each site. 
c. The redness and color of the skin will be measured at each site by [CONTACT_1299] a colorimetry probe on skin for less than 1 minute at each site. 
 d. Impedance will be measured using an impedance meter with a series of electrodes. This process takes approximately 2 minutes at each site. 
Subjects will be asked to return to the CRU at 24 hour intervals for 4 days (24, 48, 72, and 96 hours) after microneedle insertion. At each of these
return visits the baseline measurements will be repeated (excluding TEWL measurements). Occlusive coverings will be removed before
measurements are taken, and fresh material will be applied afterwards. Each visit will last approximately 1 1/[ADDRESS_672892] is having any redness or skin irritation at the site of any of the treatments. There is no long-term follow up necessary . The
overall time commitment for the subjects is approximately 1 1 - 14 hours with 5 study days (6 if consent and Day 0 procedures do not occur on
same day) over [ADDRESS_672893] to follow-up?
No - those lost to followup will not be recontact[CONTACT_39289].E.9 Will subjects be provided any compensation for participating in this study?

VIII. Risks
VIII.1 What are the risks to subjects including
 - emotional or psychological
 - financial
 - legal or social
 - physical?
In general, microneedle treatments are well tolerated. However , the skin could become irritated from the microneedle insertion or from the
adhesives (either on the micropatches used to apply the microneedles and make measurements, or the medical tape used to hold the occlusive
material in place). There may be mild discomfort, itching, redness, bruising, or hyper -/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_518693]. Loss of confidentiality is also a risk.
VIII.[ADDRESS_672896] you done to minimize the risks?
If applicable to this study ALSO include:
How you (members of your research team at Iowa) will monitor the safety of individual subjects.
Include a description of the availability of medical or psychological resources that subjects might require as a consequence of
participating in this research and how referral will occur if necessary (e.g. availability of emergency medical care, psychological
counseling, etc.)
During the consent process the subjects will be counseled about the micropatch. The skin will be cleansed thoroughly with alcohol wipes prior to
applying the micropatch (cleaning technique similar to that used for insertion of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_518694]). They will also be counseled about
the possibility of local skin irritation and redness from the adhesive tape. Subjects will be closely observed during the measurements and during
treatment with the micropatch; emer gency facilities and staf f will be available if necessary . Subjects will be instructed to contact a member of the
study team if problems arise at any time during their participation in the study (all pertinent contact [CONTACT_509577]).
Approximately [ADDRESS_672897] an individual or committee review combined data from all subjects on a periodic basis (such as summary or
aggregate safety and/or ef ficacy data)?
No
IX. Benefits
IX.[ADDRESS_672898] (do not include compensation or hypothesized results)?
There are no direct benefits to the subjects.
IX.[ADDRESS_672899]?
As microneedles have now been commercialized with the introduction of the Fluzone Intradermal vaccine in [ADDRESS_672900] will help us to optimize drug delivery systems that are non-invasive and can be used in multiple patient populations.
X. Privacy & Confidentiality
X.[ADDRESS_672901] the privacy  interests of the subjects?

XI. Data Analysis
XI.[ADDRESS_672902] will serve as their own control, and paired t-tests will determine
differences in TEWL (water loss measurements) from baseline to post-microneedle insertion (this is used to determine if the microneedles
adequately breached the skin barrier). For the colorimetry and hydration measurements, each daily measurement will be compared to its baseline at
that site using paired t-tests. The percent change in TEWL measurements from baseline to post-microneedle application will be calculated and
compared between groups. 
 
The impedance data for this study will be analyzed using similar methods as our previous study . The Z-pores impedance value will be calculated,
and Student’ s t-tests will be used to ensure that micropores where adequately created (demonstrated by a significant decrease in impedance from
baseline). Next, Z-pores will be calculated from impedance measurements taken over several hours to days following microneedle treatment
(depending on the subject group), and then converted to admittance (admittance is the inverse of impedance). The admittance can demonstrate how
“open” the micropores are in a very intuitive manner . If a micropore has a maximum admittance, then the micropore is 100% open. Using this
information, we will plot admittance vs. time and calculate a rate constant of micropore admittance (k). The rate constant is then used to calculate
the half-life of micropore closure, which thus describes a rate of closure in units of time.
XI.[ADDRESS_672903] number was based
on what is feasible for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_518697] a power analysis later . We plan to enroll subjects into 2 groups, determined
by [CONTACT_518714]. Group 1: BMI <29.9; Group 2: BMI >30. W ithin each group there will be 80 subjects, divided as follows: 10 African American or
Black, 10 Hispanic/Latino, 10 Caucasian/White, 20 Asian, and 10 American Indian/Alaskan Native, 10 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander , 10
bi-/multiracial. The Asian group contains more individuals because this racial/ethnic category encompasses individuals from a very lar ge
geographic area (China, Japan, India, Thailand, Korea, etc.) and therefore more subjects may be necessary to see significant trends. W e have
selected [ADDRESS_672904] them in the future for your own research projects?

Clinical and Non-Clinical: CLIN- INDEX-3M-SPON-US-05-014050If any of these irritation parameters appear to be highly exacerbated, more than normally associated with use conditions in this type of population, the event will be recorded as an adverse event.  This can only be determined by [CONTACT_093].
8.[ADDRESS_325175].
For this study, any non-device adverse events (e.g. common cold, falls, systemic 
illnesses, etc.) will not be recorded.   All device-related and serious adverse events will need 
to be reported to the sponsor.
Note: The Federal Privacy Rule (HIPAA) specifically permits the use and disclosure of 
protected health information “without written authorization of the individual” when used for public health activities such as reporting adverse events, tracking FDA-related products, enabling recalls, repairs, replacements, lookbacks, or conducting post-market surveillance [45 CFR 164.512].  This use and disclosure is subject to the minimum necessary standard, i.e. “the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended use, disclosure, or request” [45 CFR 164.502(b)(1)].
Definitions:
!Adverse event
(AE) means any undesirable clinical occurrence in a subject whether or 
not it is considered to be device related.
!Device-related adverse event (i.e. adverse device effect) is an AE considered by [CONTACT_267258] a reasonable likelihood of being associated with the 
investigational device.
!Serious adverse device effect is a device effect that has a serious adverse effect on 
health or safety causing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266], or is life threatening or causes death.
!Unanticipated adverse device effect
is any serious adverse device effect on health or 
safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to rights, safety and welfare of subjects.
Recording and Reporting
The Investigator records each material-related adverse event on an Adverse Event CRF. 
Documentation includes the description, severity, seriousness, date of onset and resolution, relationship to the investigational material, action taken and outcome.
The Investigator must promptly report an adverse device effect to the 3M study monitor.  If the 
adverse device effect is also considered by [CONTACT_239544]/or unanticipated, the Investigator must report it to the IRB as soon as possible and within IRB requirements.

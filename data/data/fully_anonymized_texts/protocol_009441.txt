 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
 
Coronary artery disease (C AD) remains a leading cause of death in most countries 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_723965], prompt coronary  
revascularization, and dual antiplatelet therapy . Reducing levels of low -density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol is a cornerstone of the prevention of cardiovascular disease  (1). Statins 
are highly efficacious in lowering LDL cholesterol. However, many patients, especially 
those with very high initial LDL c holesterol levels and those who have unacceptable side 
effects with high -dose statins, do not reach recommended target levels of LDL cholesterol 
(2,3). The risk of recurrent cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome ( ACS) 
or in chronic coronar y heart disease remains related to LDL -C levels  among statin -treated 
patients  (4-6). These observations suggest that there is a considerable unmet medical 
need for additional, more effective therapeutic options with acceptable side -effect profiles .  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin  kexin type 9 (PCSK9) impairs  LDL receptor recycling to 
the hepat ic surface  which leads to reduce d removal of LDL particles from the circulation  
(7). Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 lower LDL -C levels when administered alone 
or in combination with statins and have shown potential as an alternative therapy for 
patients who experience intolerable adverse effects during statin therapy (8-10). Inhibition 
of PCSK9 with evolocumab on a background of statin therapy lowered  LDL cholesterol 
levels by 59% from baseline level to 30 mg per deciliter and reduced the risk of 
cardiovascular events in a large randomized FOURIER  trial including  patients with 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  on statin therapy  (11). In the GLAGOV trial ,

 addition of evolocumab in patients treated with moderate or high intensity statin therapy 
resulted in greater decrease in percent atheroma volume (PAV) assessed by 
[CONTACT_645666] (IVUS) during 18 month of therapy  (12), while t here was no 
plaque regression observed in patients treated with statin s alone. Reduction in the 
atherosclerotic disease burden , atheroma (PAV) was observed in 67% of the evolocumab 
and 47% of the placebo group  regardless of baseline LDL -C levels . 
One-third of the patients treated with evolocumab and almost half of statin -treated 
patients  from the GLAGOV trial did not demonstrate  plaque volume reduction despi[INVESTIGATOR_723966] a subgroup of patients , and these patients  might  require  different 
treatment approach . Another possibility is that beneficial changes in lesion morphology 
were not captured in the study due to inherent limitations of IVUS . Optical coherence 
tomography (OCT ) provides high -resolution  (10-20 µm) in vivo images of plaque 
morphology  and is the only currently available intravascular imaging modality capable of 
the assessment of the fibrous cap thickness in vivo  (13,14). The presence of a thin fibrous 
cap overlying a large necrotic core is the hallmark of high -risk vulnerable plaques  (14,15). 
While intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) lacks the spatial resolution to accurately access 
the changes in fibrous cap thickness  (FCT) , OCT’s superior image resolution allows the 
accurate detection of thin cap fibroatheroma  (TCFA)  and estimate the effect of various  
lipid-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723967] (16-18). The aim of the ongoing HUYGENS study is to 
evaluate the effect of evolocumab combined with  maximally tolerated statin therapy on

Near -infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)  detect s the lipid (cholesterol) content of 
atherosclerotic plaques  by [CONTACT_723975] “chemogram”  and calculating  lipid core 
burden index (LCBI) characterizing the amount of lipid on a 0 to 1000 scale.  Large  lipid-
core plaques (LCP) detected by [CONTACT_723976] a signature [CONTACT_723988] a high risk of periprocedural MI (19,20). 
Results of YELLOW I and II . In a series of YELLOW trials , we investigated the effect of 
statins on high -risk lipid-rich coronary plaques using intravascular imaging in patients with 
stable CAD . The aim of our first YELLOW (Reduction in Coronary Yellow Plaque, Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_723968]) trial was to explore  whether 
these benefits are attributable to reduction in plaque lipid content in obstructive coronary 
lesions  (21). In the study, we randomized 87 patients with multivessel CAD  to intensive 
(rosuvastatin 40 mg daily) or standard -of-care lipid -lowering therapy. Patients underwent 
PCI for the culprit lesion at the baseline, while obstructive nontarget lesion (NTL) was 
treated at the stage d procedure, follow -up. The inclusion criterion for the trial was FFR 
less or equal 0.8. NTLs were evaluated at baseline and after 7 weeks of therapy with 
NIRS and IVUS. The primary endpoint was the change in lipid -core burden index at the 
4-mm maximal seg ment ( maxLCBI4mm ). Upon follow -up, median reduction in 
maxLCBI4mm was significantly greater in the intensive versus standard group suggesting 
that short -term intensive statin therapy may reduce lipid content in obstructive lesions.

 In our subsequent YELLO W II study, all patients with obstructive NTL received high -dose 
statin therapy for 8 -12 weeks  (22). The aim of the study was to  characterize  the 
relationship between the ch anges in plaque morphology  assessed by [CONTACT_160087]/IVUS and 
OCT, HDL functionality  and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell s 
(PBMC)  using microarray  analysis . At the follow -up, we observed a significant increase 
in fibrous cap thickness  (FCT)  in the study lesion , enhancement of cholesterol efflux 
capacity ( CEC ) and significant perturbations of PBMC transcriptome in patients with 
stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with 40 mg rosuvastatin for 8 -12 weeks . As 
a result, the prevalence of TCF A reduced from 20 to 7% (P=0.003) and there  was a 
significant  independent association between the thickening of the fibrous cap  and 
improved CEC independent of lipid lowering and CRP reduction.  In addition , we observed 
significant transcriptomic perturbati ons in genes related to cholesterol synthesis, 
regulation of fatty acid unsaturation, cellular cholesterol uptake, efflux and inflammation 
suggesting that several independent molecular mechanisms might be responsible for the 
beneficial effects of statin on  plaque morphology . The unique translational combination 
of multi -modality  intravascular  imaging with clinically relevant cellular biology and 
comprehensive transcriptomics represents a powerful approach to assessing  the effects 
and mechanisms of the efficacy of different lipid-lowering therap ies for stabilizing 
atherosclerotic plaques.   
With OCT imaging, we observed an increase  in FCT after intensive statin therapy  only in 
a subset of the study patients . Traditionally, response to statins is measured by [CONTACT_723977][INVESTIGATOR_805], however, these changes do  not predict the beneficial changes

machine learning models (23). One of the model used 18 genes and was able identify 
statin responders with  an accuracy of 95.7%, sensitivity of 94.3% and specificity of 97.1%.   
Hypothesis. In the YELLOW III study, we hypothesize that  LDL-C lowering with 
evolocumab [ADDRESS_988466] and reduction of plaque lipid content assessed by [CONTACT_723978] (PCI) . In 
addition, we hypothesize that there is an association between the changes in patient’s 
plaque characteristics and PBMC gene expression  and lipid metabolites at the baseline , 
which would allow us to develop a predictive model for detecting subjects that 
demonstrate the greatest response regarding plaque morphology  to PCSK9 inhibition 
therapy.  YELLOW III will provide an additional contribution to the ongoing HYUGENS 
study due to its unique design  combining intravascular imaging and transcriptomic based 
machine learning approach , which will a llow to u ncover molecular mechanisms 
responsible for the beneficial  changes in atherosclerotic lesions of patients treated with 
evolocu mab.

morphology using  intravascular imaging , NIRS/IVUS and OCT , and PBMC gene 
expression analysis  in patients with stable CAD on maximally tolerated statin therapy .  
Primary endpoints . The primary end -point s are the changes from baseline to follow -up 
(follow -up value minus baseline  value) in (1) the minimal FCT assessed by [CONTACT_723979] (2) 
NIRS maxLCBI4mm  after 26 weeks of evolocumab . 
Secondary endpoints . The secondary endpoints are the changes in (1) the m aximal lipid 
arc, lipid length, lipid volume index, macrophage accumulation and calcification by [CONTACT_63396] ; 
(2) PAV and TAV defined by [CONTACT_723980] (3) PBMC gene expression .  In recognition of the 
role of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_723969], we will perform lipi[INVESTIGATOR_723970]. Measuring lipid metabolites (and their effectors) might directly lead to the 
identificati on pathways of lipid action or lipid metabolism in patients receiving treatment. 
We will also perform Mass Cytometry (CyTOF) of PBMC  to characterize the immune 
profile and responses  in patients receiving a combination of evolocumab plus statin with 
an eye on identifying biomarkers for detecting and/or predicting favorable changes in 
plaque morphology as a result of PCSK9 inhibition therapy. Other parameters including 
the levels of CRP , resistin, adiponectin, perilipin  and Lp(a) will also be measured for the 
same purpose.

Summary of Changes from Previous Version: 
Affected 
Section(s) Summary of Revisions Made Rationale 
Sections 1.1, 
1.3, 4.1, 4.4, 
and 9.3  The at-home testing through the public 
health intervention will be 3 times a week 
for 4 weeks, instead of testing twice a 
week for 5 weeks.  More frequent testing is better suited to 
diagnosing asymptomatic/pre-
symptomatic disease and prevent 
spread. 
Section 1.3 Questionnaires/surveys will be 
administered only on baseline and weeks 
1, 3, 5, 13, and 21. The Schedule of Events 
table has been updated to reflect these 
timepoints.    To reduce participant burden, 
questionnaires/surveys will only be 
administered on baseline and weeks, 1, 
3, 5, 13, 21.  
Section 1.3  The survey on knowledge of prevention 
approaches will be administered on weeks 
5 and 21 instead of weeks 13 and 21. Administering this questionnaire at 
week 5 and week 21 allows for a better 
perceptive to see how the participant
knowledge has changed over time.  
Section 1.3 The survey on feasibility of at-home testing 
has been removed from week 21. It will 
only be administered at week 5. To reduce participant burden, this 
survey will only be asked once after the 
testing phase. 
Section 1.3 Survey questions on Beliefs were added to 
the protocol for weeks 1, 5, and 21.  No new questions were added. The 
survey questions on Belief were already 
included in the questionnaire. It has now 
been specified as a new category of 
questions within the protocol.  
Section 1.3 Anthropometrics (weight) was added as a 
measure to be taken at Baseline and week 
5. Anthropometrics (height) was added as 
a measure to be taken at Baseline.  Socio-Demographic Data was already 
planned at Screening and Enrollment 
(now called Baseline). For additional 
clarity, anthropometrics have now been 
specified at Baseline. Height will be 
taken at Baseline. Since weight 
fluctuates, it will be taken at Baseline 
and week 5.

[ADDRESS_1099735]/self-test SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_1099736]. This sub-study will provide participant 
level behavioral information essential to understanding the relationship between large scale at-home 
testing and community transmission during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and relevant for implementation 
of public health interventions in future pandemics.      
 2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
In the US, > [ADDRESS_1099737] been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and >400,[ADDRESS_1099738] at-home testing in asymptomatic 
populations as part of a broader mitigation strategy that includes protective measures (masking, social 
distancing, increased hygiene) and contact-tracing and isolation. With 50% or more of infections 
resulting from pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission, at-home testing may offer an effective 
option for screening and for breaking chains of transmission. Rapid antigen tests are relatively 
inexpensive and therefore can be used frequently for detecting infected individuals who are 
asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and without known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-21. However, 
even with antigen tests, the implementation of community level testing will be challenging, with an 
impact that is still to be determined2.

 8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 
 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The questionnaires/surveys will assess patient-report outcomes related to social behaviors, healthcare 
utilization, knowledge of SARS CoV-2 prevention approaches, and the feasibility of at-home self-
administered testing. Adherence to the at-home testing and questionnaire/survey schedule will also be 
assessed.  
 
8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS 
 
The healthcare utilization questionnaire will be routinely administered during the treatment and follow-
up phase, and it will ask about any emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and ICU admission 
related to SARS COV-2 evaluation or treatment.

of disease. To illustrate this, suppose the proportion of participants who adhere to social distancing is 
50%. In that case, a sample size of 5,000 participants will be sufficient at a confidence level of 95% to 
estimate the prevalence with a margin of error of 1.5%. Additional examples of estimate precision at 
varying sample sizes are provided below. Overall, even with a sample size of 1000 participants and for 
an endpoint with a 50% proportion, there will be a 95% chance that the real value of this proportion is 
within 3.1% of the observed value.

Point estimates with 95% confidence intervals will be reported.  The analysis will be done for applicable 
study populations as described above, and stratified by [CONTACT_797231] (e.g., age, 
gender). There will be a comparison of the proportion of participants that report adhering to social 
distancing guidelines after positive vs. negative test result.  
 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
The first secondary objective is to assess change in self-reported behaviors before and 
following SARS CoV-[ADDRESS_1099758]

Using PhenX and RADx-Up CDE measures, the questionnaires/surveys will collect data on demographic 
characteristics, medical history and health status, SARS-CoV-2 testing and symptoms, social interactions, 
knowledge of prevention strategies, and infection risk, and attitudes towards vaccines. All data capture 
will be electronic for participants who choose to participate using the MyDataHelps app. The app

Patients who require adjuvant radiation therapy postoperatively will be referred to radiation  
oncologists at the DFCI. If the patient chooses to pursue their radiation treatment with DFCI  
clinicians (patients are offered a choice as to where to complete their radiation treatment), then  
the radiation oncologist will be provided with all imaging, including supi[INVESTIGATOR_890995] -surgery for treatment planning purposes. These images will be utilized for  
planning of the radiation treatment plan. Following com pletion of the initial radiation  
treatment plan, the attending treating radiation oncologists will be asked to complete a brief  
survey to assess their perceived usefulness of the supi[INVESTIGATOR_890996].  17

undergoing upfront surgery or neoadjuvant therapy (NAT).  
 
We hypothesize that breast MRI with supi[INVESTIGATOR_890997] -based 
characteristics for (1) radiological procedures (2) surgical operations and (3) adjuvant radiation 
delivery, and further hypothesize that these images will allow for superior characterization and 
localization of breast lesions as compared to traditional imaging studies (mammography, 
ultrasound, prone MRI). This will be measured by a combinatio n of qualitative (clinician surveys 
of supi[INVESTIGATOR_890998]/delivery) and quantitative measures (correlation in residual tumor size estimation with 
the gold standard method, success rate o f US-guided lesion identification and/or biopsy 
performed with supi[INVESTIGATOR_890999], and rate of re -excisions for breast conserving surgical 
operations when supi[INVESTIGATOR_891000]).  
 
More specifically, we hypothesize that:  
(1) Supi[INVESTIGATOR_891001] w ill provide an accurate assessment of residual breast tumor  size 
(2) Supi[INVESTIGATOR_891002] -operative pathology (gold  standard).  
(3) Supi[INVESTIGATOR_891003] i dentify suspected satellite lesions and/or additional 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_891004]. Tissue sampling under 
sonographic -guidance is more cost effective and patient centric for the patient compared to 
biopsy under MRI -guidan ce; therefore, the correlation of MRI findings with ultrasound  findings 
is an important patient -centered  endpoint.  
(4) Supi[INVESTIGATOR_891005]’s location within the 
breast in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], which will translate into reduced re -excision rates associated  with 
this procedure.

obtain a prone contrast -enhanced MRI and investigational supi[INVESTIGATOR_891007] -enhanced MRI 
sequence pre -NAT; however if a patient  presents with an outside pre NAT MRI this will not be 
repeated. The tumor’s position on all imaging modalities will be registered, and tumor location

the need for reoperation, will be recorded, and these measures (using supi[INVESTIGATOR_891013]) will 
be compared to historical data to determine the impact of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891014].  
 
Patients requiring postoperative radiation therapy will be referred to rad iation oncology post -

1.2 Primary Objectives  
 
The primary objectives are:  
 
1) Determine the Pearson correlation between pre -operative prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891017].  
2) To compare the Pearson correlation between pre -surgical standard imaging (mammography, 
ultrasound, prone MRI) and the gold standard of pathologic evaluation of the surgical specimen 
and the Pearson correlation between pre -surgical  supi[INVESTIGATOR_891018]. 
 
3) To explore the potential changes occurring in tumor -associated properties/dimensions 
between the prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891019] -surgical supi[INVESTIGATOR_891020]. Tumor location will be 
assessed in terms of distance from nipple, chest wall, and skin. Tumor geometry will be assessed 
on multiple properties including volume , surface area, diameter, spherocity, and compactness. 
Patients with both pre -NAT and pre -surgical MRI will also be evaluated for the pre -NAT 
prone/supi[INVESTIGATOR_891021] -surgical prone/supi[INVESTIGATOR_891022].

quantitative measures (success rate of second -look ultrasound lesion localizations and procedures 
utilizing supi[INVESTIGATOR_890999] ). Procedures include lesion biopsy and pre -surgical lesion 
localization performed by [CONTACT_271486].  
2. To explore the perceived benefit of pre -surgical supi[INVESTIGATOR_891025] a survey of surgeons performing BC S in our study patient  population.  
3. To explore the effect of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891026] -excisions or having a pathologic positive margins when  supi[INVESTIGATOR_891027].  
4. To explore the perceived benefit of pre -surgical supi[INVESTIGATOR_891028] a survey of radiation oncologists

2. BACKGROUND  
2.[ADDRESS_1247438] common cancer in 
the world [1]. Over 249,[ADDRESS_1247439] -cancer specific morality rates predicted to exceed 40,000 
[2]. Treatment for breast cancer has evolved in recent decades following an improved 
understanding of the biology of the disease, and contemporary breast cancer c are now mandates 
a multidisciplinary, multimodal approach for optimal outcomes. Surgery, radiation, and systemic 
therapy (including endocrine, biologic, and chemotherapeutic agents) are key modalities utilized 
in the ongoing treatment algorithm for breast cancer patients. For early stage disease, breast 
conservation therapy or ‘BCT’ (consisting of lumpectomy or ‘breast conserving surgery’ (BCS) 
followed by [CONTACT_447] -operative radiation therapy) has become a mainstay of treatment following 
demonstration of its eq uivalence to mastectomy in terms of long term survival in at least six 
modern prospective randomized trials  [3-8]. 
 
BCT has enabled less invasive surgical treatment for breast cancer without compromising 
survival, however it currently is limited in its application to well -selected candidates. Although 
size is not an absolute contraindication to BCT, a very large tumor size relative to breast volume 
is considered a relative contraindication [9]. MRI is routinely utilized to determine extent of 
disease at diagnosis and to determine candidacy for upfront surgery in patients who are desirous 
of BCT. For women with large and locally advanced breast cancers, breast conserving surgery 
only became a surgical option following the inclusion of neoadjuvant therapy ( NAT) into 
contemporary cancer treatment algorithms. NAT has demonstrated efficacy in shrinking breast 
tumors preoperatively, enabling some patients to become BCT candidates who otherwise would 
not have qualified [10 -14]. Numerous studies have established e quivalence of BCT after NAT 
compared to BCT with post -surgical systemic adjuvant therapy with respect to both survival and 
local recurrence rates [13, 15 -17]. By [CONTACT_891083], over 50% of patients with 
certain breast cancer subtypes (includ ing triple negative and HER2+) treated with NAT are 
expected to achieve a pathological complete response (pCR) following NAT administration, 
which is associated with improved long -term prognosis [18, 19].  
 
 
In the upfront surgery setting, the use of Breast  MRI has been shown to compliment traditional

imaging modalities (MMG/US) for determining extent of disease; however there remains a 
problem with over -estimation of lesion size. This combined with the frequency of identification 
of second le sions which require biopsy (and are often not visible on MMG/US) has been shown 
to correlate with increased use of mastectomy, with patients often deferring biopsy altogether. 
Whether or not supi[INVESTIGATOR_891029].  
 
In the NAT setting, breast MRI has demonstrated higher accuracy over physical examination, 
mammography, and tar geted breast ultrasound in the evaluation of tumor response to NAT and 
prediction of amount of residual disease. [12, 20 -28]. The correlation of residual tumor size 
following NAT and histopathology in patients who underwent prone MRI before BCS has been 
reported to be approximately r=0.7 (Bhattacharyya et al (r=0.71), Rosen et al (r=0.75), 
Martincich et al (r=0.72), Segara et al (r=0.75)[12, 27 -29]. For patients who require NAT for 
downstaging to BCT, repeating the MRI after NAT (pre -surgery) is standard fo r surgical 
treatment planning. In practice, it is uncommon to exclusively rely on a single imaging modality 
for breast cancer evaluation, and newly diagnosed breast cancer patients routinely have 
diagnostic mammography and ultrasound imaging as well. In pa tients undergoing NAT, these 
images are also repeated after NAT (pre -surgery) for surgical treatment planning.  
 
One of the challenges inherent with the current breast MRI design is that the images are obtained 
with the patient in the prone position. Tumors  are displayed to both radiologists and surgeons in 
relation to their position in the prone breast, however both ultrasound and surgery are performed 
on the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891030]. The changes in breast position - especially for patients with large or pliable 
breast s- can significantly displace breast tumors, making it difficult for radiologists to correlate 
MRI and sonographic findings, and for surgeons to localize tumors intraoperatively[33, 34].  
 
Limitations of other modalities are numerous. For example, NAT can i nduce unpredictable 
fibrous changes that can reduce the reliability of clinical examination. Certain breast cancer 
subtypes, such as lobular carcinoma for example, are difficult to visualize mammographically 
and can increase in firmness after NAT, causing an initially occult lesion to become more 
clinically palpable with treatment[30]. Assessment of tumor size on exam and with 
mammography can be undermined by [CONTACT_891084], 
especially in the setting of dense brea st tissue [25, 26, 31]. Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_891031], become coarser, or occasionally increase on 
mammograms after NAT. Peintinger et al demonstrated that a combination of mammogram and 
ultrasound could provide mo derate agreement in predicting residual tumor size after NAT; 
however, the correlation and agreement with pathologic residual tumor size was underestimated 
for lobular carcinoma and overestimated for poorly differentiated tumors [32]. Yeh et al also 
demons trated similar findings when comparing agreement regarding the rate of response 
between clinical examination, mammography, sonography, and MRI with pathology as the 
reference standard, with agreement rates of 19%, 26%, 35%, and 71%, respectively [26].  
Although MRI was noted to be the superior modality in this study, it was not without its own 
limitations; MRI was felt to both underestimate and overestimate residual tumor measurements, 
leaving clinicians with an ongoing need for an improved way to monitor th e response to and the 
disease remaining after NAT regimens.

adjuvant chemotherapy, which can delay radiation treatment and contribute to cavity contraction 
making cavity identification more challenging [35, 36]. Multiple studies have demonstrated 
limitations in single -modalit y treatment planning with significant inter -observer variability in 
delineation of tumor cavities, and multi -modality imaging using a combination of MRI and CT 
has been suggested as a way of improving target volume definition in patients with difficult to 
visualize cavities [35, 37 -39]. Jacobson et al, for example, found that acquisition of a non - 
contrast supi[INVESTIGATOR_891032] -lumpectomy breast, and suggested that the com bination of 
images could improve delineation of target cavities [35]. Nevertheless, debate remains about the 
ultimate utility of MRI for breast treatment radiation planning, and additional studies evaluating 
the potential benefits are warranted [39 -42]. 
 
A secondary objective of a Phase I Clinical Trial we recently completed at our institution 
evaluating the feasibility of intraoperative breast MRI was to better characterize the positional 
change that occurs between the prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891033] [30, 33, 34]. Our results, 
presented in [ADDRESS_1247441] changes from the prone to the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547],  with an average tumor displacement of  over 
6cm [43, 44]. Additionally, we found substantial tumor deformation occurring between 
positions, with an average change in the measured volume of 23.8%, surface area of 6.5%, 
compactness of 16.2% and maximum 3D di ameter of 7.1% (mean change from prone to supi[INVESTIGATOR_891034] (as a percentage of the prone metrics) [34, 43]. This was unanticipated, as breast cancers 
have been shown to be more stiff than surrounding breast parenchyma (Krouskop et al showed 
stiffness of norm al fat, normal glandular tissue, and invasive ductal carcinomas to be 20 kPa, 57 
kPa, and 490 kPa, respectively) and thus deformation was suspected to be negligible [43,  45]. 
These deformations and displacements were visually represented on ‘composite’ MRI  images, 
which simultaneously displayed a tumor’s location/shape using “3D tumor models” in both the 
prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (tumors were registered, and prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891035]), 
enabling surgeons and radiologists alike to visually identify e ach tumor’s location/size/shape in 
both orientations. Briefly, this was achieved by [CONTACT_891085] - 
contrast MRI series on thoracic cavities using the Mutual Information criterion, following initial 
alignment of the pulmonar y veins [46 -48]. 3D tumor models were then created in 3D Slicer by 
[CONTACT_891086][INVESTIGATOR_891036] -automatic threshold -based 
algorithms on the subtracted images computed from the first post - and pre -contrast volumes, 
which wer e then further registered using Iterative Closest Point registration [48]. These tumor 
models, and their associated prone and MRI scans, were overlaid to generate the composite 
models presented to surgeons prior to surgery. Anecdotally, we found that these  composite 
images were viewed as useful by [CONTACT_891087], in assisting with tumor 
localization and with surgical planning. Based on these results, our institution adopted a policy

persists.[49 -55] Further although post NAT is associated with the highest correlation between 
residual tumor size and pathologic size; it’s use in this setting has also not been de monstrated to 
improve BCT outcomes. This study will evaluate the role of obtaining supi[INVESTIGATOR_891037]. We 
hypothesize that having supi[INVESTIGATOR_891038] s equences available for review by

tumors in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891039], 2) influence outcomes

suggested on investigational MRI, additional imaging evaluation wit h mammography and/or 
ultrasound may be performed (refer to Section 5.2.1 below). In cases in which additional 
imaging evaluation with/without biopsy is required following MRI exams, attending breast 
radiologists will complete a short survey on their percei ved usefulness of the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891040]/or lesion biopsy. Histopathology will be correlated to radiographic lesion 
findings in cases in which biopsy are performed.  
 
Patients deemed candidates for BCS with upfront surgery will proceed to surgery using the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_891041]. Patients who will be receiving NAT per 
their clinical treating team. Post NAT (pre -surgical) imaging will be o btained at the completion 
of NAT (refer to Section 5.2.2). These imaging studies will then be reviewed by [CONTACT_891089], and will be utilized for surgical planning. Surgery will be either  standard 
BCT or mastectomy (with appropriate nodal intervention including sentinel lymph node biopsy 
and/or axillary dissection), as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_176344]. No investigational or 
commercial agents, or devices will be used or administered during the operation with the intent 
to tre at the participants’ breast cancer. When BCT is performed, standard cavity shave margins 
will be taken (as per institutional guidelines). At the conclusion of the operation, the surgical 
specimen will be sent for histopathology. If the final pathology indi cates that there are positive 
margins amendable to resection, the patient will be scheduled to undergo re -excision and/or 
mastectomy in the standard operating room. At the discretion of the treating surgeon, additional 
re-excisions may be performed for clo se margins not meeting the definition of a true positive 
margin. Following completion of each BCT operation, the attending surgeon will be asked to 
complete a brief survey to assess their perceived usefulness of the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891042]/les ion localization.

NCI Protocol #: 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16 -277 Protocol 
Version Date: 11/08 /[ADDRESS_1247449] cancer deemed eligible for this study (refer to 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, Section 3) will be identified during surgical consultation at a 
participating institution. A signed, written consent form will be obtained befo re any study - 
specific assessments are initiated. Each participant will undergo a history and physical 
examination, and will be required to have a diagnostic mammogram with or without ultrasound 
reviewed at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH) or Dana Farber  Cancer Institute (DFCI). 
Patients who are eligible and give written consent to participate will then be scheduled to receive 
a prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891007] -enhanced MRI. Patients who have already had a breast MRI at an 
outside institution, for their present cancer, and who will receive NAT, will not be required to 
undergo an additional pre -NAT MRI. All patients (upfront surgery and NAT patients) will be 
required to have a pre -surgical prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_25342]. Prone MRI will consist of the standard 
imaging sequen ces as identified by [CONTACT_891090]’s breast(s) in the 
prone position and identify the extent of the disease. An FDA -approved gadolinium -based MRI 
contrast agent, as per standard of care, will be administered in order to acqu ire images that will 
be used to identify the lesion. The dosage will be consistent with institutional safety guidelines. 
See Section [ADDRESS_1247450] MRI VIBE (volumetric int erpolated breath -hold examination) 
sequence of the breast with the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891043]. Prior to obtaining 
this MRI, a second dose of gadolinium MRI contrast agent may be given at the discretion of the 
radiologist, with dose cal culated by [CONTACT_891091], to ensure adequacy of 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_65031]. The supi[INVESTIGATOR_605845] -contrast sequences will be used to estimate the tumor 
position with respect to fixed landmarks such as the nipple, skin and chest wall. If MRI ide ntifies 
additional disease not initially seen on other imaging exams, repeat ultrasound and/or 
mammogram with additional views will be performed (‘second look’ exams) to attempt to 
identify these lesions on an additional imaging modality. Biopsy of newly i dentified suspi[INVESTIGATOR_891047], ultrasound, or stereotactic guidance at the discretion of the 
treatment team, and histopathologic -radiographic correlation will be performed.

quality is deemed unacceptable for interpretation, the image will not be u tilized in residual tumor 
calculations. If rCR has not occurred, estimated sizes and volumes of the remnant tumor will be 
made using each imaging modality by [CONTACT_891092]. If 
additional disease is uncovered at th is time, it will also be recorded. Using the information 
obtained from the totality of imaging studies, the surgeon will determine whether or not the 
patient is eligible to proceed with BCT or mastectomy.

sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or axillary dissection), as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_891093]. Informed consent as per institutional standards will 
be obtained from the patient prior to surgery and all risks and benefits of surgical intervention 
and alternative options (no surgery) will be reviewed with the patient. When BCT is performed, 
standard cavity shave margins will be taken (as per institutional guidelines). At the conclusion of 
the operation, the surgical specimen will be sent for histopathology. Following completion of 
each BCT operation, the attending surgeon will be asked to complete a brief survey to assess 
their perceived usefulness of the s upi[INVESTIGATOR_891049]/lesion localization.  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1247453]-Surgery: Histopathogy  Assessment  
Lymph node specimens (if taken during surgery) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_891094] (lumpectomy or mastectomy) at the conclusion of surgery. If the 
final pathology indicates that there are positive margins amendable to resection, the patient will 
be scheduled to undergo re -excision and/or mastectomy in the standard operating room. At the 
discretion of the treating surgeon , additional re -excisions may be performed for close margins 
not meeting the definition of a true positive margin.

Patients who require adjuvant radiation therapy postoperatively will be referred to radiation 
oncologists at the DFCI. If the patient chooses to pursue their radiation treatment with DFCI 
clinicians (patients are offered a choice as to where to complete their radiation treatment), then 
the radiation oncologist will be provided with all im aging, including supi[INVESTIGATOR_891050] -surgery for treatment planning purposes. These images will be utilized for planning 
of the radiation treatment plan. Following completion of the initial radiation treatment plan, the 
attending treating radiat ion oncologists will be asked to complete a brief survey to assess their 
perceived usefulness of the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891051].

6. EXPECTED TOXICITIES , ADVERSE EVENTS , AND  DOSING DELAYS /DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial. There are no 
interventional agents (drugs or devices) being inves tigated as part of this protocol, and therefore 
there are no associated adverse events such as toxicities that would commonly be anticipated in 
these scenarios. There are also therefore are no protocol -specific dose delays or modifications 
unique to this s tudy to report.  
 
This protocol will utilize gadolinium contrast -enhanced MRI imaging, which is a standard FDA - 
approved imaging agent, and expected toxicities are therefore included and described here. The 
use of gadolinium contrast has been associated wit h relatively minimal risk compared to other 
contrast agents; however, some contrast -related reactions have been identified [56, 57]. IV - 
administered gadolinium contrast has been associated with renal failure and allergic reactions.  
Both of these events ar e identified as potential adverse events, and patients will be informed of 
the risk of such adverse events. Patients that have a known contrast allergy will be excluded from 
participating in this study. There is approximately 0.07% risk of an allergic reac tion with IV 
contrast according to a retrospective review of 78,[ADDRESS_1247457] rate of 0.0404% 
among 158,439 administrations, within the 0.0003 -1.2% rang e reported in other studies [56, 57]. 
If an allergic reaction does occur, the procedure will be aborted and supportive care, including 
maintaining airway and administration of steroids and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], will be initiated. This will be 
reported appropriately  as an adverse event. Patients will be screened to ensure they are MRI - 
eligible and those who are not for any reason, including but not limited to renal failure, will be 
excluded from participating in this study.  
 
In our protocol, two MRI sequences will b e obtained. Of these two sequences, prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
the prone sequence is standard and the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891054]. Additional adverse events 
applicable to this study will therefore be related to performance of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891055]. All 
patients un dergoing supi[INVESTIGATOR_891056] a prone MRI. To perform supi[INVESTIGATOR_25342], 
patients will be subjected to physical maneuvering required to position them and their breast(s) 
in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_891057]. It is possible that an a dverse event may occur 
during this maneuvering. These events would be unanticipated, and would be reported according 
to institution guidelines. An additional smaller dose of gadolinium -based contrast agent may be 
administered prior to supi[INVESTIGATOR_25342], which wou ld result in patients receiving higher contrast doses

Version Date: 11/08 /[ADDRESS_1247458] long after administration (primarily in the 
brains of patients who are subjected t o four or more contrast -based MRI scans), even in patients 
with normal renal function. The significance of this retention, however, remains uncertain, as it 
is currently unknown if these gadolinium deposits are harmful or could lead to adverse health 
effec ts.

perform quality checks on the data for this study. The study will utilize a case report form 
collected after patients complete all study procedures a nd up to 30 days after their study 
completion. Surveys from providers will be collected at the completion of a patient’s on 
study procedures.  Data will be collected and shared with an outside collaborator for 
analysis. The data will not be identifiable.

Investigative sites within DF/HCC are responsible for submitting data forms to the 
Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 30 days of a patient coming off study.  
 
 
8.2 Data Safety  Monitoring  
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity 
and accrual data from this study. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with 
experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that 
raises any questions about particip ant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_252380].  
 
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review 
toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up -to-date 
participant accrual; all grade [ADDRESS_1247462] been reported;

accurately estimate breast tumor size (in term of correlation with gold standard size on post - 
operative pathology analysis). This study is also designed to compar e correlation between supi[INVESTIGATOR_891060] #: 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16 -277 Protocol 
Version Date: 11/08 /[ADDRESS_1247464] tumor -associated properties/dimensions 
between the prone and s upi[INVESTIGATOR_891061] -surgical supi[INVESTIGATOR_891062].  A total of 80 patients will 
be recruited to participate in this  study.  
 
9.1 Study  Design/Endpoints  
The primary objective of the st udy is to determine the usefulness of pre -surgical prone and 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_891063] (as compared to tumor size on post -operative pathology, 
which is the existing gold standard). This will be evaluated using correlation coefficients 
between es timated tumor size on prone MRI and estimated tumor size on post -operative 
pathology.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1247465] 90% power to detect a 
correlation coefficient between pre-surgical prone or supi[INVESTIGATOR_891064] 0.[ADDRESS_1247466] at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1247467] more than 80% power to detect a difference in 
correlation from 0.[ADDRESS_1247468] at 
alpha=0.[ADDRESS_1247469] imaging is 
0.70.  
 
Assuming the dropo ut rate will be 10%, we will plan to accrue a total of 80 patients. With an 
anticipated enrollment of 5 patients per month, accrual should be completed in approximately 16 
months.  
 
The below table “Accrual Targets” reflects the accrual targets anticipated for this study. As noted 
in detail in Section 3.3, men are not likely candidates for breast conserving surgery, and are not 
eligible for this trial. Approximately 10% of the target enrollment will be Hispanic or African 
American.

9.[ADDRESS_1247470] MRI and pathologic results. A 
95% confidence interval will also be calculated for each correlation coefficient. One sample z - 
test will be conducted to compare whether these co rrelation coefficients are different from  0.6. 
 
The second is to compare the correlation between supi[INVESTIGATOR_891065], and the correlation between existing breast imaging 
modalities and pathologic tumor size. Similarly, correlation coefficient will be calculated 
between supi[INVESTIGATOR_891066]. Two -sample z -test for comparing correlated correlation 
coefficients will  be conducted to compare whether these two correlation coefficients are  equal.  
 
The third is to characterize the changes occurring in breast tumor -associated properties/ 
dimensions between the prone and supi[INVESTIGATOR_891067] -surgical 
MRIs. We will also determine the correlation of tumor location and geometry on pre -NAT and 
post-NAT (pre -surgical) supi[INVESTIGATOR_891068]. As described in Section 2.1, in our prior work comparing prone to supi[INVESTIGATOR_65034], we utilized image processing software that enabled us to generate tumor models and 
specifically calculate differences in the metrics computed from the segmented tumor label maps 
on supi[INVESTIGATOR_891069]. As a first order stati stics, we plan to examine differences in the shape  
NCI Protocol #: 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16 -277 Protocol 
Version Date: 11/08 /[ADDRESS_1247471] size (measured on the axial slice 
through the nipple) and location (inner/outer, upper/lower). Correlation coefficients will be 
calculated for parameters related to tumor shape and size between supi[INVESTIGATOR_891069], and 
one sample t -test (or non - parametric Wilcoxon test) will be used to test  whether the difference in 
shape and size parameters between these two measurements are significantly different from 0. A 
regression model will be used to check whether these differences are correlated to breast size and 
location, age and other clinical  characteristics.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1247472] is to assess the value of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891070]/ biopsies following identification of new lesions on MRI, and performing 
preoperative lesion localization using supi[INVESTIGATOR_890999]. This value will be a ssessed by [CONTACT_891097] (survey of radiologists on perceived usefulness of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891071]/procedures*) and quantitative measures (success rate of second -look ultrasound 
lesion localizations and procedures utilizing supi[INVESTIGATOR_891072]). Procedures include lesion 
biopsy and pre -surgical lesion localization performed by [CONTACT_271486].  
A frequency table will be calculated for the survey questions and the success rate of second -look 
biopsies and/or localizations.  
 
The second is to assess the perceived benefit of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891073] a survey of surgeons performing BCT in our study patient population. A 
frequency table will again be calculated for the survey responses.  
 
The third is to ex plore the effect of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891074] -excisions or having pathologic positive margins when supi[INVESTIGATOR_891075]. This will be an  
exploratory endpoint.  
 
The fourth and final secondary endpoint is to assess the perceived value of supi[INVESTIGATOR_891076] a survey of 
radiation oncologists treating patients in our study population post -operatively. Again, a 
frequency table will be calculated for the survey responses.  
 
9.7 Reporting and  Exclusions  
 
1. Patients who are not evaluable for tumor evaluation by [CONTACT_129424] a result of MRI -related 
problems (ie degree of contrast wa shout for supi[INVESTIGATOR_891077]) will not be included in the primary  analysis.

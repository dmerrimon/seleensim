Study Purpose: Objectives and Hypothesis to be tested  
The study will evaluated whether use of a novel  sleep device in the form of a crib mattress  for one 
month improves sleep metrics  in infants aged 2 months to 12 months . Sleep metrics will include  both 
objective measures of sleep captured by [CONTACT_909599].  
 The hypothesis is that use of the sleep device  over one month will lead to improved sleep quantity and 
quality.  
 
Background and Significance  
Behavioral insomnia of childhood due to sleep- onset associations is a well -studied clinical entity. The 
science behind infant insomnia explains why some children wake up repeatedly at night.  Based on what we know about sleep, the term “sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_52036]” is a misnomer. No human being actually sleeps through the night, infants included. Nighttime sleep occurs in cycles in which we dive into d eeper 
stages of sleep, then emerge into lighter stages at the end of the cycle. The cycle lasts about 60 minutes 
for infants and 90 minutes for adults.
1 There is often an awakening at the end of a  sleep cycle during 
light sleep. Here is a simplified diagram: 
 
An infant that “sleeps through the night” is able to simply go back to sleep during the normal 
awakenings at night. However, an infant with sleep onset association disorder is unable to fall back 
asleep. This sleep disorder is termed behavioral insomnia of childhood, sleep -association subtype by [CONTACT_909600].2 It involves difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_909595]. For example, if  a parent consistently 
rocks an infant during the process of falling asleep at the beginning of the night, the infant learns to associate the transition of falling asleep to that particular intervention. The rocking is the sleep 
association for the child. When the infant awakens at night during a normal awakening, the infant begins 
to cry until rocked to sleep once again. This happens repeatedly through the night, often times separated 
by [CONTACT_455811] (the time it takes to go through another sleep cycle). It lea ds to disruption to both the infant 
and parent’s sleep.  
 
Treatment of sleep onset associations can start as early as four  months of age and often involves 
techniques known as “extinction” or “modified extinction”. Both techniques have a great deal of sleep 
research to support safety and efficacy.
3 The American Academy of Sleep Medicine has a practice 
parameter recommending these treatment t echniques.4 However, implementation of these techniques is 
challenging due to infants/toddlers crying regularly during the process and the stress it creates in 
caregiver s. Many parents give up and subject both themselves and their children to months (and 
sometimes years) of poor sleep as a result, which has a myriad of health consequence. In contrast,

3 successfully implementing a strategy to help a child sleep leads to a m ultitude of benefits, including 
improved behavior in the child, improved mood in adults, and even better marital satisfaction for 
caretakers.5 
 The problem is quite common, with estimates of 20- 30% of young children experiencing sleep 
challenges.
3 Infants between the ages of six months to one year are particularly susceptible to sleep 
difficulties, with 25 -50% still awakening at night.[ADDRESS_1277130] works by [CONTACT_909601] a child is awake, produces a sound and motion to 
soothe a child back to sleep (thereby [CONTACT_40397] a new sleep association), and then over the course of 
weeks, weans the child from this new association by [CONTACT_909602]. This would slowly teach a child to self -soothe, 
thereby [CONTACT_909603].  
 
Research Design and Procedures  
The study will be a prospective trial with subjects serving as their own internal controls. Goal 
enrollment is 20 children over the course of six months. Goal enrollment is based on an a priori  power 
analysis  performed by a Duke biostatistician.

Selection of Subjects  
Inclusion criteria:  
1) Age between 2- 12 months.  
2) Meets clinical criteria for behavioral insomnia of childhood, sleep association subtype, as defined by  
[CONTACT_909604].   
 Exclusion criteria:  
1) Diagnosed comorbid health problem that may disrupt sleep. 2) History of birth prior to [ADDRESS_1277132] Recruitment and Compensation  
Subjects will be recruited directly by [CONTACT_909605] -child checks between the ages of 2 months 
and 12 months. Pediatricians at the Duke Prim ary Care offices at Brier Creek and Durham Pedi atrics 
will be informed of the study so they can also discuss it with eligible patients. The area served by [CONTACT_909606] a heterogeneous  demographic.  
 Approximately 25 subjects will be recruited. Subjects will not receive any compensation for participation  in the study.  
Consen t Process  
Kansagra  
 
5 Consent process will be conducted by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or  CRC. Parents or legal guardian will provide consent. 
The consent process will take place via Duke- licensed Zoom software, which establishes a secured 
telecommunication portal. We will not enroll subjects whose parents are unable to provide legally 
effective consent. The consent for m will be in English. E -consent through REDCap will be used.  
Study Interventions  
The smart mattress device would work by [CONTACT_909601] a child is awake using two sensors, an accelerometer and a microphone. When awake and crying, the device would produce a sound and gentle internal vibration to soothe the child back to sleep (thereby [CONTACT_40397] a new sleep association). Based on data from previous nights, the internal algorith m of the device will eventually switch modes into a "sleep 
training" mode. In this mode, the device will wean the child off of this new association by [CONTACT_909607]. This would slowly teach a child to self -
soothe, thereby [CONTACT_909603]. 
Risk/Benefit Analysis  
The risks for participation are minimal. There is potential risk of worsening of sleep during the course of the study. For example, the infant has to sleep on a new surface or does not soothe with the motion and sound produced, thereby [CONTACT_909608]. As far as risks from the electronics of the device itself, the device uses off -the-shelf electronics and power supply that pose minimal risk, as these components 
undergo safety testing prior to commercialization.  Benefit includes potential to improve the child’s sleep by [CONTACT_909609].  
Cost to Subject  
There will be no costs associated with participation in this study. 
Data Analysis and Statistical Considerations  
The proposed study design was discussed with a biostatistician to determine goal enrollment. Power analysis to achieve an a priori  confidence level of 80% was evaluated for a variety of metrics. Since we 
do not have a pi[INVESTIGATOR_909596] (SD) of metrics to be measured, we determined SD by [CONTACT_909610] 5. Paired T -tests will be used for analysis.

 Ineligible subjects will be withdrawn from statistical analysis. Estimated accrual rate is 5 subjects per month. Target accrual is 25 subjects (assuming 20% drop out with goal of 20 subjects that complete the study). Time to target accrual is [ADDRESS_1277133], enter, and complete a quality check on study data each month. Data will be stored in REDC ap database.  
Study discontinuation:  
Patients will be discontinued if there are significant adverse effects that are judged to outweigh possible benefits. Risk of such events is low given the nature of this device.

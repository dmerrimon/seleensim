INTRODUCTION
Study rationale
Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP and is current ly being evaluated for severe asthma.
In the current global Phase 3 asthma clinical program, 210 mg o f tezepel umab (or pl acebo) is 
administered as a single 1.91 mL subcutaneous (SC) injection (110 mg/mL) via vial (wit h 
disposable syringe) Q4W at the clinic. An accessorized pre -filled syringe (APFS) and auto -
injector (AI) have been developed to enable safe, effecti ve and convenient tezepelumab 
administration by [CONTACT_667772] a ho me use environment in addit ion to 
administration by [CONTACT_544972] h care professionals (HCPs) in the clinic. The purpose of this study is to 
assess the funct ionality and perform ance o f the APFS and AI used to administer a fixed [ADDRESS_901961] been shown to reduce the annualised asthma exacerbat ion rate (AAER) 
in severe asthma pat ients who are uncontrolled wit h medium to high dose ICS and addit ional 
asthma controller medicat ions. Omalizumab provided benefit for a subgroup of patients with 
proven reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels who 
remain inadequately  control led with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a lo ng-acting beta -
agonist (LABA) ( Xolair US PI 2018 ). Four additional bio logics, m epolizumab, reslizumab, 
benralizumab and dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], have recent ly been approved for severe asthma with an 
eosinophilic phenoty pe (Nucala US PI 2017 ;Cinqair US PI 2019; Fasenra US PI 2017 ; Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_667739] 2018 ).  Bio logics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional treatment 
guidelines ( GINA 2018) as an add- on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA 
treatment. However, even when using current ly available bio logics, substant ial proporti ons of 
patients continue to experience exacerbations and may benefit fro m agents that target different 
molecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 ; Fasenra US PI 2017 ; Froidure et al. 2016 ; Swedin e t al. 
2017). Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_667740], there is st ill a clear unmet medical 
need amo ng patients with severe asthma, independent ly of IgE status or eosinophil level, who are 
unable to gain co mplete asthma control using current ly available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that is produced in 
responses to proinflammatory  stimuli (e.g., infectious, allergic and environmental st imuli) and 
traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of immune responses and can 
activate a broad range of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, 
Type 2 innate lympho id cells and basophils ( Watson and Gauvreau 2014 ). Classically , TSLP 
may be a cr itical co mponent in the init iation and perpetuation of the T helper 2 (Th2) response 
and the result ing cascade of cytokines associated with T2 driven asthma ( Kaur and Brigh tling 
2012). Asthma is recognized as a heterogeneous disease, though, and there are subsets of patients 
that do not exhibit T2 -associ ated di sease ( Wenzel 2012). Emerging data indicates that TSLP may  
also m ediate non -allergic (non -T2) inflammat ion (Tanaka et al. 2009 , Ziegler et al . 2013 ).

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 22 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Tezepel umab is a fully  human immunogl obulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody  (mAb) di rected 
against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with the TSLP 
receptor (TSLPR). Owing to the central role of TSLP as an upstream and pleiotropic cy tokine in 
mediat ing asthma pathophysio logy, anti -TSLP therapy  is anticipated to have abroad impact on 
the spectrum of inflammatory  responses seen in asthma.
Results of a co mpleted inhaled allerg en challenge study  in 31 adult subjects with mild atopic 
asthma (Study  20101183) dem onstrated that tezepelumab attenuated the late allergic response 
and the early allergic response to allergen challenge, as measured by [CONTACT_635140] -under -the-curve 
(AUC) for th e percent fall in the forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_131955] (FEV 1) and the 
maximum percent fall in FEV 1. Tezepel umab also attenuated the increase in fract ional expi[INVESTIGATOR_667741] -allergen day co mpared with the pre -allergen day. Mult iple doses of 
700 m g IV tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic 
asthma. No subjects developed ant i-drug antibodies (ADA) after receiving tezepelumab 
(Gauvreau et al. 2014 ). Based upon these data, the MedImmune/[COMPANY_008] conducted a 
rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose range finding study  in asthmat ics who were 
inadequately controlled with mediu m or hi gh dose ICS/LABA with or without other controller 
medicat ions.
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- [ADDRESS_901962] of 3 dose level s 
of tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately  controlled, severe asthma. 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 dose levels o f subcutaneous (SC) 
tezepel umab (70 m g every  4 weeks [Q4W], 210 mg Q4W, 280 mg every  two weeks [Q 2W]) or 
placebo (Q2W) for [ADDRESS_901963] 1 dose of tezepelumab or placebo. An AAER reduction of 62%, 71%, and 66% for the 70 
mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 mg Q2W tezepelumab groups, respectively, compared wit h 
placebo were observed in the intent -to-treat population ( p<0.001). After repeated SC 
administration, mean serum trough concentration increased over time and achieved steady -state 
by [CONTACT_5875] 12. Tezepel umab exhibited linear pharmacokinet ics (PK) across the 3 doses. A total of 
6 (4.3%) placebo subjects and 7 (1.7%) t ezepelumab subjects who had no detectable ADA at 
baseline had detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects developed neutralizing ADA in the 
study . The resul ts of this study  did not i dentify safety concerns associated with tezepelumab for 
any dosing regimen. The frequencies of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
similar between the placebo (65.9%) and the total tezepelumab (66.0%) dose groups. A majorit y 
of subjects had TEAEs that were mild or moderate in severit y and not related to invest igational
product (IP). Few subjects had TEAEs that resulted in permanent discont inuat ion of IP, and at 
similar incidence between the tezepelumab (5 subjects [1.2%] overall) and placebo ([ADDRESS_901964] 
[0.7%]) groups. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated wi th an acce ptable safety  profile and no 
ident ified safety risks were noted ( Corren et al, 2017 ).

Benefit/risk assessment
In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance for tezepelumab, preclinical and clinical data 
have been taken into considerat ion, as well as a review of the available information for 
monoclonal antibodies that are approved for or are in development for the treatment of severe 
asthma. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a clinically meaningful reduct ion in 
asthma exacerbations, improvement in lung function and asthma control metrics. 
Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no identified s afety  risks to date in the clinical 
development program. No serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic reactions considered related 
to tezepel umab were reported in the Phase [ADDRESS_901965] been detected in the tezepelumab program.
The benefit/risk assessment for tezepelumab in severe asthma based on the development through 
Phase 2 i s favorable. The future benefit / risk assessment will largely be defined by  [CONTACT_667773] [ADDRESS_901966] igator’s Brochure.

doses (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 20) of tezepelumab.  The first [ADDRESS_901968] dose at the clinic. Approximately 20 ado lescents aged ≥12 to <18 y ears will  
be included as subjects. 
As part of the informed consenting pr ocess, the APFS and AI Instructions For Use (IFU) and 
administration quest ionnaire (see Appendix I and Appendix J ) will be reviewed. Fo llowing a 2 -
week screening period, eligible subjects will receive 4 SC doses of tezepelumab 210 mg at the 
clinic (Week 0, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 20) and 2 SC doses of tezepelumab 210 mg at home 
(Week 12 and Week 16). At Week 0, the HCP will administer the study  drug. At Week 4, the 
subject or caregiver will have the option of administering the study  drug under HCP supervisio n 
to ensure they  understand the procedure and are capable of doing so. At Week 8, the subject or 
caregiver will have to perform the inject ion, again under HCP supervision. Subjects or subjects 
with caregivers who are unable or unwilling to administer invest igational product (IP) at Week 8 
(Visit 4) will be discont inued fro m the stud y.
At Week [ADDRESS_901969] be present for 
IP administration.  
The final dose of tezepelumab (Week 20) will be self- administered by [CONTACT_667774] n in order to evaluate 
administration technique.
When IP i s administered in the clinic at Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 20, the person 
administering the dose will fill out an administration questionnaire designed to indicate if the 
dose was successfully  administered. The si teis to subsequent ly return the used devices and 
completed questi onnaires to the Sponsor for evaluation.
When IP i s administered at home (Week 12 and Week 16), whether the subject is self -
administering, or the caregiver is administering to the subject, the person administering the dose 
will fill out an administration quest ionnaire designed to indicate whether the dose was 
successfully administered. Both the completed questionnaire and the used device are to be 
returned to the site during each of the on -site visits scheduled wit hin 48 hours of the ho me 
administration of IP (Week 12 and Week 16). The site is to subsequent ly return the used devices 
and co mpleted questionnaires to the Sponsor for evaluat ion. 
The same person must administer the IP at Weeks 4 (if administered by  [CONTACT_1130]/caregiver), 8, 12, 
16, and 20, whether it is the subject or caregiver. The caregiver must accompany the subject to 
all dosing visits after signing consent. Caregiver attendance to the EOT/IPD and Fo llow up visits 
is opti onal.

Scientific rationale for study design
This is a mult icenter, open -label trial designed to confi rm the su ccessful  use and gain relevant 
inform ation on the HCPs and subjects/caregivers use of the AI and APFS devices with 
tezepel umab both in the clinic and an at -home setting . The study  design provi des for HCP 
administration at Week 0, followed by [CONTACT_667775]/caregiver administration at Week 
4. Subj ect/caregiver administration will take place at Week [ADDRESS_901970]/caregiver familiarit y with the devices, provide oversight by  
[CONTACT_667776], and establish suitabilit y of subject/caregiver use at home.
Justification for dose
A 210 m g Q4W dosing regimen was selected for the Phase 3 studies based on efficacy data and 
an exposure -response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using 
popul ation PK/PD methodology . The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed based 
on all available data fro m 5 Phase 1 studi es (Study 20070620, Study  20080390, Study  2010118, 
Study  D5180C00003, Study  D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study  D5240C00001 and 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146). The exposure -response analysis was based on the Phase 2b 
Study  CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146.
Analysis of data fro m the Phase 2b s tudy identified a stati stically significant exposure -response 
against the primary efficacy endpo int of AAER and the pharmacodynamic (PD) endpo int of 
FeNO. These relat ionships indicate that the dose of [ADDRESS_901971] expected visit/contact [CONTACT_96747] .

Screen failures
Screen failures are defined as subjects who signed the informed consent form to participate in the 
clinical study  but are not subsequent ly rando mized. A minimal set of screen failure informat ion 
is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects to meet the Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries 
from regulatory  authori ties. Minimal  information includes dem ography, screen failure details, 
eligibilit y criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE). 
These subjects should have the reason for study  withdrawal  recorded as a ‘Screen Failure’ (i.e., 
subject does not meet the required inclusio n/exclusio n criteria) in the eCRF. This reason for 
study  withdrawal  is only  valid for screen failures, and not randomized subjects.
Re-screening is allowed only  once under the following circumstances:
Subjects with respi[INVESTIGATOR_667743] 14 days 
prior to Visi t 1 or during the screening/run -in pe riod may  be re-screened (exclusio n criterion 4) 
14 day s after recovery , (i.e., com pletion of the therapy ).
If the reason for screen failure was transient (including but not limited to study -supplied 
equipment failure, unforeseen personal events that mandate missed screening visit s), subjects 
may potentially be re -screened. These cases should be discussed with the [COMPANY_008] study  
physician and documented in the Invest igator Study  File (ISF).
Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbat ion during the screening/run -in period will be 
screen failed and may be re -screened after [ADDRESS_901988] igator’s discretion. 
Any re -screened subject will be re -enrolled and reassigned their originally assigned enrolment 
number after signing a new Informed Consent Form (ICF), or assent form, and after all Visit [ADDRESS_901989] been performed as listed in Table 1(with the except ion of testing for HIV1 and 
HIV2, hepatit is B and C, and FSH).
Re-screened subjects should be assigned the same subject number as for the initial screening. 
However, re -screening should be documented so that its effect on study results, if any, can be 
assessed.
Re-screening of a subject will be allowed only upon approval o f the [COMPANY_008] Study  
Physician.
STUDY TREATMENTS
Study  treatm ent is defined as any invest igational product(s) (including marketed product 
comparator and pl acebo) or m edical  device(s) intended to be administered to a study  parti cipant 
according to the study  protocol . Study  treatm ent in this study  refers to tezepelumab.

controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage 
condi tions wi th access limited to the invest igator and authorized site staff. 
The IP must be kept in the original outer packaging and under condit ions specified on the label 
(between 2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F], protected from light).
Only subjects enrolled in the study  may receive and self -administer study  treatment. Only 
authori zed si te staff may  supply  or administer study  treatm ent. Only authorized caregivers may 
administer study  treatm ent to the specific subject they have consented t o provi de administration 
of IP. The Invest igator, inst itution, or the head of the medical inst itution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study  treatm ent accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record maintenance (i.e., 
recei pt, reconciliat ion, and final dis position records).
For at hom e administrati on, the subject will be responsible for refrigerat ing the product at home. 
Subjects can transport the IP in uncontrolled temperature condit ions but shoul d return i t to a 
refrigerator as soon as possible. The tempe rature is not m onitored duri ng storage by  [CONTACT_423]; 
standard refrigerat ion is sufficient to maintain appropriate temperatures while the IP is in the 
subject’s possessio n. The subject will be responsible for returning used APFS/AI devices and 
completed a dministration questi onnai res to the study  center.
In the fo llowing cases nei ther the center staff nor the subject or caregiver should use the affected 
IP and should immediately contact [CONTACT_667779]:

Dam aged ki t upon recei pt
Dam aged APFS/AI device
Dam aged IP shoul d be docum ented vi a IWRS (pl ease refer to IWRS manual for further details).
Dose Preparation
Prior to each IP administration at clinic site:
Invest igator/authorized delegate will assess injection site as per standards of medical care
For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the 
resul t of the test is negat ive (see Sect ion8.2.1.1 )
Prior to each IP administration in at -home setting:
Invest igator/authorized delegate will perform visit reminder call within [ADDRESS_901990] about the next scheduled visit to occur within 48 hours 
after hom e administrati on.
For WOCBP, urine pregnancy test will be done; IP will be administered only when the

different anatomical site each time. Suggested injection site rotation sequence is presented below 
(see Figure 2). In the case whe n rotati on of  the injecti on si te is not favourable for the subject 
and/or Invest igator, the reason should be recorded in the source documents. The inject ion site 
must be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF at each treatment visit.
If IP i s self -administered by [CONTACT_423], the injection should be done in the abdo men or thigh; 
when the injection is performed by [CONTACT_340477] h care professio nal (HCP) or caregiver the inject ion 
can be made in the abdo men, thigh or upper arm (upper arm reserved only for i njecti ons 
performed by  [CONTACT_667780]). The same person must administer the IP throughout the study , 
whether it i s the subject or caregiver. The caregiver administering study drug must accom pany  
the subject to all dosing visits after signing consent. Car egiver attendance to the EOT/IPD and 
Follow up visits is optional. For adolescent subjects who will self -administer the IP, the 
caregiver or an adult must supervise IP administration.  For adult subjects who will self -
administer the IP, an adult must be pr esent for IP administration.   
Further details on IP administration are provided in the Instruction for Use (IFU). Invest igational 
product administration must be carried out in line with the instructions provided.

Single Use APFS/AI device malfunction
An AI m alfuncti on is when the AI device appears normal during verificat ion of shipment and 
then does not work during administration, e.g., the autoinjector activated prematurely, the 
autoinjecto r stalled or did not expel the full vo lume, needle guard safet y feature did not deplo y or 
remain locked, glass sy ringe breakage, needle bent or broke upon use. 
An APFS malfunct ion is when the APFS appeared normal during verificatio n of shipment and 
then does not work during administration, e.g., the safet y feature activated prematurely, part of 
the device (finger flange, plunger rod, etc.) came off or broke, needle shield could not be 
removed only partial dose administered, needle guard safet y feature did not activate, needle bent 
or broke upon use.
Device malfunct ions should be reported using the Device Malfunct ion Return Form and the 
Study  Moni tor shoul d be notified.
If a device malfunct ion is ident ified at the study  center:
Before IP administration has started, another IP kit (replacement) should be dispensed to 
perform IP administration;
After IP administration has started and subject has been administered unknown dose of 
IP, another IP kit must not be dispensed, and subject must not be administered wit h 
another IP kit. The [COMPANY_008] study  physician and study  monitor shoul d be notified.

Measures to minimize randomization bias
The Investigator(s) will:
1.Obtain signed informed consent or assent fro m the potential subject, or their 
guardi an/legal representative, before any study  specific procedures are performed.
2.Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’) via 
the Interactive Web Re sponse System/Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS).
3.Determine subject eligibilit y.

System  (IWRS).
5.Subjects will be allocated to receive tezepelumab 210 mg via a single -use APFS or AI 
subcutaneously (SC) in a 1:1 ratio and stratified. by [CONTACT_654] (adults/adolescents) and country. 
Randomization numbers will be grouped in blocks. If a subject withdraws fro m the study , 
then his/her enro lment/randomization code cannot be re used. Wit hdrawn subjects will not 
be replaced.
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS will be provided in a separate manual.
Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
rando mized or receive study medication. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who 
are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all  the eligibilit y criteria must not be 
rando mized or init iated on trea tment and m ust be wi thdrawn from the study .
Where a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error, or incorrectly 
started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the [COMPANY_008] study physician 
immediately, and a discus sion shoul d occur between the [COMPANY_008] study  physician and the 
Invest igator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the subject from treatment. Study 
treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safet y 
risk to the subject. In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study  therapy  is judged not to present 
a concern related to safet y and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy 
must be clearly documented. Regardless of what is decided abo ut IP, all rando mized subjects 
shoul d remain in the study  and the subjects should continue to be fo llowed up in accordance with 
defined study  procedures.
Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially within each stratum as subjects 
beco me eligible for randomizat ion.
The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a co mputerized 
system  provi ded by  [CONTACT_667783] o f AZ (AZRand). All subjects will be 
stratified at randomizat ion by [CONTACT_654] (adul ts/adolescents) and country . 
Treatment compliance
Any change fro m the dosing schedule or dose discontinuat ions should be recorded in the eCRF.
The IP Storage Manager is responsible for managing the IP from receipt by  [CONTACT_667784]. The date and time o f all IP administrations, as well as 
any missed doses, should be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.

Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment
Subjects are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study  at any  time without prejudice to 
further treatment. Discont inuing study treatment is not the same as study withdrawal. Procedures 
to fo llow for study  withdrawal  are detailed bel ow. If  the subject deci des to wi thdraw consent, 
then the reason for this must be recorded separately in the eCRF. 
A subject that decides to discont inue IP should always be asked about the reason(s) and the 
presence of a ny adverse events. The reason for discontinuing treatment and the date of last IP 
administration should be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects permanent ly discont inuing IP 
administration should be given locally available standard of care therapy, at the discret ion of the 
Invest igator. However, treatment with marketed or invest igational biologics i s not allowed unt il 
week [ADDRESS_902017] not been conducted. For addit ional 
inform ation regarding pharmacokinet ic and pharmacodynamic effects of tezepelumab reference 
shoul d be made to the Investigator brochure. 
All subjects who prematurely discontinue IP and who do not withdraw their consen t from the 
study , shoul d return to the study  centre and complete the procedures described in the Premature 
IP Di scontinuati on (IPD) vi sit after 4 weeks (± 3 days) and the procedures for the Follow -up 
visits after 10 weeks (± 3 days) and 16 weeks (± 3 days) of the last IP administration. The reason 
for prem ature di scont inuat ion of IP should be recorded in the eCRF. 
If a subject discont inues IP due to a study specific discontinuat ion criterion, thi s shoul d always 
be recorded as ‘Development of study specific discontinuat ion criteria’ on the Di sposi tion (DS) 
form in the eCRF. 
Lost to follow -up
A subject will be considered potentially lost to fo llow-up if he or she fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  [CONTACT_4145].  
The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study  
visit:
oThe site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_96758].
oBefore a subject is deemed lost to fo llow

Withdrawal from the study
A subject may  withdraw f rom the study  (e.g. wi thdraw consent), at any  time (IP and 
assessments) at his/her own request, without prejudice to further treatment. 
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (A E).  The Invest igator will fo llow-up subjects as medically  indicated. A 
withdrawal  visit is essent ial to collect as much data as possible for the subject as per EOT visit 
described in the SoA, Section 1.1.
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the sponsor may  retain and 
continue to use any  data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.
If a subject withdraws fro m the study , he/she m ay request destructi on of  any samples taken, and 
the Invest igator must document this in the site study records.  
If the subject only wit hdraws consent for the retentio n of blood samples for future exploratory
use (e.g. DNA, study  of markers of asthma, ident ifying potential new drug targets for asthma, or 
for assay development purposes), the subject will not be withdrawn fro m the study .
Withdrawal o f consent fro m the study  must be ascertained and documented by  [CONTACT_244953] (ICF) or assent form.
Withdrawal due to recruitment completion
When the required number of subjects are randomized in the study , ongoing subjects in run -in 
will not be random ized and will be withdrawn from the study . The reason of the withdrawal 
shoul d be docum ented in the source notes and eCRF. As wit h screen failures, no further study

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and thei r timing are summarized in the Schedule of Act ivities (SoA) .
The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). 
The Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collect ion and query  
handling.  
The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y and timeliness of the data 
recorded and of the provisio n of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study 
Agreement.  The Invest igator will sign the completed eC RFs.  A copy  of the com pleted eCRFs 
will be archived at the study  site.
Immediate safet y concerns shoul d be discussed wit h the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or 
awareness to determine if the subject should continue or discont inue study treatment.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule o f 
Activities (SoA) , is essent ial and requi red for study conduct.
All screening evaluat ions m ust be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential subjects 
meet all eligibilit y criteria.  The Investi gator will maintain a screening log to record details o f all 
subjects screened and to confirm eligibilit y or record reasons for screening failu re, as applicable.  
The amount of blood collected from each subject over the duration of the study (excluding 
optional blood sam ples and any extra assessments that may  be requi red) will be approximately

successfully administered tezepelumab wit h an APFS/AI at the clinic and at home. A successful 
administration is defined as an injection co mpleted based on a user -recorde d answer of “Yes” to 
all 5 questions in the APFS/AI Questionnaire (please see Appendix I and Appendix J ) and 
satisfactory  in vitro eval uation (visual test + funct ional evaluat ion) of the returned devices.
Assessment of returned APFS/AI device through in vitro evaluation
In addi tion to the Questi onnaire filled out and returned to the Sponsor with each administered 
dose, the used APFS/AI will be returned to the Sponsor for in vitro evaluat ion. The data 
collected in the vitro evaluat ion of the APFS/AI devices falls into 2 categories: 1) Visual 
inspection, and 2) Funct ional evaluat ion.
The visual  inspect ion will assess the returned devices for any visible damage or disassembly, full 
plunger travel  indicating a co mplete dose was expelled, and needle guard deplo yment. The 
funct ional evaluation will challenge the needle safety guard to assess whether i t depl oyed 
correctly  and cont inued to provide protection against accidental needle st ick injuri es. As

All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within [ADDRESS_902031]’s last visit and 
he/she cons iders the event to be reasonably related to the Study treatment or study participat ion, 
the Invest igator must notify the sponsor.
The m ethod of recording, evaluat ing, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for com pleting and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix B . 
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the Invest igator is required to proactively fo llow each subject at 
subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs/non -serious AEs/AEs of special  interest will be fo llowed 
until reso lution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’ s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study  are f ollowed up by [CONTACT_96770], 
but wi thout f urther recording in the CRF.  [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional 
inform ation for any  subject wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged 
necessary .

Adverse event data collection
The fo llowing variables will be collected for each AE;
o AE (verbat im)
o The date when the AE started and stopped
o Whether the AE is serious or n ot
o Invest igator causalit y rating against the IP(s) (y es or no)
o Action taken with regard to IP(s)
o Select the appropri ate as requi red: AE caused subject’s withdrawal from 
study  (yes or no)
o Outcom e.
In addi tion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
o Date AE met criteria for serious AE
o Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE
o Reason of AE is being serious 
o Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
o Date of di scharge
o Probable cause of death
o Date of death
o Autopsy  performed
o Causalit y assessment in relat ion to Study  procedure(s)
o Causalit y assessment to other medicat ion'
Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between IP and each Adverse Event, and answer 
‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possi bility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249]?’

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 59(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied a s ‘yes’.
A gui de to the interpretati on of  the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B to the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_667787] m 
the study  site staff : Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last 
asked? or reveal ed by  [CONTACT_667788] e CRF. When co llecting 
AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and 
symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not 
generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosi s and each sign or symptom will be recorded 
separately
Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the Clinical Study  Protocol  mandated l aboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarized in the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  
values/vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE criteria 
or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatment with the IP.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign/ECG is as sociated wi th clinical  signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
resul t/vital sign will  be considered as addi tional inform ation. Wherever possible the reporting 
Invest igator uses the clinical, rather th an the l aboratory  term  (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglo bin 
value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal me dical  finding at a physical examinat ion as 
compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally  related to 
the disease under study . 
Disease progression
Asthma signs or symptoms such as wheeze, cough, chest tightness, breathlessness, etc. will be 
recorded as AEs only when:
The sign or symptom is serious according to definition, see Appendix B
The pati ent di scont inues the study due to the sign or symptom.
The sign or symptom is new to the patient or is not consistent with the patient's pre -exist ing 
asthma history  as judged by [CONTACT_11856]. 
Asthma exacerbations should be recorded as an AE or SAE in the eCRF only if it fulfils any of 
the above criteria.

Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an event of scient ific and medical interest towards 
improving the understanding of the IP. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. For this study, 
AESIs include:
o Anaphylactic reactions 
o Immune com plex disease (Ty pe III hy persensi tivity reacti ons)
o Malignancy
o Helmint h infect ions 
o Severe infect ions which are defined as:
SAEs or 
Requi ring treatm ent wi th antiviral medicat ions, intravenous ant ibiotics 
or medicat ions for helmint h parasit ic infect ion or
Requi ring a perm anent discont inuat ion of study  drug
o Inject ion site reactions 
o Opportuni stic infect ions
o Guillain Barre Syndrome
Hy’s law
Cases where a subject shows elevat ion in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion and 
occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may n eed to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix E for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law.
Safety report ing and medical management
Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs must be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study 
procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs during the study , then In vestigators or other site personnel must inform the 
appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day  e.g., immediately but no later than 24 
hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.

necessary  informat ion is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin [ADDRESS_902032] igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an 
autom ated em ail alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative(s).
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site staff must report a 
SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative(s) by [CONTACT_756].
The [COMPANY_008] representative(s ) will  advise the Investi gator/study  site staff how to proceed.  
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s Brochure 
for the [COMPANY_008] IP.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix B .
Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_008] except if the 
pregnancy is discovered before the study  subject has received any study  drug. If a pregnancy  is 
reported, the Invest igator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours o f learning o f the 
pregnancy. 
Abnorm al pregnancy outcom es (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopi c pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
Maternal exposure
If a subject beco mes pregnant during the course of the study, IP should be discont inued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the IP under 
study  may have interfered wi th the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  El ective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth 
or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be f ollowed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued fro m the study .

congenital abnormalit y) shoul d be fo llowed up and docum ented for conceptions occurring fro m 
the date of the first administ ration of  IP until 16 weeks (5 half -lives) after the last administration 
of IP.
Overdose
A dose in excess of 280 mg administered within a 2 -week period is considered an overdose.
There i s currently no specific treatment in the event of overdose of IP and p ossible symptoms of 
an overdose are not established.
An overdose wi th associ ated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE 
modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF mo dule.
An overdose wi thout associ ated symptom s is only  reported on the Overdose CRF module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives immediately,
or no later than [ADDRESS_902035] igator or other site

treat anaphylaxis ( Lieberman et al. 2010). Details on anaphylaxis management are provided in 
Appendix G.
Anaphylaxis will be defined as a serious reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death 
(Sampson et al . 2006 ). Anaphylaxis t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_96684] 1 of 3 clinical scenarios:
1. The acute onset of a reaction (minutes to hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal 
tissue or both and at least one of the fo llowing: a) respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097]; or b) 
reduced blood pressure or symptom s of end -organ dy sfunct ion.
2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_96685]: involvement of the 
skin/mucosal t issue, respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097], reduced blood pressure or associated 
symptoms and/or persistent gastrointest inal symptom s.
3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure.
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase. The sample will be tested at the local lab or central lab where applicable. In 
addition, in order to hel p understand the potential drug -relatedness o f any acute reaction, a blood 
sample should be drawn during the event for ADA testing (if not already scheduled for this 
visit).

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 
Statistical hypotheses
No stati stical hypotheses will be tested in this study .
Sample size determination 
A total o f 210 subjects will be rando mized, out of which 105 will receive a dose of tezepelumab 
210 mg via APFS injection and 105 will receive the same dose administered via AI. 
Approximately  20 adol escents aged ≥12 to <18 years will be included. It is ant icipated that 
approximately  5% of  subjects will drop out and thus it is estimated that approximately 10 0 
subjects will co mplete the study  for each device.
Populations for analyses
For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: 
Population Description
Enrolled All subjects who sign the ICF
Full Analysis Set All subjects rando mized to study treatment who received or 
attem pted to receive at least one dose of IP, irrespective of their 
protocol  adherence and cont inued participat ion in the study
Pharmacokinet ics Analysis 
Set All subjects in the full analysis set who received tezepelumab 
and fro m whom PK blood sam ples are assumed not to be 
affected by  [CONTACT_244974] (e.g. disallowed 
medicat ion or incorrect study  medicat ion received).
Safety Analysis Set All subjects who received tezepelumab
Statistical analyses
Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_244979]. A comprehensive statist ical 
analysis plan (SAP) will be developed prior to first patient enter treatment period, and any 
subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments (if a ny) finalized before 
database lock. This sect ion is a summary o f the planned stati stical analyses of the primary  and 
secondary  endpoints. Any  deviat ions from this plan will be reported in the clinical study  report.
All analyses will be descriptive only an d no form al stati stical testing will be performed.
Efficacy analyses
The efficacy endpo ints will be summarized using the Full Analysis Set. To assess successful 
administration, functionalit y, and performance o f the tezepelumab [ADDRESS_902038] ion via APFS 
andAI both in clinic and at home, 3 outcomes will be measured for APFS and AI devices 
separately:

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 65(107) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Primary endpo int: Proportion of HCPs and subjects/caregivers who successfully 
administer tezepelumab in clinic or at home. Successful administration is defined in 
Secti on8.1.The deno minator will be the number of subjects who received or attempted 
to receive an administration at each visit.
Secondary  endpoint: Proporti on of used/returned devices that pass funct ional tests and 
visual inspection and show no evidence of malfunction. The deno minator will be the 
number of used and returned devices at each visit. 
Secondary  endpoint: Proporti on of  devices that have been report ed as malfunctioning 
(Product Complaints). The deno minator will be the number of used and returned devices 
at each visit.
For each of these endpoints, proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented by 
[CONTACT_667789]. For the primary endpo int specifically, the HCP and the 
subject/caregivers will be assessed separately, which is achieved through the by -visit 
presentations described above.  
In addi tion, summaries combining visits may  also be presented to assess at home use separately  
from clinic use as well as HCP use separately  from subject/caregiver use. The details will be 
presented in the SAP.
For the addi tional secondary  endpoint change from baseline in mean ACQ -[ADDRESS_902039] ionary for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) versio n in force at database

in the SAP.
The number and percentag e of subjects wi th on-treatm ent and post -treatm ent adverse events will
be tabulated separately by  [CONTACT_82523]. An event that occurred one or
more times during a period will contribute 1 observat ion to the numerator of the proporti on. The
deno minator of the proportion will co mprise all subjects in the safety populat ion. On -treatm ent
adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_243696] y/severit y and separately , by 
[CONTACT_20084] y/relatedness (as determined by [CONTACT_093]). Should a subj ect report the same 
preferred term/system organ class within mult iple intensit y/severi ty or causali ty/relatedness
categori es, the subject ’s worst occurrence (most severe/most related) will be tabulated. Serious
AEs, AEs leading to discont inuat ion from IP, and commo nly occurring AEs will  be summarized
in a generally similar manner. Adverse events, SAEs, AEs leading to death, and AEs leading to
study  discont inuat ion will be summarized for each treatment group as applicable.
AEs of Special Interest (AESIs) wi ll also be summarized descript ively by [CONTACT_3227].

laboratory  abnorm alities will be summarized.
Other analyses 
PK vari ables will be summarized using Pharmacokinet ics Analysis Set. Tezepelumab serum 
concentrations will be summarized using descript ive statist ics at each visit for each device 
separately . No f ormal  PK data analysis is planned due to sparse sampling and variat ions of

using the Safet y Analysis Set. ADA data will be summarized using descri ptive statist ics at each 
visit by  [INVESTIGATOR_16897]. Sam ples confirmed posi tive for ADA will be archived for possible testing for 
neutralizing ant ibodies (nAb). The potential effects of ADA status and ADA t iter on 
pharmacokinet ics of tezepel umab will be evaluated. Th e potential associat ion of immunogenicit y 
with efficacy and safet y may be evaluated.
Interim analyses 
No interim analyses are planned in this trial.

Adverse event definitions and additiona l safety information
B [ADDRESS_902048] a causal  
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavou rable and unintended sign 
(e.g.  an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The term AE is u sed to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no Study  treatm ent has been administered.
B 2 Definitions of seriou s adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -subject hospi t
alisation or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  
Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect?
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B 3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject ’s 
death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it might 
have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B 4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72917] a serious AE , although the reasons for 
it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject
was enrolled in t he study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 76 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426B [ADDRESS_902049] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hyd rocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requi ring bl ood transfusi on, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
B 6 Intensity rating scale:
1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause inter ference with normal act ivities)
3. severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_244986] B .  An AE of severe intensit y need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B . On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B .
B 7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is 
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by  [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the suspect 
drug?  Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal  relationship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support a re-
challenge .
Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit yof ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough information 
to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the case, i t is likely  
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B 8 Medication Error
For the purpos es of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medicat ion error i s not l ack of efficacy  of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.

Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error e.g.  medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to 
the participant
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tab let 
Drug not stored as instructed e.g.  kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IWRS errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IWRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IWRS - including those which lead to one of the above 
listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug d ose(s) e.g.  forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs, but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

Genetics
D 1 Use/analysis of DNA
Genet ic variat ion may impact a subject’s response to therapy , susceptibilit y to, and severi ty and 
progression of disease.  Variable response to therapy  may be due to geneti c determinants that 
impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism  of action of the 
drug; di sease et io
logy; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where 
local regulati ons and IRB/IEC allow, blood samples will be co llected for DNA an alysis fro m 
consent ing subjects.
[COMPANY_008] intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to 
medicat ions.  Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of 
diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery  of new diagnosti cs, 
treatm ents or m edicat ions.  
In addi tion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinic al 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the entire 
genome. 
The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) or in a separate 
study  summary .
The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confident iality.
The samples will be retained while research on tezepelumab cont inues but no longer than [ADDRESS_902054] of the m ain study .

described in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and: Provide informed consent 
for the genet ic sampling and analyses.
Exclusion criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any  of the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collection
Withdrawal of consent for genet ic research:  
Subjects m ay withdraw from  this genetic research at any  time, independent of any decisio n 
concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study .  Vol untary  withdrawal will  not 
prejudice further treatment.  Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Sect ion 7.3of the m ain 
Clinical Study  Protocol .
Collection of samples for genetic research
Blood sam ples f or geneti c research will be obtained from su bjects at randomisation visit and 
only after the consent is signed. Although DNA is stable, early  sample collect ion is preferred to 
avoid int roducing bias through excluding subjects who may  withdraw due to an adverse event 
(AE), such subjects would be impo rtant to include in any  genet ic analysis. If for any reason the 
sample i s not drawn at Randomisat ion Visit, i t may be taken at any  visit unt il the last study visit. 
Only one sample should be co llected per subject for genetics during the study. Samples will be 
collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory  Manual.
Coding and storage of DNA samples
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to 
maintain subject confident iality.  Sample s will be stored for a maximum o f 15years, from the 
date of l ast subject l ast visit, after which they  will be destroy ed.  DNA is a finite resource that is 
used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible 
or the maximum  storage time has been reached.
An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA 
extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable only by [CONTACT_33160], unique number.  This number is used to ident ify the sample and 
corresponding data at the [COMPANY_008] genet ics laboratories, or at the designated organization.  
No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person ([COMPANY_008] 
employee or designated organizat ions working with the DNA).
The link between the subject enrolment/randomization code and the second number will be 
maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at [COMPANY_008] or

Ethical and regulatory requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in this appendix.
Informed consent
The genetic component of this study  is opti onal, and the subject may participate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in 
the genet ic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for the 
main study  and the genet ic component of the study as applicable. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_667764]. The 
Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the 
subject understands that they  may freely  withdraw fro m the genetic aspect of the study  at any  
time.
Subject data protection
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any  insura nce com pany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by  [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the subject. Regul atory  authori ties may req uire access to the relevant files, though 
the subject’s medical informat ion and the genetic files would remain physically separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated in this study  will be stored at a secure system at [COMPANY_008] 
and/or designated organi zations to analyze the samples.
[COMPANY_008] and its designated organizat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], acad emic organizat ions or health insurance co mpanies.  This can 
be done by [CONTACT_103472], where they can be combined with the 
resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even m ore about healt h and disease.  The researchers can only 
use th is informat ion for health -related research purposes.  Researchers may  see summary  resul ts, 
but they  will not be able to see individual subject data or any  personal  identifiers.  
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a 
suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database.

Actions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and 
evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately report 
Potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) cases and Hy’s Law (HL) cases.  It is not intended to be a 
comprehe nsive gui de to the m anagement of el evated liver biochemistries. 
Specific guidance on managing liver abnormalit ies can be found in Sect ion 7.1of the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for determining whether a subject meets potential 
PHL cri teria at any  point during the study .
All sources o f laboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this 
includes samples taken at scheduled study  visit s and other visits including central and all local 
laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study visits; for e xample, PHL criteria 
could be m et by  [CONTACT_96724] a central laboratory  and/or elevated TBL from a local 
laboratory .  
The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) forpossible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alt ernat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_309582] (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reportin g 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events (AEs) according to the outcome o f the 
review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransfera se (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together wi th Total  Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN togeth er wi th TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, 
can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicat ing cho lestasis, 
viral hepat itis, another drug. 
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (i.e. on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevat ions 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is importan t to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory  
data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3xULN
AST ≥ 3xULN
TBL ≥ 2xULN
Central laboratories being used:
When a subject meets any o fthe PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  repo rts where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative 
Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_122647]
Com plete the appropri ate unschedul ed laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Section E 2within this Appendix 
for definit ion) by [CONTACT_309583] (including both 
central  and l ocal laboratory  resul ts)
E 4 Follow -up
E 4.1 Poten tial Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:

Tezepelumab -D518 0C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria. 
Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provi ded 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
E 4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team .
Within [ADDRESS_902055] igator will report the case as an SAE of 
Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Im portant m edical event’ and causalit y assessment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
For subjects that m et PHL cri teria prior to starti ng IMP, the invest igator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion.
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data.
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. 
Com pletes foll ow-up SAE Form as required.
Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician. This includes decid ing which the tests available in the Hy’s law 
lab kit should be used. 
Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.
E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether there 
is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_2203], to 
ensure timely  analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL 
criteria was m et.  The [COMPANY_008] Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y

Tezepelumab -D5180C00011
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 (107 ) Form Doc Number: AZDoc0070547 Parent Doc Number: AZDoc0017426Physician will al so be invo lved in this review together with other subject matter experts as 
appropriate.  
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the
appropriate CRF.
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted 
Potenti al Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly  with the new inform ation 
(reassessing event term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard 
processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] 
standard processes. 
–The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous criterion should be used if no other 
serious cri teria apply.
–As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion necessary  
to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report 
following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and 
amending the reported term if an alternat ive explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.

G [ADDRESS_902057] inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (e.g. IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for 
defining anaphylaxis for thi s study  are listed in Appendix G 2. A gui de to the si gns and 
symptoms and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix G 3. Appropri ate 
drugs, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat 
anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel s hould 
be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. 
If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at di scharge for analysis 
of serum  tryptase.
G 2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune 
Complex Disease
Anaphylaxis
In adul ts, anaphylaxis is highly likely  when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
1.  Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal     
tissue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swo llen lips -tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097] (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, hypoxemia).
(b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion 
(e.g. hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence).
2.Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_11312] a likely allergen for 
that subject (minutes to sev eral hours):
a)Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (e.g. generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula).
b)Respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097] (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, hy poxemia).
c)Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hypotonia [collapse ], syncope, incontinence).
d)Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdo minal pain, vomit ing).

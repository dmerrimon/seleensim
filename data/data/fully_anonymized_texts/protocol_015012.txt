Rationale and 
background  The four seasonal I nactivated Influenza V accines Fluarix, 
FluLaval, Fluarix Quadrivalent  and FluLaval Quadrivalent  
(collectively referred to as [COMPANY_004] seasonal  Inactivated Influenza 
Vaccines [[COMPANY_004] sIIVs]) are approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
for prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A 
subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the 
vaccine in persons [ADDRESS_640569] data such 
as vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 
days preceding conception , potential confounding factors (such

CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640570] -2017 10 as exposure to other medications) and information related to 
the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Research question 
and objectives  Co-primary objectives  
• To describe  the characteristics of prospectively reported  
pregnancies ( women vaccinated with Fluarix or FluLaval 
or Fluarix Quadrivalent  or FluLaval Quadrivalent  during 
pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception ) with 
abnormal pregnancy outcomes . 
• To assess the proportion of prospectively reported 
pregnancies (women vaccinated with Fluarix or FluLaval 
or Fluarix Quadrivalent  or FluLaval Quadrivalent  during 
pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception ) with 
abnormal pregnancy outcomes . 
Study design  
(Amended on 27 
October 2017) • This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy 
registries for Fluarix, FluLaval  and Fluarix 
Quadrivalent  and an ongoing PASS for  FluLaval 
Quadrivalent into a combined PASS for these four [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs. 
• This is an exploratory  prospective , observational, cohort  
study. The [COMPANY_004] sIIVs pregnancy registry study requires 
voluntary, prospective* reporting of eligible pregnancies 
by [CONTACT_498147] ( HCPs). Data such 
as vaccination with  [COMPANY_004] sIIVs during pregnancy or within 
28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors 
(such as exposure to other medica tions) and information 
related to the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected 
prospectively.  
*Some pregnancy exposures may be reported when the 
outcome is unknown (prospective reports). 
Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after 
pregnancy outcome has been identified (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.  
• This study is a post-marketing commitment in the US. 
• Study population: 
pregnant women, vaccinated with  [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding 
conception volunteering to take part in the study . 
• Type of study: self -contained. 
• Data collection: Initial and follow-up data will be 
collected using questionnaires ( Initial notification  form, 
Pregnancy outcome  form and [ADDRESS_640571]-
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640572] -2017 11 delivery follow-up form). Initial data can be collected 
from pregnant subjects, their healthcare providers or 
both. Follow-up of cases is performed within 2 months 
of the estimated date of delivery (EDD) to as certain 
outcome and approximately 6 months and 12 months after 
the EDD (for all live births  for whom the contact [CONTACT_498148] ) to ascert ain the presence of 
birth defects not diagnosed before.  Follow-up 
questionnaires can only be completed by [CONTACT_498149]/or HCP staff . 
• After transition of the ongoing pregnancy registries into 
one combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] s IIVs, data will be collected 
for a minimum of 5 years starting Q2 2014 
Population, 
including the setting and study population (Amended on 27 
October 2017) In the US, [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are indicated for prevention of disease 
caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine.
 Currently, [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are 
approved for use in persons 3 years of age and older or 6 months of age and older, depending on the vaccine.  
Size of the potential “at-risk” population 
In the year 2012, the fertility rate in the US was 63.2 births per 1000 women aged 15-44 years and there were 3.96 
million births [
CDC, 2012]. 
Number of pregnant vaccinees  
Although the number of pregnant women who will be 
vaccinated with  [COMPANY_004] IIVs through this registry  is impossible to 
predict, experiences with other vaccine pregnancy registries  
indicate that it is likely that fewer than 100 pregnancies  per 
year will be registered  for each of the vaccines.  
Variables  Primary endpoint  
Occurrence of  abnormal pregnancy outcomes in women 
intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs 
during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception. 
Data sources  
(Amended on 27 
October 2017) Reporting of vaccine -exposed pregnancies to the Registry is 
voluntary. Registration can be initiated from a HCP or from a consumer . Permission  
from consumers  is requested to 
obtain confirmation and follow -up from their HCP , as well 
as follow -up from the HCP of their infant . A toll-free 
telephone number for reporting adverse events ( AEs) and 
vaccine-exposed pregnancies to the Registry are listed in the  
product information leaflet and on the [COMPANY_004] Registry website. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640573] Section “Study population” above 
for the size of the potential “at -risk” population and the 
number of pregnant vaccinees.  
Data analysis  
(Amended on 27 
October 2017) Pregnancy outcomes include spontaneous abortio n (pregnancy 
loss before 22 weeks gestation), fetal deaths/stillbirths (loss 
at or after 22 weeks gestation),  elective/therapeutic abortions  
and live births. The presence or absence of birth defects or 
other abnormalities is evaluated within each of the pr eceding 
outcome categories.  
Pregnancy outcomes are stratified by [CONTACT_498150], with an additional stratum for preconception 
exposure with no subsequent administration of vaccine during pregnancy. Reports of multiple exposures during a pregnancy are classified by [CONTACT_498151]. The calculations of risk for birth defects are made by [CONTACT_498152] a nd without birth defects. An exact 95% 
confidence interval is calculated using standard statistical software. The 
outcomes of the study will be assessed against 
known rates from an external reference group for the likelihood of a safety signal warranting f urther investigation
. 
Spontaneous abortions without birth defects are excluded from 
the risk calculations.  
All defects regardless of trimester of vaccine exposure will be 
included in the periodic summary reports of this Registry and stratified by [CONTACT_498153].
 
A section of each periodic summary report, separate from the analysis of prospective reports, will describe all abnormal outcomes of retrospectively reported cases.
 
Milestones  
(Amended on 27 
October 2017) Summary reports with cumulative analyses will be written 
annually and submitted with the Periodic Benefit -Risk 
Evaluation Report (PBRER) for each [COMPANY_004] sIIV. A final 
report will be written and submitted approximately18 months 
after the last annual report.   
After submission of the final report, [COMPANY_004] will continue the 
Registry pending Center for Biologics Evaluation and

7.1.1. Trivalent influenza vaccine s 
Fluarix and FluLaval are both split virion, inactivated influenza vaccines consisting of 
equal amounts of three  monovalent viral antigen bulks prepared from influenza strains 
A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and one B strain. One dose of the split inactivated vaccine contains 15 
μg hemagglutinin (HA) for each of the three  influenza virus strains, for a total of 45 μg 
HA/0.5 mL dose. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640582] -2017 15 [IP_ADDRESS]. Animal studies  
Animal reproduction studies were performed in female rats using 0.1 mL (approximately 
56 times the human dose based on average weight) of Fluarix  administered 28 days 
before mating and on Days 6, 8, 11 and 15 of gestation. There were no adverse effects on mating performance or fertility of the female rats, and no adverse effects on embryo/fetal survival, growth or development, or the pre- or post -natal survival, growth or 
development of the offspring up to 25 days of age [ Fluarix Prescribing Information ( PI), 
2013]. 
In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study , the effects of FluLaval on embryo-
fetal and pre-weaning development were evaluated in pregnant rats. Animals were 
administered 
FluLaval by [CONTACT_80626], once prior to gestation and on 
gestation days 6, 8, 11, and 15 during the period of organogenesis, at a dose of 0.1 mL/rat/occasion (approximately 40-fold excess relative to the projected human dose on a 
body weight basis). No adverse effects on mating, female fertility, pregnancy, parturition, lactation parameters, and embryo -fetal or pre -weaning development were observed. 
There were no vaccine- related fetal malformations or other evidence of teratogenesis 
[FluLaval PI, 2013].

Quadrivalent  has been studied in female rats at doses approximately 80 times th e human 
dose (on a mg/kg basis) and no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus 
was observed.  
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies, the effect of Flu arix Quadrivalent 
and FluLaval Quadrivalent on embryo- fetal and pre- weaning development was evaluated 
in rats. Animals were administered Fluarix Quadrivalent or  FluLaval Quadrivalent  by

There are, however, no adequate and well -controlled studies of these 
vaccines in pregnant women. Review of the collective post marketing exposure

or lactating women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC, 2002]). 
7.1.3. Medical conditions for use  (Amended on 27 October 2017) 
The [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are approved by [CONTACT_197769] (FDA) for 
prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B 
viruses contained in the vaccines (Table 5). In the US, the [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are 
approved for use in persons [ADDRESS_640591] 
trimester, before pregnancy  is known. In general, the women are closely monitored 
throughout the remainder of the pregnancy.  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for potential annual exposure  in pregnant women.  
7.1.5. Potential benefits of product  
Because of the increased rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498141], parti cularly in the third trimester [ Neuzil, 1998], the CDC 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that any woman 
who will be pregnant during the influenza season should be vaccinated for influenza 
[CDC, 2011] and the American Colleg e of Obstetrics and Gynecology guidelines indicate 
that pregnant women may be vaccinated with IIV during any trimester [ACOG, 2004] . 
7.2. Rationale  
The purpose of this pregnancy r egistry study is to detect and describe abnormal pregnancy 
outcomes in women intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with  any of the four [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs. The combination of the large number of women who are of reproductive capacity  
in the indicated age range for vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs, and the lack of data 
concerning vaccination during pregnancy , makes such a Registry an important

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640592] -2017 20 component of the ongoing program to assess the safety of these vaccines. This study 
is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registries for Fluarix, FluLaval, and 
Fluarix Quadrivalent  and an ongoing PASS for  FluLaval Quadrivalent into a 
combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] sIIVs.  
The Registry requires voluntary, prospective reporting of eligible pregnancies by 
[CONTACT_498147]  (HCPs). Patient confidentiality is strictly 
maintained. The intent of the Registry is to prospectively  collect data such as 
vaccination with  any of the four [COMPANY_004] sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days 
preceding conception , potential confounding factors (such as  exposure to other 
medications)  and information related to the outcome of the pregnancy.  
The [COMPANY_004] sIIV pregnancy registry study will be maintained by [CONTACT_23983]’s Vaccine Clinical 
Safety and Pharm acovigilance (VCSP) department.  
8. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES  
8.1. Co-primary objectives 
• To describe  the characteristics of prospectively reported  pregnancies ( women 
vaccinated with Fluarix or FluLaval or Fluarix Quadrivalent  or FluLaval 
Quadrivalent  during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception ) with 
abnormal pregnancy outcomes . 
• To assess the proportion of prospectively reported  pregnancies ( women vaccinated 
with Fluarix  or FluLaval or Fluarix Quadrivalent  or FluLaval Quadrivalent  during 
pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception ) with abnormal pregnancy 
outcomes . 
Refer to Section 9.3.1 for the definition of the primary endpoint.

9.1. Study design 
9.1.1. Overview  (Amended on 27 October 2017) 
• This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registri es for Fluarix, 
FluLaval, and Fluarix Quadrivalent  and an ongoing PASS for  FluLaval 
Quadrivalent into a combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] sIIVs. 
• This is an exploratory,  prospective, observational, cohort study.  
• The [COMPANY_004] sIIV pregnancy registry study requires voluntary, prospective * 
reporting of eligible pregnancies by [CONTACT_498155]. Data such as vaccination 
with a [COMPANY_004] sIIV during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception , potential 
confounding factors (such as  exposure to other medications)  and information related 
to the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected prospectively.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640593] -2017 21 *Some pregnancy exposures may be reported when the outcome is unknown 
(prospective reports).  
Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after pregnancy outcome has been 
identified (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective report s, but 
these reports will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports. 
• This study is a post-marketing commitment in the US. 
• Study population: pregnant women, vaccinated with  [COMPANY_004] sIIV during pregnancy 
or within 28 days preceding conception , volunteering to take part  in the study . 
• Type of study: self -contained. 
• Data collection: initial and follow -up data will be collected using 3 
questionnaires.  Data for enrollment will be collected using the Initial 
Notification Form.  Follow-up of cases is performed within 2 months of the 
estimated date of delivery (EDD)  to ascertain pregnancy  outcome (through the 
Pregnancy Outcome Form)  and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the 
EDD (for all live births  for whom the contact [CONTACT_498156] ) 
to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before  (through th e 6- and 
12-month post -delivery Follow -Up Form ). 
• After transition of the ongoing pregnancy registrations into one combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] sIIVs, data will be collected for a minimum of 5 years starting Q2 2014 . 
9.1.2. Rationale for study design  
This is a condition based  Registry as opposed to a disease registry . After market 
authorization, adverse events (AEs) that occur after administration of the vaccine can and 
should always be reported. In that case, however, there is no clear group in which the events occur and  so a proper rate of occurrence cannot be estimated. In this pregnancy 
registry, participants are recruited between administration of the vaccine and the potential 
occurrence of an AE (i.e., a teratogenic effect in the offspring). This allows for a more 
proper estimation of the rate of occurrence of these events. Nevertheless, the result s of 
this study still need to be regarded with caution as the exact number of women exposed during pregnancy is unknown. Incidences of events cannot therefore be calculated from 
the study data.  
Furthermore, it is likely that pregnant women who accept vaccination may differ from those who refuse vaccination in underlying health status, propensity to seek medi cal care, 
propensity to report AEs and differences in access to medical care in general. The 
differential response/participation by [CONTACT_498157] a pregnancy registry could si gnificantly bias risk estimates  and possibly in unpredictable 
ways, because of the inability to collect adequate da ta to characterize the non -responders. 
Therefore, the risks of any identified birth defects will be compared to those in the general population, such as that defined by [CONTACT_498158] (MACDP) .

9.2.1. Study population  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Patient population  (Amended on 27 October 2017) 
In the US, t he [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are indicated for prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A 
subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine. [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are approved for 
use in persons 3 years of age and older or 6 months of age and older, depending on the 
vaccine. 
The study population includes women vaccinated  with any of the four  [COMPANY_004] sIIVs 
during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Potential annual exposure  (Amended on 27 October 2017) 
Size of the potential “at-risk” population 
In the year  2012, the fertility rate in the US was 6 3.2 births per 1000 women aged 
15-44 years and there were 3.96 million births [ CDC, 2012]. 
Number of pregnant vaccinees  
The four [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are classified as Pregnancy Category B. Although the number of 
pregnant women who will be  vaccinated with  [COMPANY_004] sIIV with this registry  is impossible to 
predict, experiences with other vaccine pregnancy registries (e.g., smallpox vaccine [CDC, 2003], varicella vaccine [
Shields, 2001] and Twinrix) indicate that it is likely that 
fewer than 100 pregnancies per year will be registered  for each of the vaccines. 
9.2.2. Patient recruitment  (Amended on 27 October  2017) 
Reporting of vaccine -exposed pregnancies to the Registry is voluntary. Reporters 
become aware of the Registry through the US Prescribing Information ( PI) and, in the 
case of healthcare providers,  the [COMPANY_004] Registry website. The PIs for each of the sIIVs and 
[COMPANY_004] Registry website each give a brief summary of the purpose and intent of the Registry, 
along with contact [CONTACT_3031]. The forms for enrolling and reporting outcomes are 
also accessible to healthcare providers through the [COMPANY_004] Registry website.  
Additionally, [COMPANY_004] has requested that information regarding [COMPANY_004] pregnancy registries be 
posted directly on the FDA website.  
9.2.3. Selection of a comparison group  
This registry study is a prospective cohort study. A ctive enrollment of a valid internal 
comparison group is not possible . The outcomes of the study will be assessed against 
known rates from an external reference group for the likelihood of a safety signal warranting further investigation
. Background risks from existing, external systems (e.g., 
the National Birth Defects Prevention Network and the National Center for Health 
Statistics) will be used.

intervals will be made to obtain more information via pregnancy follow -up 
form. 
 
For all reports:  
• Within [ADDRESS_640602] to follow -up. 
• An additional follow -up will be done for all live births  (as confirmed around EDD) 
at approximately 6 months  after the EDD to ascertain the presence of birth defects 
not diagnosed at the time of the initial follow -up. For this follow -up, the HCP 
supervising the health of the infant will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
• The last follow -up will be done for all live births  (as confirmed around EDD) at  
approximately 12 months after the EDD to ascertain the presence of birth defects not 
diagnosed at previous follow -ups. This follow -up will be done regardless of whether 
or not follow -up information was received at approximately 6 m onths after the

As explained in section 9.6.1 , within two months after the EDD  and if the HCP has not 
already provided the outcome, she/he is sent a  pregnancy  outcome form 
(questionnaire). The mode of communication is generally via a standard letter . 
Two attempts are made to secure the outcome information from the HCP. The second 
attempt also utilizes standard letter as mode  of contact.  For all live births (as confirmed 
around EDD) if the pregnant subject has previously provided her consent but has 
not already shared the contact [CONTACT_498165], two attempts are made to obtain this information.  
For all live births  (as confirmed around EDD)  and with the mother’s permission, two 
attempts are made to solicit information from the pediatrician and/or other special ists who 
have provided healthcare/consultation to the child  up until 12 months of age  (one 
attempt at around 6 months after EDD and another attempt at around 12 months 
after EDD) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Classification of outcomes  
This Registry uses the term ‘birth defects’  for outcomes sometimes referred to as 
‘congenital anomalies’.  For purposes of analysis, pregnancy outcomes are 
dichotomized according to the presence or absence of birth defects. The latter group is 
further categorized as: 1) live births, 2) spontaneous a bortions (i.e., pregnancy lo sses) 
and 3) induced abortions.  
This Registry adopts a definition of a child with a birth defect as any live or stillborn 
neonate with a structural or chromosomal abnormality diagnosed before 6 years of age. 
The Registry employs  a conservative approach of including all morphologic 
anomalies, includin g minor ones, as birth defects. To provide consistency in the 
definitions of major defects in this Registry, CDC MACDP criteria are used for the 
classification of defects [CDC, 2008;  Correa-Villasenor , 2003]. Some of the conditions 
excluded from the MACDP criteria for major structural defects may actually have major 
clinical, functional, or genetic significance. Therefore, minor malformations not appearing in the CDC Inclusion List may be classified as birth defects in this Registry. In  
addition, CDC guidelines disqualify as defects those findings that are present in infants delivered at less than 36 weeks of gestation and are attributable to prematurity itself, such as a patent ductus arteriosus or inguinal hernias. Infants with infectious conditions (e.g., neonatal sepsis) or isolated biochemical abnormalities (e.g., hyperbilirubinemia) are classified as being without birth defects unless there is a possibility that the condition reflects an unrecognized congenital abnormality. All othe r congenital abnormalities are 
included in the ‘ birth defects ’ category, regardless of whether the neonate is delivered 
alive, including structural defects in neonates delivered prior to 20 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 500 g.
 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640604] -2017 28 9.7. Data analysis (Amended on 27 October 2017)  
Pregnancy outcomes include spontaneous abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks 
gestation), fetal deaths/stillbirths (loss at or after 22 weeks gestation),  
elective/therapeutic abortions  and live births. Gestational weeks are counted from the 
date of the LMP. The second trimester is considered to begin at week [ADDRESS_640605] 
trimester begins at week 28. The presence or absence of birth defects or other 
abnormalities is evaluated within each of the preceding outcome categories.  
Pregnancy outcomes are stratified by [CONTACT_498150], with an additional stratum for preconception exposure with no subsequent administration of vaccine during pregnancy. Receiving multiple administrations of [COMPANY_004] sIIV during a single pregnancy 
is unlikely; however, if this does occur, reports of multiple exposures during a pregnancy are classified by [CONTACT_498151].  
The calculations of risk for birth defects are made by [CONTACT_498166]. 
Since the 
presence of birth defects will be assessed around EDD and at approximately 6 and 12 months after the EDD (for all live births), the calculation of risk will be performed for 
two separate cohorts: 1). the risk of birth defects for all subjects who completed the outcome form at around EDD (regardless of whether they were lost -to-follow up 
afterwards) and 2). the risk of birth defects for all subjects reporting live births and who completed either or both the [ADDRESS_640606] known rates from an external 
reference group for the likelihood of a safety signal warranting furthe r investigation . In 
each periodic and the final report s, the data will be analyzed for all [COMPANY_004] sIIVs pooled 
and for each of the 4 vaccines separately . The analyses will also include data collected 
cumulatively in each individual registry up to the initiation of the combined Registr y for 
[COMPANY_004] sIIVs. Individual reports of birth defects following vaccination with any of the 
[COMPANY_004] sIIVs will also be evaluated for causal assessments, as appropriate.  
The majority of spontaneous abortions occur early in pregnancy [Wilcox, 1981; 
Wilcox, 1983; Ellish, 1996]. If spontaneous abortions were to be evaluated as an 
outcome of interest, it would be essential to enroll pregnancies as soon as possible after 
vaccination with  [COMPANY_004] sIIV. Because enrollment and recognition of pregnancy would 
occur at various times, it would be virtually impossible to meaningfully evaluate the 
effects of [COMPANY_004] sIIV on pregnancy loss [Kennedy, 2004] . Therefore, spontaneous 
abortions without birth defects are excluded from the risk calculations.  
The risk in the general population of all birth defects meeting CDC criteria is approximately 3% (1 of 33) of live births 
[CDC, 2013]. The estimated risk cited in the 
medical literature varies because of differences in case d efinitions, populations sampled 
and ascertainment meth ods. The Collaborative Prenatal Project, using a broader case 
definition and prospective ascertainment, reports a frequency of 5% to 7% [ Chung, 
1975]. Most major structural defects originate during the first trimester of pregnancy, 
which is the critical time for organogenesis [Niebyl, 2012]. For such defects, exposures 
occurring in the second or third trimester are not likely to be causally associated. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640607] -2017 29 However, for the sake of completeness and to enable the assessment of possible increases 
in the frequency of birth defects, all defects will be included in the periodic summary 
reports of this Registry and stratified by [CONTACT_498167].  
Criteria for review of a specific individual report include:  
• Is the timing of the vaccination with  [COMPANY_004] sIIVs commensurate with the 
ontogenetic development of the organ(s) affected by [CONTACT_498168]?  
• Is there another known or likely cause (e.g., pre -existing genetic or chromosomal 
defect or exposure to a known teratogen)? 
• Is the congenital abnormality  not previously described (i.e., is it new to medical 
science)? 
• Is there a unique constellation of defects (i.e., is there a new syndrome)?  
Criteria for review of aggregate data include:  
• Is there a deviation from the expected frequency of all defects indicating an 
increase in the overall risk of defects?  
• Is there a deviation from the expected frequencies of individual defects?  
• Is there uniqueness (e.g., a pattern) of the abnormalities that  is suggestive of a common 
etiology?  
Studies have shown the risk of spontaneous abortion is high early in pregnancy and 
decreases substantially from week 8 to week 28, yielding a c umulative estimated risk of

1997; Khattak, 1999; Anderson , 2000; Osborn, 2000]. 
While the Registry is to be limited to prospective reports, some pregnancy exposures are reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified (retrospective reports). The 
Registry will capture retrospective report s, but these reports will not be included in the 
analyses of prospective reports. In general, retrospective notification  of outcomes 
following exposure to drugs or vaccines is biased toward reporting the severe and unusual cases and is not reflective of the general exp erience with the drug. Information 
about the total number of exposed pregnancies, i.e., the pool of exposures from which the retrospective reports arise, is unknown; therefore, incidences of outcomes cannot be calculated from these data. A series of report ed birth defects, however, can be analyzed to 
detect patterns of specific congenital abnormalities and can identify early signals of new vaccine-associated risks. A section of each periodic summary report, separate from the 
analysis of prospective reports, will describe all abnormal outcomes of retrospectively reported cases.  
9.8. Quality control  
Data will be recorded using questionnaires. Subject data necessary for analysis , follow-up 
and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database or data system. Data 
management will be performed in accordance with applicable [COMPANY_004] standards .

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640608] -2017 30 To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP) and all other applicable 
guidelines and regulatory requirements, [COMPANY_004] may conduct a quality assurance audit. 
Regulatory agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study. Such 
audits/inspections can occur at any time during or after completion of the study. 
9.9. Limitations of the research methods 
This Registry is a prospective voluntary  study. Active enro llment of a valid internal 
comparison group is not possible . Therefore, background risks from existing, external 
systems (e.g., the National Birth Defects Prevention Network and the National Center for Health Statistics) are used. The potential limitations of comparisons between Registry and background data depends upon the event(s) being compared and will be discussed on an ad hoc basis in the relevant periodic Registry reports. In addition, 
variations in the 
year-to-year (or strain), resulting in  differences in the safety profiles of the vaccines , 
remain a possible limitation.  
Refer to Section 9.1.2 for other potential limitations of the study.  
10. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
10.1. Regulatory and ethical considerations, including the 
informed consent process 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) Guideline for GCP  or other applicable guidelines, all applicable

Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product, or temporally associated with a study procedure. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i .e., lack of efficacy), abuse or 
misuse.

Non-interventional 
(observational) Human Subject Research:  Studies where medicinal products, should they be 
administered, are prescribed in normal (routine) medical practice. No medical care or medical/scientific procedures as required in a research protocol are administered to participants except as part of routine medical care.  
Post-Authorization 
Safety Study (PASS) : A pharmaco -epi[INVESTIGATOR_333841] a clinical trial 
carried out in accordance with the terms of the marketing authorization, conducted wit h the aim of identifying or 
quantifying a safety hazard relating to an authori zed 
medicinal product. This includes all [COMPANY_004] sponsored non-interventional studies and clinical trials conducted anywhere in the world that are in accordance with the terms of the  European marketing authoriz ation and where 
the investigation of safety is the specific stated objective.  
Note: The phrase ‘In accordance with the terms of  the 
European marketing authoriz ation’ means that the 
product is used according to the European label (e.g., within the recommended dose range, the approved formulation, indication etc.). 
Prospective study:  A study that looks ahead  for outcomes, e.g., the 
development of a disease, during the study period and relates this to other factors such as a potential risk due to 
exposure or protection factor(s). The study usually 
involves taking a cohort of subjects and watching them

Protocol amendment:  The International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) 
defines a protocol amendment as: ‘A written description 
of a change(s) to or formal clarification of a protocol.’ [COMPANY_004] Biologicals further details this to include a change to an approved protocol that affects the safety of subjects, scope of the investigation, study design, or scientific integrity of the study.  
Research protocol:  A document that describes the objective(s), design, 
methodology , statistical considerations  and organization 
of a study. The protocol usually also gives the background and rationale for the study, but these could be provided in other protocol referenced documents. 
Retrospective study:  A study that looks backward in time (e.g., at events that 
occurred in the past; outcomes and exposure can no longer be influenced), usually using medical records, databases or interviews in order to address one or more study objectives. 
Self-contained study:  Study with objectives not linked to the data of another 
study. 
Study population:  Sample of population of interest.

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640623] the following:  
Data collection: 
• Corrections were made throughout the protocol to reflect current practices for data 
collection, that two and not three follow up attempts are made around EDD to 
ascertain the presence of birth defects.  
• Follow-up questionnaires for all live births were not being sent at approximately 6 
and 12 months after EDD to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed 
at around EDD, contrary to what was described in the protocol. The importance of this information is acknowledged and both 6- and 12-month follow- up attempts 
will be implemented prospectively via a new data collection form. 
• Originally, pregnant subjects enrolled into the registry had to sign a consent form 
only when subjects  registered themselves into the registry, and to allow [COMPANY_004] to 
contact [CONTACT_85338] r HCPs at around EDD . Now, HCPs who register their pregnant 
patients will be encouraged to provide these with the consent form. With this  
consent, the HCP supervising the health of the infant up can also be contact[CONTACT_177226] 
[ADDRESS_640624] information on the infant’s healthcare provider. This new 
consent form will be implemented for all prospective reports. 
Exclusion criterion:  
• According to the exclusion criter ion detailed in section 9.2.[ADDRESS_640625] trimester of 
gestation, this exclusion criterion will pointedly limit the number of subjects who enroll into the registry and enrich for subjects with low prenatal care coverage. The registry protocol has been  updated to reflec t its current practices: pregnancies 
will be excluded from enrollment only if abnormal pregnancy outcomes are diagnosed before receipt of a [COMPANY_004] seasonal influenza vaccine.  
Pregnancy registry reports:  
• The dates for submission of the annual reports have been updated to reflect newer PBRER submission dates.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640626]-marketing exposure in pregnant women:  
• Numbers and outcomes of women exposed to each [COMPANY_004] sIIV during pregnancy 
since their respective launches and spontaneously reported into our safety database 
worldwide were updated. 
Data Analysis: 
• Since the 6 - and 12-month follow-ups will only be done prospectively, we propose 
calculating the risk of birth defects for two separate cohorts : 1). the risk of birth 
defects for all mother -child pairs with complete p regnancy outcome forms at 
around EDD (regardless of whether they were lost- to-follow up afterwards) and 2). 
the risk of birth defects for all mother-child pairs reporting live births at around 
EDD and who completed either or both the 6- and 12-month post-delivery follow -
up forms.  
Since this registry is currently ongoing, changes beyond those related to the items above were limited to minor updates for clarity purposes. 
These changes will be implemented within 30 days of approval by [CONTACT_1622].

Synopsis:  
Study design   • This study is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy 
registries for Fluarix, FluLaval  and Fluarix 
Quadrivalent  and an ongoing PASS for  FluLaval 
Quadrivalent into a combined PASS for these four [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs. 
• This is an exploratory  prospective , observational, cohort 
study. The [COMPANY_004] sIIVs pregnancy registry study requires 
voluntary, prospective* reporting of eligible pregnancies 
by [CONTACT_498147] (HCPs). Data such 
as vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs during pregnancy or within 
28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors 
(such as exposure to other medications) and information 
related to the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected prospectively.
 
*Some pregnancy exposures may be reported when the 
outcome is unknown (prospective reports). 
Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after 
pregnancy outcome has been identified (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.  
• This study is a post- marketing commitment in the US.  
• Study population: 
pregnant women, vaccinated with [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding 
conception volunteering to take part in the study . 
• Type of study: self -contained. 
• Data collection: initial and follow -up data will be 
collected using questionnaires ( Registration  Initial 
notification  form, Pregnancy  Outcome form and [ADDRESS_640628]-delivery follow-up form). Initial data 
can be collected from pregnant subjects, their 
healthcare providers or both.  Follow-up of cases is 
performed within 2 months of the estimated date of 
delivery (EDD) to ascertain outcome and  approximately 
6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for all live births  
for whom the contact [CONTACT_498156]
) to ascertain the presence of birth defects not 
diagnosed before.  Follow-up questionnaires can only be 
completed by [CONTACT_498171]/or HCP staff

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640629] -2017 42 participating in the care of the pregnant  female or 
offspring, as applicable . 
• After transition of the ongoing pregnancy registries into 
one combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] sIIVs, data will be collected 
for a minimum of 5 years starting Q2 2014 
Population, 
including the setting and study population  In the US, [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are indicated for prevention of disease 
caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine.
 [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are approved for use in 
persons 3 years of age and older . Currently, [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are 
approved for use in persons 3 years of age and older or 6 months of age and older, depending on the vaccine.
 
Size of the potential “at-risk” population 
In the year 2012, the fertility rate in the US was 63.2 births per 1000 women aged 15-44 years and there were 3.96 million births [
CDC, 2012]. 
Number of pregnant vaccinees  
Although the number of pregnant women who will be 
vaccinated with [COMPANY_004] IIVs through this registry  is impossible to 
predict, experiences with other vaccin e pregnancy registries  
indicate that it is likely that fewer than 100 pregnancies  per 
year will be registered  for each of the vaccines . 
Data sources  Reporting of vaccine -exposed pregnancies to the Registry is 
voluntary. Registration can be initiated from a HCP or from 
a consumer  in the latter case. Permission from consumers  is 
requested to obtain confirmation and follow -up from their 
HCP, as well as follow -up from the HCP of their infant . A 
toll-free telephone number for reporting adverse events (AEs) and vaccine-exposed pregnancies to the Registry are 
listed in the product information leaflet and on the [COMPANY_004] Registry website. Retrospective post-marketing reports and 
relevant scientific publications are potential sources of 
additional information.  
Data anal ysis Pregnancy outcomes include spontaneous abortion 
(pregnancy loss before  20 22 weeks gestation), fetal 
deaths/stillbirths (loss at or after  20 22 weeks gestation), 
elective/therapeutic abortions and live births. The presence or absence of birth defects or other abnormalities is 
evaluated within each of the preceding outcome categories.  
Pregnancy outcomes are stratified by [CONTACT_498150], with an additional stratum for preconception 
exposure with no subsequent administration of vaccine 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640630] 95% confidence interval is calculated using standard statistical software. The outcomes of the study will be assessed against known rates from an external reference group for the likelihood of a safety signal warranting further investigation.  
Spontaneous abortions without birth defects are excluded from the risk calculations.  
All defects regardless of trimester of vaccine exposure will be included in the periodic summary reports of this Registry and stratified by [CONTACT_498167].  
A section of each periodic summary report, separate from the analysis of prospective reports, will describe all abnormal outcomes of retrospectively reported cases.  
Milestones  Summary reports with cumulative analyses  will be written 
annually and submitted with the Periodic Benefit -Risk 
Evaluation Report (PBRER) for each [COMPANY_004] sIIV. A final 
report will be written and submitted [ADDRESS_640631] annual report. 
After submission of the final report, [COMPANY_004] will continue the 
Registry pending Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) review of the report and determination whether the Registry can be discontinued.

Section 7.1.3 Medical conditions for use 
The [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are approved by [CONTACT_197769] (FDA) for 
prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A subtype viruses and type B 
viruses contained in the vaccines (Table 5). In the US, the [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are 
approved for use in persons [ADDRESS_640642] and describe abnormal pregnancy outcomes in women intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with any of the four [COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs. The combination of the large number of women who are of reproductive capacity  
in the indicated age range for vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs, and the lack of data 
concerning vaccination during pregnancy , makes such a Registry an important 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640643] -2017 48 component of the ongoing program  to assess the safety of these vaccines. This study 
is a transition of existing ongoing pregnancy registries for Fluarix, FluLaval, and 
Fluarix Quadrivalent  and an ongoing PASS for  FluLaval Quadrivalent into a 
combined PASS for [COMPANY_004] sIIVs. Timelines for collection of follow-up data will be 
adapted in order to correspond to the follow-up timelines of other [COMPANY_004] pregnancy 
registries.  
The Registry requires voluntary, prospective reporting of eligible pregnancies by 
[CONTACT_498147] (HCPs) . Patient confidentiality is strictly 
maintained. The intent of the Registry is to prospectively collect data such as 
vaccination with any of the four [COMPANY_004] sIIVs  during pregnancy or within 28 days 
preceding conception , potential confounding factors (such as  exposure to other 
medications) and information related to the outcome of the pregnancy.  
The [COMPANY_004] sIIV pregnancy registry study will be maintained by [CONTACT_23983]’s Vaccine Clinical 
Safety and Pharm acovigilance (VCSP) department.  
Section 9.1.1 Study design overview 
• Data collection: initial and follow -up data will be collected using  2 3 
questionnaires. Data for enrollment will be collected using the Initial 
Notification Form.  Follow-up of cases is performed within  3 2 months of the 
estimated date of delivery (EDD) to ascertain pregnancy  outcome (through the 
Pregnancy Outcome Form)  and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the 
EDD (for all live births  for whom the contact [CONTACT_498156] ) 
to ascertain the presence of birth defects not diagnosed before  (through the 6- and 
12-month post -delivery Follow -Up Form ). 
Section 9.1.2 Rationale for the study design 
This study is designed as  a condition based Registry  as opposed to a disease registry . 
After market authorization, adverse events (AEs ) that occur after administration of the 
vaccine can and should always be reported. In that case, however, there is no clear group 
in which the events occur and so a proper rate of occurrence cannot be estimated. In this pregnancy registry, participants are recruited between administration of the vaccine and the potential occurrence of an AE (i.e., a teratogenic effect in the offspring). This allows for a more proper estimation of the rate of occurrence of these events. Nevertheless, the results of this stu dy still need to be regarded with caution as the exact number of women 
exposed during pregnancy is unknown. Incidences of events cannot therefore be calculated from the study data.  
Furthermore, it is likely that pregnant women who accept vaccination may differ from those who refuse vaccination in underlying health status, propensity to seek medical care, propensity to report AEs and differences in access to medical care in general. T he 
differential response/participation by [CONTACT_498157] a pregnancy registry could significantly bias risk estimates and possibly in unpredictable ways, because of the inability to collect adequate data to characterize th e non-responders.

201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640644] -2017 49 Therefore, the risks of any identified birth defects will be compared to those in the 
general population, such as that defined by [CONTACT_498158] (MACDP).  
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Patient population 
In the US, t he [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are indicated for prevention of disease caused by [CONTACT_14302] A 
subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine. [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are approved for 
use in persons 3 years of age and older or 6 months of age and older, depending on the 
vaccine. 
The study population includes women vaccinated with any of the four  [COMPANY_004] sIIVs 
during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception . 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Potential annual exposure 
Number of pregnant vaccinees  
The four [COMPANY_004] sIIVs are classified as Pregnancy Category B.  Although the number of 
pregnant women who will be vaccinated with [COMPANY_004] sIIV with this registry is impossible to 
predict, experiences with other vaccine pregnancy registries (e.g., smallpox vaccine 
[CDC, 2003], varicella vaccine [ Shields, 2001] and Twinrix ) indicate that it is likely that 
fewer than 100 pr egnancies per year will be registered  for each of the vaccines . 
Section 9.2.2 Patient recruitment  
Reporting of vaccine -exposed pregnancies to the Registry is voluntary. Reporters 
become aware of the Registry through the US Prescribing Information (PI)  and in the 
case of healthcare providers  the [COMPANY_004] Registry website. The PI s for each of the sIIVs  and 
[COMPANY_004] registry website each give a brief summary of the purpose and intent of the Registry, 
along with telephone and fax contact  [CONTACT_3031]. The forms for enroll ing and 
reporting outcomes are also accessible to healthcare providers through the [COMPANY_004] 
Registry website.  Additionally, [COMPANY_004] has requested that information regarding [COMPANY_004] 
pregnancy registries be posted directly on the FDA website.  
Section 9.2.[ADDRESS_640645] will be included in the Registry if all of the following criteria are met:  
• Exposure to [COMPANY_004] sIIVs  occurs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding 
conception. 
• Subject is a US resident.  
• A HCP is identified (name, address and phone number). 
• Subject can be identified (by [CONTACT_498159]).

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640646] -2017 50 Data from registered subjects will be included in the analyses if the following criterion is 
met: 
• Pregnancy is ongoing and the outcome is unknown at the time of initial report. 
Section 9.2.6 Exclusion criteria  
Data from registered subjects  will not be included in the analyses if the following 
criterion is met:  
• Outcome of pregnancy is known at the time of initial report. Types of known 
outcomes include prenatal testing reports in which the results are abnormal or 
outside the reference range, indicating possible abnormality in the fetus. Pregnancies 
in which prenatal testing indicates a normal pregnancy would also be excluded 
because inclusion of such pregnancies could potentially bias results toward a lower 
overall estimate of risk for defects [ Honein, 1999]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_498146] > [ADDRESS_640647] undergone prenatal testing that can identify whether a ch ild has

Section 9.3.2 Data to be collected  
Data will be collected using  2 3 questionnaires; one for enrollment  (i.e. Initial 
Notification Form) initial data  and, one for follow -up data after the EDD  (i.e. 
Pregnancy Outcome Form)  and one for infant data at about 6 and 12 months after 
EDD (i.e. 6- and 12-month post- delivery Follow -Up Form.  
With the information gathered from these questionnaires, the frequency of birth defects among enrolled subjects will be calculated and individual reports will be evaluated for causal assessments, if possible.

collected before the outcome is known. Follow -up of cases is performed at the 
following timepoints :, with each follow -up independent from the others:  
For consumer reports:  
• At initial notification of pregnancy exposure: 2 attempts at 4 -6 week intervals 
will be made to obtain more information about the pregnancy (e.g. estimated

• The last follow -up will be done for all live births  (as confirmed around EDD) at  
approximately 12 months after the EDD to ascertain the presence of birth defects not 
diagnosed at previous follow -ups. 
Section 9.6.2  Processing of reports  
Initial rReports are entered into the [COMPANY_004] safety database by [CONTACT_498173]’s 
worldwide safety database  using existing mechanisms and practices. Follow -up is 
conducted by [CONTACT_498174]. The HCP  supervising the pregnancy  is

Section [IP_ADDRESS]  Solicitation of outcome  
As explained in section 9.6.1 , within three  two months after the EDD and if the HCP has 
not already provided the outcome, she/he is sent an a pregnancy  outcome form 
(questionnaire), along with a copy of the initial completed pregnancy form. The 
mode of communication is the one through which the initial information was 
received (telephone, fax, or postal mail)  generally via a standard letter .

Section 9.7  Data analysis 
Pregnancy outcomes include spontaneous abortion (pregnancy loss before  20 22 weeks 
gestation), fetal deaths/stillbirths (loss at or after 20 22 weeks gestation), 
elective/therapeutic abortions and live births. Gestational weeks are counted from the date of the LMP . The second trimester is considered to begin at week [ADDRESS_640654] 
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640655] -2017 54 trimester begins at week 28. The presence or absence of birth defects or other 
abnormalities is evaluated within each of the preceding outcome categories. 
Pregnancy outcomes are stratified by [CONTACT_498150], with an additional 
stratum for preconception exposure with no subsequent administration of vaccine during pregnancy. Receiving multiple administrations of [COMPANY_004] sIIV during a single pregnancy 
is unlikely; however, if this does occur, reports of multiple exposures during a pregnancy are classified by [CONTACT_498151].  
The calculations of risk for birth defects are made by [CONTACT_498166]. 
Since the 
presence of birth defects will be assessed around EDD and at approximately 6 and 12 months after the EDD (for all live births), the calculation of risk will be performed for two separate cohorts: 1). the risk of birth defects for all subjects who completed the outcome form at around EDD (regardless of whether they were lost -to-follow up 
afterwards) and 2). the risk of birth defects for all subjects reporting live births and who completed either or both the [ADDRESS_640656] known rates from an external 
reference group for the  likelihood of a safety signal warranting further investigation . In 
each periodic and the final reports, the data will be analyzed for all [COMPANY_004] sIIVs pooled and for each of the 4 vaccines separately. The analyses will also include data collected cumulativel y in each individual registry up to the initiation of the combined Registry for 
[COMPANY_004] 
sIIVs. Individual reports of birth defects following vaccination with any of the 
[COMPANY_004] sIIVs will also be evaluated for causal assessments, as appropriate.  
The majority of spontaneous abortions occur early in pregnancy [ Wilcox, 1981; 
Wilcox, 1983; Ellish, 1996]. If spontaneous abortions were to be evaluated as an 
outcome of interest, it would be essential to enroll pregnancies as soon as possible after 
vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIV. Because enrollment and recognition of pregnancy would 
occur at various times, it would be virtually impossible to meaningfully evaluate the 
effects of [COMPANY_004] sIIV on pregnancy loss [ Kennedy, 2004]. Therefore, spontaneous 
abortions without birth defects are excluded from the risk calculations.  
The risk in the general population of all birth defects meeting CDC criteria is approximately 3% (1 of 33) of live births 
[CDC, 2013]. The estimated risk cited in the 
medical literature varies because of differences in  case definitions, populations sampled 
and ascertainment methods. The Collaborative Prenatal Project, using a broader case definition and prospective ascertainment, reports a frequency of 5% to 7% [
Chung, 
1975]. Most major structural defects originate during the first trimester of pregnancy, 
which is the critical time for organogenesis [Niebyl, 2012]. For such defects, exposures occurring in the second or third trimester are not likely to be causally associated. However, for the sake of completeness and to enable the assessment of possible increases in the frequency of birth defects, all defects will be included in the periodic summary reports of this Registry and stratified by [CONTACT_498167].  
CONFIDENTIAL  
201476 (EPI -FLU-039 VS US PR) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_640657] -2017 55 Criteria for review of a specific individual report include:  
• Is the timing of the vaccination with [COMPANY_004] sIIVs commensurate with the 
ontogenetic development of the organ(s) affected by [CONTACT_498168]?  
• Is there another known or likely cause (e.g., pre -existing genetic or chromosomal 
defect or exposure to a known teratogen)?  
• Is the congenital abnormality not previously described (i.e., is it new to medical 
science)? 
• Is there a unique constellation of defects (i.e., is there a new syndrome)?  
Criteria for review of aggregate data include:  
• Is there a deviation from the expected frequency of all defects indicating an increase in the overall risk of defects?  
•
 Is there a deviation from the expected frequencies of individual defects?  
• Is there uniqueness (e.g., a pattern) of the abnormalities that  is suggestive of a common 
etiology?  
Studies have shown the risk of spontaneous abortion is high early in pregnancy and 
decreases substantially from week 8 to week 28, yielding a cumulative estimated risk of 10% to 22%
 [Wilcox, 1981; Wilcox, 1983; Wilcox, 1988;  Fenster, 1997; Windham , 
1997; Khattak, 1999; Anderson , 2000; Osborn, 2000]. 
While the Registry is to be limited to prospective reports, some pregnancy exposures are reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports will not be included in the 
analyses of prospective reports. In general, retrospective notification of outcomes following exposure to drugs or vaccines is biased toward reporting the severe and unusual cases and is not reflective of the general experience with the drug. Information about the total number of exposed pregnancies, i.e., the pool of exposures from which the retrospective reports arise, is unknown; therefore, incidences of outcomes cannot be calculated from these data. A series of reported birth defects, however, can be analyzed to detect patterns of specific congenital abnormalities and can identify early signals of new vaccine-associated risks. A section of each periodic summary report , separate from the 
analysis of prospective reports, will describe all abnormal outcomes of retrospectively reported cases.  
Section 9.9  Limitations of the research methods

who are followed prospectively . Active enrollment of a valid internal comparison 
group is not possible . Therefore, background risks from existing, external systems 
(e.g., the National Birth Defects Prevention Network and the National Center for Health 
Statistics) are used. The potential limitations of comparisons between Registry and 
background data depends upon the event(s) being compared and will be discussed on an 
ad hoc basis in the relevant periodic Registry reports.  In addition, variations in the

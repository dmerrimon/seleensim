Study Overview  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
High blood pressure can affect a person’s thinking abilities.  The purpose of this study is to 
compare the effect of two high blood pressure drugs, candesartan and lisinopril, on thinking 
abilities and brain activities. Both drugs are approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for treatment of high blood pressure . However, in this study th ey are 
considered experimental because they are being used to compare how the drugs affect memory 
and thinking abilities. If you agree you will be randomized, that is selected by a 50% chance, to 
take either candesartan or lisinopril for your blood pressure.  
 
You have been invited to participate because you are [ADDRESS_822689] early/mild limitations in their thinking abilities. We will test your thinking ability at our first meeting to confirm that you are eligible to take part in the study.  
 
About [ADDRESS_822690] 5 times during that year. The following describes what happens at each visit:  
 Screening visit: (40 -60 minutes) 
 During this visit, we will: 
• Explain the study details  
• Ask you questions about your medical problems and medications  
• Check your blood pressure

IRB Form 10012013  • Test your thinking abilities. Please note that a large proportion of potential participants 
will not be eligible based on the results of these tests.   
If you qualify and you agree to participate, we will enroll you in this study. You will be asked 
to identify an individual who is willing to act as a study partner and who is familiar with your daily activities, if needed. We will also draw a blood sample (half to 1 teaspoon).  
 
If you do not qualify then we will not proceed  with your study participation and you will not 
undergo any of the procedure s in the rem ainder of this document.  
 If you are taking blood pressure medications , you will need to stop these medications before 
you start one of the two study medications used in this study (candesartan or lisinopril). W e will 
take special steps to ensure your safety during the process of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618824]:  
 1. If you agree, we will inform your primary care doctor that you are interested in participating 
in a research study and that your blood pressure medications will be stopped gradually.    
 
2. We will give you an automatic blood pressure machine and a diary to take home with you. 
We will teach you how to use the blood pressure machine and ask you to measure and record 
your blood pressure twice a day (morning and before sleep).  
 
3- You will also be contact[CONTACT_618833] a week (more if needed) 
to review your blood pressure recordings and your progress on decreasing your medications.  
 
4. You will receive written instructions on how to lower your current blood pressure 
medications and eventually stop them. The instructions will give the dose of each medication 
that you will be taking each day until you completely stop all blood pressure treatments.  
 
5. If your reading of the upper number is higher than 180 or the lower number is 110or higher, 
we will ask you to repeat the blood pressure check within an hour. If the second reading is still 
above 180/[ADDRESS_822691] you on what to do next: which may include altering the way your blood pressure medication is being reduced, take an extra dose of your blood pressure medication, or resume 
your usual doses of all your blood pressure medications immediately (the dose s you were on 
before you started the study). You will continue measuring your blood pressure as instructed. The study personnel will then contact [CONTACT_618834]. This will 
continue until your blood pressure is back to the level before you started the medication reduction or you have seen/contact[CONTACT_618835]. For your safety, you will not be enrolled in the study if you could not stop your blood pressure medication.

provide you with a supply of the study drug (either candesartan or lisinopril) and ask you to start the study medication the same day, after you perform the baseline study procedures.  
 If you are not taking any blood pressure medications before the study, then we will schedule the baseline visit without stopp ing any medication.  
 
Baseline Visit  (3 and a half to 4 hours) :  
 
You can complete this visit on one day or divide it into [ADDRESS_822693] your 
voice for 5- 10 minutes to assess certain patterns in your speech. This will be done during the 
memory tests or during a different time at one or more of your visits. We will also ask you to 
complete a few questionnaires  regarding your physical and daily activities.  Some of these will 
be mailed to you so you can complete them before your visit.  A blood sample (1- and-a-half to 
2-and-a-half Tablespoons) will also be drawn to measure the number of specialized cells in the 
blood that can line up your arteries, the degree of inflammation, and the APO E gene that is 
involved in making a protein called apolipoprotein E. A urine test will also be obtained to check for proteins in the urine. The blood and urine tests will be completed either at Emory University 
or an external laboratory. Your samples may be stored temporarily until shipped to the external laboratory at Emory University storage sites.  
 You will have an MRI of your head that will provide us with detailed information about the health of your brain. The MRI does not use x- rays or radiation. We would like your permission 
to share your information (after removing your name) with other research investigators and to contact [CONTACT_618836]. These choices are optional. You can still take part in this study even if you say no to these options. You will initial at the end of this 
form with your choice.  
 The MRI scans will be obtained at the Emory Center for System Imaging.  These scans will 
take about 50- [ADDRESS_822694] the scan, you may be asked to change into a gown 
and remove all metal objects (like earrings or watches) from your body. Throughout the exam, 
there will be loud thumpi[INVESTIGATOR_618825]. Earplugs will be provided to help reduce the noise. You may feel a warming sensation in your body during the 
MRI. You must lie still on a padded table during the scan.  
 
We will be monitoring your blood pressure, heart rate, and comfort level during the scan 
procedure. We will also record the amount of carbon dioxide that you breathe out of your nose.

receive candesartan or lisinopril. There is about 50% chance of being assigned to either group. We will give you a month supply of your assigned drug (candesartan or lisinopril), instruct you 
on how to take it, and ask you to come back in [ADDRESS_822697] results will not be disclosed to you unless deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_618837]: These visits will last about 20-30minutes. The first one occurs 2 
weeks after the baseline visit. We will measure your blood pressure twice in the seated position 
during each of these visits and at 1 and 3 minutes after standing. If your blood pressure is less 
than 140/90, then you will continue on the same dose, a blood sample will  be drawn (half to 1 
teaspoon) to check your potassium level and kidney function, and you will be scheduled for a 
follow-up visit in [ADDRESS_822698] both.  
 If your blood pressure is 140/[ADDRESS_822699] that you come back for another visit in 2 weeks.  If your blood pressure is still 140/90 or greater, then we will increase the dose of your medication further.  A blood sample 
will be drawn (half to 1 teaspoon) to check your potassium level and kidney function during this 
visit. Afterwards, we will see you every 2 weeks until your blood pressure is below 140/90. If 
additional medications are needed then hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_618826].

Page 6 of 17  Version Date: 6/22/2017 
IRB Form 10012013  Follow-up visits: You will also be seen at 3, 6 and 12 months. We will measure your weight 
and blood pressure at each visit. We will also repeat your tests of the thinking abilities at 6 and 
12 months. Your brain scan, neck ultrasound, walking speed, balance, and ability to perform 
daily activities will be measured again at 12 months.  We will also obtain urine samples and 
draw blood samples at the 6 and 12 months visits : (1-and-a-half to 2-and-a-half Tablespoons). 
During this phase, we will also call you monthly to ask you if you have missed any doses of 
your blood pressure medications or if you have had any problem related to taking your blood pressure medication.  
 Once you complete the study, we will inform you and your primary care doctor of what medication you were receiving (un- blinding). You will have the option to continue on the same 
regimen that you were receiving in the study or go back to your previous medication regimen. We recommend that you discuss your options with your primary care doctor. You will need to make arrangements with your primary care doctor to discuss these options. We will supply you 
with one extra month of the medication regimen so that you have time to make arrangements with your primary care doctor.   
 
Risks and Discomforts  
 
Risks from stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_618827] : During the medication switching phase 
there is a risk of severe elevation of blood pressure, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, 
severe headache with no known cause, or difficulty speaking. These can be signs of a Stroke. 
Please Call [ADDRESS_822700] with.   
 
Risks from the study medications : The medications that will be given during the course of the 
study, lisinopril, candesartan, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol are approved by 
[CONTACT_15847] (FDA) and are commonly used by [CONTACT_618838].    If you have a side effect or have developed a new medical problem that prevents you 
from taking the study medication you will be asked to resume your previous blood pressure 
medications. You will also be referred back to your primary care doctor for further blood pressure treatment. You will continue in the study and will be asked to come  back for your 
scheduled visits.  
  The possibility of side effects or an allergic reaction related to these medications is no different 
than if your doctor prescribed them.  You will be carefully monitored throughout the study for 
any side effects related to these medicat ions. The potential side effects are listed below. Please

started on them while you are enrolled in this study: Simvastatin (also called Zocor) at doses 
greater than 20, reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (serpalan), clonidine (catapress) or lithium.  
 
Risks from study procedures :  
 There may be minor discomfort from the needle stick when a blood sample is taken during 
screening and follow -up visits and a small chance of a bruise in the area of the needle stick.  In 
rare instances a person may experience dizziness and may faint during a needle stick.  
 You may experience anxiety, frustration and overall fatigue from the thinking tests. You can choose to skip or stop answering any questions that make you uncomfortable. There is possible minor discomfort of the ultrasound device placed against your skin. The inflation of the blood 
pressure cuff on your arm may make you feel like your arm went to sleep. This goes away after 
we deflate the cuff  
  
Brain imaging requires you to stay still and lie down for 50 -60 minutes which may cause slight 
back pain. You may feel claustrophobic (fear of enclosed spaces) or anxious since you will be 
enclosed in a clo sed space. If you experience claustrophobia while in the machine the scan will 
be stopped at your request. Some people may be uncomfortable due to the loud noise that occurs during the scan. You will be given earplugs to protect your ears. During the scan,  a small 
percentage of people may experience muscle twitches, tingling sensations, or headaches, but 
these sensations are not harmful. If you experience such sensations, immediately report them to 
the operator and adjustments will be made to prevent such sensations.  
 
There is a chance that you may feel dizzy or lightheaded when breathing through the mask or 
breathing carbon dioxide.  If you feel dizzy or lightheaded, we will stop the flow of CO
2 and the 
mask will be removed.

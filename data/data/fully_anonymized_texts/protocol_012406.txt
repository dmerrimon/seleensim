Page 10PROTOCOL SUMMARY
The current presentation of testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523096] (supersaturation) with respect to the active pharmaceutic al ingredient (API) and 
therefore makes the product susceptible to crystallization when exposed to lower
temperatures than recommended on the approved label [20°C to 25 °C (68°F to 77°F)].  
Currently the 200 mg/mL [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information1(USPI) include “Warming
and shaking the vial should re-di ssolve any crystals that may have formed during storage at
temperatures lower than recommended”.  To avoid crystallization and maintain true solution
properties, the 200 mg/mL formulation i s being modified to impro ve the solubility of the
active ingredient in the vehicle.  The current study will be ass essing the bioequivalence (BE)
and tolerability between the currently approved formulation and t he reformulated 
presentation of testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523097].
This is an open-label, randomize d, 2-treatment, single-dose, cros s-over study, 2-part design 
to evaluate the BE and tolerability of testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523098] (IM)
injection in healthy hypogonadal male subjects (ages of 18 to 65 y ears).
The objectives and endpoints of this study are listed below.
Part 1
Primary Objective: Primary Endpoints:
•To estimate the exposure variability of the
test and reference formulations of
testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523099] (200 mg) given intramuscularlyas a single dose.•AUC

In Part 1, approximately 12 subjects w ill be enrolled to ensure 10 evaluable subjects in the
study.  Subjects will be randomized according to a computer-gen erated randomization
schedule to receive the following 2 treatments below in random order .
Treatment A:A single testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523097] (new for mulation) 200 mg dose
administered IM deep in the gluteal muscle (Test formulation).
Treatment B:A single testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523097] (currently marketed formulation)
200 mg dose administered IM deep in the gluteal muscle (Reference formulation).
In Part 2, approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled to ensure 57 evaluable subjects in the 
study. In Part 2, the variability associated with maximum observed  concentration (C
max) and 
area under the curve (AUC) as well as the point estimates obtained  from Part 1 were to be 
used to inform the sample size needed to attain BE.CCI

sequence, period andtreatment asfixed effects andsubject within sequence as arandom
effect .Estimates of the adjusted mean differences (Test –Reference) and corresponding
90% confidence intervals willbeobtained from the mode l. The adjusted mean differences 
and 90% confidence intervals for the differences will be ex ponentiated to provide estimates of 
the ratio of adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% confidence intervals for the 
ratios.
For each Part separately , pharmacokinetic (PK) concentrations and parameters will be listed,
summarized descriptively and graphed per sponsor standards.
If results from Part [ADDRESS_678763] variability ≥30% (eg ,highl yvariable drug), the
study design and/or methodology of data analy sismay be modified.

Page 151.INTRODUCTION
The current presentation of testosterone cy pi[INVESTIGATOR_523097] (200 ng/mL) is 
highl y concentrated (supersaturation) with respect to the active API [INVESTIGATOR_523100] a pproved label [20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)].  Currently  the product USPI 1includes 
“Warming and shaking the vial should re -dissolve an y crystals that may  have formed during 
storage at temperatures lower than recommended”.  T o avoid cry stallization and maintain
true solution properties, the 200 mg/mL formulation is being modified to improve the 
solubility  of the active ingredient in the vehicle, via an increase in the concentration of 
benzy l benzoate from 20% to 30% and a comm ensurate reduction in cottonseed oil from
560mg to 470 mg to maintain mass balance. The current study  will be assessing the BE and 
tolerability  between the currentl y approved formulation and the reformulated presentation of 
testosterone cy pi[INVESTIGATOR_523101] n for injection.
1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication
Testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523102].1
Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired)- testicular failure due to
cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis s yndrome; or
orchidectom y.
Hypogonadotropic hy pogonadism (congenital or acquired) -idiopathic gonadotr opin or
Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) deficiency , or
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma, or radiation.
1.2.Background
Endogenous androgens are responsible for normal growth and development of the male sex
organs and for maintenanc e of secondary sex characteristics.[ADDRESS_678768] been reported to increase protein anabolism and 
decrease protein catabolism.  Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient 
intake of calories and protein.
During exogenous administration ofandrogens, endogenous testosterone release isinhibited 
through feedback inhibition of pi[INVESTIGATOR_523103] (LH ). At large doses of 
exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_72094] -stimulating hormone (FSH).  There is a lack o f substantial evidence that 
androgens are effective in fractures, surgery , convalescence, and functional uterine bleeding.

determining the risk of major adverse c ardiovascular events (MACE).  Some studies, but not 
all, have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone 
replacement therap y in men. Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding 
whether to use or to contin ue to use DEPO -Testosterone (testosterone cy pi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]).   
Testosterone has been subject to abuse, t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y at doses higher than recommended for the 
approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids.  Edema, 
with or without conges tive heart failure, may  be a serious complication in patients with

document, which for this study is the Depo -Testosterone USPI .1
1.3.Rationale
1.3.1. Study Rationale
The current study will be assessing the BE between the current formulation (Referenc e
formulation) andthereformulated presentation of testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523107] (Test
formulation) at asingle 200 mg IM dose administered deep inthegluteal muscle. Since
endogenous testosterone can interfere with the interpretation of systemic testosterone levels,
the study will be conducted in hy pogonadal males defined as subjects having serum
testosterone levels below 2.5 ng/mL (250 ng/dL). Overall, thestudy design incorporates

1.3.2. Dose Rationale
Testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523108] c urrently approved for
testosterone replacement therapy in hypogonadal men. Testosterone  cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523109] 100 mg/mL strength (in 10 mL vials) and  in 200 mg/mL strength (in
1 and 10 mL vials).  The suggested dosage for testosterone cypio nate solution for injection
varies depending on the age, sex, and diagnosis of the individu al patient. Dosage is adjusted
according to the patient’s response and the appearance of adver se reactions.  For testosterone 
replacement therapy in the hypogonadal male, it is recommended that 50-400 mg should be
administered every 2 to 4 weeks (per the USPI).1  A 200 mg dose is selected for this study as
the recommended dose in the drug label for hypogonadal males is 2 00 mg administered IM
every 2 weeks (USPI).1

to evaluate the BE and tolerability of testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523110] (IM) 
administration in healthy hypogonadal male subjects (ages of 18 t o 65 years). In Part 1, 
approximately 12 subjects will be e nrolled in the study to ensure 10 evaluable subjects are to 
be randomized according to a computer-generated randomization sch edule to receive the 
following 2 treatments below in random order.
Treatment A: A single testosterone cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523097] (new form ulation)

In Part 2, the observed variability  associated with C maxand AUC as well as the point 
estimates obtained from Part 1, were used to estimate the sample size needed to attain 
bioequivalence (BE) in Part 2. In Part 2, it is anticipated that approximately 60 subjects will 
be enrolled to ensure 57 evaluable subjects. Subjects will be ran domized according to a 
computer -generated randomization schedule to receive the 2 treatments (eg, same as listed in 
Part 1) in a random order.
As results from Part [ADDRESS_678774] variability ≥30% (eg ,highl y variable 
drug) with respect to baseline corrected testosterone PK parameters, thestudy design and 
methodology for data analy sisof Part 2 has been modified to a partial replicate design .

Page 244.3.4. Contraception
All fertile male subjects, who are,intheopi[INVESTIGATOR_523112], sexually active and at
risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly effective method of 
contraception consistently and correctly  for the duration of the active treatment period and for 
at least [ADDRESS_678791] and his or partner(s) from th e
permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has
been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities, the investigator or designee wi ll inform the subject of the need to use highl y
effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the
subject’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjects need to affirm their consistent and
correct use of at least 1 of the selected methods of contraception).   In addition, the
investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected 
contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the partner.
Highl y effective m ethods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and
include the following:
Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD ).
Male condom or female condom used WITHa separate spermicide product (ie, foam,
gel, film, cream, or suppository ). For countries where spermicide is not available or
condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highl yeffective contraception, this option
is not appropriate.
Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate.
Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8820] y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject.

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study ,and per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)
guidelines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical trial,
including aproduct with amarketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or
packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E61.33).
For this study ,the investigational products are:
Testosterone C ypi[INVESTIGATOR_523094] 200 mg/mL (Test);
Testosterone C ypi[INVESTIGATOR_523094] 200 mg/mL (Reference).
5.1.Allocation toTreatment
The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a 
particular subject or affect the order in which subjects are enrolled.
The investigator will assign subject numbers to the subjects as they  are screened for the 
study .  [COMPANY_007] will provide a randomization schedule to the investigator and, in accordance 
with the randomization numbers, the subject will receive the study  treatment regimen 
assigned to the correspond ing randomization number.

Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temper atures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products). This should 
be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study .Even for 
continuous- monitoring sy stems , a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for 
excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum
temperature is checked each business day  to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last 
evaluation and to provide the site with the capability  to store or view the minimum/maximum 
temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the 
temperature -monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applica ble, 
should be regularl y inspected to ensure they  are maintained in working order.

6.2.Study Period
Refer to Schedule of Activities for the study procedures tobecompleted. For the study
period described below, when multiple procedures are scheduled at the same time point(s)
relative to dosing, the follo wing chronology of events should be adhered to, where possible.
ECGs: obtain prior to vital sign measurements and as close as possible to the
scheduled time, but prior to blood specimen collection;
BP/pulse rate: obtain as close as possible to the schedule dtime, butprior toblood
specimen collection;
PK blood specimens: obtain atthe scheduled time;
Other procedures: obtain all other procedures as close as possible to the scheduled
time, but may be obtained before or after blood specimen collection.
When an intravenous (IV)catheter is utilized for blood sample collections, ECGs and vital
sign assessments (pulse rateandBP) should be collected prior to the insertion of the catheter.
There will be an interval of at least 45 daysbetween study periods (ie, administration 
of subsequent doses of investigational product will not occur until at least 45days 
after theprevious dose ofinvestigational product). All study periods will be 
conducted identically to that described above.
If asubject has anyclinical ly significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of a
scheduled inpatient portion of the study , the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor (ordesignated

6.4.Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw from the study at an ytime at their own request, or they may be
withdrawn at anytime atthediscretion oftheinvestigator orsponsor forsafety (see also the
Withdrawal From the Study Due to AEs section) orbehavioral reasons, or the inability of the
subject to comply with the protocol -required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given
investigator site.   Theearly termination visit applies only to subjects who are randomized and
then are prematurely withdrawn from the study .
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should bemade tocontact [CONTACT_1560]. The investigator or site staff should attempt to contact [CONTACT_110280]. After
2attempts, CRU staff may send aregistered letter .Ifnoresponse isreceived from the 
subject, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up. All attempts tocontact [CONTACT_523138]’s
medical record. In anycircumstance, every effort should be made to document subject
outcome, if possible . The investig ator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request 
thatthe subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding 
anyunresolved AEs.
Lost to follow -up is defined as:
Allreasonable efforts must bemade tolocatesubjects todetermine andreport their ongoing 
status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by[CONTACT_74084] . All
attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records.  If it is determined that the 
subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of 
death . Iftheinvestigator’s use of athird-party  representative to assist in the follow -up

12-Lead ECG measurement;
Blood and urine specimens for safety laboratory ;
Blood sample for PK analy sis.
Lack of completion of all or anyof the withdrawal/earl y termination procedures will not be
viewed as protocol deviations so long as the subject’s safet y was preserved.
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use anydata collected before such
withdrawal of consent.
Withdrawal of consent is defined as:
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will rem ain in the study and
must continue tobefollowed forprotocol -specified follow -upprocedures. The only
exception to this is when asubject specifically  withdraws consent for any further contact [CONTACT_523140]. 
Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from
future follow -up,whenever possible.  The withdrawal of consent should be explained in
detail in the medical records by [CONTACT_3170], as to whether the withdrawal is only from 
further receipt of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment
study follow -up,and entered on the appropriate CRF page.  In the event that vital status
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information 
should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately  directed in accordance with
local law.
Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the investiga tor
upon consultation with the sponsor.

Page 347.1.2. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations may  be conducted by  a ph ysician, trained ph ysician’s assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. A full ph ysical examination 
will include head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, ly mph nodes, 
and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurolog ical sy stems. The limited or abbreviated 
physical examination will be focused on general appearance, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_31000] s ystems, and subject -reported s ymptoms.
For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be 
placed on a stable, flat surface. Subjects must remove shoes, bulky  layers of clothing, and 
jackets so that only  light clothing remains.  They  must also remove the contents of their 
pockets and remain still during measurement of weight.
7.1.3. Blood Pre ssure (BP) and Pulse Rate
BP and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in the Schedule of Activities /STUDY 
PROCEDURES section of this protocol. Additional collection times, or changes to 
collectio n times, of BP and pulse rate will be permitted, as necessary , to ensure appropriate 
collection of safety  data.
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_523115]’s arm supported at the level of the heart, and 
recorded to the nearest mm Hg after approximately  [ADDRESS_678808].  The same arm 
(preferabl y the dominant arm) will be used throughout the study .  Subjects should be 
instructed not to speak during measurements.
The same properl y sized and calibrated BP cuff will be used to measure BP each time. The 
use of an automated device for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable; however, when 
done manuall y, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least
30seconds.  When the timing of these measurements coincides with a blood collection, BP
and pulse rate should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection.
7.1.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG)
12-Lead ECGs should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities /STUDY 
PROCEDURES section of this protocol.
All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly  for at least 
10minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].
To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigator site will make 
comparisons t o baseline measurements from the current period.  If the QTc interval is 
increased b y ≥45 msec from the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is ≥500 msec for an y 
scheduled ECG, then 2 additional ECGs will be collected, approximately  2 to 4 minutes 
apart, to confirm the original measurement.  If either of the QTc values from these repeated 
ECGs remains above the threshold value (ie, is ≥45 msec from the baseline, or is
≥500 msec), then a single ECG must be repeated at least hourl y until QTc values from
2succe ssive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.

Page 35If QTc values remain ≥500 msec (or ≥45 msec from the baseline) for greater than 4 hours (or
sooner, at the discretion of the investigator), or QTc intervals get progressively longer, the
subject should undergo continuous ECG monitoring. A cardiologist should be consulted if
QTc intervals do not return tolessthan 500msec (or to <45 msec above the baseline) after
8hours of monitoring (or sooner, atthediscretion oftheinvestigator).
In some cases, itmay be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead
placement ascontributing tothe ECG abnormality . Itisimportant thatleads areplaced inthe 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recor dings.  If a machine -read QTc
value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a
qualified medical provider’s interpretation determines thattheQTc values areinthe
acceptable range.
7.2.Pharmacokinetics (PK)
7.2.1. Serum for Analysis of Testosterone and Dihydrotestosterone
During all study periods, blood samples (6 mL)to provide approximately 2.5mLserum for
PKanaly siswill be collected into appropriately labeled tubes at times specified in the
Schedule of Activities section of the protocol.
The actual times may change, but the number of samples will remain the same.  All efforts
will be made to obtain the PKsamples at the exact nominal time relative to dosing.   
However, samples obtained within 10% of the nominal time (eg, within 6minutes of a
60-minute sample) from dosing will not be captured as a protocol deviation, as long as the
exact time ofthesample collection isnoted onthesource document anddata collection tool 
(eg, CRF). It is important to note, that for baseline testosterone samples (4 pre -dose) it is 
recommended to obtain samples from 7 -8 am , if dosing occurs for example at 8 am 
(recommended) . A window of no more than 2 hours is allowed (ie , 6-8am).
Samples will be analy zed using avalidated analy tical method in compliance with [COMPANY_007]
standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The PK samples must be processed and shipped as indicated in the instructions provided to
the investigator site to maintain sample integrity .Any deviations from the PK sample
handling procedure (eg,sample collection and processing steps, interim storage or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_523116]), including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor . 
On acase-by-case basis, the sponsor may make a determination astowhether sample
integrity  has been compromised. Any deviation from the specified sample handling
procedure resulting in compromised sample integrity will be considered a protocol deviation.
As part of understanding the PK of the investigational product, samples may be used for
metabolite identification and/or evaluation of the bioanaly tical method, as well as for other
internal exploratory purposes.  These data will not be included in the clinical study report 
(CSR).

All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following 
paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safet yon the CT SAE Report
Form within [ADDRESS_678812] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available
event information. This time frame alsoapplies toadditional new (follow -up)information on

FinalProtocol Amendment #3,[ADDRESS_678813] report the event 
within 24 hou rs after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be
requested by[CONTACT_22835] -upi[INVESTIGATOR_523117].
This information is more detailed than t hat recorded on the CRF .In general, this will include
adescription of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of
the case and independent determination of possible causality . Anyinformation relevant to the 
event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  Inthe case of a
subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety . Any pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT S AE
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safety ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted by [CONTACT_456], any non-serious AE that is
determined by[CONTACT_523141]. Toassist
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the
investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  It
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in aconsistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical
terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE in formation.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported by[CONTACT_523142] y acceptable representative . In addition, each study  
subject or legall y acce ptable representative will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs 
in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal Section)
Withdrawal duetoAEs should bedistinguished fromwithdrawal duetoother causes, 
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF.
When asubject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on
the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Fo rm, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.

The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection
period”) foreach subject begins from thetimethesubject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a
minimum of [ADDRESS_678815].
For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .

8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such
an assessment inaccordance with theSAE reporting requirements, ifapplicable . An
investigator’s causality  assessment is the determ ination of whether there exists areasonable
possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall ythefacts
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know wh ether or not the investigational product caused the event, then
theevent willbehandled as“related toinvestigational product” forreporting purposes, as
defined by[CONTACT_456]. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not
related” to investigational product, this should be clearly documented on study records.

AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable local regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an yuntoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment
or usage.  Examples of AEs include , but are not limited to:
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally ,AEs may include signs and sy mptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication err or;
Occupational exposure.
Testosterone Cypi[INVESTIGATOR_523091]
B5341002
FinalProtocol Amendment #3,[ADDRESS_678817] Findings
Abnormal objective testfindings should berecorded asAEs when anyof the following
conditions are met:
Test result is associated with accompany ingsymptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnost ic testing or medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
Test result leads to achange in study dosing (outside of anyprotocol -specified dose
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study ,significant additional concomitant
drug treatment, or other therapy ; and/or
Test result is considered tobean AE by[CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not
constitute an AE . Anyabnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not re quire
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. 
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should bereported asserious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Page 42Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was
performed should bereported if itmeets thedefinit ionofanSAE . For example, anacute 
appendicitis thatbegins during thereporting period should bereported iftheSAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual f unction.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Potential Cases ofDrug -Induced Liver I njury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury ,but adapt
are termed “adaptors.” Insome subjects, transaminase elevations areaharbinger of amore
serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are “susceptible” to
progressive and serious liver injury ,commonly referred to as drug-induced liver injury
(DILI ). Subjects who experience atransaminase e levation above 3times the upper limit of
normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they  are an “adaptor”
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede total bilirubin (TBili) 
elevations (>2 ×ULN) by [CONTACT_523144].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_523122]/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be
elevated within the same lab sample ).Inrare instances, by[CONTACT_523145], AST/ALT values might have decreased . This occurrence is still regarded as a
potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili
that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed p er Hy’slaw
criteria) cases and should alway sbe considered important medical events, even before all
other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded.

individual baseline values and underly ingconditions. Subjects who present with the
following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy’slaw)
cases to definitively determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who
subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value
>2×ULN with no evidence of hemoly sisand an alkaline phosphatase value
<2×ULN or not available.
Forsubject swith baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the
following threshold values areused inthedefinition mentioned above, as needed,
depending onwhich values areabove theULN atbaseline:
Preexisting AST orALT baseline values above thenormal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above thenormal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value by[CONTACT_8895] 1 ×ULN orif the value reaches >3×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by[CONTACT_523146]; anycase where uncertainty remains as to whether it
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor.
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferably within [ADDRESS_678821] and ALT and TBili, laboratory tests should
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.
Consideration should also be given to drawing aseparate tube of clotted blood and an
anticoagulated tube ofblood forfurther testing, asneeded, forfurther contemporaneous 
analy sesat the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed
history ,including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either by
[CONTACT_523147]-the-counter medications),
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history, sexual history ,
travel history ,history of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery ,blood transfusion, history
of liver or allergic dis ease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be
collected. Further testing foracute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and Einfection and liver imaging
(eg, biliary tract) may bewarranted.

other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has yetbeen found . Such
potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be repor ted as SAEs, irrespective of availability 
ofalltheresults oftheinvestigations performed todetermine etiology oftheLFT 
abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy’slaw) case becomes a confirmed case only after all results of
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.2. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy orbreastfeeding and 
occupati onal exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety within 24 hours of investigator
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during
pregnancy (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is foun d to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigat ional product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products);
Amale has been exposed (eg , because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed
during his partner’s pregnancy .
Ifa subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the sub ject’s
treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information
regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports thatsheispregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by  [CONTACT_523148][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety using the EDP supplemental form . This must be done irrespective
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure . The
information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 45Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for
allEDP reports with anunknown outcome.   Theinvestigator will follow the pregnancy until
completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify [COMPANY_007] Safety of the outcome a s a
follow -upto the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural
integrity  of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinic allypossible, the structural 
integrity  of the terminated fetus should be assessed by  [CONTACT_4692] (unless
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal yand the findings are
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy ,
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  [in a
live-born baby , aterminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or aneonatal death]), the
investigator should follow theprocedures forreporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety asSAEs
follows:
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_678824].
Addition al information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the
inves tigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in
accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may ormay not lead to the occurrence of an AE.

Medication errors include:
Medication errors involving subject exposure totheinvestigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do

Based on the results from Part 1, when the bioequivalence estim ation was performed without 
the baseline correction, test formulation (Treatment A) was foun d to be bioequivalent to 
reference formulation (Treatment B) for AUC inf, AUC lastand C max.  For all PK parameters the 
90% CI for the ratio of the adjusted geometric mean fell within  the 80-125% limits.  
However, when the data was analyzed with baseline testosterone correction, the 90% CI for 
the ratio for all the PK parameters was outside the 80%-125% li mit. Importantly, the 
variability associated with AUC infwas approximately 40%. The higher variability observed 
in these results as compared to the previous B5341001 study is t he reason for the change in
the original design of Part 2 from a 2-period crossover to a pa rtial replicate design involving 
3 periods.

11.DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. CaseReport Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject . The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of[COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, with out written permission from [COMPANY_007] . Theinvestigator shall ensure that the 
CRFs are securely  stored in encry pted electronic and/or paper form and will be password
protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by[CONTACT_20011].
The i nvestigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safety ,andlaboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attrib utable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The
CRFs must be signed by[CONTACT_523152] . Anycorrections t o entries made in the CRFs orsource
documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the
original entry .
Inmost cases thesource documents arethehospi[INVESTIGATOR_523124]'s chart . Inthese cases,
data collected o n the CRFs must match those charts.
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, adocument
should be available at the investigator site and at [COMPANY_007] that clearl yidentifies those data that
will be recorded on the CRF ,and for which the CRF will stand as the source document.

To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet yreporting forms, source documents,
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of rel evant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, andtelephone call reports). The records should
be retained by[CONTACT_161723], according to local
regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer . The
investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel yforso long as they are
retained.
If the investigator becomes unable for anyreason to continue to retain study records for the
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should beprospectively notified . The
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by[CONTACT_4618].

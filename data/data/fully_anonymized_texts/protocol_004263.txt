Study Design  This multicenter study consists of a randomized, 
placebo-controlled, double -blind phase followed by [CONTACT_18428]-label extension  (OLE) phase. 
Blinded Phase:  
The blinded phase of the study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 16-week comparison of two doses of 
GWP42003-P versus placebo.  P atients will complete a 1-week 
screening period and a 4-week baseline period before they are 
randomized to receive 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P or equivalent volumes of placebo.   Randomization 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_648450]: 1–6,  7–11, 12–17 years and 18+ years.  Patients will begin a [ADDRESS_868647] (IMP) for [ADDRESS_868648] to the investigator’s 
assessment of safety and tolerability.   If a dose becomes poorly 
tolerated, the investigator may consider temporarily or 
permanently reducing the dose for the remainder of the study.  
Clinic visits will occur for screening (Day  −35), baseline 
(Day −28), rand omization (Day  1) and, on Days 15 and 29 during 
titration and on Days 43, 57, 71 (telephone) and 85 until the end 
of treatment (Day  113).  Safety telephone calls will be completed 
every two days during titration, one week after the end of titration  
and, for patients not entering the OLE, weekly from Visit 10 to Visit 12.  If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule 
the call for the Friday before or Monday after the weekend

 instead. 
Patients will be required to perform daily interactive voice 
response system ( IVRS) telephone calls to record seizure 
information.  They will also complete a paper diary daily with 
information about their IMP and concomitant AED administration.  
Following completion of the blinded phase, patients will be invited to continue to receive GWP42003-P in an OLE .  
Those patients opting not to enter the OLE  will complete a 10 -day 
taper period (down-titrating 10% per day for 10 days).  
Open-label Extension Transition:  
In order to maintain consistent exposure to IMP and maintain the 
integrity of the blind, patients will enter a 2 -week blinded 
transition to the OLE.  OLE IMP will be titrated up to 
25 mg/kg/day whilst blinded IMP is simultaneously tapered down 
to zero.  A ll patients will complete the transition and enter the 
OLE taking 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P:  
• Patients from the placebo group will titrate up to 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 25  mg/kg/day GWP42003- P group will 
continue to take 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 5 0 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group wil l taper 
down (10% per day ) to 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
Safety telephone calls will be completed every two days 
throughout the OLE  transition.   If the call falls on a weekend, it is 
permitted to schedule the call for the Friday before or Monday 
after the weekend instead.  
Open-label Extension: 
The OLE consists of a 3- week titration period followed by a 
maintenance period and a 10-day taper period.  The initial OLE 
period will last for a maximum of 1 year. 
Following titration according to the titration schedule, patients 
will continue with their optimal GWP42003 -P dose.  However, 
investigators may decrease the dose if a patient experiences intolerance, or increase the dose to a maximum of 50 
mg/kg/day if 
required for better seizure control, until the optimal dose is found.  
Dose increases above 25  mg/kg/day are recommended to be done 
slowly, with maximum increments of 2.5 mg /kg/day every 
two days.  Patients whose dose has been decreased can have their 
dose increased again provided there is adequate tolerance.   Safety 
telephone calls will be completed every two days throughout the OLE titration and one week after the end of titration .  If the call 
falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule the call for the

freedom is achieved with use of GWP42003-P during the study, 
the investigator should consider reducing the dose of concomitant 
AEDs after six months of seizure freedom.

Should the above transaminase elevation criteria be confirmed, the patient must be withdrawn from the trial. 
The patient  may also be withdrawn from the study for any of the 
following: 
• Did not meet eligibility criteria.  
• Patient non-compliance.  
• AE (including clinically significant laboratory result) which, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would compromise the 
continued safe participation of the patient  in the study.

 Mode of 
Administration, 
Dose and 
Regimen ethanol, sweetener (sucralose) and strawberry flavoring.  
Blinded Phase:  
Patients will titrate the IMP up to the required dose over four weeks as per randomization.  Patients will then remain at this maintenance dose for [ADDRESS_868652] to the investigator’s 
assessment of safety and tolerability.   If a dose becomes poorly 
tolerated, the investigator may consider temporarily or 
permanently reducing the dose for the remainder of the study.  
Patients will be on treatment for a total of 1 6 weeks.  
Patients not entering the OLE or who withdraw early will 
down-titrate over a period of 10 days.  Patients who decide to 
enter the open -label extension will enter the Open -label Extension 
Transition. 
Titration from 0–25 mg/kg/day will begin at 5  mg/kg/day and will 
be increased in increments of 5  mg/kg/day every two days 
(patients will remain on each dose level for two days before they 
progress on to the next dose). 
Titration from 25 –50 mg/kg/day will continue at smaller 
increments of 2.5 mg/kg/day every two days.  
IMP will be taken twice daily (mor ning and evening). 
Open-label Extension Transition:  
This double-blind transition phase will take two weeks to 
complete.   OLE IMP will be titrated up to 25 mg/kg/day whilst 
blinded IMP is simultaneously tapered down to zero.  All patients 
will complete the transition and enter the OLE taking 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P :  
• Patients from the placebo group will titrate up to 
25 mg/kg/day.  
• Patients from the 25  mg/kg/da y group will continue to take 
25 mg/kg/day.  
• Patients from the 5 0 mg/kg/day will taper down (10% per day 
for 5 days) to 25 mg/kg/day.  
Open-label Extension: 
Patients may titrate the IMP up to the target dose of 50 mg/kg/day.  
Patients will then remain at this dose until the ‘End of Treatment’ 
visit, with the option for doses to be increased or decreased if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093], to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/day.   Following the ‘End of Treatment’ visit or decision 
to withdraw, doses of the IMP will be tapered down (10% per day for 10 days) at home until the ‘End of Taper’ visit.  IMP will be 
taken twice daily (morning and evening).

Control Group The control group will receive equal volumes of matching placebo. 
Procedures  Screening Assessments (Blinded Phase) Will Include: 
• Informed consent /assent 
• Demographic assessment  
• Full medical history (including seizure information since 
diagnosis and all prior AEDs taken) 
• Concomitant medication review (including AEDs)  
• Physical examination  
• Vital sign s assessment  
• Postural blood pressure 
• Clinical laboratory samples (blood and urine) will be taken

if the patient/parent(s)/legal representative provide consent  
• ECG 
• Suicidality  
Patients who satisfy all inclu sion and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be assigned a unique patient number. 
After the screening visit, investigators will submit the patient’s 
documented history of seizures directly to the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_59669] (ESC) for verification of seizure types.  The ESC may 
ask the investigator for additional information to assist in their decision.  The ESC will provide written confirmation directly to the investigator.  
Baseline Visit : 
Following written confirmation of seizure classification from the 
ESC patients will attend a Baseline Visit before beginning the 28-day baseline observation period.  The patient’s attendance is preferred, but if this is not possible the primary caregiver can attend alone provided that t his caregiver (not the patient) will be 
responsible for seizure identification, IVRS use, and paper diary

 additional Supplemental Adverse Event Form and Site 
Classification  Form (investigator only) following further 
discussion of the event(s) with the patient/caregiver.  
The second trigger that will require the investigator or study 
coordinator to discuss abuse potential signals with the patient/caregiver is drug accountabil ity issues regarding overuse 
of the IMP or missing bottles.  
Irrespective of the above, all patients/caregivers will be interviewed at their final dosing visit of the blinded phase 
(Visit 10 or 11) and again at their final dosing visit of the OLE (Visit B10 or B11).  A Study Medication Use and Behavior 
Survey will be completed by [CONTACT_648456]. 
 
A formal Adjudication Committee will be appointed and assigned to this initiative to classify triggered cases.  The Adjudication 
Committee w ill meet on a periodic basis to review and assess all 
of the information collected on triggered cases. 
Statistical Considerations Blinded Phase:  
Each of the primary and secondary endpoints will be described and compared between treatment groups, using appropriate statistical methods, over the [ADDRESS_868658] placebo (25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P and 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P vs. 
placebo).  Also, [ADDRESS_868659] the null hypothesis of an endpoint at 
the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis of the subsequent 
endpoint in the sequence at the level of 0.05 (2-sided).  If a null hypothesis is not rejected then te sting will stop and all subsequent 
analyses will be declared not statistically significant.  
The secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically, starting with the key secondary endpoints followed by [CONTACT_648457].  No mult iplicity adjustments 
will be made for all other secondary endpoints. 
All other statistical tests will be two -tailed and carried out at the 
5% level of significance.  
All safety data will be summarized using appropriate statistical 
methods.

 3 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
3.1 Disease  
TSC is a genetic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_312998] 
(tubers) in multiple organ systems.   The clinical signs of TSC arise as a resu lt of 
inactivating mutations in either of two tumor suppressor genes: TSC1 (located on 
chromosome 9q34.131) or TSC2 (located on chromosome 16p13.32).  TSC1 encodes 
the 130-kDa protein TSC1 ( hamartin)[ADDRESS_868668] TSC2 encodes the 200-kDa protein 
TSC2 (tuberin)2.  TSC1 and TSC2 share no homology yet bind to each other with 
high affinity to form a functional heterodimer3 which suppresses the mammalian 
target of rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation4.  Thus, 
inactivating mutations in TSC1 and TSC2 lead to  inadequate suppression of mTOR 
signaling, resulting in  abnormal cellular growth  and tumorigenesis5,6.  TSC is 
transmitted  in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, although two- thirds of all 
cases are caused by [CONTACT_648459]2,7,8.  Mutations in TSC1 account for 
approximately 15% of all cases  of TSC whilst approximately 70% of all cases are due 
to mutations in TSC2; ~15% of TSC patients have no identif iable mutation in the 
coding regions of either gene8,9.  Generally, TSC2 mutations result in a  more severe 
disease phenotype compared with TSC1 mutations8,9.  The birth incidence of TSC is 
estimated to be [ADDRESS_868669] 
patients exhibit dermatological, renal and/or neurological abnormalities, which appear 
at distinct developmental points13.  Dermatological abnormalities generally first 
appear in infancy or early childhood and include hypomelanotic macules, which are 
present in more than 90% of TSC patients, and facial angiofibromas, found in 
approximately 75% of TSC patients7,14,15.  In contrast, renal abnormalities tend not to 
develop until late childhood/adolescence and include angiomyolipomas (found in  
50–70% of TSC patients), renal cysts (found in 25–35% of TSC patients) and, very 
rarely, renal -cell carcinomas (found in 2–3% of TS C patients)16,17,18.  Neurological 
abnormalities first appear during embryogenesis and include cerebral cortical tubers 
and subependymal nodules (SENs), each of which are found in 80–90% of TSC

 patients, as well as subependymal giant -cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), which are 
presumed to derive from SENs and are found in 5–15% of TSC patients19.  Whereas 
SENs and SEGAs are usually asymptomatic, the presence of cortical tubers is widely 
believed to underl ie the neurologic manifestations of TSC, which include epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], 
cognitive disability and autism12,13,19. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_648408], affecting more 
than 70% of patients9,20,21,22.  Seizure onset occurs within the first year of life in 
approximately two -thirds of TSC patients and occurs within the first 3 years of life in 
80% of TSC patients13,20.  The onset of epi[INVESTIGATOR_648409] , which in approximately one- third of TSC patients coexist with 
infantile spasm s20.  Interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings at onset

and approximately half of all epi[INVESTIGATOR_648412], including complex focal  seizures (with or without secondary 
generalization) , generalized tonic–clonic seizures, atonic seizures, and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_648413]20.  Although infantile spasms resolve with time, the frequency and severity 
of other seizures tend to increase throughout early childhood and  nearly two -thirds of 
TSC patients develop medically intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], including Lennox–Gastaut 
syndrome20.  Cognitive impairment (intelligence/developmental quotient < 70) is 
observed in around 60% of all TSC patients with a history of seizures and in 
approximately three- quarters of all TSC patients with a history of refractory 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]20.  Early management of seizures is therefore important in preventing 
subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_648414]22,24. 
In both the European Union and the [LOCATION_002], the drug of first choice for the treatment of infantile spasms secondary to TSC is vigabatrin  (VGB), which was 
approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 ( as Sabril
®) to 
treat infantile spasms in children aged 1  month to 2 years25.  VGB is a structural 
analog of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA; the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system) that irreversibly inhibits GABA- transamin ase and thereby 
[CONTACT_648461]
26.  The initial prospective clinical study compared 
VGB (100 –150 mg/kg/day) with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; 10 IU/day) in 
42 patients with infantile spasms, only 4 of whom were diagnosed with TSC (3

 received VGB; 1 received ACTH)27.  Although all 4 TSC patients became spasm -free 
after 20 days’ treatment (irrespective of which therapy was received), VGB was 
considered more effective than ACTH for the treatment of  infantile spasms due to 
TSC27.  In a separate randomized trial which compared VGB (150 mg/kg/day, n=11) 
with the oral steroid hydrocortisone (15 mg/kg/day, n=11) for the treatment of 
infantile spasms due to TSC, 100% of patients taking VGB were spasm- free after 
1 month’s treatment compared with 45% taking hydrocortisone28.  Furthermore, of 
the non-responders who received hydrocortisone, all became spasm -free on switching 
to VGB therapy28.  A larger study compared 2 doses of VGB in treatment -naïve 
patients with infantile spasms29,30.  Of the patients  with TSC , 52% were spasm -free 
after 2 weeks’ treatment compared with 16% of patients with other etiologies29.  
Furthermore , 92% of TSC patients who began VGB therapy were spasm -free after 
71 days’ treatment, although whether these patients received additional treatments 
during this time is un clear29.  Following recruitment of more patients into the trial and 
use of intent- to-treat analysis, however, only 21% of TSC patients could be classed as 
primary responders after 2 weeks’ treatment compared with 9% of patients with other 
etiologies30.  Although VGB is generally well tolerated, long term treatment with 
VGB is associated with irreversible peripheral visual field defects  (VFDs), the risk of 
which increases with increasing dose and cumulative exposure26.  The prevalence of 
VGB-associated VFDs in children with refractory complex focal seizures is 
approximately 15%26; however, a very recent study found that 60% of TSC patients 
who received VGB treatment for infa ntile spasms  subsequently developed VFDs31. 
Furthermore,  there is evidence that spasms may relapse and become refractory to 
VGB following discontinuation of treatment in children with focal cortical

ACTH (corticotropin) is a long- established therapy for infantile spasms  and was

effects are common with ACTH treatment and long term exposure is associated with 
serious adverse events  (SAEs), including fulminant infections secondary to 
immunosuppression, hypertension, glucosuria and metabolic abnormalities25,34.  
Furthermore, there is evidence that ACTH may contribute to the enlargement of

 cardiac rhabdomy oma in TSC patients35,36.  ACTH treatment is therefore generally 
short-term (~2 weeks followed by [CONTACT_13217]) and close monitoring is required in TSC 
patients with cardiac rhab domyoma.  Relapse rates following effective ACTH 
treatment range from 15 –60%33.  Oral corticosteroids (prednisone/prednisolone) have 
also been used to treat infantile spasms, although randomized controlled trials 
demonstrate that even at very high doses only ~30–60% of patients achieve freedom 
from spasms37,38,39,40. 
The mTOR inhibitor  everolimus (the 40- O-[2-hydroxyethyl] derivative of 
sirolimus/rapamycin ) has demonstrated efficacy in reducing seizure frequency  in TSC 
patients with SEGA41.  In an open-label study of add-on everolimus (3 mg/m2/day; 
n=16), 56% of patients had a clinically-relevant reduction in total seizure frequency 
at 6 months42.  In a randomized controlled trial comparing everolimus 
(4.5 mg/m2/day; n=78) with placebo ( n=39), analysis of change in seizure frequency 
was inconclusive because most patients had no seizures at baseline or at 24 weeks’ 
follow-up43.  As both studies demonstrated significant  reduction s in SEGA volume, 
the FDA approved everolimus in 2010 (as Afinitor®) and in 2012 (as Afinitor 
Disperz™) for the treatment of TSC patients with SEGA who are not elig ible for 
curative surgical resection.   In addition to resective surgery, other non-
pharmacological treatments of TSC -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_648415] a ketogenic diet22. 
3.[ADDRESS_868671] (IMP), GWP42003-P, is formulated from 
extracts prepared from Cannabis sativa L. plants that have a defined chemical profile 
and contain consistent levels of CBD as the principal phytocannabinoid.  Extracts 
from these plants are processed to yield purified (≥ 98%) CBD that typi[INVESTIGATOR_648416] 0.15% (w/w) THC  (for oral form ulations).  The purified CBD is 
subsequently dissolved in excipi[INVESTIGATOR_31628]. 
The pharmacological effects of phytocannabinoids are thought to be mediated 
primarily via their interaction with the endocannabinoid system, which cons ists of 
cannabinoid receptors, endogenous ligands (endocannabinoids) and enzymes for 
endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation.  To date, [ADDRESS_868672] been identified, designated CB
1 receptor and CB 2 receptor. 
CBD does not bind to either of these receptors with any great affinity but does

 modulate the metabolizing enzymes of the endocannabinoid system.  CBD also 
affects conduction of ion channels and acts on other G-protein-coupled receptors such 
as the transient recep tor potential channel TRPV144 and the orphan receptor GPR5545. 
Importantly, CBD lacks the psychoactivity associated  with THC. Further to this, CBD 
has demonstrated anticonvulsant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, antioxidant and anti- inflammatory activity
46.  Very little data concerning AEs of CBD 
in humans currently exist ; however, in the small number of placebo- controlled trials 
published to date investigating the anticonvulsant effects of CBD, few side effects 
have been reported after 4 –12 months of 200–300 mg/day CBD46. 
3.3 Rationale  
The pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648417] -associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_648418], and  a significant proportion of patients (37 –63%) 
become resistant to treatment20,21.  Consequently, there is a clear need for new, 
efficacious pharmaceutical treatments  for refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] .  Given the limitations 
of current synthetic AEDs, it has been suggested  that CBD should be tested for 
anticonvulsive effi cacy in randomized controlled clinical trials , especially  in infantile 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_122245]46.  Although there are no published reports to date investigating 
the efficacy of  CBD for seizures in TSC patients, a recent parent survey has reported 
that 84% of children with treatment- resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_648419] a reduction in 
seizures whil st taking CBD-enriched cannabis, with over half of those reporting 
> 80% reduction in seizure frequency47.  The CBD -enriched cannabis was 
behaviorally well  tolerated and children often experienced improved sleep, increased 
alertness, and better mood.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_868673] b een well tolerated in adults 
in the GW Research Ltd (GW) clinical study GWMD0911248, which — assuming an 
average weight of 70 kg — equates to 11.4 mg/kg.  In the literature, doses of CBD have been given up to 1500 mg C BD per day for 4 weeks in adults
49, which, in a 
70 kg human, equates to a daily dose of 21.4 mg/kg CBD.  
At the time of dose selection, GWP42003- P was being used by [CONTACT_648462][INVESTIGATOR_648420] a variety of etiologies in 
a number of Individual and Intermediate  Expanded Access Investigational New Drug 
(IND) studies.  In the ongoing Individual Expanded Acce ss IND studies, the initial

Confidential  Page 45 of 154 Template: 231014.V1 
 dosing had been cautious (100 mg [morning] + 150 mg [afternoon/evening]), 
progressively increasing to 400 mg /day CBD ; doses up to 22 mg/kg /day had been 
well tolerated in an individual pediatric patient.   The sponsor reviews all safety 
information on an ongoing basis from the patients in the Individual Expanded Access 
IND studies and is not aware of any safety issues arising from the dosing used to date. 
In the Expanded Access IND  program (EAP), clinical dosing is determined on a 
case-by-case basis, balancing seizure control with tolerability , and shows that patients 
had tolerated doses up to 50 mg/kg/day.   In a data review of the EAP, the median dose 
was 25 mg/kg/day among [ADDRESS_868674] 12  weeks (EAP; data cut 
Sep 2015). 
The first patient was dosed on 22 Jan  2014 and at the Sep  2015 data cut 350  patients 
with severe treatment -resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_648421] (predominantly children) had 
received CBD oral solution; the median duration of exposure was 202 days.   The 
available safety data collected from these patients showed that the reported AEs were 
usually mild or moderate in severity and resolved without treatment.  There had been few withdrawals due to AEs.  The median dose of CBD oral solution was 
25 mg/kg/ day after 12  weeks of treatment.  24 patients achieved a dose > 30  mg/kg up 
to and including 40 mg/kg and 37 patients were dosed in the higher category 
> 40 mg/kg up to and including 50 mg/kg.  The highest dose ha d been 51 mg/kg 
(1 patient). 
Doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg/day have been chosen for the GWEP1521 study to cover the doses of CBD oral solution most likely to have an effect in controlling multiple seizure types in TSC.   The two doses will also allow demonstration of a possible dose 
response in TSC.  D ose escalation for each patient in this study is subject to the 
investigator’s assessment of safety and tolerability.   If AEs become dose limiting, the 
investigator may consider temporarily or permanently reducing the dose for the remainder of the study.   Dose limiting AEs have so far recovered/were resolving with 
dose adjustment or cessation. 
The maximum dose patients can receive during the maintenance period of the blinded 
phase will be 50 mg/kg/day.  During the open- label phase, the maximum dose patients  
can receive will be 50  mg/kg/day although all patients will initially titrate to 
25 mg/kg/day.  The maximum dose was based on data from the Intermediate EAP at 
the time of initiation of GWEP1521 .

 4 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
4.1 Study Design 
This multicenter study consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 
phase followed by [CONTACT_3440]- label extension  (OLE) phase. 
Blinded Phase:  
The blinded phase of the study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 16- week 
comparison of two doses of GWP42003-P versus placebo.  Patients will complete a 
1-week screening period and a 4-week baseline period before they are randomized to 
receive 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P or equivalent 
volumes of placebo.   Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_648464]: 1–6, 7–11, 12–17 years and 18+ years.  Patients will begin a 4-week 
dose escalation period, titrating up to their assigned dose, before continuing on a stable dose of blinded IMP for [ADDRESS_868677] to the investigator’s assessment of safety 
and tolerability.   If a dose becomes poorly tolerated, the investigator may consider 
temporarily or permanently reducing the dose for the remainder of the study. 
Clinic visits will occur for screening (Day −35), baseline (Day −28), randomization 
(Day 1) and, on Days 15 and 29 during titration and on Days 43, 57, 71 (telephone) 
and 85 unt il the end of treatment (Day  113).  Safety telephone calls will be completed 
every two days during titration , one week after the end of titration  and, for patients 
not entering the OLE, weekly from Visit 10 to Visit 12 (refer to  Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
further details on s afety telephone c alls).  If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted 
to schedule the call for the Friday before or Monday after the weekend instead. 
Patients will be required to perform daily interactive voice response system ( IVRS) 
telephone calls to record seizure information.  They will also complete a daily paper 
diary with information about their IMP and concomitant AED administration.  
Following completion of the blinded phase, patients will be invited to continue to receive GWP42003 -P in an OLE .  
Those patients opting not to enter the OLE  will complete a 10 -day taper period 
(down-titrating 10% per day for 10 days).  
Open-label Extension Transition:  
In order to maintain consistent exposure to IMP and maintain the integrity of the 
blind, patients will enter a 2 -week blinded transition to the OLE .  OLE IMP will be

 titrated up to 25 mg/kg/day whilst blinded IMP is simultaneously tapered down to 
zero. All patients will complete the transition and enter the OLE taking 25  mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P :  
• Patients from the pla cebo group will titrate up to 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 25  mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group will continue to take 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 5 0 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group will taper down (10% per 
day) to 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
Safety telephone calls will be completed every two days throughout the OLE 
transition.   If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule the call for the 
Friday before or Monday after the weekend instead. 
Open-label Extension: 
The OLE consists of a 3-week titration period followed by a maintenance period and a 
10-day taper period.  The initial OLE period will last for a  maximum of 1 year.  
Following titration according to the titration schedule, patients will continue with their optimal GWP42003-P dose.  However, investigators may decrease the dose if a patient experiences intolerance, or increase the dose to a maximum of  50 mg/kg/day if 
required for better seizure control, until the optimal dose is found. Dose increases 
above 25 mg/kg/day are recommended to be done slowly, with maximum increments 
of 2.5 mg/kg/day  every two days.   Patients whose dose has been decreased can  have 
their dose increased again provided there is adequate tolerance.   Safety telephone calls 
will be completed every two days throughout the OLE titration and one week after the end of titration.  If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedu le the call for 
the Friday before or Monday after the weekend instead.  If seizure freedom is 
achieved with use of GWP42003-P during the study, the investigator should consider 
reducing the dose of concomitant AEDs after six  months of seizure freedom.

50 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent at a 2:2:1:1 ratio.  The placebo groups will be pooled for the analyses of efficacy.   
8.1.1 Dose Administration 
The IMP will be administered by [CONTACT_648468]

gastrostomy/nasogastric tubes may be allowed after consultation with the GW 
medical monitor.   Alteration in dosing frequency may also be considered after 
consultation with the GW medical monitor.  
8.1.2 Dose Escalation and Dose Adjustments 
All patients will be weighed during Visit 3 and the daily volumes of IMP solution to 
be taken during the maximum fou r-week titration period and for the remainder of the 
blinded phase maintenance period will be calculated via the IVRS and the dosing regimen provided to the patient and/or caregiver.  Doses may be altered during the 
OLE according to changes in patient weig ht. Further information on dispensing 
procedures will be provided in a separate Pharmacy Manual.  
Titration from 0 –25 mg/kg/day will begin at 5  mg/kg/day and will be increased in 
increments of 5  mg/kg/day every two days (patients will remain on each dose level for 
two days before they progress on to the next dose).  Titration from 25–50 mg/kg/day 
will continue at smaller increments of 2.5  mg/kg/day every two days.

Each patient will take their first dose of IMP at Visit 3 (Day 1) and their final 
maintenance dose of IMP at Visit 10 (Day 113 ).  If an unacceptable AE develops at 
any time during the titration period, dosing should initially be suspended or amended, 
at the investigator’s discretion, until the event has resolved.  During the maintenance 
period, patients should continue on a stable dosing regimen at the target Dose Level.  
If that dose becomes poorly tolerated or an AE occurs (e. g., somnolence, transaminase

8.2 Concomi tant Therapy  
It is theoretically possible that GWP42003- P may modify the metabolism of other 
drugs (including AEDs) administered concurrently and there remains the possibility 
of pharmacological interactions between GWP42003-P and other concurrently 
administered drugs.   Doses of any concomitant AEDs must have been stable for at 
least four weeks prior to screening and must remain stable throughout the blinded 
study period.  If during the blinded or OLE phase plasma concentrations of 
concomitant AEDs are foun d to be altered following administration of IMP, or if there 
are side-effects suspected of being related to an elevation in the concomitant AED concentration, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_648469] .  Decisions should be based on clinical symptoms and not plasma levels 
of AEDs.   Further information on drug interactions can be found in the IB
51. 
Concomitant AED dose reductions are permitted on clinical grounds (e.g., due to AEs 
or transaminase elevations not meeting withdrawal criteria specified in Section 10 
and Section  12.8) following discussion with the GW medical monitor.

during the randomized phase of the trial but may be considered on a case- by-case 
basis for the OLE phase in accordance with local licensing and after consult ation with 
the GW medical monitor. 
The use of rescue medication is allowed when necessary.  Any medication, other than 
the IMP, taken during the study must be recorded on the Case Report Form (CRF).

8.3 Prohibited Therapy During Study Period  
The following medications are prohibited for the duration of the study beginning from 
acquisition of patient  consent/assent .  However, any patients taking these medications 
after randomiz ation should not be withdrawn from the study unless there are safety 
concerns.  If applicable, the possible effects of these medications on the primary 
endpoint will be considered during the assessment of the evaluable period (see Section 13.6.1). 
• Any new medications or interventions for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (including ketogenic diet 
and vagus nerve stimulation ) or changes in dosage. 
• Recreational or medicinal cannabis or synthetic cannabinoid- based 
medications (including Sativex

 • Visit 7 (Day 57 ) 
• Visit 9 (Day 85 ) 
• Visit 10 (Day 113) (patients not entering the OLE) 
• All OLE visits until the end of treatment  
The patient  or their caregiver  will record the volume of solution taken  on each 
treatment day in the diary. 
Patients should return all IMP (used and unused) at each of visits 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 
11 during the blinded phase and at all OLE visits.  The usage recorded in the diary  
and the usage projected in the dose calculator will be checked and any discrepancies 
discussed with the patient  or their caregiver at the time of the visit and documented 
accordingly within the patient’s source documents. 
Records of IMP accountability will be maintained according to  Section 5.3.4. 
8.5 Access to Blinded Treatment Assignment  (Blinded Phase and 
OLE Transition Only) 
The identity of IMP assigned to patient s will be held by [CONTACT_21926] .  The principal 
investigator (PI) at each center , or his/her designee, is responsible for ensuring that 
information on how to access the IVRS for an individual patient  is available to the 
relevant staff in case of an emergency and unblinding is required.  A patient’s 
treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is 
essential to make a decision on the medical management of the patient .  Unblinding 
for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. 
The investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_648470].  However, to prevent delays to the investigator or medical personnel responding to a potentially emergent situation, unblinding of study medication will 
not be dependent upon the investigator receiving approval from GW (i.e., the 
investigator will be able to obtain the code break information independent of contact[CONTACT_313014]).  
If the investigator does unblind, they must contact [CONTACT_648471], date and reason(s) for unblinding on the patient ’s 
CRF.

9.1.1 Blinded Phase  
[IP_ADDRESS] Visit 1 (Day −35, Screening)  
Eligibility must be assessed according to the criteria specified in Section 6. 
The following observations will be made at Visit 1: demographics, medical history 
(including seizure information since diagnosis, history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]- specific genetic 
testing and all prior AEDs taken), concomitant medications (including AEDs), physical examination (including height and body weight), ECG, vital signs, postural blood pressure and visit procedure- related AEs.  With the patient/parent(s)/legal 
representative’s consent, a further  blood test will be carried out to determine the 
mutation status of  TSC1 and TSC2, if it is  unknown. 
The patient’s documented history of TSC will be sent to the ESC to confirm seizure 
classification .  
Clinical laboratory samples (blood and urine [where possible]), including pregnancy 
tests if appropriate (using both a serum sample and a urine dipstick), will be taken for 
hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, and a urine /serum THC screen.  Suicidality will 
be assessed in accordance with Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Patients will take their final dose of the blinded phase IMP in the morning of Visit B1, 
followed by [CONTACT_648478] ‘End of Treatment’ assessments.  Patients 
will be instructed to begin the Blinded Open-label transition, taking their first dose of 
Blinded Transition OLE IMP in the evening of Visit B1 (Day 1).  
Patients or their caregivers will receive sufficient IMP for two weeks’ home dosing 
together with a blinded transition phase.  If an unacceptable AE develops at any time 
during transition , dosing should initially be suspended or amended, at the 
investigator’s discretion, until the event has resolved or is well tolerated.  
Patients or their caregivers will be given a paper diary to record information regarding 
AEs, IMP, usage of rescue medication , concomitant AEDs and IMP dosing.  In 
addition, pati ents/caregivers will be instructed to complete a weekly seizure reporting 
diary until the Follow-up visit using the IVRS.  
The investigator should review the laboratory results as soon as these become available.  If the results raise any safety concerns, th e investigator should consider 
whether it will be appropriate for the patient to continue to participate in the extension study, or if the patient should be withdrawn. 
In order to complete the S GIC/CGIC, the patient/caregiver is to compare to the 
memory ai d from the Baseline of the blinded phase.  If the memory aid is not 
available from the Baseline of the blinded phase then the patient/caregiver should do 
this from memory, if possible, and complete a memory aid at Visit B1. 
In order to complete the SGIC-SD/CGIC-SD, the patient/caregiver  would ha
 ve been 
asked to assess and note the average duration of the patient’s seizures at the Baseline 
of the blinded phase as a memory aid for subsequent visits.  If the memory aid is not available from the Baseline of the blinded phase then the patient/caregiver should do this from memory, if possible, and complete a memory aid at Visit B1.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Visit B2 (Day 15)  
Visit B2 will take place 14 days after Visit B1. A visit window of ±3 days from the 
scheduled visit date is permitted, but it is preferred that the visit is performed on the 
scheduled visit day where possible. 
The following assessments will be made at Visit B2: concomitant medications 
(inc
luding AEDs), physical examination (including height and body weight), ECG, 
vital signs, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , and AEs.  Clinical laboratory samples 
(blood and urine [where possible]) will be taken for hematology, biochemistry and 
urinalysis.  Provided that the risk/benefit outcome is favorable in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], prior to the first daily dose of IMP, a bloo
d sample will be taken for analysis 
of plasma concentrations of concomitant AEDs.  Suicidality will be assessed in 
accord
ance with Secti
on [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The investigator must assess adherence to the titration regimen by [CONTACT_14536]’s diary and IVRS data and record the patient’s attendance at the visit.  
Upon completion of the two-week blinded transition at V isit B2 all patients will be 
taking 25 mg/kg/day.  All blinded IMP (used and unused) will be collected and a 
check of the returned IMP against usage should be made.  Patient s/caregivers will 
then receive sufficient open -label IMP for three weeks’ home dosing together with a 
titration schedule.  Patients may  titrate up to the target dose of 50 mg/k g/day 
according to the defined titration schedule.  If an unacceptable AE develops at any 
time during titration, dosing should initially be suspended or amended, at the 
investigator’s discretion, until the event has resolved or is well tolerated . 
Following Visit B2, during titration, safety telephone calls must be made every two 
days.  If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule the call for the Friday 
before or Monday after the weekend instead.  An additional call should be completed one week after the end of titration.  During these calls, caregivers will be asked for information on AEs, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], concomitant medications and/or changes to medication.  The investigator must retain oversight of safety 
telephone calls .

9.2 Study Procedure Listing 
9.2.1 Informed Consent/Assent  
Adult patients with an adequate level of understanding must personally sign and date 
the EC/IRB-approved / ICF before any study-specific procedures are performed or 
any patient-related data are recorded for the study. For adult patient s with an 
insufficient level of understanding of what is proposed, only parent(s)/legal 
representative consent will be sought.  If an adult patient is unable to read (illiterate or 
visually impaired), or is physically unable to speak or write, an impartial witness should be present during the entire informed consent discussion.  After the ICF is read 
and explained to the patient  and after the patient  has orally consented to participation 
in the trial and has signed and dated the ICF (if capable of doing so), the witness 
should also sign and personally date the ICF.  By [CONTACT_12568], the witness attests 
that the information in the ICF was accurately explained to and apparently understood 
by [CONTACT_648480]  (as outlined 
in the International Council for Harmonis ation [ICH] Tripartite Guideline for GCP 
Topic E6(R2)
52, section 4.8.9). 
The parent(s)/legal representative of minor patient s must personally sign and date the 
EC/IRB-approved ICF before any study-specific procedures are performed or any 
patient-related data is recorded for the study.   In addition, i n cases where the patient

Protocol V 8 23Apr19 
 
Confidential  Page 87 of 154 Template: 231014.V1 
 possesses adequate understanding, a ssent will be taken (if allowed per local 
regulations ) along with parent(s)/legal representative consent, using 
EC/IRB-approved assent forms.  Assent is defined as  the minor’s permission or 
affirmative agreement to participate in the study.  The explicit wish of a minor, who is 
capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_648428], to refuse 
participation in or to be withdrawn from the clinical trial at any time must be considered by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.  
For patients who go from being a minor to an adult (as per the country or state’s 
age-of-majority regulation) during the course of the study, a new ICF will be signed if 
the patient  possesses adequate understanding to do so. 
If the patient cannot write, they can give consent/assent by “making their mark” on 
the consent /assent form (e.g., writing an “ X”). 
GW requires a physician to be present for consent and assent and to sign the consent and assent forms also.  Patient s/parent(s)/legal representatives will be given the option 
of being informed about the summary outcome and results of the trial as part of the ICF. For further details, see Section 15.2. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_868700] agreed that if they or their partner 
are of childbearing potential they are willing to use highly effective con traception for 
the duration of the study and for three months thereafter.  H ighly effective method s of 
birth control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that  result in a low failure 
rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and c orrectly
53.  Such 
methods include hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices/hormone- releasing 
systems, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized  partner (provided that partner is the 
sole sexual partner of the trial patient and that the vasectomized  partner has received 
medical assessment of the surgical success) , or sexual abstinence54.  Abstinence , as 
referenced above,  is only acceptable as true abstinence: when this is in line with the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acce ptable 
methods of contraception54.

Patient demographics will be recorded at Visit 1.  The following information will be 
obtained for each patient: date of birth, sex and ethnic origin (if allowed per local 
regulations). 
9.2.4 Medical History  
Relevant, significant medical history (including seizure information since diagnosis, 
history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]- specific genetic testing and all prior AEDs taken) will be obtained 
during Visit 1 and is defined as any condition or diseas e that: 
• May affect the condition under study. 
• Is ongoing on entry into the study. 
• Has occurred within one year prior to screening (Visit 1). 
The mutation status of the TSC1 and  TSC2 genes, if known, will be obtained through 
the patient’s medical records.  
9.2.5 Concomitant Medication 
Details of all current and recent medication (i.e., taken within the previous 14 days) 
including AEDs will be recorded at the screening visit (Visit 1) and reviewed at each subsequent visit.  AEDs used during the study should be maint ained at a stable dose.  
Any changes in concomitant medication during the study must be recorded in the 
CRF at study visits .  Patients should stop taking any prohibited therapy prior to 
enrollment, as defined in Section 8.2. 
9.2.6 Physical Examination  
A physical examination will be performed at the screening visit (Visit 1) to ensure  
that the patient is eligible to enter the study.  To ensure patient safety, further physical 
examinations will be performed during subsequent visits.  Physical examinations will include height and body weight measurements. 
9.2.7 Vital Signs  and Blood Pressure  
Vital sign measurements  (body temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]), including 
blood pressure taken in a sitting position at rest for five minutes, will be completed 
alongside the physical examination .  Where p ostural blood pressure is required it

9.2.[ADDRESS_868701] be recorded appropriately in the CRF. 
Additional ECG measurements can be taken at any time during the study, if clinically 
indicated.  
9.2.9 Clinical Laboratory Sampling  
Laboratory tests will include hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis (provided urine 
can be obtained), urine /serum THC screening and a serum pregnancy test (if 
appropriate).  In addition to serum pregnancy tests, urine dipstick pregnancy tests will 
also be performed (if appropriate) at the study center.  Analysis of all clinical blood 
samples, pregnancy tests (using serum) and tests to detect the presence of THC  will be 
conducted at a central clinical laboratory.  
Urine samples for biochemistry will be analyzed at the study center by [CONTACT_2363] a 
dipstick with any relevant findings being sent for further urinalysis at the central laboratory (urinalysis, microscopy, culture and sensitivity, as applicable).  In cases 
where urine samples cannot be analyzed  at center due to local regulations, a full set of 
urine samples should be sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  Sample volume requirements and processing procedures will be detailed in a separate laboratory 
manual. 
The investigator and study monitor will be provided with a list of the normal ranges 
used by [CONTACT_648481] a 
statement of accreditation (or similar) for the laboratory .  Clinical laboratory sample 
parameters are detailed in  Table 9.2.9-1.

GCP Topic E6(R2)52, the U.S. FDA regulations relating to good clinical practice and 
clinical trials57,58,59, the European Union ( EU) Clinical Trials Directive60, the EU 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Directive61 and/or other applicable regulations, a 
patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_30363].  
The patient  must be withdrawn from the study if any of the following apply:  
• Administrative decision by [CONTACT_093], GW, or a Regulatory Authority. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Protocol deviation that is considered to compromise potentially the safety of 
the patient . 
• Withdrawal of patient  consent/assent . 
• Withdrawal of parent(s)/legal representative consent.  
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
• ALT or AST >  8 × ULN. 
• ALT or AST >  5 × ULN for more than two weeks. 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5).  
• Lost to follow-up. 
Note: Prior to withdrawal for the transaminase elevations noted above, the 
investigator may choose to confirm the transaminase elevations by [CONTACT_312992] 24 to 48 hours: ALT, AST, TBL, INR, %eosinophils, gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase.  Should 
the above transaminase elevation criteria be confirmed, the patient must be 
withdrawn from the trial.   In cases where the transaminase elevation 
withdrawal criteria are not met or confirmed, the dose of IMP  or a 
concomitant AED with known hepatoto xicity should be reduced following 
discussion with the GW medical monitor.

 Patients may also be withdrawn from the study for any of the following: 
• Did not meet eligibility criteria.  
• Patient non-compliance.  
• AE (including clinically significant laboratory result)  which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], would compromise the continued safe participation of the 
patient in the study. 
• Suicidal ideation or behavior of type 4 or 5 during the treatment period, as 
evaluated with the C -SSRS. 
• Any evidence of drug abuse or diversion. 
• General anesthesia (blinded phase only). 
• Addition of a new AED (blinded phase only). 
Should a patient  request or decide to withdraw from the study, all efforts must be 
made to complete all assessments of the End of Treatment/Withdrawal Visit (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for w ithdrawals within the double-blind phase and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
for withdrawals within the OLE phase).  All  observations should be reported as 
thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal.  Patient s withdrawing due to an 
AE should be followed up according to Section  12.7.  All information should be 
reported i n the applicable CRF pages (refer to  Section 9.2).  Wherever possible, a 
post-study follow-up visit should take place 28- days after last dose of IMP (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  If withdrawing patients decline to give a 
reason for withdrawal of consent, the investigator must respect the patient ’s wishes.

 12 ADVER SE EVENT REPORTING 
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1 Adverse Event  
For the purposes of this study an AE is defined as: 
Any new unfavorable/unintended signs/symptoms (including abnormal laboratory 
findings when relevant ), or diagnosis or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which  
occurs following screening (Visit 1) and at any point up to the post-treatment, safety 
follow-up visit (Visit 12 and Visit OLE Follow -up), which may or may not be 
considered to be related to the IMP.  Any event that is the result of a stud y procedure 
must be recorded as an AE. 
Surgical/Investigational procedures are not AEs .  The medical reason for the 
procedure is the AE .  Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648435]-study existing conditions or 
elective procedures are not  AEs.  The exception may be if the patient  has an AE 
during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648436] a SAE ( refer to Section 12.2). 
If reporting a fatal event , the SAE term should be the underlying cause of the death 
(e.g., disease or medical condition leading to death).  
12.1.[ADDRESS_868715] the IMP is 
developed (e.g. , change in dose, population, monitoring need, consent /assent forms).  
This is particularly true for events that threaten life or function. Such SAEs will be reported promptly to Regulatory Authorities, applicable ECs/IRBs and investigator s 
(expedited reporting) by [CONTACT_31694]. 
An AE must only be classed as serious, i.e. , a SAE, when the event falls into one of 
the following criteria:  
• Results in death . 
• Is life-threatening
*.

 • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is medically significant**. 
* The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient  was at risk of  death at the time of the event ; it does not refer to an event 
which, hypothetically , might have caused death if it were more severe.  
** Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations.  Important medical events may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88908] e 
the patien t or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the definition above.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

information received for a case (follow -up or corrections to the original case) need to 
be detailed on a new SAE  Report form , signed/dated and faxed to the GW PVD  and 
the AE section of the CRF must be updated. 
The investigator is not obliged to actively monitor for any new SA Es which occurred  
after the last formal follow -up observational period (Visit 12 or OLE Follow-up).

 However, if the investigator becomes aware of any deaths or a new  IMP-related SAE 
occurring within 28 days of the final dose of IMP, these should be reported to the GW 
PVD.  
Any other problem discovered outside these time limits  (Visit 12 or OLE Follow-up) 
which is deemed to be an unexpected safety issue and is likely to have an impact  on 
patients who have taken part in the study must be treated  as an SAE and reported to  
the GW PVD.  Such post-study SAEs do not need to be recorded in the patient ’s CRF 
if editing rights to the CRF have been removed  due to final study data lock .  GW PVD 
may request safety follow -up information after the final study visit in order to 
investigate a potential safety issue.  
Contact [CONTACT_648493], and upon the GW SAE Report form. 
12.4 Pregnancy  
Any patient, or patient ’s partner, who has become pregnant whilst receiving IMP, or 
within [ADDRESS_868717] be sent to the GW PVD using the fax number for SAE 
reporting (see Appendix 3.2) within [ADDRESS_868718] be reported as such.  The expression 
“reasonable causal relationship”  is meant to convey in general that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following question which must be answered by [CONTACT_648494]: 
“In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_31647] a plausible relationship to the IMP ?” The answer is either 
“yes” or “no”.

 Events that start before the first dose of IMP (pre -treatment) should be considered as 
not causally related .  Where a pre- treatment event worsens in severity following the 
first dose of IMP , a new event record should be entered into the CRF. 
Considering the explanation given above, investigator s are strongly encouraged to 
express their opi[INVESTIGATOR_31648].  For individual patient s, 
the investigator is usually in the best position to assess the underlying suspected cause 
of an AE.  For all AEs, and especially  SAEs, it is important that the investigator 
assess not only the possible role of the IMP but also other potential contributing 
factors. Factors for consideration  of the underlying cause may include: 
• Medical and disease history. 
• Lack of efficacy/worsening of treated condition. 
• Concomitant or previous treatment. 
• Withdrawal of IMP. 
• Protocol-related procedure. 
12.6 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All AEs (including SAEs) occurring during the study will be reported on the running 
logs in the AE section of the CRF .  This inc ludes all events from the time following 
screening (Visit 1) up to and including the post-study follow-up visit ( Visit 12 or OLE 
Follow-up), whether or not attributed to IMP and observed by [CONTACT_197489].  
The following information will need to be provided for all AEs: 
A) Adverse Event (Diagnosis or Syndrome if Known, or Signs and Symptoms)  
Where the investigator cannot determine a diagnosis, signs or symptoms should be 
recorded in the AE section of the CRF .  Once a diagnosis has been determined the AE 
section of CRF must be updated to reflect the diagnosis in replacement of the original 
symptoms .  In circumstances where only a provisional diagnosis is possible (working 
diagnosis), the CRF must be updated to reflect the provisional diagnosis in 
replacement of the original symptoms .  In some circumstances it may be relevant for 
the investigator to include the symptoms alongside the diagnosis in the verbatim event 
description.  However, the diagnosis (full or provisional) should be clearly stated (e.g., headache and fever  due to pneumonia).

 B) Adverse Event Start Date and Stop Date 
The start and stop dates of the event must be provided.  All AEs require these fields to 
be completed in full.  Partial dates or missing dates are not normally acceptable and 
significant effort must be undertaken to obtain any unknown information.  If a precise 
date is not known an estimated date should be provided instead.  When a complete 
date cannot be given then record as much i nformation as possible (i.e., month and 
year or, in exceptional circumstances , just year) .  When the actual start date becomes 
known the CRF must be updated to replace the previously recorded date. 
C) Outcome  
The outcome of the event must be recorded accurately and classified into one for the 
following categories:  
• Recovered . 
• Recovered with sequelae . 
• Continuing. 
• Patient died. 
D) Severity  
When describing the severity of an AE the terms mild, moderate, or severe should be 
used.  Clinical judgment should be used when determining which severity applies to 
any AE. 
If the severity of an AE fluctuates day -to-day, e.g., a headache or constipation, the 
change in severity should not be recorded each time; instead , only the worst observed 
severity should be recorded with  AE start and stop dates relating to the overall event 
duration, regardless of severity.  
A severe AE is not the same as a SAE .  For example, a patient  may have severe 
vomiting but the event does not result in any of the SAE criteria above.  T herefore, it 
should not be classed as serious. 
E) Causality  
See Section 12.5 above. 
F) Action Taken with Study Medication

AEs considered related to the IMP by [CONTACT_313027].  
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical judgment whether or not an AE is of 
sufficient severity to require the patient’s removal from treatment.  A patient may also 
voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable 
AE.  Further details of withdrawa l are presented in  Section 10.  If either of these 
occurs, the patient  must undergo an end of treatment assessment and be given 
appropriate care under medical supervision until symptoms cease or the condition becomes stable.   If a safety concern is identified following withdrawal of a 
participant, GW may contact [CONTACT_648495]-up information. 
12.8 Potential Cases of Drug -induced Liver Injury   
All investigational centers are required to submit to the GW PVD the laboratory 
results for any patient after randomization that meet the criteria for the selected 
laboratory parameters as follows:  
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia 
(> 5%). 
• ALT or AST >  8 × ULN. 
• ALT or AST >  5 × ULN for more than two weeks. 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5).

Protocol V 8 23Apr19 
 
Confidential  Page 114 of 154 Template: 231014.V1 
 These reports must be sent to the GW PVD using the same fax number for SAE 
reporting within 24 hours of becoming aware of the results.  In addition, please send a 
copy of the patient ’s baseline laboratory results with all reports to the GW PVD.  
Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent with abnormal elevations in TBL 
that meet the criteria outlined above are considered potential cases of drug -induced 
liver injury and will be considered as protocol defined criteria for withdrawal and 
important medical events.   The investigator will arrange for the patient to return to the 
investigational site as soon as possible (within 24 –48 hours of notice of abnormal 
results) for repeat assessment  of ALT, AST, TBL, alkaline phosphatase and 
gamma-glutamyl transferase, detailed history and physical examination.  Patients 
should be followed in this way until all abnormalities have normalized (in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) or returned to the baseline state; however, if the above 
transaminase elevation criteria are confirmed by [CONTACT_313029] -up laboratory 
tests, the patient must be withdrawn from the trial.  
Elevations in ALT or AST > 3 × ULN or TBL > 2 × ULN alone are not considered 
potential cases of drug -induced liver injury, but will be followed as detailed above, 
within 72 hours’ notice of abnormal results.  If the participant cannot return to the investigational center, repeat assessments may be done at a local laboratory and the 
results sent to GW PVD.  
12.9 Notification of Safety Information to Investigator s, Regulatory 
Authorities and Ethics Committees.  
In accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive
60, relevant parts of the FDA Code 
of Federal Regulations62 and any national regulations, GW will inform i nvestigator s, 
Regulatory Authorities and relevant EC s/IRBs of all relevant safety information .  This 
will include the reporting of relevant SAEs an d all Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Drug Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
This information will be provided through three sources:  
1) IB: a compi[INVESTIGATOR_312938]- clinical safety data available on the 
IMP that is relevant to the study .  The IB is updated annually. 
2) Development Core Safety Information: this document forms the safety section 
of the IB51, or is updated as an addendum to the IB51.  This document is 
revised if necessary , when new important safety information becomes 
available ( potentially  up to a few times a year).

 3) Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) reports: 
these reports are issued every time a S[LOCATION_003]R is reported to GW .  They pro vide 
information on individual case reports and are sent to all the Regulatory 
Authorities , the relevant  central ECs/IRBs which have approved the study and 
investigators.  As required , the investigator should notify their regional 
ECs/IRBs of SAEs or  S[LOCATION_003]Rs  occurring at their center  and other AE  reports, 
i.e., CIOMS reports and any additional safety documentation received from 
GW, in accordance with local procedures.  
In the [LOCATION_003], investigators are normally required to promptly report to their I RBs all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to human patients, or others, including AE s 
that should be considered unanticipated problems.  Based on current FDA guidance57 
the following clarification is provided in determining what constitutes an 
unanticipated problem: 
In general, an AE observed during the conduct of a study should be considered an 
unanticipated problem involving risk to patient s and reported to the IRB, only  if it 
were unexpected, serious, and would have implications for the conduct of the study (e.g., requiring a significant, and usually safety-related, change in the protocol such as 
revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring requirement, informed consent /assent, or IB).  An individual AE occurrence ordinarily  does not 
meet these criteria because, as an isolated event, its implications for the study cannot be understood. 
In The Netherlands, all SAEs observed during the conduct of a study will be reported 
within the stipulated timelines to the De Medisch Ethische 
Toetsingscommissie /Centrale Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek only  if it were 
considered an unanticipated problem involving risk to patients and would have implications for the conduct of the study (e.g., requiring a significant, and usually 
safety-related, change in the protocol such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or 
including a new monitoring requirement, informed consent/assent, or IB).  All other 
SAEs will be report ed in a cumulative summary as part of the Development Safety 
Update Report and updated on a yearly basis.  This does not replace the ongoing obligation to report any S[LOCATION_003]Rs originating in The Netherlands, which do not meet 
the above criteria, to the accredited Medical Research E thics Committee  and 
competent authority.

notify the IRB of unanticipated problems, any i nvestigator s participating in a

safety issues or  case reports that are considered to be unanticipated and provide such 
reports as mentioned above. It should be noted that a single S[LOCATION_003]R report notified to

 13 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be produced prior to unblinding of the study.  
Any deviations from the original SAP will be described in the final clinical study 
report. 
13.1 Sample Size, Power and Significance Levels 
Blinded Phase:  
A total of 210 patients will be enrolled.  The 210 patients will be randomly allocated 
to one of four treatment groups (GWP42003-P 25 mg/kg/day, GWP42003- P 
50 mg/kg/day, placebo 25 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent, or placebo 50 mg/kg/day dose volume equivalent) at a 2:2:1:1 ratio.  The placebo groups will be pooled for the analyses of efficacy.  
If it is assumed that patients in the placebo group will experience a mean reduction in seizure frequency of 15% (from baseline), patients receiving GWP42003- P will 
experience at least a 50% reduction in seizures and a common standard deviation of 
60%, then this sample size of [ADDRESS_868720] a difference in response distributions with 90% power.  This test is based on a two -
sided non- parametric Wilcoxon -Mann-Whitney test for continuous response data with 
a 5% significance level.  
Open-label Extension: 
All patients who wish to continue on IMP following the blinded phase. 
13.2 Interim Analysis  
Blinded Phase:  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  The blinded phase of this study will be 
locked and unblinded prior to completion of the OLE.  The SAP covering the blinded 
phase will be finalized prior to unblinding the blinded phase. 
Open-label Extension: 
A cut of the OLE data will be used  to support New Drug Application and Market ing 
Authorization Application filings.  Further data cuts may be conducted as required.

 13.3 Analysis Sets  
Blinded Phase:  
There will be up to three analysis sets in the blinded phase: 
Intention to Treat (ITT) 
• All patients who are randomized, receive IMP in the study and have 
post-baseline efficacy data will be included and analyzed according to their 
randomized treatment group. 
• The ITT analysis set is the primary analysis set for all efficacy endpoints.  
Per Protocol (PP)  
If there are a sufficient number of s ignificant protocol deviations in the study, a PP 
analysis set may also be presented.  
• All patients who complete the study with no protocol deviations deemed to 
compromise the assessment of efficacy will be included and analyzed 
according to the treatment g roup they were randomized.  The rules 
determining the PP analysis set will be fully defined prior to unblinding of the 
database. 
Safety 
All patients who received at least one dose of IMP in the study will be included and 
analyzed according to the treatment  received.  Only patients for whom it has been 
confirmed that they did not take any IMP will be excluded from this safety analysis set. 
Open-label Extension: 
There will be one analysis set in the open -label extension phase:  
Safety 
All patients who received  at least one dose of IMP in the open- label extension phase 
of the study will be included.  Only patients for whom it has been confirmed that they 
did not take any IMP in the OLE  phase will be excluded from this safety analysis set.

Protocol deviations will be listed and reasons for exclusion from the analysis 
populations will be summarized.

 13.4 General Considerations  
Unless stated otherwise, continuous variables will be summarized showing the 
number of non- missing values ( n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and 
maximum and categorical variables will be summarized showing the number and percentage of patients falling in each category.  
Unless otherwise specified, tables for the blinded phases will be summarized by [CONTACT_21964], and for the OLE  phase will be summarized overall.  
13.5 Accountability and Background Characteristics  
13.5.1 Enrollment and Disposition 
All patients (screened, enrolled/randomized, prematurely terminated IMP) will be accounted for in the enrollment and disposition summary tables. 
13.5.2 Baseline and Demographic Characteristics  
Age, sex, ethnic origin (as allowed per local regulations) and any other demographic 
or baseline characteristics, includin g history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_648439]- specific genetic 
testing, will be summarized, using appropriate summary statistics.  
13.5.3 Medical History  
Previous and current medical conditions will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196]

13.5.4 Concomitant Medication 
Concomitant medications (including standard AED and rescue medication) taken 
prior to and during the study will be summarized separately, by [CONTACT_648496].  
13.6 Endpoints and Statistical Methods  
Blinded Phase: 
Statistical hypothesis testing will be performed on the primary endpoint and other 
endpoints as appropriate.  Each endpoint, including the primary will have 
[ADDRESS_868721] placebo (25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P and 50 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P vs. placebo).  Also, [ADDRESS_868722] been defined.

 The primary and key secondary endpoints will be tested with their Type I error 
controlled by [CONTACT_2363] a hierarchical gate -keepi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], in the sequence given in 
Table 13.6-1.  One must reject the null hypothesis of an endpoint at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis of the subsequent endpoint in the sequence at the le vel 
of 0.05 (2-sided). If a null hypothesis is not rejected then testing will stop and all subsequent analyses will be declared not statistically significant.  
 
13.6.1 Evaluable Period  
Blinded Phase:  
The start of the evaluable period of the study (Day 1) is defined as the first day the patient took IMP, as recorded on the CRF, or the day of randomization if this date is unknown. 
The end of the evaluable period is defined as the earliest of: 
• Day 113 of treatment for the IVRS reported effi cacy data and the day of 
Visit 10 for the CRF -based efficacy data;

 13.6.2 Primary Endpoint(s)  
Blinded Phase:  
The primary endpoint is the change in number of seizures* during the treatment 
period (maintenance and titration) compared to baseline in patients taking 
GWP42003-P compared with placebo. 
*Seizures include: focal motor seizures without impairment of consciousness or 
awareness; focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness; focal seizures evolving to bilateral generalized convulsive seizures and generalized seizures (tonic–clonic, tonic, clonic or atonic) that are countable.  
Data will be analyzed using negative binomial regression on the sum of the seizure 
counts during the treatment period.  However, seizure frequency (average per 28 days) and percentage change in seizure frequency will be presented using summary statistics.  A mixed effect model with repeated measures will be performed modelling 
the observed number of seizures in the baseline period and treatment period implemented within the framework of general linear models using the negative binomial response distribution.  The model will include stratified age group (1 –6 
years, 7–11 years, 12–17 years and 18–65 years), time, trea tment arm and treatment 
arm by [CONTACT_648497] a random effect.  The log 
transformed number of days in which seizures were reported will be included as an offset.  The time variable corresponds to an indicator for the baseline period and 
treatment period.  The estimated ratio of least squares means for treatment period to 
baseline period and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be presented for each treatment arm.  In addition, the estimated ratio of each GWP42003-P group to placebo 
and 95% CIs will be presented along with the p- value testing the null hypothesis that 
this ratio is 1.  
The hypothesis testing approach for controlling the Type I error is described in 
Section 13.6 and Table 13.6-1. 
If a patient withdraws from the study, then the primary analysis variable will be 
calculated from the available data, during the treatment period, prior to the patient 
withdrawing.  
Open-label Extension: 
The primary endpoint is the safety of GWP42003- P, evaluated by [CONTACT_648451], type and severity of AEs.  Data will be presented as per Section [IP_ADDRESS].

 [IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis for the Primary Endpoint  
Blinded Phase:  
The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary endpoint for the 
blinded phase: 
• Wilcoxon rank- sum test on percentage change from baseline in seizure 
frequency during the treatment period.  An estimate of the median differences 
between each GWP42003-P group and placebo, together with approximate 
95% CIs, will be calculated using the Hodges –Lehmann approach. 
• Primary endpoint analysis repeated  using the PP analysis set. 
• Primary endpoint analysis repeated using the maintenance period (Day 29 to 
the end of the evaluable period) rather than the treatment period . 
• Primary endpoint analysis repeated  using the worst case of last observation 
carried forward (LOCF), next observation carried backward (NOCB) and the mean from the non- missing data for each patient to impute missing data 
arising from unreported days in IVRS. 
− Any intermittent missing data for the number of seizures arising from 
unreported days in IVRS will be imputed using the worst (highest number 
of seizures) of the following for each patient: LOCF, NOCB and the mean daily number of seizures during the treatment period based on non- missing 
data: 
Number of seizures ÷  Number of reported days in IVRS. 
• A rank ANCOVA on percentage change from baseline in number of seizures 
(average per 28 days) during the treatment period. 
− The ranks of the percentage change from baseli ne and the baseline number 
of seizures (average per 28 days) will be calculated.  The rank of the 
percentage change from baseline will then be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with the rank of the baseline number of seizures (average per 
28 days) and age group (1–6 years, 7–11 years, 12–17 years and 18–65 
years) as covariates and treatment group as a fixed factor.   The estimated 
least squares means, treatment differences, together with the 95% CIs and 
p-value will be presented.  
• ANCOVA of log transformed number of seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period.

 − The number of seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period 
and the baseline number of seizures (average per 28 days) will be log 
transformed prior to analysis.  The log transformed number of seizures (average per 28  days) during the treatment period will then be analyzed 
using an ANCOVA model with the log transformed baseline number of 
seizures (average per 28  days) and age group as covariates and treatment 
group as a fixed facto r.  The back transformed estimated treatment ratios, 
together with the 95% CIs and p-value will be presented. 
− If there are any patients with no seizures post -baseline, then 1 will be 
added to the number of seizures (average per 28 days) for all patients pr ior 
to log transformation.  
• Primary endpoint analysis repeated using each 4 weeks of the maintenance 
period (Week 1 to 4, Week 5 to 8 and Week 9 to 12 of the 12- week 
maintenance period)  rather than the treatment period . 
− This analysis will include only patie nts who have at least 7 days of seizure 
data within each corresponding 4- week period.  
• Wilcoxon rank- sum test on percentage change from baseline in number of 
seizures (average per 28 days) during the treatment period, using multiple 
imputation (MI) to impute data under the Missing Not at Random (MNAR) 
assumption. 
− MNAR will be assumed for missing values resulting from two scenarios, 
discontinuation due to AEs, and discontinuation due to any reason in the 
GWP42003-P dose groups and missing at random ( MAR) for others, 
including other patients discontinued in the GWP42003-P dose groups and patients in the placebo group. 
− MI will be performed on the seizure frequency, based on time points 
corresponding to each [ADDRESS_868724] 14-day time-point will be imputed using the MCMC method in SAS 
PROC MI with an IMPUTE=MONOTONE statement for 100 times for each treatment group separately.  Then, monotone missing data assumed 
under the MAR assumption at time-point t  (i.e., patients in the placebo 
group and patients in the GWP42003-P groups who did not discontinue due to AEs or for any reason) will be imputed using the MI procedure with the ‘MONOTONE REG’ option, for ea ch treatment group separately.  The

time-point up to time-point t  (in chronological order).  With the data 
imputed from above, monotone missing data of patients in the 
GWP42003- P groups under the MNAR assumption will be imputed. At 
each 14-day time-point t, the input dataset for the MI procedure will 
include all placebo patients and those patients from the GWP42003- P 
groups that have values missing under MNAR at that time -point. The

14-day time-point up to time-point t  (in chronological order) and will be 
performed for each GWP42003- P group separately.  
Full details  for this sensitivity analysis will be pro vided in the SAP. 
13.6.3 Secondary Endpoint(s)

Following completion or t ermination of a clinical study , GW will initiate proper 
archive of clinical study -related documentation and electronic records generated by 
[CONTACT_1755]/or GW.  All clinical trial- related documents and electronic 
records will be retained within an archiving system for a period dependent upon need 
and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_868729] 
retention.  No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement 
between GW and the investigator .  Should the i nvestigator  wish to assign the study 
records to another party or move them to another location, he/she must notify GW in writing of the new responsible person and/or the new location.

pertinent data, provided that patient  confidentiality is respected.  
The GW study monitor , or designee,  is responsible for ins pecting the CRFs and 
available IVRS /diary data at regular intervals throughout the study to verify 
adherence to the protocol, completeness, accuracy and consistency of the data and 
adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research.  The st udy monitor

 should have access to patient  medical records and other study- related records needed 
to verify the entries in the CRFs.  
The investigator agrees to co -operate with the study monitor to ensure that any 
problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
To ensure the quality of clinical data across all patients and centers, a clinical data 
management review will be performed on patient  data received at GW or a contract 
research organization (CRO) .  During this review, patient data will be checked for 
consistency, omissions and any apparent discrepancies.  In addition, the data will be 
reviewed for adherence to the protocol and FDA regulations57,58,59,68, ICH Tripartite 
Guidelines for GCP Topic E6(R2)52 and all other applicable regulatory re quirements .   
To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review process, 
data queries and/or center  notifications will be sent to the center for completion and 
then returned to GW or the CRO , as applicable. 
16.4 Electronic Data collected  by [CONTACT_648506] E6( R2)52 and 
in adherence to a quality management system .  All data will be stored in a secure 
(e.g., redundant hardware, password control, limited physical access to servers), fully 
audit trailed environment with appropriate industry standard back-up and off- site 
storage practices.  
Access for patients providing assessments and investigator s will be authenticated and 
meet industry standards and comply with the requirements outlined in the FDA Code 
of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 11, Subpart B ( Electronic Records)68.  
After database lock , all investigator s will receive a certified copy of all IVRS  
assessment data.  Th ese data will be in an agreed, read -only format with a covering 
letter explaining the content of the data, a quality statement from the IVRS provider 
and the investigator ’s responsibilities.  
Regulatory and sponsor auditors will have the ability to review, but not modify, IVRS 
data via an agreed means of access.

Clinical Protocol Amendment Template  V1, 24Sep15  1 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
Trial Title A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to 
investigate the  efficacy and safety of cannabidiol (GWP42003-P, 
CBD) as add -on therapy in patients with tuberous sclerosis 
complex who experienc e inadequately -controlled seizures . 
Indication Seizures* in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). 
*Seizures include: focal motor seizures without impairment of 
consciousness or awareness; focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness; focal seizures evolving to bilateral generalized convulsive seizures and generalized seizures (tonic-clonic, tonic, clonic or atonic) that are countable. 
Trial Design This multicenter study consists of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double -blind phase followed by [CONTACT_18428]-label extension (OLE) phase.  
Blinded Phase:  
The blinded phase of the study is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 16-week comparison of two doses of GWP42003- P 
versus placebo.  Patients will complete a 1 -week screening period 
and a 4-
week baseline period before they are randomized to receive 
25 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P, 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P or 
equivalent volumes of placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_648511] r anges: 1–6,  
7–11, 12–17 years and 18+ years.  Patients will begin a [ADDRESS_868747] (IMP) for [ADDRESS_868748] to the investigator’s 
assessment of safety and tolerability.  If a dose becomes poorly 
tolerated, the investigator may consider temporarily or permanently 
reducing the dose for the remainder of the study. 
Clinic visits will occur for screening (Day  −35), baseline 
(Day −28), randomization (Day 1) and, on Days 15 and 29 during 
titration and on Days 43, 57, 71 (telephone) and 85 until the end of treatment (Day  113).  Safety telephone calls will be completed 
every two days during titra tion, one week after the end of titration 
and, for patients not entering the OLE, weekly from Visit 10 to Visit 12.  If the call falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule 
the call for the Friday before or Monday after the weekend instead. 
Patients will be required to perform daily interactive voice response system (IVRS) telephone calls to record seizure information.  They will also complete a paper diary daily with information about their IMP and concomitant AED administration. 
 
Following completion of the blinded phase, patients will be invited

Clinical Protocol Amendment Template  V1, 24Sep15  to continue to receive GWP42003 -P in an OLE.  
Those patients opting not to enter the OLE will complete a 10- day 
taper period (down-titrating 10% per day for 10 days).  
Open-label Extension Transition:  
In order to maintain consistent exposure to IMP and maintain the 
integrity of the blind, patients will enter a 2 -week blinded transition 
to the OLE.  OLE IMP will be titrated up to 25  mg/kg/day whilst 
blinded IMP is simultaneously tapered down to zero.  All patien ts 
will complete the transition and enter the OLE taking 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P:  
• Patients from the placebo group will titrate up to 25  mg/kg/day 
GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 25  mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group will 
continue to take 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
• Patients from the 50  mg/kg/day GWP42003-P group will taper 
down (10% per day) to 25 mg/kg/day GWP42003- P. 
Safety telephone calls will be completed every two days throughout the OLE transition.  If the call falls on a weekend, it is 
permitted to  
schedule the call for the Friday before or Monday after 
the weekend instead.  
Open-label Extension: 
The OLE consists of a 3-week titration period followed by a maintenance period and a [ADDRESS_868749] for a maximum of  1 year. 
Following titration according to the titration schedule, patients will continue with their optimal GWP42003-P dose.  However, investigators may decrease the dose if a patient experiences intolerance, or increase the dose to a maximum of 50 mg/kg/d ay if 
required for better seizure control, until the optimal dose is found.  Dose increases above 25  mg/kg/day are recommended to be done 
slowly, with maximum increments of 2.5 mg/kg/day every two days.  Patients whose dose has been decreased can have thei r 
dose increased again provided there is adequate tolerance.  Safety 
telephone calls will be completed every two days throughout the OLE titration and one week after the end of titration.   If the call 
falls on a weekend, it is permitted to schedule the cal l for the 
Friday before or Monday after the weekend instead.  If seizure 
freedom is achieved with use of GWP42003-
P during the study, the 
investigator should consider reducing the dose of concomitant AEDs after six  months of seizure freedom.

This clinical protocol amendment 7 (will be incorporated into the Protocol creating 
Clinical Protocol Version 8 D ate 23 April 2019) addresses the following issue(s): 
2.1 Change in Hierarchy for Analysis 
Following review of the original hierarchy for analysis, the Global Impression of 
Change (GIC) and total seizure endpoints were deemed of lower critical importance 
compared with the TSC-associated seizure endpoints.  Therefore, the GIC and total seizure en dpoints were moved down in the hierarchy so that all TSC -associated 
seizure endpoints are tested first.  
2.2 Minor Corrections and Clarifications  
• ICH definition changed on 23 October 2015 from ‘International Conference 
on Harmonisation’ to ‘International Counci l for Harmonisation ’.  References 
to ICH updated accordingly throughout.

Trial GWEP1521 consists of a randomized, parallel-group, 16- week double-blind- phase 
comparing 2  doses of GWP42003- P with placebo, followed by a 1- year open-label 
extension (OLE) phase.  To ensure continued access to GWP42003- P prior to approval, 
the OLE phase will be extended to a total of 4 years in duration in the [LOCATION_002] ( US).  
Patients will complete the OLE phase when GWP42003-P is approved in tuberous 
sclerosis complex (TSC) and is commercially available to the patient, or after a maximum 
of [ADDRESS_868758] been added at Week 78, Week 104, Week  130, Week 156, and 
Week 182 (relative to Visit B1).  Investigational medicinal product (IMP) dispensing 
visits have also  been added between assessment visits in year s 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_868759].  Following completion of the OLE, patients who do not 
immediately continue to use commercial GWP42003- P will commence a 10-day taper 
period (tapering 10% per day) before attending an End of Taper visit.  A safety follow -up 
telephone call  will be completed 2 weeks after the End of Taper visit and a safety 
Follow-up visit will be completed 4  weeks after the End of Taper visit.

a End of Treatmen t/Withdrawal  Visit will occur: 1)  following early withdrawal from the trial ; 2) in place of the next scheduled clinic visit (assessment or 
resupply) when GWP42003- P is approved in TSC and is commercially available to the patient; or 3) after a maximum of 4 years of OLE treatment  
(i.e., 208 weeks [±7  days] from Visit B1 ); whichever occurs first.  
b Only required for patients who withdraw from the trial or complete treatment but do not immediately continue to use commercial GWP42003 -P. 
c Safety Telephone C all must be made 2 weeks (+3 days) after the patient ’s last dose of IMP . 
d This must be mad e 4 weeks (+3 days)  after the patient ’s last dose of IMP  and can be conducted by [CONTACT_756]. 
e Visits B13, B14, B16, B17, B19, B20, B22, B23, B25, B26, B28, and B29 – Resupply visits ( ±7 days).

Patients and their parent(s)/legal representative will be invited to participate in years 2, 3, 
and 4 of the OLE when they reach Visit B10 of the OLE  phase.  They will be issued with 
additional OLE patient information and informed assent or the patient/par ent(s)/legal 
representative information and informed consent (as applicable).  Following adequate 
time to discuss the additional visits with the investigator, nurse, relatives or caregiver, patients/parent(s)/legal representatives who provide written infor med consent/assent at 
Visit B10 will continue in the OLE.  
Patients will continue to make weekly interactive voice response system ( IVRS) diary 
calls throughout their second, third , and fourth years of OLE participation. 
4.1 Visit B10 (Week 52) 
In addition to the visit schedule outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] of the main protocol, patients 
treated in the US who provide written informed consent/assent (see Section  5) will 
receive sufficient open -label IMP for 9 weeks’ home dosing and will be instructed to 
maintain consistent dosing.  An additional dose calculator and paper diary will be issued, and patients will be trained on their appropriate use. 
The Study Medication Use and Behavior Survey should not be administered  at Visit B10 
for patients entering the second year of the OLE.  The investigator must record the patient’s attendance at the visit and confirm their c ontinued participation. 
4.2 Resupply Visit s B13 (Week 61), B14  (Week 70), B16  (Week 87), 
B17 (Week 96), B19 (Week 113), B20  (Week 122), B22  (Week 139), 
B23 (Week 148), B25 (Week 165), B26 (Week 1 74), B28  (Week 191), 
and B29 (Week 200) 
Visits B13, B14, B16, B17, B19, B20, B22, B23, B25, B26, B 28, and B29 will occur 61, 
70, 87, 96, 113, 122, 139, 148, 165, 174, 191, and 200 weeks  after Visit B1 , respectively .  
A visit window of ±7 days from the scheduled visit date is permitted, but it is preferred that the visit is performed on the scheduled visit day where possible. 
Attendance of the patient is not required for resupply visits provided the primary 
caregiver is able to attend.   However, it is preferred that the patient attend where possible.

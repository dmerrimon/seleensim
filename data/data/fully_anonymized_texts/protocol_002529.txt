Objectives  The purpose of this study is to show the sa fety and feasibility of a new fully automated AP 
controller with and without the Bolus Priming System  
Study Design  A randomized cross -over trial  assessing glycemic responses to a fully automated  AP system 
using two  approaches :  
1) using the Bolus Priming System (which detects shifts in glucose level to trigger a priming 
dose of insulin)  
2) without the Bolus Priming System  
We will also have structured meal and exercise challenges of the fully closed loop system.  
Number of Sites  One 
Endpoint  The primary outcome will be time in range 70 -180 mg/dL for a 24- hour period. 
Population  Key Inclusion Criteria

 Chapter 1  Background 93 
 
 94 
A major impediment to maintaining blood glucose (BG) control in  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is missed 95 
meal boluses, which has been associated with significantly higher HbA1c levels .1  While the 96 
advent of the artificial pancreas (AP) offers promise of safe reductions in HbA1c, our research 97 
group previously found that current  AP systems only partly compensates for missed prandial 98 
insulin .2 We thus designed a new system called RocketAP  to be fully automated, utilizing  a Bolus 99 
Priming System (BPS) that recognizes meal ingestion and delivers a quick priming dose of insulin 100 
prior to extreme blood sugar excursions. When used as a fully automated closed loop (FCL) system 101 
(without any meal announcements to the controller), this system improves time -in-range compared 102 
to a current commercially available system (Con trol-IQ). However, we have not previously 103 
determined whether the BPS provides improved blood sugar control over what the Rocket AP 104 
controller could without the BPS.  Indeed, when the BPS provides a bolus, it reduces the amount 105 
of insulin the controller can provide in response to high blood sugars —leaving open the possibility [ADDRESS_1048154] spurious changes in blood sugar and provide a priming dose of insulin 110 
in the absence of a meal.   111 
In the current study, the maximum amount of insulin that the BPS injects (which varies based on 112 
the system’s calculation of the probability that a meal has been ingested) is 6% of the person’s 113 
total daily insulin for any individual meal. This system is equipped with a novel hypoglycemia  114 
anti-rebound system , which constrains insulin infusion after  CGM /SMBG readings <70 mg/dL. 115 
The BPS system is also silenced at night (23:00 – 6:00h). 116 
In the current study, we are testing this Rocket AP system for BG levels using two approaches :  117 
A randomized cross -over trial where each participant will experience FCL for two 24- hour study 118 
periods in random order (referred to as FCL1 and FCL2) with : 119 
• The BPS functioning 120 
• The BPS inactivated  [ADDRESS_1048155] the Rocket AP system in FCL  122 
with further challenges, both before and after the change in BP S treatment arm —i.e., not as a 123 
cross -over assessment but a comparison between participants randomized to start with  or without 124 
BPS.  These challenges will include:  125 
• A session of high- intensity interval training  (assessing the safety of the BPS when BG’s 126 
may spi[INVESTIGATOR_764870]) [ADDRESS_1048156]-2022  Page 14 of 56 
 • A high-carbohydrate, high- fat meal (assessing how the system  responds to prolonged 128 
carbohydrate absorption) 129 
• Ingestion of a bolus of simple sugar (assessing the safety of the BPS when the user’s 130 
blood sugar spi[INVESTIGATOR_764871] a relatively low amount of carbohydrate)    131 
Participants  will be admitted to a hotel and started o n the RocketAP for the purpose of comparing 132 
FCL use with and without BPS  as described above, all implemented on the DiAs platform ( MAF 133 
2109).  As an assessment of the efficacy of the system in maintaining BG control, participants will 134 
be followed for appro ximately 24 hours in the randomized phase (FCL1 vs. FCL2) and during the 135 
24-hour cross -over phase. Our primary outcome will be one of efficacy in assessing BG control  136 
(TIR 70 -180 mg/dL) between the two 24-hour FCL1/FCL2 periods.  [ADDRESS_1048157] the performance of  the Rocket AP in FCL  both with and without 143 
the BPS, assessing efficacy and safety . We will target  completion of up to 20 adults in a 144 
randomized cross -over trial, comparing blood glucose time in range 70- 180 mg/dL for two 24- 145 
hour periods  and assessing TIR during an additional challenge period, which will be compared 146 
between those who started on BPS vs. those who did not.    147 
 
 148 
We will consent up to 30 participants,  ages ≥18.0 and ≤[ADDRESS_1048158] up to 20 149 
participants complete the trial. The study will be performed overnight at a local hotel /rental  house 150 
(heretofore referred to as “hotel ”). Enrollment in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_423800] 151 
completing a minimum of 2 -3 participants. This admission will be about 24 hours  at a hotel/rented 152 
house. Enrollment in the Main Study will proceed with th e goal of completing 20 participants.   153 
1.3.1 Study Hardware/Software 154 
The study itself will involve use of the DiAs prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_25586] (MAF 2109), connected to a 155 
Tandem t:AP research pump and a Dexcom G6 sensor, and implementing Rocket AP with and [ADDRESS_1048159]-2022  Page 15 of 56 
 G6 Transmitter will be linked with DiAs. Participants will then be taught how to use DiAs in this 163 
configuration. The research pump will be programmed  with the individual ’s usual insulin [ADDRESS_1048160] their blood sugar managed through this  system 165 
during the entirety of the time at hotel. 166 
1.3.3 Study Controller Ses sions 167 
Order and timing  of controller sessions : During the hotel stay, participants will have two separate 168 
24-hour periods during which they will receive FCL control with and without the BPS active .  169 
These will be separated by a 24 -hour challenge period which will involve further challenges.  The 170 
timing and potential order of these sessions is shown in Figure 1. 171 
 172 
Figure 1:  Timeline and randomized order of the Study Controller Sessions  173 
During these 24- hour periods participants will be followed for the experimental meals as part of 174 
the Study Controller Sessions to compare blood glucose control with and without the BP S (Figure 175 
1). The study meals and activities will be standardized between study sessions (see Figure 2).  [ADDRESS_1048161]-2022  Page 16 of 56 
  177

The primary outcome will compare the percent time CGM is between 70 and 180 mg/dL during [ADDRESS_1048163] morning of the study (Day 2 of study), study staff who will be present will include nursing 188 
staff and technical staff ; a study physician will be available either on- site or nearby [CONTACT_78150] -site at all 189 
times . Hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia treatment protocols will be followed per guidelines. We 190 
anticipate more significant cases of hyperglycemia during meals on the study system because of 191 
the lack of carbohydrate announcement; participants will be encouraged to drink large amounts of [ADDRESS_1048164]-2022  Page 18 of 56

about any changes to the participant’s medical history.  Any changes to medical history will be [ADDRESS_1048194]’s CGM reading, and ketone concentration will be recorded. In the event that the 519 
participant’s CGM reading is not between 80- 250 mg/dL or ketone concentration is ≥ 0.6 mmol/L [ADDRESS_1048195]-2022  Page 29 of 56 
 dosing according to the participants’ usual doses . Study physician may elect to cancel participant’s 522 
participation in the hotel admission if concerned about their medical safety.  This participant will 523 
not be replaced.  524 
The participant’s home insulin pump will be discontinued, and the study Tandem research  insulin 525 
pump will be initiated  using the RocketAP system with BPS activated .  The study team will ensure 526 
the proper function of the CGM, insulin pump, and activity tracker. T he goal will be to initiate 527 
Closed -Loop Control by [CONTACT_423815], running the Rocket AP system  on the DiAs 528 
platform .  529 
The CGM used in the study is FDA -approved for the non- adjunctive measurement of blood 530 
glucose (i.e. the CGM reading can be used for insulin dosing decisions). The CGM readings will 531 
be the primary source of blood glucose values .  There are no protocol fingerstick blood glucose 532 
measurements other than at times of CGM calibration (if necessary) and if directed by [CONTACT_1758] [ADDRESS_1048196] in the morning will be with the BPS system engaged. 540 
Throughout the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the participant will remain in closed loop mode.  541 
 
 542 
In the afternoon after admission, participants will participate in a supervised bout of high- intensity 543 
interval training (see details in Section 7.8). D uring this time, the system will have BPS activated. 544 
Apart from the programmed exercise portions, participants will be free to engage in low- intensity 545 
activity ( i.e. walking) during the admission . Participants will enjoy quiet activities in the evening. 546 
 
 547 
Discharge will be at approximately noon. D ischarge criteria is CGM value 80 -300 mg/dL with 548 
stable trend and ketones <=0.6 mmol/L. I f the CGM values are above 300 mg/dL and ketone values 549 
are >0.6 mmol/L, the study team will check the insulin pump infusion site and correction insulin [ADDRESS_1048197]’s insulin pump.   A qualified 551 
clinical study team member (e.g. MD, NP, PA, CDE) will assess and discuss the transition back to 552 
usual care with t he study participant.    553 
Participants will be asked to continue monitoring ketone levels for 24- 48 hours after the hotel 554 
admission  if ketones were >0.6 mmol/L at time of discharge. Urine ketone supplies may be [ADDRESS_1048198] the participant 558

• Should any concerns regarding medical history, pump information, or unforeseen issues [ADDRESS_1048202] for COVID -19 after arriving for the study .  The study team will 593 
perform vital signs and inquire about any changes to the participant’s medical history.  Any [ADDRESS_1048203]’s CGM reading, and ketone concentration will be recorded. In the event that the 599 
participant’s CGM reading is not between 80- 250 mg/dL or ketone concentration is ≥0.6 mmol/L 600 
prior to initiation of the UVa artificial pancreas system, the study physician may recommend  601 
additional insulin dosing according to the participants’ usual doses. Study physician may elect to 602 
cancel participant’s participation in the hotel admission if concerned about their medical safety.  603 
This participant will not be replaced.  604 
The participant’s home insulin pump will be discontinued, and the  study insulin pump will be 605 
initiated.  The study team will ensure the proper function of the CGM, insulin pump, and activity 606 
tracker.   607 
The CGM used in the study is FDA -approved for the non- adjunctive measurement of blood 608 
glucose (i.e. the CGM reading can be used for insulin dosing decisions). The CGM readings will 609 
be the primary source of blood glucose values.  There are no protocol fingerstick blood glucose 610 
measurements other than at times of CGM calibration (if necessary) and if directed by [CONTACT_1758] [ADDRESS_1048204] to insulin do sing.  The 618 
transfer from one treatment to another will proceed as follows: 619 
• The system is stopped 620 
• DiAs is plugged into a laptop and ‘parameters.xml’ file (with the corresponding BPS 621 
condition) will be replaced  622 
• DiAs is restarted  623 
• CGM is recovered and pump connections is checked 624 
• DiAs is transitioned to Closed Loop Control mode  625 
 
 626 
Participants will eat structured study meals during the admission, with the same amount of 627 
carbohydrate, protein and fat for meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) on the days for FCL1 and FCL2).  628 
During the 24- hour challenge period, there will be additional meal challenges that will only be 629 
performed on that day.  This includes a high carbohydrate high fat meal at dinner (such as pi[INVESTIGATOR_6107]) [ADDRESS_1048205] -acting carbs (e.g.. juice).  In all cases the [ADDRESS_1048206] non- carbohydrate snacks.  Blood glucose levels will be 635 
followed via continuous glucose monitor and glucose values will be managed by [CONTACT_423814] 636 
as usual.  637 
 
 638 
During the study, we will challenge the participants with exercise sessions that will be supervised 639 
by [CONTACT_464].  During FCL1 and FCL2, participants will do a mild to moderate walking or similar 640 
exercise at approximately 4pm on each of those study days. 641 
During the challenge phase (the 24- hour period between the FCL1 and FCL2), participants will 642 
undergo supervised session of high- intensity interval training (HIIT). The HIIT workout will [ADDRESS_1048207]. This 3- minute set 645 
of intervals may be repeated up to 6 times or until volitional exhaustion, followed by [CONTACT_3450] 646 
5 minutes of light intensity cooldown and stretching. The goal of this will be to assess the safety 647 
of the AP system in HIIT, given that HIIT has been observed to result in an increase in BG levels, 648 
which could theoretically lead to activation of the BPS —dosing insulin.  The AP system will be 649 
monitored for BPS activation during this workout.  If the BPS is activated, participants will 650 
continue to be monitored for BG excursions, including receiving treatment for hypoglycemia if 651 
this occurs (as described in the Glycemic Treatment Guidelines) .   [ADDRESS_1048208] pain, dizziness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814],  or any such concerning symptoms reported by [CONTACT_4317]. 654 
Participants will stop their participation in the exercise portion of the study if reporting any 655 
concerning symptoms. Study physicians (or physician’s assistants) will assess the participants for 656 
their need for additional care outside the study. If symptoms resolve entirely and there is no 657 
additional requirement for care outside the study, participants will stop participation in the exercise 658 
portion of the study and will not repeat that portion of the study. Participants however may then 659 
continue with the remainder of the study per investigator discretion.  660 
Participants will also be free to engage in low -intensity activity ( i.e. walking) during the hotel [ADDRESS_1048209]-2022  Page 34 of 56 
 
 
 666 
Discharge will be at approximately  1 pm . Discharge criteria is CGM value 80 -300 mg/dL with 667 
stable trend and ketones <=0.6 mmol/L. If the CGM values are above 300 mg/dL and ketone values 668 
are >0.6 mmol/L, the study team will check the insulin pump infusion site and correction insulin [ADDRESS_1048210]’s insulin pump. A qualified 670 
clinical study team member (e.g. MD,  NP, PA, CDE) will assess and discuss the transition back to 671 
usual care with the study participant.    672 
Participants will be asked to continue monitoring ketone levels for 24- 48 hours after the hotel 673 
admission  if ketones were >0.6 mmol/L prior to discharge. Urine ketone supplies may be provided [ADDRESS_1048211] the participant 680

 Chapter 10  Risks Associated with Clinical Trial 716 
 
 717 
Risks and Benefits are detailed below. Loss of confidentiality is a potential  risk; however, data are 718 
handled to minimize this risk . Hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and ketone formation are always a 719 
risk in participants with type 1 diabetes and participants will be monitored for these symptoms.  720 
10.1.1 Venipuncture Risks  721 
A hollow needle/plast ic tube may  be placed in the arm for taking blood samples  (e.g. external 722 
HbA1c measurements for inclusion criteria) . Blood draws can cause some common reactions like [ADDRESS_1048216] for several weeks . The risk of local 731 
infection is less than 1 in 1000. This should not be a significant contributor to risks in this study 732 
as finger sticks are part of the usual care for people with diabetes. 733 
10.1.3 Subcutaneous Catheter Risks (CGM)  734 
Participants using the CGM will be at low risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of 735 
the sensor needle placement . If a catheter is left under the skin for more than 24 hours it is possible 736 
to get an infection where it goes into the skin, with swelling, redness and pain.  T here may be 737 
bleeding where the catheter is put in and bleeding under the skin causes a bruise (1 in 10 risk). [ADDRESS_1048217] a small portion of the sensor under the skin that may cause redness, swelling, or pain at the 740 
insertion site . The participant should be further instructed to notify the study coordinator 741 
immediately if this occurs.  742 
10.1.4 Risks of Hypoglycemia  743 
As with any person having type 1 diabetes and using insulin, there is always a risk of having a low 744 
blood sugar (hypoglycemia) . The frequency of hypoglycemia should be no more and possibly less [ADDRESS_1048218] as at home, there is the possibility of fainting or seizures 747 
(convulsions) and that for a few days the participant may not be as aware of symptoms of [ADDRESS_1048219] approved the insulin 758 
pump, CGM, glucometer and ketone meter for single use and that by [CONTACT_423818] 759 
patients, bloodborne pathogens (i.e. Hepatitis B) may be spread through the use of mult iple users.  760 
The study CGM system is labelled  for single use only. The sensor (the component of the system 761 
that enters the skin) will be single use only. The transmitter and receiver may be reused during the 762 
study after cleaning the device using a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved cleaning procedure. The transmitter is 763 
attached to the sensor but does not enter the skin and the receiver, if used, is a handheld device.  764 
The study insulin pumps are label led for single -patient use. During the study, this device may be 765 
reused af ter cleaning adhering to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved cleaning procedure. All infusion set 766 
equipment will be single patient use only (infusion set insertion kits, tubing, cartridges etc.).   767 
The study blood glucose meter and blood ketone meter are labe lled for single -patient use. 768 
During the study, these devices may be reused after cleaning adhering to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -approved 769 
cleaning procedure.   770 
10.1.7 Device Cleaning Instructions  771 
CGM cleaning instructions are provided in the Dexcom G4 P latinum (Professional) Cleaning and 772 
Disinfection manual (current edition) and a similar approach will be applied for the G6 version 773 
used in this study. The transmitter should be cleaned with Clorox Healthcare® Bleach Germicidal [ADDRESS_1048220]-2022  Page 39 of 56 
 Per the pump manufacturer, the insulin pump will be cleaned with a damp lint -free cloth. Use of 783 
house hold or industrial cleaners, solvents, bleach, scouring pads, chemicals, or sharp instruments 784 
are prohibited. The pump should never be submerged in water. If needed, use only a very mild 785 
detergent, such as a bit of liquid soap with warm water. A soft to wel will be used to dry the pump.  786 
The glucometer is cleaned and disinfected with two separate Super Sani -Cloths (EPA number 787 
9480-4). The entire surface will be cleaned, making sure the surface stays wet for 2 minutes. This 788 
step is repeated with a clean cl oth for disinfecting the device.  789 
The Precision Xtra User’s Guide suggests that healthcare professionals use 10% bleach, 70% 790 
alcohol or 10% ammonia to clean the device.  [ADDRESS_1048221] skin will be cleaned with ethyl or isopropyl alcohol (70- 90%), 792 
quaternary ammonium germicidal detergent (i.e. Cavicide, EPA number [ZIP_CODE]) or household [ADDRESS_1048222] time on the surface depends on the method used to clean the equipment. 794 
Cavicide requires three minutes on the surface of the equipment. Clorox Germicidal Bleach Wipes 795 
require two minutes on the equipment. The surface should remain wet (i.e. slightly damp) with the [ADDRESS_1048223] current recommendations.  799 
There is the risk of blood sampling collection and contamination from sampling techniques. Hand 800 
washing with either soap & water or waterless hand sanitizer wil l be used prior to caring for the [ADDRESS_1048224]’s protection (i.e. hand washing, 803 
changing gloves frequently, disposing needles properly). Gloves will be removed, and hands [ADDRESS_1048225]’s room. Soiled linen will be 805 
changed to minimize the transfer of pathogenic organisms. 806 
10.1.8 Risk of Exercise  807 
There is a risk of  musculoskelet al symptoms or injury from participating in an exercise regimen. 808 
There are cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risks (including but not limited to dizziness, 809 
lightheaded, syncope, arrhythmia or ischemia) associated with participating in an exercise 810 
regimen. The intention of the eligibility criteria will be to minimize these risks.  811 
10.1.9 Hb1Ac Risk  812 
An NGSP Point of Care analyzer (i.e. DCA Vantage Analyzer) will be utilized at the research site [ADDRESS_1048226]’s HbA1c level. [ADDRESS_1048227]-2022  Page 40 of 56 
 10.1.10 Other Risks  815 
Some participants may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives used to secure 816 
the CGM, or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.  817 
If these reactions occur, different adhesives or “under -tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, 818 
etc.) will be tried, sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_91101] 819 
medication may be required. 820 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM and pump infusion 821 
sites are insert ed under the skin.  It is possible that any part that is inserted under the skin may 822 
cause an infection.  These occur very infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur, oral and/or 823 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_27996].  The risk of skin problems could be greater if you use a sensor for 824 
longer than it is supposed to be used.  Therefore, participants will be carefully instructed about 825 
proper use of the sensor. 826 
Data downloaded from the CGM, pump, glucometer, and ketone meter will be collected for the 827 
study as me asures of diabetes self -management behaviours. Some people may  be uncomfortable 828 
with the researchers' having such detailed information about their daily diabetes habits. 829 
10.1.11 Known Potential Benefits  830 
It is expected that this protocol will yield increased knowledge about using an automated closed- 831 
loop system with anticipatory action to control glucose levels. The individual participant may not 832 
benefit from study participation. 833 
10.1.12 Risk Assessment  834 
Based on the facts that (1) adults with diabetes experi ence mild hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 835 
frequently as a consequence of the disease and its management, (2) the study intervention involves 836 
periodic automated insulin dosing that may increase the likelihood of hypoglycemia, and periodic 837

specifications include all claims made in the labelling  for the device.  The intended performance 903 
of a device refers to the intended use for which the device is labelled  or marketed. (21 CFR 803.3).   [ADDRESS_1048243] medical occurrence that meets 906 
one of the following criteria: 907 
• A serious adverse event  as defined in section 11.2  908 
• An Adverse Device Effect as defined in section 11.1.4, unless excluded from reporting in 909 
section 11.7 910 
• An Adverse Event as defined in section 11.1.1 occurring in association with a study 911 
procedure 912 
• An AE as defined in section 11.1.1 which leads to discontinuation of a study device for 2 913 
or more hours 914 
• Hypoglycemia meeting the definition of severe hypoglycemia as defined in section 11.2.1  915 
• Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as defined in section 11.2.[ADDRESS_1048244] . Skin reactions from sensor placement are 919 
only reportable if severe and/or required treatment. [ADDRESS_1048245] is only reportable as an adve rse event 922 
when the following definition for severe hypoglycemia is met:   923 
• The event required assistance of another person due to altered consciousness, and required 924 
another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative action s 925 
• Impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat himself/herself, was unable 926 
to verbalize his/ her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or combative, or experienced 927

evidence that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration 932 
11.2.2 Hyperglycemia Events/Diabetes Ketoacidosis  [ADDRESS_1048246] is only reportable as an adverse 934 
event when one of the following four criteria is met:  935 
• The event involved DKA, as defined by [CONTACT_3467] 936 
(DCCT) and described below  evaluation or treatment was obtained at a health care provider [ADDRESS_1048247]-2022  Page 44 of 56 
 • Blood ketone level ≥1.5 mmol/L and communication oc curred with a health care provider 939 
at the time of the event  940 
• Blood ketone level ≥3.0 mmol/L, even if there was no communication with a health care 941 
provider 942 
Hyperglycemic events are classified as DKA if the following are present:  943 
• Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting  944 
• Serum ketones ≥1.5 mmol/L or large/moderate urine ketones  945 
• Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15 946 
• Treatment provided in a health care facility  947 
All reportable Adverse Events—whether volunteered by [CONTACT_2299], discovered by [CONTACT_3449] [ADDRESS_1048248], or other 949 
means —will be reported on an adverse event form online.  Each adverse event form is reviewe d [ADDRESS_1048249] been caused by 954 
the study device. 955 
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators should apply the 956 
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  957 
• There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and the 958 
study intervention, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_2299]’s 959 
clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; an d/or the adverse event 960 
follows a known pattern of response to the study intervention; and/or the adverse event 961 
abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study intervention or dose reduction and, if 962 
applicable, reappears upon rechallenge.  963 
• Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study intervention 964 
(e.g., pre-existing  medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 965 
concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship [ADDRESS_1048250] 976 
within 14 days after discharge from the hotel.  977 
 
 978 
The intensity of an adverse event will be rated on a three -point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 979 
severe. It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse event 980 
is not necessarily serious . For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may 981 
not be clinically serious. 982 
• MILD: Usually transient, requires no specia l treatment, and does not interfere with the 983 
participant’s daily activities.  984 
• MODERATE: Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant 985 
and may interfere with daily activities but is usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_91118] 986 
measures.  987 
• SEVERE: Interrupts a participant’s usual daily activities and generally requires systemic 988 
drug therapy or other treatment. 989 
 
 990 
Adverse events will be coded per the UVA IRB website instructions (i.e. mild, moderate, severe).   991 
The Medical Monitor  will review the investigator’s assessment of causality and may agree or 992 
disagree.  Both the investigators  and Medical Monitor ’s assessments will be recorded.  The [ADDRESS_1048251] the final say in determining the causality. 994 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of the study will 995 
be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the condition 996 
is expected.  997 
 
 998 
The outcome of each reportable adverse event will be classified by [CONTACT_3470]: 999 
• RECOVERED/RESOLVED – The participant recovered from the AE/SAE without [ADDRESS_1048252] the AE/SAE stop date. 1001 
• RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE – The event persisted and had stabilized [ADDRESS_1048253] the AE/SAE stop date. 1003 
• FATAL – A fatal outcome is defined as the SAE that resulted in death. Only the event that 1004 
was the cause of death should be reported as fatal.  AEs/SAEs that were ongoing at the 1005 
time of de ath; however, were not the cause of death, will be recorded as “resolved” at the 1006 
time of death.  1007 
• NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED (ONGOING) – An ongoing AE/SAE is defined 1008 
as the event was ongoing with an undetermined outcome. 1009 
• An ongoing outcome will require follow- up by [CONTACT_3471] 1010 
outcome of the AE/SAE. [ADDRESS_1048254]-2022  Page 46 of 56 
 • The outcome of an ongoing event at the time of death that was not the cause of death, will 1012 
be updated and recorded as “resolved” with the date of death recorded as the stop date.  1013 
• UNKNO WN – An unknown outcome is defined as an inability to access the participant or 1014 
the participant’s records to determine the outcome (for example, a participant that was lost 1015 
to follow-up). 1016 
All clinically significant abnormalities of clinical laboratory measurements or adverse events 1017 
occurring during the study and continuing at study termination should be followed by [CONTACT_941] 1018 
participant’s physician and evaluated with additional tests (if necessary) until diagnosis of the [ADDRESS_1048255] 1024 
the participant until the adverse event has resolved or stabilized.  1025 
 
 1026 
All UADEs, ADEs, device complaints, and device malfunctions will be reported irrespective of 1027 
whether an adverse event occurred, except in the following circumstances.  1028 
The following device issues are anticipated and will not be reported but will reported as an Adverse 1029 
Event if the criteria for AE reporting described above are met:  1030 
• Component disconnections 1031 
• CGM sensors lasting fewer than the number of days expected per CGM labelling  1032 
• CGM tape adherence issues  1033 
• Pump infusion set occlusion not leading to ketosis 1034 
• Battery lifespan deficiency due to inadequate charging or extensive wireless 1035 
communication  1036 
• Intermittent device component disconnections/communication failures not leading to 1037 
system replacement  1038 
• Device issues clearly ad dressed in the user guide manual that do not require additional 1039 
troubleshooting 1040 
• Skin reactions from CGM sensor placement or pump infusion set placement that do not 1041 
meet criteria for AE reporting  1042 
 
 1043 
• UADEs must be reported within [ADDRESS_1048256].  1045 
• Other reportable adverse events, device malfunctions (with or without an adverse event) [ADDRESS_1048257]-2022  Page 47 of 56 
 • The IDE Sponsor will investigate the UADE and if indicated, report the results of the 1049 
investigation to the IRBs, FDA, and DSMB  within 10 working days of the study team  1050 
becoming aware of the UADE per 21CFR 812.46(b) (2).  1051 
• The Medical Monit or will determine if the UADE presents an unreasonable risk to [ADDRESS_1048258] receipt notice of the UADE.  1056 
• In the case of a device system component malfunction (e.g. pump, CGM, control 1057 
algorithm), information will be forwarded to the responsible manufacturer by [CONTACT_1758] 1058 
personnel. 1059 
 
 1060 
11.10.1 Participant Discontinuation  1061 
Rules for discontinuing study de vice use are described below.  1062 
• The investigator believes it is unsafe for the participant to continue the intervention.  This 1063 
could be due to the development of a new medical condition or worsening of an existing 1064 
condition; or participant behaviour contrary  to the indications for use of the device that 1065 
imposes on the participant’s safety 1066 
• The participant requests that the treatment be stopped  1067 
• The participant tests positive for COVID -19 (during study testing or otherwise within 14 1068 
days of study start) or subsequently develops symptoms for COVID-19 and tests positive. 1069 
• Diagnosis of DKA.  Any severe hypoglycemia event meeting the definition  in section 1070 
11.2.1 of the protocol. 1071 
11.10.2 Suspending/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3396]  1072 
In the case of an unanticipated system malfunction resulting in a severe hypoglycemia or severe 1073 
hyperglycemia event (as defined in section 11.2.2), use of the study device system will be [ADDRESS_1048259] severe hypoglycemia events as 1076 
defined in section 11.2  occur , the overall study would be suspended while the underlying 1077 
conditions are determined.   1078 
In addition, study activities could be similarly suspended if the manufacturer of any constituent 1079 
study device requires stoppage of device use for safety reasons (e.g. product recall).  The affected [ADDRESS_1048260]-2022  Page 48 of 56 
 
 
 1087 
A Medical Monitor  will review all DKA and severe hypoglycemia irrespective of relatedness to 1088 
study device use, and all serious events (including UADEs) related to study device use at the time [ADDRESS_1048261] (43 USC [ZIP_CODE]) as an unauthorized acquisition, 1095 
access, or use of protected health information (PHI) that compromises the security or privacy of [ADDRESS_1048262] their personal 1100 
physician to change their prescribed personal insulin to lispro or aspart  for the duration of the trial.  1101 
The study devices (study insulin pump, study CGM) must be removed before Magnetic Resonance 1102 
Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT) or diather my treatment. Participants may continue [ADDRESS_1048263]-2022  Page 50 of 56 
 Chapter 13  Statistical Consideration 1113 
 
 1114 
The main  study is itself a n early exploratory study to assess glycemic responses of a fully closed- 1115 
loop system (Rocket AP).  This information is detailed in Table 1.  [ADDRESS_1048264] the following statistical hypotheses  1120 
 1121 
a. Null Hypothesis:  There is no difference in the means of time spent in the 70 -180mg/dL range during 1122 
daytime between FCL with and without prandial priming bolu s (BPS at 6% and 0% of TDI respectively)  1123 
 1124 
b. Alternative Hypothesis:  There is a difference in the means of time spent in the 70 -180mg/dL range during 1125 
daytime between FCL with and without prandial priming bolus (BPS at 6% and 0% of TDI respectively)  [ADDRESS_1048265] and baseline HbA1c and gender as covariates.  1129 
 1130 
Secondary outcomes:  1131 
All secondary outcomes will be similarly analyzed. If an outcomes distribution is not suited for mixed 1132 
model analysis (e.g. profound skewness, or large atom at boundary) we will perform paired Wilcoxon [ADDRESS_1048266] (and loose the capacity to use covariate) to test difference in the median instead of the 1134 
mean; this is expected for time below 70mg/dL, number of hypoglycemia, and possibly time above 1135 
250mg/dL.  [ADDRESS_1048267]-2022  Page 51 of 56 
 
 
 1144 
As a early exploratory Study, the goal will be to complete up to 20 participants  in the main study 1145 
to provide data from a variety of individuals.  This number was chosen out of feasibility and not 1146 
from a formal power calculation.  (The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_764874] 1147 
will be completed in a minimum of 2 -3 individuals prior to the beginning of the Main Study.)  With 1148 
N=20 and our randomized crossover design (allowing for paired comparison), we can hope to detect a [ADDRESS_1048268] size of 0.66 at a power of 80%. Based of prior FCL study, the standard deviation of daytime 1150 
TIR is approximately 12%, leading to a detec table difference in daytime TIR of 8%.  [ADDRESS_1048269] being bet ween the RocketAP 1155 
with and without BPS. Our primary endpoint is CGM time -in-range 70 -180 mg/dL for the daytime 1156 
period 6 a m – 12 am when on each treatment modality (BPS vs. no BPS) .  1157 
13.3.2 Secondary Outcomes 1158 
Each admission is separated in to windows of analysis: 1159 
• The entirety of the admission (24h: 4pm to 4pm) 1160 
• The 4 hours following each of the meals. 1161 
• The overnight period (12 am to 6 am) 1162 
For each of these periods we will compute the following outcomes: 1163 
• Number of hypoglycemia events defined as at least two consecutive CGM values 1164 
<70mg/dL or a hypoglycemia treatment (two events separated by [CONTACT_21316] 30 minutes are 1165 
counted as one). 1166 
• Percent CGM time < 70 mg/dL  1167 
• Percent CGM time between 80 -140mg/dL 1168 
• Percent CGM time between 70 -180mg/dL 1169 
• Percent CGM time  >180 mg/dL  1170 
• Percent CGM time > 250 mg/dL  1171 
• Units of insulin injected  1172 
• Area under the curve when accounting for starting BG  1173 
• Low Blood Glucose Index 1174 
• High Blood Glucose Index 1175 
• CGM coefficient of variation  1176 
• Mean CGM  [ADDRESS_1048270]-2022  Page 52 of 56 
 13.3.3  CGM  data treatment  1179 
• Saturated CGM values “High” and “Low” will be replaced by 401mg/dL and 39mg/dL 1180 
respectively.  1181 
• Any CGM gaps shorter than 1 hour will be interpolated  1182 
• CGM data during recorded occlusion event will be removed from analysis as follow: [ADDRESS_1048271] will be removed. 1184 
• CGM data following a pump/DiAs communication interruption >1h by [CONTACT_21316] 2h [ADDRESS_1048272] 80% of the analysis window CGM m easurements (after data 1188 
treatment) are available  1189 
 
 1190 
We will assess for the system’s functionality, including the ability of the system to run its code 1191 
without error (delivering insulin safely, as planned), as well as its ability to avoid low BG <70 1192 
mg/dL. 1193 
 
 1194 
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of all randomized participants will 1195 
be summarized in a table using summary statistics appropriate to the distribution of each variable. 1196 
Descriptive statistics will be displayed overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  1197 
Will include: 1198 
• Age 1199 
• HbA1c  1200 
• Gender  1201 
• Race/ethnicity  1202 
• CGM use before enrollment 1203 
• AID use before enrollment 1204 
• Diabetes duration  1205 
• BMI  1206 
• Total Daily Insulin  1207 
 
 1208 
The following tabulations and analyses will be performed during time on the UVa AP systems to 1209 
assess device issues:  1210 
• Device malfunctions requiring study team contact [CONTACT_91120] 1211 
• % time CGM data available  1212 
• % time with closed loop control  [ADDRESS_1048273]-2022  Page 53 of 56 
 Chapter 14   Data Collection and Monitoring 1214 
 
 1215 
The study data are collected through a combination of case report forms (electronic and paper) and [ADDRESS_1048274].  These documents should be retained for a longer 1226 
period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427] . No records will be destroyed without the written 1227 
consent of the sponsor, if applicable . It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator 1228 
when these documents no longer need to be retained. 1229 
 
 1230 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practices 1231 
(GCP), or procedure requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, [ADDRESS_1048275]-2022  Page 54 of 56

 1237 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 1238 
the Protection of Human Participants of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 1239 
CFR Part 5 6, and/or the ICH E6. 1240 
 
 1241 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will [ADDRESS_1048276] be  obtained before any participant is enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will 1244 
require review and approval by [CONTACT_3484].  All 1245 
changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether 1246 
previously consented participants need to be re- consented.  1247 
 
 1248 
15.3.1 Consent Procedures and Documentation  1249 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual’s agreement to participate in 1250 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Extensive discussion of [ADDRESS_1048277] the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 1257 
prior to signing. 1258 
The consenting process will involve discussing the study at length in a phone call/HIPAA 1259 
compliant telecommunication method for consenting that is not face to face. The participant will 1260 
sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. 1261 
The consent form may be signed electronically with the use of the Part 11  compliant version of 1262 
DocuSign for both in- person and telecommunication  screening visits . The study team will follow 1263 
the FDA part 11 compliant process of  verification of reviewing two forms of identification  if 1264 
signing electronically off site. A HIPAA compliant video conferencing tool will be utilized during 1265 
the consenting process  of the telecommunication screening visit  to facilitate review of the 1266 
participant’s identification .  A copy of the informed consent  document will be given to the [ADDRESS_1048278] all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not 1273

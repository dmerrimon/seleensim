 DETAILED CONSENT:  
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THIS STUDY?  
You should not participate if: you are less than [ADDRESS_123695]?  
The research procedures will be conducted at the CANE Community Kitchen.  You will need to come 2 times 
during the study.  Each of those visits will take about 30 minutes . The total amount of time you will be asked to 
volunteer for this study  is 1.5 hours, plus however long you decide to stay at the Farmer’s Market over the next  5 
months . 
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO?  
All participants will fill out a survey and have their weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, and carotenoid status taken two  times – once in May 2020, the second time in September 2020. 
In June through September, all participants will be asked to sign in near the swimming pool to receive their 
voucher. All participants will turn in their voucher to the market manager, who will rip off the small end in return for $10 worth of tokens to spend on fruits and vegetables at the farmer’s market. The part of the voucher returned to you will ask you to do two things. First, you will be asked to write down what fruits and vegetables you ate over 
the last week . Second, you will be asked how you used the fruits and vegetables you purchased the previous 
week. This voucher must be turned in to the market manager as you leave the market in order for you to receive 
your voucher the f ollowing week.  
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
To the best of our knowledge, the things you will be doing have no more risk of harm than you would experience 
in everyday life.  There are no risks associated with the use of a carotenoid scanner. Additionally, there is always 
the risk for unforeseeable risks.  
WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
We do not know if you will get any benefit from taking part in this study. However, some people have experienced 
improved self -perceived health, a decrease in blood pressure, and waist circumference when they eat more fruits 
and vegetables and increase their physical activity.  
 However, if you take part in this study, information learned 
may help others with your condition.  
WHAT WILL IT COST Y OU TO PARTICIPATE?  
There are no costs associated with taking part in the study.  
WHO WILL SEE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU GIVE?  
When we write about or share the results from the study, we will write about the combined information. We will keep your name [CONTACT_111040]. We will make every effort to prevent anyone who is not 
on the research team from knowing that you gave us information, or what that information is. The combined information will only reveal summarized data without identifiable information. The de- identified data will be 
available electronically and stored on a password protected computer. The electronic document containing names with respective survey codes will be deleted after post -survey data has been collected and th erefore will not be 
stored. The list  will be deleted by [CONTACT_36466] [ADDRESS_123696] access to [ZIP_CODE]

                                             Revised 10/17/16 1  
1. Background:   The Tanglewood Trail walking group is a community- initiated  walking group, spontaneously 
established in summer 2016.  Community members meet at the Housing Authority in Whitesburg, KY and 
walk the  approximately  1 kilometer Tanglewood Trail co nnecting the Housing Authority to the Farmer’s 
Market. Participation in the walkin g group is open to the public. Participants that walk to the Farmer’s M arket 
on Wednesday evenings receive a $5 voucher to the Farmer’s Market and a $10 voucher on Satu rdays during 
the season  (June-October). Adults 18 years and older receive one voucher each time they walk.  Currently, 
there is no evaluation of the walking group program beyond the community tracking the name, number of walkers, and the number of vouchers distributed to walkers on each Wednesday and Sat urday. This program 
was initiated by [CONTACT_111034].      
The current proposed study will target non-pregnant healthy, 18+ years old, community members who are 
willing and able to walk  the Tanglewood Trail on Saturday mornings, June -August  2017. Community 
members will be randomized into a walking group and a farmers market group.  Both groups will receive 
farmers mark et vouchers of equivalent value.  One group will meet at the Housing Authority and walk to the 
farmers market to obtain their vouchers and the other group will obtain their farmers market voucher at the farmers market.   Both groups are welcome to walk the Tanglewood Trail if they would like, however those 
that are randomized into the walking group are expected to walk.  However, people are not forced to walk and have the option to refuse to walk.  We hypothesize that adults who regularly attend the walking group and subsequently  purchase fruits and vegetables at t he Farmer’s Market will experience an increase in physical 
activity, fruit and vegetable intake, and community engagement, and a decrease in anthropometrics and 
biomarkers associated with adulthood chronic disease (including cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure,  
carotenoid status,  weight, and waist circumference) beyond that of the farmers market voucher group only. 
   
2. Objectives:    
a) To educate Tanglewood Trail  program participants about the health benefits of consuming a variety 
of fruits and vegetables, being physically active, and dietary strategies that can help protect their 
health from environmental pollution. 
b) Assess self -reported behavior change, knowledge change, and change in physical measurements (see 
below), and level of physical activity. 
 
3. Study Design:  The sample population consists of a convenience sample that is participating in a prospective 
study. This study will focus on nonpregnant healthy adult (ages 18+) community members who walk the 
Tanglewood Trail on Saturdays, June-August 2017.  
Any interested community members who are 18 years or older, nonpregnant and able to voluntarily give their 
consent are welcome to join the study. One hundred participants will be randomized into one of two groups – a 
walking group and a farmer’s market group.  
The fifty participants randomized into the walking group will meet at the Housing Authority at a designated 
time each Saturday. When they arrive, they will be signed in by a community leade r and receive a farmer’s 
market voucher (see attached) for $10 along with education material (5 of the 13 Saturdays). They will walk 
as a group to the farmer’s market and hand their voucher to the market manager, who will give them $[ADDRESS_123698] two sides: one side will ask 
participants what fruits and vegetables they ate the past week; the second side will ask participants to check off what fruits and vegetables they purchase at the mar ket that day. They will turn this in as they leave the market.  
The fifty participants randomized into the farmer’s market group will meet at- the farmer’s market and sign in with a [LOCATION_006] employee. They will receive the same voucher and education materials and  follow the same 
procedure as the walking group. Participants randomized into this group will be allowed to walk if they want; no one will be dissuaded from engaging in physical activity. However, in order to receive their voucher, it is not required for t hem to walk.  
Three  times per month participants will be presented with education material concerning phytonutrients, the 
importance of fruit  and vegetable intake, and how these factors might protect them from environmental 
pollutants. The education materials will be in the form of a.) a handout based on the Transtheoretical Model

                                             Revised 10/17/16 2 (see attached example) or b.) Plate it Up Kentucky Proud recipe samples and cards ( see attached example ). 
A Registered Dietitian will be available to answer nutrition -based health questions once per month.  
 
No participants will receive medications – neither real nor placebo.  
 
Data will be a time series collection of finger -stick total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, trigly cerides, hemoglobin 
A1c (cardiocheck meter) , height, weight, waist c ircumference, carotenoid status (carotenoid RS, which is a 
non-invasive instrument that is a reliable indicator of fruit and vegetable intake  (see attached ), and a survey  
(see attached ). Measur ements will be taken twice – baseline data will be collected in  May 2017, with follow-
up data collected in early September 2017.  
 Finger stick tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_111035] (see attached IBC approval and certificates of completion) . Lys ol wipes will be available to 
wipe down equipment as needed. Hand sanitizer will be provided to each researcher to use between glove changes. Gloves will be changed between each participant. Heat packets will be available for participants with cold hands t o make the finger stick go faster and easier. Lancets will be used to take the finger stick and all 
materials will be disposed of in sharps containers. All sharps containers will remain sealed until the research team returns to the University of Kentucky t hat same day to dispose of the sharps containers.  
 
4. Study Population:  Based on walking group numbers from summer 2016 we antici pate a maximum 
enrollment of 100 participants (18+ years old , nonpregnant ). Previous research in Letcher County suggests the 
majo rity of participants will be white, ages 18 -65, both male and female, of moderate health status. A 
prerequisite for participating in this study is the ability to walk approximately 1 kilometer to the Farmer’s 
Market,  nonpregnant,  pre-supposing a baseline health status. Any interested community members over the 
age of 18 and in moderate or good health will be included. Since our focus is on changes in rates of chronic 
disease in adulthood, children will be excluded from study participation (but may walk the trail with their 
parents). Institutionalized adults, pregnant adults adults with impaired consent capacity, and prisoners will be 
excluded. No one will be excluded based on sex/gender or racial/ethnic identity.   
5. Subject Recruitment Methods and Privacy :  A commu nity leader will build a  facebook group in April [ADDRESS_123699] the above measurements (see section 3) taken in 
return for a farmer’s market t -shirt.  Participants will be randomized into one of the two groups, walking group 
or farmers market only group, and informed of their group in May, during baseline measurements.  
Privacy will be maintained through de- identification of all su rvey and measurement data. The surveys and 
measurement data sheets will contain a cover sheet that has a place to record the participant’s name. The next 
page will be where the first question is listed and a space for the survey code to be recorded. Once t he survey 
has been coded the cover sheet will be removed from the post- surveys and shredded.  Participants will be 
asked to indicate which fruits and vegetables they purchased at the market on shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_111017] ( see attached ).  
The card will have a place for their name [CONTACT_111044].  The community leader will collect these weekly and give them to [LOCATION_006] researcher bi -weekly.  The 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_111018]’ measurement data on an electronic datasheet.  Once all of the dat a has been collected in September the electronic list of names will be replaced with a code to de-
identify participants, the cover sheets of the surveys that contain participant names will be shredded and the 
survey s and shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_111019] a locked drawer in the PI’s locked office.  The 
electronic data that is generated will be stored on a password protected computer.  Throughout the study, any 
study materials that contain participant names will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in the PI’s locked 
office.  In the event this data is published it will be done so by [CONTACT_111036].

                                             Revised 10/17/16 3 6. Informed Consent Process:  All study personnel that will obtain consent are l isted in Form A. Participants 
will be told they can decide to stop their participation at any time.  The consent form will be read to any study 
participants with visual issues. [LOCATION_006] study personnel will speak to study participants at an appropriate volume 
to be heard by [CONTACT_19288]. Study personnel will ask if they are speaking loud enough, they will tell 
study participants to let them know when they need to speak up or slow down or repeat a question, and study 
personnel will be in tune to signs of stu dy participants straining to hear.  
 Consent will be obtained before physical measurements or survey data is collected. To obtain consent the [LOCATION_006] 
study personnel will ask potential participants if they would like to participate in a research study that 
involves asking them questions about their health and diet and will also involve education material on 
phytonutrients, the importance of fruits and vegetables , and how these factors might protect them from 
environmental pollution. They will be told their parti cipation is completely voluntary, and that they will be 
randomized into one of two groups. They will be informed that even if they are randomized into the farmer’s 
market group, they are still allowed to walk whenever and however often they like .  Those randomized to the 
walking group will be told that they are expected to walk each Saturday morning, but they will never be 
forced to walk and will be encouraged to abstain from walking on Saturdays when they do not feel well.  
They will also be told their survey answers will not be reported individually or with their name, but as 
anonymous aggregated data. Additionally, they will be told their participation is voluntary and they can 
withdraw from the study at any time and they do not have to answer any questions that they are not 
comfortable answering. If the participant agrees the consent form will be given to them and their signature [CONTACT_43633]. The participant will be given a copy of an investigator-signed consent form.  
 The [LOCATION_006] study personnel will ask if the participant would like to move elsewhere to complete the survey  and 
anthropometric/biological data collection . Study personnel will also explain that the consent forms and 
surveys will be stored separately in a locked drawer in the PI’s locked office and that an electronic file will be created that lists their name [CONTACT_111045]. This list will be destroyed following the collection and entry of 
post-survey data. Any electronic files generated from this study will be stored on a password protected 
compute r. 
 Obtaining consent and completing the survey will take approximately [ADDRESS_123700] data will be collected in the same manner as the pre data. The [LOCATION_006] study personnel will 
offer the same explanation of the survey  and anthropometric/biological measurements and the same 
procedures will be followed, consent however will not be obtained again. The midline and post-surveys will 
contain a cove r sheet that has a place to record the participant’s name. The next page will be where the first 
question is listed and a space for the survey code to be recorded. Once the survey has been coded the cover sheet will be removed from the midline and post -surveys and shredded  once all data has been entered 
electronically . 
 
7. Research Procedures: Following IRB approval, beginning in May 2017 community members will show up to a designated location approximately 1 kilometer from the F armer’s M arket. Participants wi ll fill out a survey 
and have anthropometric and biological measurements taken . Carotenoid status will be measured via 
carotenoid RS scanner.   Anthropometric data will be collected by [CONTACT_111037] (digital 
scale), height (portable stad iometer), waist circumference (tape) and blood pressure (digital blood pressure 
machine) Finger stick tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_111038]. Lysol wipes will be available to wipe down equipment as needed. Hand sanitizer will be provided to each researcher to use between glove changes. Gloves will be changed between each 
participant. Heat packets will be available for participants with cold hands to make the finger stick go faster 
and easier. Lancets will be used to take the finger stick and all materials will be disposed of in sharps 
containers. All sharps containers will remain sealed until the research team returns to the University of 
Kentucky that same day to dispose of the sharps containers.

be signed in by a community member, and walk approximately 1 kilomet er to the F armer’ s Market, in 
exchange for $10 they can spend at the market.  Participants in the farmer’s market group will show up to the 
farmer’s market, be signed in by a [LOCATION_006] employee, and follow the same voucher protocol as the walking group. 
Three Saturdays of each month , participants  from both groups will receive education material in the form of 
a.) handouts base d on the Transtheoretical Model or b.) Plate it Up Kentucky Proud recipes samples and 
cards. A Registered Dietitian Nutritionist will be available at least one weekend of each month to answer 
nutrition- related questions.  
 Post-data will be collected in September  2017; the same survey will be administered and participants will 
again have their anthropometric and biological measurements taken.  
 No clinical care will be given as a part of this research study.

9. Potential Risks:    
No physical, psychological, social, legal, cultu ral, or financial risks can be perceived from participating in this 
research. In the rare case that a dangerously high blood pressure or hemoglobin A1c  is recorded, the 
participant will be referred immediately to the local emergency department for care. Al l foods prepared for 
the farmer’s market will be accompanied by a recipe card with ingredients. Potential allergens will be 
identified and communicated to all participants. Participants will not be forced to taste any food. 
Undergraduate research assistants will be GAP trained  and knowledgeable about food safety issues. No 
participants will be discouraged from walking to the farmer’s market, regardless of which group they are randomized into. The only difference between the two groups is where they sign in; the walking group signs in 1 kilometer from the market, while the farmer’s market group signs in at the market.

participant names and codes once the post-survey data has been coded, using a password protected computer, and storing any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_111027]- related material in a locked drawer that is in a locked office.  
 
10. Safety Precautions:  Participation in every aspect of the intervention is voluntary. Participants do not 
have to respond to any survey questions that they are uncomfortable answering or participat e in any 
anthropometric or biological measurements they are uncomfortable with.  No one will be discouraged 
from engaging in physical activity.  
 When identifiable data (names) is being collected it will be on the cover sheet or consent form of a survey and will be detached from survey data that will include a code that is linked to the participant. At the end of the 
study, t he cover sheets will be deleted and consent forms will be stored separately from the surveys in a 
locked drawer in the PI’s locked office. The electronic list containing the names and survey codes will be 
deleted once all post -survey data is entered, which will be entered within a month following collection. 
However, the assigning of codes, and generating the electronic document that lists codes and names from 
surveys will occur the day of data collection at [LOCATION_006].  
 The study population consists of adults ages 18 years or older who are in good enough health to walk 1 
kilometer to the farmer’s market.  
 Finger stick tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_111035]. Lysol wipes will be available to wipe down equipment as needed. Hand sanitizer will be provided to each researcher to use between glove changes. Gloves will be changed betw een each participant. 
Heat packets will be available for participants with cold hands to make the finger stick go faster and easier. Lancets will be used to take the finger stick and all materials will be disposed of in sharps containers. All 
sharps containers will remain sealed until the research team returns to the University of Kentucky that same 
day to dispose of the sharps containers.  
 
11. Benefit vs. Risk:   Potential benefits include (but are not limited to) a decreased risk for high blood pressure, 
high blood glucose, and cardiovascular disease; a decrease in oxidative stress; a decrease in generalized 
inflammation; an increase in community engagement; an increase in physical activity, and an increase in overall fruit and vegetable consumption.  
 
There i s no more than minimal risk to participants in this intervention with the benefits outweighing any risk.  
There is however, a potential risk of a breach in confidentiality, which is minimal due to the study being voluntary, removing the signed consent form/cover sheet from the coded pre/post surveys, deleting the document containing participant names and codes once the post-survey data has been coded, shredding the 
cover sheets attached to post-surveys with participants names, using a password protected com puter, and 
storing any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_111027]- related material in a locked drawer that is in a locked office.

                                             Revised 10/17/16 6 13. Research Materials, Records, and Privacy:  Participants will be asked to fill out two  surveys (May and  
September 2017).  The surveys contain questions about demographics, self- reported health, physical 
activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and community engagement.  
 
      Participants will be asked to complete weekly shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_111028] p urchased at the farmer’s market and what fruits and vegetables they ate over the past week.  
 
 
Participants will be asked for finger -stick total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (cardio 
check meter), height, weight, waist circumference, and carotenoid status (carotenoid RS , which is a non-
invasive instrument that is a reliable indicator of fruit and vegetable intake)  twice (May and September 2017).  
 The collected data will be collated and summarized without identification or attribution to the individual 
participants. All reports will only reveal aggregated summaries across participants. The surveys with attached 
consent forms will be collected and stored separately in a locked drawer in the PI’s locked office. An electronic document containing participant name [CONTACT_111046] a password 
protected computer. Following the collection of post-survey data and coding of the post- survey data the 
electronic document containing the names and codes will be deleted. To minimize risk of identification the consent forms will be removed from the survey and the survey will have a code written on it. The consent 
forms , shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_111029], but both w ill be in a locked drawer.  
 
The information collected will be used to assess whether walking 1 kilometer to the farmer’s market and 
spending approximately $10 at the market improves physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, community 
engagement, and c hronic disease- related biomarkers (i.e. cholesterol, A1c, etc).  
 
14. Confidentiality:  The collated data will only reveal summarized data without identifiable information. The de-identified data will be available electronically and stored on a password protected computer. The electronic 
document containing names with respective survey codes will be deleted after post -survey data has been 
collected and therefore will not be stored. The list will be deleted by [CONTACT_36466] [ADDRESS_123703] access to these items.  
 
15. Payment :  Participants will be offered a farmer’s market t- shirt at the baseline data collection time (May 
2017) and a $[ADDRESS_123704]-data collection (September 2017) as well as the weekly $10 voucher to the 
farmer’s market.

Tanglewood Trail Walking Program in Rural Kentucky [ADDRESS_123705] will be used for the difference in survey questions (environmental pollution 
knowledge, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity) between before and after the 
Tanglewood trail walking program.  
When the sample size is 50, a dependent t -test with a 5% two -sided significance level will have 
80% power to detect an effect size of 0.4 calculated from previous data.

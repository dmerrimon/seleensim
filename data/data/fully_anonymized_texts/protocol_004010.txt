Version  3; 8/27/[ADDRESS_1015586] data, or “mammometrics” (1). 
Mammometric data can be stati stically analyzed, longitudinally evaluated in the same patient over 
time, and correlated with other quantitative data including patient reported outcomes. Some of the 
useful mammometric measurements that can be used to quantify and compare pre - with 
posto perative breast surgery include total and split breast volumes, distances from the low breast 
crease to the nipple, and projection of the breast and nipple from the chest wall among others.  
 
Outcomes research in plastic and reconstructive surgery is more likely to focus on patient 
reported outcomes than survival. While the plastic surgery literature is replete with surveys 
focused on judging patient satisfaction, they are infrequently validated or comprehensive. The 
Breast Q has been established  as a valid ated instrument t o provide a quantitative measure of the 
unique features of patient reported outcomes following breast surgery. This instrument represents 
the most comprehensive and specific quantitative method for patient self -assessment following 
breast surgery. Recently, McCarthy and colleagues published, for the first time, patient 
satisfaction in [ADDRESS_1015587] a ugmentation in 
the “satisfaction with breasts” – 14 item scale, “psychological well -being” – 9 item scale, and 
“sexual well -being” – [ADDRESS_1015588] closely associated with improved 
satisfaction. Interestingly, the core scale “satisfaction with care” was not evaluated in this study. 
While this particular core scale may not have been relevant to a study looking at the overall 
benefits of br east augmentation, we suspect that it may be highly relevant to the aesthetic 
surgery patient where the consultation experience is more likely to impact overall patient 
satisfaction.  
 
This study will  evaluate the impact of incorporating 3D imaging during preoperative consultation 
on patient reported outcomes in primary breast augmentation surgery. 3D imaging can be used to 
facilitate patient education and surgical planning in the context of breast aug mentation. The 
purpose of this study is to utilize the most objective assessment available for assessing patient 
satisfaction with breast augmentation - the Breast Q - in a prospective randomized trial. We will 
evaluate whether 3D imaging used in consultat ion 1) can improve patient reported outcomes, and 
2) whether there are measurable mammometric parameters that are associated with improved 
patient satisfaction and 3) if utilizing 3D imaging in the pre -operative consultation significantly 
influences final mammometric parameters compared to patients receiving a traditional 
consultation that does not involve 3D breast surgical simulation.  
 
It is hoped that patients of surgeons that utilize this technology in the preoperative consultation 
will have significan tly higher Breast Q breast augmentation module scores 6 months after 
surgery. “Satisfaction with care” - one of six core scales within the Breast Q - will be particularly 
impacted by [CONTACT_2329] 3D image simulation in the consultation experience. Additionally, i t is thought 
that s uperomedial pole fullness  and central nipple position as quantified with mammometrics  that 
Version  3; 8/27/[ADDRESS_1015589] Q scores, especially the 
“satisfaction with breasts” items.  
 
This study will rep resent one of the first randomized control trials performed to address patient 
satisfaction with breast augmentation.

3.3 Inclusion  of Women  and Minorities 
 
Due to the nature of the surgical procedure, men are excluded from participation in this study.  
Members of all races and ethnic groups  are e ligible for this trial. 
 
3.4 Inclusion of Non -Randomized Cohort  
Patients who refuse the option of randomization but otherwise meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be offered participation in this study as part of a non -randomized 
cohort.  All aspects of the study as described in the protocol will be followed with exception 
of the randomization will be followed.

4.6 Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s 
health  and/or the patient no longer wishes to proceed with the protocol intervention, the patient 
should be removed from the study and the reason(s) for disco ntinuation documented in the case 
report forms.  
 
Otherwise, the patient will receive the intervention and be followed as described.  
 
 
5.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
 
5.1 Adverse Events 
 
Definition:  any unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject including any 
abnormal sign, symptom, or disease.  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the 
terms listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_411800] t of Health and 
Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this 
guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html  
 
5.2 Reporting to the Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at Washington 
University: 
 
All HRPO guidelines for reporting unanticipated problems will be followed.  
 
 
6.0 DATA AND SAFETY MO NITORING

research related adverse event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO according to institutional guidelines. 
 
6.1 Potential risks  
A possible breach of confidentiality of study data  is an unlikely risk . 
 
6.2 Minimization  of risks  
 
PHI will be collected and include the patient’s name, date of birth, date of surgery and 
date of follow -up. The patient’s name [CONTACT_742879] a password -
protected database in which access will be granted to only the research team. 
Version  3; 8/27/[ADDRESS_1015593] augmentation: 1) satisfaction wit h breasts 2) psychological well -being 3) sexual well being. 
A fourth, 4) satisfaction with care, however, may be particularly relevant to the discerning 
aesthetic surgery patient using 3D imaging in consultation. The other core items in this instrument 
are 5) physical well -being and 6) satisfaction with overall outcome which will also be recorded.  
 
Secondary endpoints  
All patients will u ndergo standard 2D as well as 3D imaging before and after surgery. During 
consultation, and in the postoperative period, reviewing 3D imaging and morphing software will be 
unique to the experimental group. 3D imaging from all patients will be used to obtai n 
mammometric data. Pre - , and post - op mammometric data (volumes, vectors, surface distances, 
anatomic landmarks), as well as the measurable change in these parameters before and after 
surgery will be correlated with changes in Breast Q patient reported o utcomes scores.  This will 
enable us to identify particular mammometric parameters that are a) associated with improved 
patient reported outcomes and b) determine whether certain mammometric parameters are 
significantly different in patients who had 3D ima ge simulation as part of their preoperative 
consultation relative to those that did not.  
 
 
7.2 Study Design  
 
To achieve comparable groups for known and unknown risk factors randomization will be 
performed as unistratified block randomization with random block sizes in a 1:1 allocation ratio.  
Allocation to treatment will be carried out by [CONTACT_3553] a computer -gene rated random study 
numbers with group assignment.   
 
 
Version  3; 8/27/14  page 9 of 12 Non -randomized cohort  
Patients who choose not to be randomized but otherwise meet the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be offered participation in this study as part of a non -randomized cohort. Their 
data will still be analyzed for the purpose of addressing the secondary objective.   
 
 
7.3 Sample Size  
 
Appropriate sample size is calculated based on assumption of difference of 20 percent in patient 
satisfaction as compared with the control group .  This difference is considered clinically relevant 
baed on previous similar studies .  A sample size of 100 patients (5 0 in each group) is considered 
sufficient to prove this difference, if present (alpha error set at 0.05, power>99 percent).   
 
Approxima tely [ADDRESS_1015594] -surgery complications will be summarize d using descriptive 
statistics and the confidence intervals will also be provided.  
  
Patients assigned to the intervention  group  (3D simulation)  will be compared with those who had 
conventional techniques  using х2 tests for categorical variables and Student’s t-tests for 
continuous variables. For the t -tests equal variances  were not be assumed, unless significant by 
[CONTACT_742878]’s test. Mann -Whitney U tests will be utilized for non -normally distributed variables.  T wo-
tailed P values 0.[ADDRESS_1015595] Q scores , mammometric parameters , and patient satisfaction will 
be performed using  binary logistic regression and linear regression models to examine the 
relationship between intervention groups and examined outcomes and to identify potential 
confounders. The results of  multivariate analyses will be  expressed as odds ratios with  
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. All analyses w ill be performed using SPSS 20.0 
statistical software (SPSS Inc.  Chicago, IL).

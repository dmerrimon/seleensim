4.1 Background  
The incidence of end -stage renal disease (ESRD) has been escalating and the creation of the hemodialysis 
(HD)  access ha s become a common vascular procedure in the form of either an autologous arteriovenous 
dialysis fistula (AVF) or prosthetic graft (AVG), see Figure 11. In the [LOCATION_002] and Japan, according to 
the [LOCATION_002] Renal Data System (USRDS), the incidence rates of ESRD in [ADDRESS_896458] patients/year, ~80% of which 
received H D treatment3. 
Figure 1: Hemodialysis Access by [CONTACT_663831] a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing 
HD which can eventually lead to loss of vascu lar access4,5. At 12 months, primary patency rates of 49% 
and 14% for forearm AVFs and AVGs, respectively, have been reported by [CONTACT_663832] -Rodrigues et al.[ADDRESS_896459] a high rate of failure mainly because of the development of a neointimal hyperplas ia 
respons e after endothelial and smooth muscle injury that results in the formation of stenotic lesions at 
the anastomotic site and/or along the venous outflow tract.[ADDRESS_896460] a 20 -25% mortality rate, with a 5 -year 
survival rate of 35%8. 
 
PTA is the current standard for the treatment of flow limiting stenotic lesions within the dialysis circuit, 
however, angioplasty itself results in vessel trauma that can fur ther drive  the intimal hyperplasia and the

Defined as the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) rate up to [ADDRESS_896474] exits the study, no medical information can be retrieved.  Time to  survival /death  will be evaluated 
according to the Kaplan -Meier m ethod  up to 60 months.  
6. Study Design   
This is a prospective, global, multicenter, single -blinded, randomized (1:1) clinical study evaluating the 
IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB (study arm) vs. standard PTA (control arm) for the treatment of de novo or non -
stented restenotic ob structive lesions up to 10 0 mm in length in the arteriovenous dialysis fistulae. All eligible 
subjects who provide informed consent and meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 based 
upon lesion type ( de novo , restenotic) to the control  or study arm. Total enrol lment will be 330 subjects at up 
to 30 global sites, with a minimum of 50% (165) of subjects coming from the U.S. sites, and a minimum of 
30% (99) of subjects coming from the Japan sites. There is no minimum enrollment requirement  at each s ite; 
however, in dividual sites may enroll no more than 20% of the total study subjects. Approximately [ADDRESS_896475]™ AV Access Study Clinical Investigation Plan

 Versi on 4.[ADDRESS_896476]™ AV Access DCB will be evaluated through a prospec tive, glob al, 
multicenter, single -blinded, randomized (1:1) clinical study in a total of 330 subjects with a hypothesis - based 
30-day primary safety endpoint and a 6 -month primary efficacy endpoint. The study has been designed with 
the assumption of a targ et lesion prim ary patency rate of 60% for the study arm and 40% for the control arm. 
The safety endpoint composite rate is assumed 5% for both study arms. The assumptions for endpoint rates 
were based upon publicly available information from currently mark eted devic es and the literature. See 
Section 14.[ADDRESS_896477] for treatment of flow limiting stenotic lesions within the dialysis circuit. PTA may 
cause vessel trauma leading to neointimal hype rplasia re sulting in poor midterm patency, and therefore, an 
increased rate of reinterventions. The addition of the antiproliferative drug, paclitaxel, has been proven in 
other vessel beds to be safe and effective in the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasi a and redu ction of 
vascular restenosis. 8 
 
6.3 Blinding  
The study subjects will remain blinded through completion of the 6 -month primary efficacy endpoint, 
including completion of all associated evaluations. Independent Core Laboratories and the Clinical Event s 
Committe e (CEC) will be blinded to the treatment assigned through the entire study duration.  
Study site staff (implanting physicians, catheterization lab staff, and other research staff) will not be blinded 
to treatment assignment due to the macroscopic visual dif ferences between the investigational device and 
the control device. As study investigators are not blinded to the subject’s treatment assignment, no 
procedures to break the blind in the case of an emergency are required.  
Medtronic representatives  whose res pons ibilities require knowledge of treatment assignment to perform 
their respective roles will not be blinded. Designated individuals within the IN.PACT™ AV Access study team, 
Data Solutions, Safety, Customer Service (responsible for device shipm ent and ac coun tability), and 
Regulatory will not be blinded. Clinical Customer Service, a small group of individuals who will be responsible 
for device shipment and reconciliation, will be unblinded, as will the team of monitors assigned to the study.  
Unb linded ind ividuals within Medtronic and at the study sites will receive guidance on preserving the blind as

Balloon Cathe ter (“IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB”), see Figure 2.  The IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB is an over -the-wire 
(OTW) ballo on catheter with a drug coated balloon at the distal tip. The drug component consists of 
paclitaxel and the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841],  urea. IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB catheter is dual -lumen shaft which is branched at 
the proximal end so that one tube forms the entrance to th e central lumen for the guide wire, while the 
other tube is used to inflate and deflate the dilation balloon  with a mi xture of contrast medium and saline 
solution.  
The catheter construction and the balloon material are designed so that a specific balloon diameter can be 
reached, depending on the balloon size and defined pressure.

Index Procedure Requirements  
The Investigator performing the study index procedure must be both approved by [CONTACT_663835]’s Principal Investigator (as documented on the  Delegation of Authority/Delegated Tasks List 
Form).  
The treating Investigator must use the s tudy device in accordance with the investigational IFU. The 
corresponding manufacturer’s IFU should be followed for all ancillary devices (e.g., guide wires, 
sheat h/guiding catheters, pre -dilatation balloons, etc.) used during the index procedure.  
The foll owing describes required assessments and procedures associated with the index procedure. All 
activities should be documented.  
Target Lesion : only one target lesion  per subject is eligible for study treatment. Tandem lesions may be 
treated provided they mee t all requirements for a single lesion (as defined in the Inclusion Criteria) and can 
be treated as a single lesion.  
Preparation / Medications  
Single antiplatelet therapy, at a minimum, (e.g.  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_336495]) should be 
administered before the procedure and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_896505]™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.[ADDRESS_896506] be sent to the ang iographic core 
lab. 
The angiographic core lab values will supersede the physician’s measurement assessments for data analysis 
purposes; however, the physician’s assessm ent will be used to determine subject eligibility at the time of 
enrollment.  
Pre-Dilatat ion 
In both treatment groups, pre -dilatation is required for all target lesions and must be performed successfully 
before a subject can be randomized (inclusion criteri a 8). Pre-dilatation must be performed with a high 
pressure PTA balloon (no other device s, such as cutting/scoring balloons, or DCBs are allowed). The pre -
dilatation balloon must have a diameter matching the RVD distal to the target lesion. Patients must b e 
excluded from enrolling in the study if pre -dilatation is unsuccessful. Up to two ball oons may be used to 
achieve successful pre -dilatation prior to considering the patient a screen failure. Pre -dilatation is 
considered unsuccessful if any of the followi ng occur:  
• The tip of the guide wire or PTA balloon is unable to cross and extend beyond the target  lesion  
• A flow -limiting dissection (Grade ≥C) or perforation  occurs  
• Inability to  pre-dilate  
• Residual stenosis >  30%  
If pre -dilatation is successful, the patie nt will be randomized to receive either standard PTA (control arm) or 
IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB (study arm), see Section 9.5 – Randomization and Treatment Assignment. Subjects 
randomized  to the standard PTA arm will receive addi tional PTA treatment with a low pressure balloon.

Balloon Sizing: Balloon size must match the RVD and fully cover and extend beyond the lesion length:  
• Nominal balloon diameter must match the inner diamet er of the reference vessel distal to the target  
lesion.  
• Nominal balloon length must exceed the total target lesion length by [CONTACT_3450] 1 cm at the 
proximal and distal edge in order to ensure full lesion coverag e and prevent geographic  miss.  
Inflation Pressure: Balloon inflation pressure should be at the nominal pressure and should never exceed 
rated burst pressure.

Inflation Time: Balloon inflation must be at least 180 seconds (3 minutes). The IN.PACT™ AV Acces s DCB 
releases the drug into the vessel wa ll on first expansion and adequate drug transfer occurs in the first 60 
seconds of inflation. The additional 120 seconds is intended solely for mechanical dilatation purposes to fulfill 
optimal PTA requirements.  
Prolonged and Repeat Inflations: Longer infl ation times are possible at the discretion of the Investigator 
for the purpose of optimizing lesion dilatation.  
A second dilatation must be performed with a non -DCB when the initial dilation results in any of the 
following:  
• Residual stenosis > 30% (by [CONTACT_663836]);  
• Presence of flow -limiting  dissection  
Use of Multiple Study Balloons: In subjects with a total target lesion length that is longer than the longest 
available balloon, two or more IN.PACT™ AV Access DCBs may be used and they should overlap by 
[CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_896507]™ AV Access DCB to complete treatment is allowed only under either of the 
following circumstances:  
• The first IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB bursts prior to 60 seconds  of inflation  time  
• The total length of the eligible target lesion requires more than one IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB  to 
fully cover the lesion and extend about [ADDRESS_896508]™ AV Access DCB is required under the circumstances described above, the secon d 
IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB must be a newly opened device, and may be of a different diameter.  
Post -dilatation: Post -dilatation should be completed according to the investigator’s discretion. It is 
important to provide drug delivery to the entire length of th e treated vessel prior to post -dilatation or 
provisional stenting. If adequate PTA results are not obtained after the IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB(s) 
inflation, post -dilatation using a non –drug -coated PT A balloon of shorter length than the previously  used 
IN.PAC T™ AV Access DCB is recommended. For both treatment arms, all balloon dilatations in enrolled 
subjects, including the pre -randomization dilatation, must be documented with angiographic images and 
submitted to the angiographic core lab.  
Only study subjects randomized to treatment with the IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB may be treated with the 
investigational product.  
No alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33938] (DES, grafts, laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty, brachytherapy, etc.). 
Intention to use such alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_663808] - or peri -procedure 
constitutes a violation of exclusion criterion.

performed only after repeated and prolonged balloon inflations result in either of the following condition s: 
• Residual stenosis of ≥50% (by [CONTACT_663829]);  
• Major (≥ Grade D) flow -limiting  dissection  
All subjects who undergo a provisional stenting are required to be followed per the protocol -required

Unscheduled Visit  
A subject w ho returns to the investigational site between protocol -required visits for a clinical event in the 
target limb is considered to have an Unscheduled Visit, and all appropriate assessments must be completed 
and captured in the appropriate electro nic case re port forms (eCRFs). Appendix 17.11 details the 
recommended guidelines for re -interventions.  
Angiography and/or duplex ultrasound should be repeated if clinically indicated and/or within the 
institution’s standard of care. As much as possible, im aging studi es performed during an Unscheduled Visit 
should be performed in accordance with the Core Lab imaging protocols. Angiographic and/or duplex 
ultrasound and/or arterial flow studies results must be submitted to the appropriate core lab with the Cor e 
Lab Techn ician Worksheet.  
If the subject refuses an angiogram, duplex ultrasound or re -intervention at an unscheduled visit, it will not 
be considered a deviation from the protocol. Table 1 2 lists the assessments to be performed if clinically 
indicated a t unschedul ed and re -intervention visits.  Unscheduled visits will no longer  be collected  or 
required.

size if needed in order to achieve an acceptable distributio n of sizes. Investig ators would be notified of 
what balloon sizes are needed for enrollment, and patients who are not candidates for treatment with 
those sizes would no longer be considered for enrollment. This determination may be made during the 
procedur e after the initial angiogram, at which point the patient would become a screen failure.  
 
9.3 Prior and Concomitant  Medications  
Single antiplatelet therapy, at a minimum, (e.g.  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_336495]) should be 
administered before the procedure and for a m inimum of [ADDRESS_896534] of care at the study site, ensure  the informed 
consent form has been reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_663837].  
Use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications will be documented on the Concomitant Medication 
eCRF. Use of medications other than a ntiplatelet and anticoagulants will not be collected.  
Note: medications and dose as market approved in g eography  
 
9.[ADDRESS_896535] undergo the consent process, possess the mental capacity to provide Informed Consent, 
and sign the ICF prior  to enrollment and prior to undergoing any assessments or procedures that are study -
specific (defined as  those that would not be conducted if the subject was not participating in the study). 
Some general inclusion/exclusion criteria that are standard of ca re may be  evaluated prior to the subject 
signing the Informed Consent Form. An exam previously conducted , but repeated solely for the study (for 
example, to determine eligibility) is considered a study -specific assessment.  
The subject must personally sign and date the site’s current Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics 
Committee (EC) – approved version of  the Informed Consent to be eligible for the study. A legally 
appointed representative may sign the consent form in cases where a subject has mental cap acity but 
cannot sign due to physical inability. If a patient is illiterate, an impartial witness must b e present during 
the entire informed consent discussion. All items addressed in the patient informed consent must be 
explained.  
IN.PACT™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.0  Page 46 of 96 
Medtronic Controlled Information  
056-F275, v A Clinical Investigation Plan Template   
 The study site Principal  Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his/her delegated designee must conduct the informed consent 
process. The content o f the ICF must be explained to the subject in a language that is as non - technical as 
possible and is understandable to the subject (and witness, if req uired/applicable). The patient must be 
given ample opportunity to ask questions and will be informed abo ut their rights to withdraw from the 
study at any time, for any reason, and without any disadvantage.  
When the patient has thoroughly understood this in formation, he/she will be asked if he/she is willing to 
sign or seal (with printed name) and date consen t form. A subject may participate in the study when he/she 
consents to do so of their own free will and signs the informed consent form.  
After all requi red parties have signed and dated the ICF, the subject must be provided with a copy of the 
signed and da ted ICF. The original signed ICF should be retained in the Investigator Site File or medical 
record.  
The informed consent process for all subjects must be documented in the source records.  
The ICF and other written explanatory information will be revised i f significant new information that may 
be relevant to the subject’s consent becomes available, or there is an amendment to the protocol which 
necessitates a change to the ICF. The subjects should be re -consented in a timely manner and will be asked 
to conf irm willingness to continue his/her participation in the study and obtain his/her signature [CONTACT_663872] 
(with printed name) on the revised consent  form. All revisions to the consent form and information sheet 
must be approved in advance by [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  
Medtroni c revised the written informed consent template to include the extension of follow -up from the 
originally planned [ADDRESS_896536]  index procedure. Subjects who are currently participating 
in the clinical study shall be asked to sign the update d informed consent to confirm their continuing 
informed consent in writing for up to 5 years of follow -up. The revised informed consent docume nts will be 
provided to the investigational sites for approval by [CONTACT_132639]/IRB.

9.5 Randomization and Treatment  Assignment  
After a patient has signed informed consent, the eligibility criteria has  been verified and undergone 
successful pre -dilatation, the patient will be enrolled via randomization to one of two treatment arms in a 
1:1 ratio:  
1. IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB (study  arm)  
2. Standard PTA Balloon (control  arm)  
Randomization will be accomplished usi ng an Interactive V oice Response System (IVRS), or Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS) or Interactive Mobile Response System (IMRS). Randomization should occur as 
closely as possible to the time of index procedure. Randomization will be stratified based  on lesion status: 
de novo vs. restenotic and with pre -specified block sizes within study sites. A separate protocol for 
instructions on how to randomize subjects will be provided to the study sites.  
Confirmation of randomization reports will be provided t o the site immediat ely after randomization occurs. 
These reports must be maintained in the site files.  
Once randomized (enrolled), a subject must be followed per protocol, regardless of whether or not a 
subject ultimately receives study treatment.  
If a subject inadvertently undergoes the wrong treatment (e.g. randomized to the control arm but 
undergoes PTA with the study device), the subject will be analyzed in accordance with the treatment 
assignment, not the treatment actually administered.  
If a subjec t is inadvertently ran domized more than once, the subject must be treated in accordance with 
the first treatment assignment and the subject will be followed per protocol and will be analyzed in the 
intent -to-treat (ITT) data set.  
 
9.6 Assessment of  Safety  
The primary safety endpoin t is based on the Adverse Event data collected. Further information on collection 
of Adverse Events is discussed in Section 11 – Adverse Event Assessments.

Access to Source Data/Documents . 
 
9.8 Deviation  Handling  
A deviation is any event in which the study is not conducted according to the CIP, applicable laws or 
regulations or the Investigator Agreement. Deviations may include, but are not limited to the following:  
• Failure to obtain informed consent prior to  participation  
• Incorrect version of the informed consent form  used  
• Failure to obtain IRB/EC approval before the start of enrolling subjects in the  study  
• Included subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
• Required testing and/or measurements not done or incorrectly  done  
• Subject did not attend follow -up visit 
• Follow -up visit was completed outside  window  
• Unauthorized use of IN.PACT™ AV Access  DCB(s)  
• Adverse events/UADE or device deficiencies not reported in the required timeframe  by 
[CONTACT_663839]  
• Control of study devices not  maintained  
• Source data permanently  lost 
• Enrollment o f subjects during lapse of IRB/EC  approval  
• Enrollment limits  exceeded  
Investigators are required, whenever possible, to obtain prior approval from Medtronic before initiating 
changes in or deviations from  the investigational plan, except where necessary to  protect the life or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. Such approval will be documented in writing and  
IN.PACT™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.0  Page 49 of 96 
Medtronic Controlled Information  
056-F275, v A Clinical Investigation Plan Template   
  
maintained in the study files. Prior approval is generally not expe cted in situations where unforeseen 
circumstances are beyond the Inv estigator’s control, (e.g., subject did not attend scheduled follow -up visit), 
the event, however, is still considered a deviation.  
In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect the life or 
physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the IRB/EC as well as 
Medtronic as soon as possible but no later than five (5) working days from the date of the devi ation 
occurrence.  
Reporting of all deviations should comply with IRB /EC policies and/or local laws and/or regulatory agencies 
and must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible upon the site becoming aware of the deviation. 
Subject specific deviations w ill be reported on the Protocol Deviation eCRF; all non -subject spec ific 
deviations (e.g. unauthorized use of an investigational device outside the study, unauthorized use of an 
investigational device by a physician who has not signed an Investigator Agree ment, etc.) will be reported 
to Medtronic in writing.  
Medtronic is r esponsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any 
additional corrective and/or preventive actions which may include amending the CIP, conducting additi onal 
training, terminating the investigation, etc. Repetitive or ser ious investigator compliance issues may 
represent a need to initiate a corrective action plan with the investigator and site, and in some cases, 
necessitate suspending enrollment at that s ite until the problem is resolved or ultimately terminating the 
inve stigator's participation in the study. Medtronic may provide site -specific reports to investigators 
summarizing information on deviations that occurred at the investigational site on a per iodic basis.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_896540] (e.g. phone, email, 
text), followed by a certified letter from the Principal  Investigator. Once deemed lost -to-follow - up, t he 
subject will be exited from the study.
IN.PACT™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.[ADDRESS_896541] of  his/her request 
to withdraw his/her consent. If the site is unable to obtain written documentation, all information 
regarding the subject’s withdrawal must be recorded in the subject’s medical record. In add ition, the 
appropriate eCRFs must be completed.  
Withdrawal of a subject from the study can also occur at the direction of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_663812]’s consent. Reasons for physician -directed subject withdrawal include, but are not exclu sive to: 
protocol requirements, the subject has enrolled in another study that conflicts with the primary outcome, 
or the physician deems it in the best interest for the safety or welfare of the subject to withdraw.  
Medical Care after Study Exit  
After stud y exit, the subjects may be followed as per rout ine standard of care by [CONTACT_663840] 
a treating physician. Relevant medical records may be made available by [CONTACT_663841]. As per local law 
and regulation the investigator may be contact[CONTACT_663842].  
10. Risks and Benefits  
 
10.[ADDRESS_896542]™ AV Access DCB in PTA are similar 
to those associated with standard PTA and drug -eluting stent procedures. Such risks, as listed in the 
IN.PACT™ AV Access DCB investigational IFU, inc lude but may not be limited to those listed below (in 
alphabetical order). Table 1 3 below also includes potential risks and complications that may occur.

As with any device requiring mechanical deployment and retraction, there exists a risk of mechanical failure 
of the device resulting in potential surgical intervention to remove the balloon or delivery system.  
 
It is expected that the fluoroscopy time during the procedure may be minimally longer (in order to confirm 
inclusion and exclusion criteria) than the time required for standard PTA procedures using other devices. 
Following the fluoroscopic procedure, the skin area exposed to the x -rays could react to produce an effect 
similar to a sun burn.  
 
All of the above could cause prolonged illn ess, permanent impairment of daily function or, in rare cases, 
death. Possible treatments could include, but are not limited to medication, surgery, medical monitoring or 
other applicable treatments, and will be provided at the discretion of the Investigat or. 
 
Potential Side Effects of Paclitaxel  
Paclitaxel is a drug commonly used in the treatment of oncology patients; particularly in patients with 
breast cancer. In that setting, paclitaxel is usually administered as an intravenous infusion and side effects  
associated with this systemic administration are known.  
High systemic safety margins were reported in the IN.PACT™ SFA II Pharmacokinetic Report. Paclitaxel 
systemic exposures in 24 study subjects was brief, declining in one hour by [CONTACT_46431] 87% from the peak  of 
7.9 ng/ mL to 1.0 ng/mL, followed by a continued decline to very low concentration levels of 0.1ng/mL at 
day 7.  
Some of the common side effects known to occur in cancer patients treated with paclitaxel include, but are 
not limited to, the side effects l isted in  Table 14 .

• allergic/immunologic  reaction  
• alopeci a 
• anemia  
• gastrointestinal  symptoms  
• hematologic dyscrasia (including leucopenia, neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia)  
• hepatic enzyme  changes  
• histologic changes in vessel wall, including i nflammation, cellular damage, or 
necrosis  
• myalgia/arthralgia  
• myelosuppressio n

with paclitaxel.  
As with the use of any investigational product, there may be o ther potential adverse events that are 
unforeseen at this time.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_896543]™ AV Access DCB may improve and maintain blood flow through the treated AVF, resulting in the 
need for fewer treatments. This may allow for continued/resumption of AV access for the purpose of 
hemodialysis. Information g ained from the conduct of this study may be of benefit to other persons with 
the same medical condit ion. 
 
10.[ADDRESS_896544]™ AV Access DCB or the participation in this study are not anticipated to be worse than the 
risks normally associated with the use of other commercially avail able devices.  
Potential risks with this study are minimized by [CONTACT_663843], by [CONTACT_663844]/exclusion criteria to ensure only 
appropriate subjects ar e enrolled. In addition, the investigator performs a continuous monitoring, 
assessment, and document ation of any risks.  
Medtronic will establish a CEC and DMC to independently review and evaluate subject health status, device 
performance, and identify any safety concerns regarding subjects’ wellbeing. Medtronic has further 
minimized the possibility of ri sks by [CONTACT_663845].PACT™ AV Access 
DCB in this clinical study, implementing quality control measures into producti on processes, providing 
guidelines for subject selection and evaluation, and providing adequate inst ructions and labeling.

Classification of Causal Relationships  
For each reported AE, the causal relationship between the AE and the study device, interventional 
procedure, and therapy will be classified as not related, unlikely, possible, probable, or  causal 
relationship by [CONTACT_10552].  
In the case where the AE may not be adequately assessed because of insufficient data, data cannot be  
verified, or if data is contradictory, Medtronic will classify the relatedness as ‘possible’.  
The cau sal relationships are defined in Table  16, and should be collected for subjects randomized to 
either the control arm or study arm.

12.  Data Review Committees and Core Laboratories  
12.1 Data Monitoring  Commit tee 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), will be  established with the responsibility to assess 
the progress of the clinical investigation, the safety data, and the critical performance endpoints and to 
recommend to Medtronic whether to continue,  modify, or stop the investigation. All final decisions 
regarding study modifications or termination will be made by [CONTACT_13735]. Detailed information, such as the 
DMC member selection, composition, duties, procedures, and deliberation rules are detailed and  
documented in the DMC Charter.  
 
12.2 Clinical Event  Committee  
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will be responsible for the adjudication of selected 
adverse events and clinical endpoints in the study, using criteria established at the outset of the study and 
specified by [CONTACT_10396], the CEC Charter and rele vant societal reporting standards. The CEC Charter will

 specify explicit rules outlining the minimum amount of data required and the algorithm followed in order 
to classify an event. Detailed information such as the CEC member selection, composition, dutie s, 
procedures, and deliberation rules are detailed and documented in the CEC Charter.  
For any events after 36 months , only serious adverse event related to death will be adjudicated .  
 
12.3 Duplex Ultrasound Core  Laboratory  
The Duplex Ultrasonography Core Labor atory (DUS Core lab) is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_663814], reviewing DUS exams, interpreting subject DUS data, and providing feedback on the 
quality of the DUS exams to participating sites. The DUS Core lab will review, analyze, and record d ata 
on the Duplex Core laboratory Assessment eCRF. The DUS Core laboratory’s interpretation of all DUS 
exams will be used for the data analyses through [ADDRESS_896548] index procedure.  
 
12.4 Angiographic Core  Laboratory  
The Angiographic Core Laboratory is respons ible for review of the index procedural angiograms to assess 
lesion characteristics as well as procedural outcomes. The Angiographic Core Laboratory will also review any 
angiograms performed during the follow -up period and any re -interventions. The Angiogr aphic Core 
laboratory’s interpretation of all angiograms will be used for the data analyses.  
 
13. Statistical Design and Methods  
 
This is a prospective, global, multi -center, single -blinded, randomized (1:1) study of balloon dilatation 
with IN.P ACT™ AV Access DCB (study arm) vs. standard n on-coated PTA balloons (control arm) for the 
treatment of de novo and non -stented restenotic lesions in the native AVF. The study will enroll in three 
geographies: U.S., Japan, and New Zealand. Further details o n the statistical methods, including 
justific ation, timing of interim analysis can be found in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 
13.1 Hypotheses and Sample Size  Calculation  
There are two primary hypotheses for the study. One is for the primary efficacy endpoint – target lesion 
primary patency through 6 mont hs, and one is for the primary safety endpoint – SAE rate involving the AV 
access circuit through [ADDRESS_896549]™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.0  Page 60 of 96 
Medtronic Controlled Information  
056-F275, v A Clinical Investigation Plan Template   
 For the primary efficacy endpoint – target lesion primary patency through 6 months, the treatment (p T) 
and control (p C) groups will b e compared in a superiority format under the following hypothesis.  
H0: pT ≤ p C 
HA:   p T   >  p C 
 
 
For the primary safety endpoint - SAE rate involving the AV access circuit through 30 days, the treatment  
(πT) and control (π C) groups will be compared in a non -inferiority format under the following hypothesis.  
H0: πT ≥ π C  +  0.0 75 
HA:   π T   <  π C   +  0.075  
For primary efficacy endpoint, with one -sided alpha of 0.025 and assuming 60% primary pate ncy rate in 
treatment and 40% in control, a Z -test of proportions will provide at least 92% statistical power to test 
for superiority, when the effective sample size is 140 in each arm. After accounting for 15% of attrition 
rate through [ADDRESS_896550] 80% power 
using a  Farrington -Manning test based on a one -sided alpha of 0.025, with the assumed event rate of 
5% in each arm and a non -inferiority margin of 7.5%15. After accounting for 2% of attrition at 30 -day 
follow -up, the total sample size will be 330.  
According to ab ove the consideration of both primary endpoints, the total sample size is therefore 330. 
The power and sample size calcul ations were performed by [CONTACT_663848] v14.0.7 (NCSS LLC, Kaysville, 
Utah). The establishment of the assumptions for endpoint rates was ba sed upon publicly available 
information from currently marketed devices and the literature.

*The key adverse events reported include death ( 5%), CVA (2%), CHF (4%), edema of arm/hand (3%), vessel rupture (3%), 
and pseudoaneurysm (5%) in the stent graft arm at [ADDRESS_896552] and the primary safety endpoint will be tested for non -inferiority of treatment to control using the 
Farrington Manning Method and a predefined non -inferiority margin of 7.5%. The study will be claimed 
successful if both primary efficacy and primary saf ety tests showed significance at 0.025. The family -wise 
type I error will therefore be controlled at 0.025.  
Once the hypothesis tests su cceed for both primary endpoints, key secondary endpoints will be 
compared between treatments sequentially in a superior ity manner as detailed in Section 14.5. If all of 
the selected key secondary endpoints pass the test, an exact test of superiority of th e IN.PACT™ AV 
Access DCB compared to PTA in 30 -day primary safety endpoint will follow; this sequential approach 
does no t inflate the Type I error for superiority.  
Any deviation(s) and change(s) from the original statistical plan and justifications will be  documented in 
the CIP amendment and in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

13.3 Analysis  Sets 
 
13.3.1 Primary Analysis  Set 
Inten t-to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set  
All primary analyses will be performed using Intent -to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set which includes all 
randomized subjects. The ITT subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized group assignment 
irrespective of the treat ment actually delivered and subject follow -up time, and all events post - 
randomization will be counted toward study endpoints. In general, all analyses will be performed on 
evaluable subjects in ITT analysis set. For Primary efficacy endpoint, the evaluabl e subjects include all 
ITT subjects that had a patency -related event (i.e., CD -TLR or access circuit thrombosis) wit hin [ADDRESS_896553]: (a) received the randomized treatment as assigned 
without provisional stenting or other potential bailout proce dure; (b) no pre -specified 
inclusion/exclusion violation(s); and (c) available endpoint data post -index p rocedure. Per -Protocol 
Analysis set will be applied to primary and key secondary endpoint analyses.  
 
13.4 Analysis of the Primary  Endpoints  
 
13.4.1 Primary Analysi s of the Primary  Endpoints  
Both the primary efficacy outcome and primary safety outcome will be analyzed as observed. The count 
and percentage of subjects with each outcome will be presented by [CONTACT_3148]. The percentage of the 
efficacy endpoint will be bas ed on the subjects who had non -patency event (i.e., CD -TLR or access circuit  
IN.PACT™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.0  Page 64 of 96

056-F275, v A Clinical Investigation Plan Template   
  
thrombosis ) within [ADDRESS_896554] 23 days. Non -inferiority on the safety endpoint will be tested using the 
Farrington - Mann ing method. The differences between treatments and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval (CI) will be calculated.  
To control the overall Type I error (one -sided P= 0.025 superiority and one -sided P=0.025 non -
inferiority) the following sequential analysi s approach will be taken:  
Primary efficacy superiority; if significant at one -sided alpha=0.025, and 
Primary safety non -inferiority; if significant at one -sided alpha= 0.025, 
then proceed to key secondary endpoints detailed in section 14.5.  
The study will be deemed a success if both the superiority of efficacy and non -inferiority of safety 
are demonstrated.  
 
13.4.2 Additional Analysis of the Primary  Endpoints  
The time to the ev ents will be evaluated according to Kaplan -Meier method, and the log -rank tests wil l 
be applied to compare the survival curves over time between the treatments for each primary 
endpoint respectively.  
Primary endpoints will also be analyzed using per -protoc ol analysis set and as treated analysis 
set respectively when applicable.  
 
13.4.3 Sensitiv ity Analysis of the Primary  Endpoints  
• Multiple Imputation: ITT subjects with missing clinical follow -up data will be imputed using 
multiple imputation  procedure.  
• Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_663816];  
• Worst case analysis in which all missing endpoint in the treatment arm will be imputed as 
failures and all missing endp oint in the control arm will be imputed as  successes.  
Multiple Imputation will  be conducted for primary efficacy endpoint. Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_663817].  
IN.PACT™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan  
Version    4.[ADDRESS_896555]; if the interaction effect is not 
statistically significant (defined as p>0.[ADDRESS_896556]) or the interaction effect is significant 
but not qualitative in nature, all data irrespective  of site will be collected in a single analysis  cohort. It 
may be necessary to combine two or more low enrolling study sites into pseudo -sites to allow these 
analyses. Sites with fewer than [ADDRESS_896557] enrollment equal to or greater than 10 sub jects. This will be done in a manner to preserv e the 
structure of the study and prevent bias. Similar poolability analyses will be conducted to assess 
treatment -by- geography (U.S. vs. Japan vs. New Zealand) interaction and treatment -by-lesion status 
(de n ovo vs. restenotic)  interaction.  
 
13.5 Analysis of t he Secondary  Endpoints  
Descriptive statistics for the secondary endpoints will be provided. Unless otherwise specified, for 
categorical variables, the count and percentage of subjects with each outcome will be  presented. 
They will be evaluated by [CONTACT_663849] -square tests or Fisher’s exact tests depending on the event counts.  
Continuous variables will be compared with t -tests. The differences between treatments together 
with the corresponding 95% confidence interv al will be calculated. Additional time to event  survival 
analysis will be employed when applicable. Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using ITT analysis 
set, per - protocol analysis set and as treated analysis set respectively when applicable.  
 
In additi on, v ital status will be collected annually thr ough [ADDRESS_896558] exits the study, no medical 
information can be retrieved.  Time to survival /death will be evaluated according to the Kaplan -Meier 
method up to 60 months  using ITT analys is set . 
 
The following key secondary endpoints will be compared between treatmen ts sequentially by [CONTACT_663850] a  superiority manner if the two primary endpoint tests pass, each at a one sided 
significance level of 0.025, for potential inclusion in the label, in the following order:

In addition, claims data analysis including Medicare and commercial populations showed that 80% or 
more cases of dialysis vessel PTAs were performed in Medicare beneficiaries. The results of the 
IN.PACT™ AV Access IDE Study are therefore expected to be applic able to and generalizable to the 
Medicare beneficiary population since Medicare is t he predominant payer of services for ESRD patients, 
including treatment of dialysis vessels with PTA.

18. Version History  
 
 
Version  Summary of Changes  Author(s)/Title  
1.0 • Not applicable, new  document  Stephanie Cihlar, Sr. 
Clinical Research 
Specialist  
2.0 • Minor administrative, language, grammatical and 
punctuation changes for clarity throughout  CIP 
• Definitions table: added “successful dialysis”  for 
standardization of reporting successful dialysis  
• Section 5.2: Updated the indication statement per  FDA 
• Section 8.1: added a footnote  stating that for the 
clinical trial only the 40 cm and 80 cm catheter lengths 
will be made  available  
• Section 10 and throughout: replaced the KD -QOL 
questionnaire with the EQ -5D questionnaire for 
healthcare economic analysis  purposes  
• Section  14: 
• Changed th e statement of “two -sided Chi - 
square test at α=0.05” to “one -sided Z -test at 
α=0.025” for primary efficacy endpoint per FDA 
recommendation to be consistent with the 
alternative  hypothesis  
• Added worst case analysis per FDA 
recommendation to assess the sens itivity of the 
primary  endpoints  
• Explicitly ex pressed the hypotheses of key 
secondary endpoints in mathematical form per 
FDA recommendation  Stephanie Cihlar, Sr.

 • Clearly disting uished the “secondary analysis” 
and “sensitivity analysis” per FDA 
recommendation. Specified the additional 
analysis on primary endpoints, including time - 
to-event analysis, analysis on as -treated 
subjects and per -protocol subjects. The 
sensitivity analysi s, includin g multiple 
imputation, Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_663827].  
• Added “As -Treated Analysis Set” and “Per - 
Protocol Analysis Set” and reworded the “as - 
treated analysis” and “per -protocol analysis” by 
[CONTACT_663868] -defined analysis set fo r 
clarifica tion.  
• Changed the test method of evaluating the 
primary safety endpoint from Z -test to 
Farrington -Manning test per FDA 
recommendation. The exact test provides a 
stronger control on type I error for the small 
event  rates.  
• Changed the cutoff day f or the 6 month target 
lesion primary patency from 180 days to 210 
days. The Target lesion primary patency is a 
composite endpoint that has two component 
events - a clinical endpoint of CD -TLR and an 
imaging based endpoint of thrombosis, using 
upper limit of  clinical  visit window (180+30 
days) helps to maximize the assessment of 
imaging  data.  
• Added Appendix 17.[ADDRESS_896591]™ AV Access Study Clinica l Investigation Plan

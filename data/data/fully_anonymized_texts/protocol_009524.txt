1.1 Primary  Objective 
1.1.1. To evaluate the r esponse rate of FOLFOX -A for patients with  locally advanced  pancreatic cancer. 
 
1.2 Secondary  Objective 
1.2.1 To evaluate the disease -free and overall survival for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
treated with FOLFOX -A. 
 
2.0  BACKGROUND 
Locally Advanced Pancreatic C ancer:  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death 
in the [LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_1240016] potentially resectable disease at diagnosis; approximately 
[ADDRESS_1240017] approach. 
Therapeutic options include radiation therapy (RT) alone, chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone.4,5 
Rarely, a response to initial therapy will be sufficient to permit an attempt at subsequent resection.  
 
The Efficacy of Radiation for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Is Uncertain: The LAP [ADDRESS_1240018] randomized to gemcitabine alone or 
gemcitabine plus erlotinib for 4 months. Patients without progression (60%) were then randomized to [ADDRESS_1240019], a phase 3 trial by [CONTACT_886228] a survival advantage to the combination of radiotherapy and gemcitabine over gemcitabine alone.
7 The study was closed early because of slow accrual; however, in the 
74 patients enrolled, median survival improved from 9.2 to 11.1 months (p=0.017).  
 
Chemotherapy for Locally Advanced Resectable Pancreatic Cancer: Systemic chemotherapy is often 
given prior to radiation in patients with locally adv anced pancreatic cancer.2 Chemotherapy has 2 goals – 
to produce responses in radiographically assessable locally advanced disease and to target  unsuspected 
micrometastases reducing the extremely high risk of systemic recurrence with locoregional therapy such as 
radiation . The most commonly used systemic regimens are gemcitabine, gemcitabine + abraxane and 
FOLFIRINOX.2 
 
FOLFIRINOX:   The PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial compared FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 
irinotecan and fluorouracil) to gemcitabine for first- line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The 
trial enrolled 342 patients between 01/2005 and 10/2009. The median overall survival was 11.1 months in 
the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group (P<0.001).8Median 
progression-free survival was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine 
group. The objective response rate was 31.6% in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 9.4% in the gemcitabine 
group. Grade 3/4 toxicities increased with FOLFIRINOX including neutropenia (18.7% versus 45.7%), 
febrile neutropenia (0.6% versus 5.4%), diarrhea (1.2% versus 12.7%) and neuropathy (0% to 9%), 
respectively.  
 
FOLFIRINOX is being inv estigated in the locally advanced and borderline resectable settings. In a study 
from [LOCATION_009], 77 patients were enrolled.9 Patients  received a median number of five cycles (1 -30). Grade 
3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (11 %), nausea (9  %), diarrhea (6  %), fatigue (6  %), and anemia (1  %).

percent of patients received a consolidation therapy: 70  % had radiotherapy and 36 % underwent a 
surgical resection, with a curative intent. Within the whole cohort, 1- year OS rate was 77  % (95  % CI 65 -
86) and 1- year progression -free survival rate was 59  % (95  % CI 46 -70).9 FOLF IRINOX was also 
investigated in 22 patients at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886212].10 The 
response rate was 27.3%, and the median progression-free survival was 11.[ADDRESS_1240020] ivity inpatients with 
LAPC and the use of FOLFIRINOX was associated with conversion to resectability in>20% of patients. However, the recurrences following R0 res ection in three of five patients and the toxicities observed with 
the use of this regimen were concerning .  
 
The studies in [LOCATION_009] and MGH showed that, due  to substantial toxicity of FOLFIRINOX, administering 
> 6 cycles of FOLFIRINOX is difficult. The abil ity to administer multiple cycles of highly effective 
chemotherapy is important in reducing the risk of systemic relapse. In the cooperative group ALLIANCE, 
only 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX are administered in the neoadjuvant setting for borderline resectable patients. A more active, less toxic regimen with the ability to receive more than 6 cycles of therapy is 
needed to improve overall outcome in locally advanced patients.  
 
Irinotecan is not an effective agent in pancreatic cancer:  Single agent irinotecan is without significant 
activity in pancreatic cancer.11 Furthermore, the combination of irinotecan and gemcitabine does not 
improve survival as compared to gemcitabine alone.12 While irinotecan may be synergistic with 
oxaliplatin  and fluorouracil, it’s overall contribution to FOLFIRINOX efficacy may be modest. However, 
the inclusion of irinotecan adds substantially to the toxicity of FOLFIRINOX.  
 
Abraxane:  Abraxane is a biologically interactive albumin -bound paclitaxel combining a protein with a 
chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form.13 This composition provides a novel approach of increasing 
intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor- mediated transport process allowing transcytosis 
across the endothelial cell. Th is albumin -specific receptor mediated process involves the binding of 
albumin to a specific receptor (gp60) on the intraluminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in activation of a protein (caveolin -1), which initiates an internalization process in the endothelial cell 
through the formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin-bound chemotherapeutic complex 
via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium.
14 A protein specifically secreted by [CONTACT_7879] 
(SPARC) binds albumin, allowing release of the hydrophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane.
15Abraxane is the first biologically interactive nanoparticle product leveraging this gp -
60/caveolin -1/caveolae/SPARC pathway  to increase intra-tumoral concentration of the drug and reducing 
toxic effects in normal tissue.15 Pancreatic cancer cells and surrounding stroma are known to overexpress 
SPARC (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes.16 The 
albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of paclitaxel through binding of albumin to SPARC.
16  
 
Abraxane + gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer:   The regimen of Abraxane, 125mg/m2, and gemcitabine, 
1gm/m2, weekly x 3 weeks in 28 day cycles, was developed by [CONTACT_774543] a phase I/II study for 
patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.16 A phase III study of 861 patients demonstrated that the 
combination of Abraxane and gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine alone. As shown in the table 1 
below, overall survival (OS), prog ression -free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), and 
response rate (RR) were significantly improved in the Abraxane + gemcitabine arm.17

Phase I Study of FOLFOX -Abraxane (FOLFOX -A): Irinotecan is responsible for much of the toxicity 
of FOLFIRINOX but may its contribution in FOLFIRINOX may be modest. The addition of irinotecan to 
gemcitabine was not superior to gemcitabine alone. In contrast , the addition of Abraxane to gemcitabine 
increased survival. Therefore, the Brown University Oncology Research Group initiated a protocol to remove irinotecan from FOLFIRINOX and substitute Abraxane – this new regimen is called FOLFOX -A. 
All patients rece ived oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m
2, leucovorin 400 mg/m2 and 5- FU 2400 mg/m2 IV over 46 hours 
with Abraxane. Cycles were repeated every 14 days. Three dose -levels of Abraxane were evaluated:  
• Level 1: Abraxane 125mg/m2 
• Level 2: Abraxane 150 mg/m2 
• Level 3: Abraxane 175 mg/m2  
 
This study has been completed. Thirty -five patients were entered: Dose level 1 (n=6), dose level 2 (N=26), 
dose level 3 (N=3). The median age was 64 (35 -81). 18 The maximum tolerated dose of Nab -paclitaxel was 
150 mg/m2 every [ADDRESS_1240021] had a partial response (60 %). 
The median survival for patients with metastatic disease is [ADDRESS_1240022] been able to receive 10 cycles of therapy.  
 
Current proposal - A phase II study of adjuvant FOLFOX -A: Our preliminary data suggests that 
FOLFOX -A may have equal or superior activity as compared to FOLFIR INOX for patients with 
metastatic pancreatic cancer and appears to be better tol erated with the ability to administer at least 10 
cycles of therapy. We therefore will evaluate FOLFOX -A in a phase II study for patient with locally 
advanced pancreatic cancer .

• It is at the discretion of the treating physician to give Neulasta, [ADDRESS_1240029] treatment  
• Antiemetics will be administered as per standard in stitutional policy.  
 
Patients may receive up to  10 cycles of FOLFOX -A as part of this study as long as their cancer does not 
progress. After 10 cycles of FOLFOX -A, patients will come off study treatment and additional 
treatment/management will be as per institutional standards of care.  It is recommended that patients 
receive radiation with concurrent capecitabine as per institutional standard policy after completion of FOLFOX -A. It is r ecommended that patients who become potentially resectable proceed to attempted 
surgical resection after completion of FOLFOX -A, either before or after standard capecitabine and 
radiation as per institutional standard of care. Information on type of treatment/management post FOLFOXA will be collected by [CONTACT_101435].  
Patients who a re borderline resectable may stop FOLFOX -A treatment at [ADDRESS_1240030] be graded 
using The National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) version 4.03 (Appendix C). **For patient’s experiencing neuropathy please refer to section 5.3**

5.3  Neuropathy  
The goals of the following dose modification rules are to prevent patients from developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] 3/4 
neuropathy during or after completion of FOLFOX -A and to fa cilitate p atients being able to receive 
10cycles of FOLFOX -A without grade 3/4 neuropathy. Fluorouracil and leucovorin are not reduced for 
neuropathy. 
 
5.3.1 For patients experiencing grade 2 neuropathy: 
• Hold Oxali platin   
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_227756] [ADDRESS_1240031] improved to Grade < 1, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and leucovorin may 
be administered. For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a first epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 2 neuropathy, oxaliplatin should be permanently decreased to oxaliplatin –by 1 dose level ( for example a patient who is on the 
starting dose level would have Oxaliplatin reduced to dose level -1: 68mg/m2) . Abraxane ® , 5-
FU and Leucovorin doses are not reduced for grade 2 neuropathy.  
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] [ADDRESS_1240032] improved to Grade < 1, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and leucovorin may

Leucovorin doses are not reduced for grade 2 neuropathy.  
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 2 neuropathy, oxaliplatin should be permanently 
discontinued, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and leucovorin may be continued. 
• It is the investigators discretion to hold FOLFOX -A treatment for up to six weeks  secondary to 
patient’s experiencing grade [ADDRESS_1240034] be documented. 
5.3.2 For patients experiencing grade 3 neuropathy: 
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_30462] 3 neuropathy, FOLFOX-A should be held until neuropathy improves to < grade 1. When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and Abraxane ® doses should be 
permanently decreased to 68mg/m2 and 120mg/m2 respectively  (reduction by 1dose level , ( for 
example a patient who is on the starting dose level would have Oxaliplatin reduced to dose level -
1: 68mg/m2)). 5-FU and Leucovorin are not reduced for grade 3 neuropathy. 
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 3 neuropathy, FOLFOX -A should be held 
until neuropathy improves to < grade 1 . When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  
dose should be permanently decreased  by 1 dose level (for example a patient who had no other 
total dose reductions, but was reduced for their first epi[INVESTIGATOR_886216] 3, would now have their Oxaliplatin and Abraxane reduced  to 5 4mg/m
2 and 96mg/m2 respectively  (dose level -2)).  
• For patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] [ADDRESS_1240035] be documented as secondary to 
grade 3 neuropathy. 
• It is also at the investigator ’s discretion to hold FOLFOX-A treatment for up to six weeks 
secondary to patient experiencing grade [ADDRESS_1240036] be documented 
on treatment and AE forms. 
5.3.3: Grade 4 neuropathy:  
• For patients experiencing grade [ADDRESS_1240037] come off study treatment.  
Examples:  
For patients who experience neuropathy grade 2 or worse and thus require a dose reduction to drugs as per 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 and then require a dose reduction per the criteria in section 5.2, please note that patients 
will be reduced per the dose modification table under section 5.0 per drug.  
Grade 2 neuropathy: For example if a patient experiences grade 2 neuropathy, per section 5.3.1 , 
Oxaliplatin is to be held until neuropathy is < grade 1 but Abraxane, Leucovorin and 5_FU are to be 
administered. Oxaliplati n will then be reduced by 1 dose level . However , if they then subsequently 
experience a toxicity per section 5.2 which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the Abraxane ®  and 5 -FU would be reduced per Dose level -1 and the Oxaliplatin would be 
reduced per Dose level -2 (Oxaliplatin would be reduced per Dose level -[ADDRESS_1240038] 
experienced a dose reduction to Oxaliplatin per the neuropathy grade 2) . Please note that investigators 
can hold treatment for 6 weeks secondary  to neuropathy and this will not count as another reason for dose 
reduction, the grade 2 neuropathy is the event that would prompt the dose modification per section 5.3.1.

be held and when neuropathy is < grade 1, Abraxane ® and Oxaliplatin will then be reduced by 1 dose 
level  and 5- FU and Leucovorin are not reduced .  However , if they then subse quently experience a toxicity 
per section 5.2 which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the 5- FU 
will be reduced per Dose level -1 and the Oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  will be reduced per Dose level -

neuropathy and this will not count as another reason for dose reduction ( as noted above in bullet 6 of 
section 5.2).  
There are no further reductions past Dose level -2  
5.4  Hypersensitivity reactions  
Patients with severe (defined as grade ≥ 3) hypersensitivity reactions from oxaliplatin or Abraxane ®  must 
be removed from protocol treatment. Patients with  hypersensitivity reactions, including pneumonitis, 
cannot be re-challenged.   
Examples of medications to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin and Abraxane ® include: 
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, 12 and 6 hours prior to the oxaliplatin or Abraxane ®  dose;  
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, as well as diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and one of the following: 
cimetidine 300 mg IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV, or famotidine 20 mg IV 30-60 minutes  prior to oxalipla tin or 
Abraxane ®  administration.  
 
If these prophylactic measures or institutional practices fail to preve nt severe oxaliplatin or Abraxane ® 
related hypersensitivity, therapy with oxaliplatin and Abraxane® should be discontinued and the patient 
should be r emoved from protocol treatment. 
 
5.5  Pulmonary Fibrosis  
In the case of unexplained respi[INVESTIGATOR_385437], dyspnea or radiological pulmonary infiltrates, Abraxane ®  and oxaliplatin should be held until further 
investigation excludes interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.  If interstitial pu lmonary fibrosis is 
confirmed, both  Abraxane ®  and oxaliplatin therapy should be terminated and the patient 
removed from protocol treatment. If pulmonary fibrosis is not confirmed and the investigator 
believes the patient can continue on study, the patient will begin treatment at their next scheduled 
cycle at a 20% dose reduction. If this is their third epi[INVESTIGATOR_774529], patie nt will be 
removed from study.  
 
 
Interstitial Pneumonitis  
Interstitial pneumonitis has been observed in < 1% during Abraxane ®  monotherapy and in < 1% during 
combination treatment with Abraxane ®  and carboplatin. Monitor patients closely for signs and 
symptoms of pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of 
pneumonitis, permanently discontinue treatment with Abraxane ®  and promptly initiate appropriate 
treatment  and supportive measures.  
 
Prevention, Surveillance and Management of Interstitial Pneumonitis  
a. Before starting treatment with Abraxane ®  candidates should be evaluated for familial, 
environmental or occupational exposure to opportunistic pathogens: do not enroll patients with a

sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple 
allergies.  
b. During treatment with Abraxane ®  epi[INVESTIGATOR_510781]. Radiographic evaluation with chest X- rays 
and computed tomography (CT) scans (normal or high resolution) may be indicated to look for 
infiltrates ground-glass opacities or honeycombing patterns. Pulse oximetry and pulmonary 
function tests can show respi[INVESTIGATOR_510782]. 
c. Infections should be ruled out with routine microbiological and/or immunologic methods. 
Transbronchial lung biopsy is not recommended, given its limited value and risk of 
pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be reserved for cases with unclear etiology. 
d.  Upon a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis Abraxane ®  should be permanently discontinued. 
After ruling  out an infectious etiology, intravenous high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be 
instituted without delay, with appropriate premedication and secondary pathogen coverage. 
Patients with an added immunological component may also require immune modulation with 
azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Appropriate ventilation and oxygen support should be used 
when required. 
 
5.6 Sepsis  
Sepsis has been reported in less than 1% during monotherapy and fatalities attributed to these events have been rare. However, the risk was appreciably higher in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic 
cancer receiving Abraxane ®  in combination with gemcitabine with a rate of 5% in patients with or 
without neutropenia receiving Abraxane ®  /gemcitabine. Complications due to th e underlying pancreatic 
cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. The increased risk of sepsis in the setting of advanced or metastatic cancer in 
combination with gemcitabine could be managed with prophylactic antibiotic treatment in febrile patients 
(regardless of neutrophil count) and dose reduction, and with G-CSF treatment in neutropenic patients. If 
a patient becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatm ent with broad spectrum 
antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, withhold Abraxane ®  and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels (as per sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1240039] been studied, the metabolism of paclitaxel is enhanced by [CONTACT_097]2C8 and CYP3A4. Therefore patients should be informed about the potential of a drug interaction if they are also 
taking drug that induce or inhibit CYP2C8 (antifungals, erythromycin, cimetidine etc) or CYP3A4 
(rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], phenytoin, etc).

H Physical to be do ne in coordination with 30 day toxicity assessment (+ 1 week allowed). Physical post [ADDRESS_1240043] scans (or disease assessment by [CONTACT_167282]) to be completed approximately every 3 months (post cycle 5 and pre cycle 
10). Scans may be done early secondary to MD discretion or to rule out progression of disease. Sites to document reason to 
BrUOG. It is not required to have pelvic imaging, however, if a pelvic scan is completed at any time point (baseline, during or 
after the s tudy with follow -up) please forward this to BrUOG. If chest imaging is not done at any time point post baseline it will 
not be considered a deviation. It is at the discretion of the MD to order chest imaging post baseline, but if chest imaging i s 
completed  it must be submitted to BrUOG. Chest x -ray acceptable for use through -out study. Abdominal imaging is required.  All 
scans completed from time of registration through progression of disease required to be sent to BrUOG. Confirmatory scans for  
response are not required.  
Off study/ Follow -up: If follow -up time points, including imaging is done outside of study window it will be a minor deviation, 
site to document reason.  
7.0 RESPONSE ASSESSMENT:  
Measurement of Response  
Response will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed in the Revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  Guideline version 1.1 [ Eur J Cancer . 2009;45:228-247.]  
See http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/d ocs/recist_guideline.pdf?  further details.  
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥[ADDRESS_1240044] x-ray, as ≥[ADDRESS_1240045] scan, or ≥[ADDRESS_1240046] be recorded in millimeters (or

(CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions; Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on 
study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more n ew 
lesions is also considered progressions).

9.0  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS  
9.1 Fluorouracil  
See package insert for comprehensive information.  
9.1.1  Formulation 
Each 10 ml ampule contains 500 mg of the drug (50 mg/ml), adjusted to a pH of approximately 9 with sodium hydroxide. 5-Fluorouracil is a fluorinated pyrimidine differing from the normal RNA substrate, 
uracil, by a fluorinated number 5 carbon. The chemical has a pH of 8.1, and the 
commercially available solution is buffered with NaOH to obtain an alkaline solution 
with a pH of around 9.0. The drug is both light sensitive and will precipi[INVESTIGATOR_886217], occasionally, after a prolonged period at room temperature. Melting range of the solid is 280-284° C. At 25°C the solubility is 1.2 mg/ml in chloroform. The 
sodium content is 8.24 mg/ml and molecular weight 130.08. 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1240048] indicated passage of the drug through the blood- brain barrier. 
Intravenous administration gives a half -time of 5 -7.5 minutes at a 15 mg/kg dose. 
Following the i.v. administration of a single 15 mg/kg dose of radioactively labeled drug, levels of 28 mcg/ml, 2 -8 mcg/ml, and 0.72 mcg/ml in plasma were observed at 10 
minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours, respectively. The drug is largely catabolized in the liver and excreted in the form of nontoxic metabolites. Ei ghty percent of the drug is excreted 
as CO
2 from the lungs, and approximately 15% is excreted intact in the urine in 6 hours. 
Of this, 90% is excreted in the first hour.

Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag  
The suspension for infusion prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used immediately, 
but may be stored at ambient temperature (approximately 25º C) and lighting conditions for up to 4 
hours.  
Study Medication Administration  
ABRAXANE ®  is injected into a vein [intravenous (I.V.) infusion] over approximately 30 minutes.  
The use of an in- line filter is not recommended.  
Reconstitution and use of ABRAXANE ®  
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the weight changes 
by > 10% by [CONTACT_456375]. If this is not done it will be 
considered a minor deviation. Weight gain secondary to edema does not require dos e re-
calculation. 
  
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) to be administered by:  
• Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2 )  
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by: 
[CONTACT_192488] = Total Dose (mg)  
                             100 (mg/vial) 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when a fractional number of vials is obtained by [CONTACT_192489] (eg, if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile techni que, prepare the vials for reconstitution. 
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Aseptically, reconstitute each ABRAXANE ®  vial by [CONTACT_44579] 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, ov er a minimum of 1 
minute , using the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto the inside wall  of the 
vial. 
• DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the 
lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the inj ection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes to 
ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.   
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution 
of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation of foam.  Rapid agitation or shaking will 
result in foaming.  
• If foaming or clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_4095], stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides. 
• Each ml of reconstituted product will contain 5 mg of paclitaxel.

• Dosing volume (ml) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/ml) 
8. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  
If particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be  gently inverted again to ensure complete 
resuspension prior to use.  Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipi[INVESTIGATOR_192457].  
9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  has been withdrawn from the vials, 
discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating procedures. 
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag using an injection port.  
Inject p erpendicularly into the center of the injection port to avoid dislodging plastic material 
into the IV bag.   
Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  suspension by [CONTACT_120355] 30 minutes.  The use of in- line filters is not recommended because the reconstituted solution may 
clog the filter. Following administration, the intravenous line should be flushed with sodium chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection  to ensure complete  administration of the complete dose, according 
to local practice.

distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins (94%). In a within-
patient comparison study, the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma wa s significantly higher 
with ABRAXANE® (6.2%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel (2.3%). This contributes to 
signi ficantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with ABRAXANE® compared with solvent -
based paclitaxel, when the total exposure is comparable. In vitro studies of binding to human 
serum proteins, using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50 μg/mL, indicated that the 
presence of cimetidine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, or diphenhydramine did not affect protein 
binding of paclitaxel. The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascu lar distribution and/or tissue binding of paclitaxel.

Agent Inventory Records – The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must 
maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents received from manufacturer using 
a Drug Accountability Record Form.   
 10.1 Treatment Compliance 
 
Records of study medication used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be recorded during the study. Drug accountability will be noted. 
 
All drugs will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identif ied 
sub-investigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt drug preparation, and dispensing, 
including the applicable lot numbers. Any discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the discrepancy must  be recorded in the source documents.  
10.2 Study Drug Disposition 
See section 9.3, # 11 c for more details.  
 
11.0 ADVERSE DRUG REACTION (ADR) REPORTING  
BrUOG considers the SAE reporting period to begin when the subject signs the study specific informed 
consent.  
 
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version [ADDRESS_1240060] access to a copy of the C TCAE version 4 .03. A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
Abraxane ® whether or not considered related to Abraxane ®. This includes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug.  During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.) 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, regardless of whether or not the event( s) are considered related to trial medication. All AEs considered related to trial 
medication will be followed until resolution even if this occurs post- trial.

6 8/21/17, Amendment # 7 11/16/17, Amendment # 8 6/28/18 , Amendment #9 12/26 /18 25 Serious adverse event (SAE) 
An adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes (CFR 312.32): 
• death  
• is life-threatening  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_774533], transfusional support, disease staging/re-staging procedures, concomitant radiotherapy, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated 
with other serious events. 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• congenital anomaly / birth defect.  
 The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical event . Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in  
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30506].  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive t reatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of treatment should be c onsidered an important 
medical event.  
 The definition of “related” being that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse 
experience. 
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An adverse event that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the specificity 
or severity of which is not consistent with the investigator's brochure or package insert.  
 Life-threatening  
Any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate ris k of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 11.2 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
Adverse events, both serious and non- serious, and deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in the source documents.  All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
 11.3 BRUOG ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Investigators are required by [CONTACT_101433]. Questions regarding 
drugs as used in this study should be directed to the Brown University Oncology Research Group 
(BrUOG) Central Office, Phone: ([PHONE_5340] Fax ([PHONE_5341], which will in turn notify the Principal Investigator.  
 Intensity for each adverse event will be scored using CTCAE Version 4 .03.  A copy of t he CTCAE 
Version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov
).  All appropriate 
treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4 .03.  All adverse clinical experiences,

outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and 
for its seriousness.  
 11.3.[ADDRESS_1240063]’s last dose of 
study drug are considered expedited reportable even ts.  If the subject is on study drug, the study drug is to 
be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported to the Brown University Oncology Research Group, by [CONTACT_779], immediately (within 24 hours), via the site completed Celgene pregnancy 
reporting Form and a 3500A MedWatch form (site to submit to BrUOG), and BrUOG will in turn report 
to Celgene immediately (within 1 working day and once in receipt of the site submitted SAE forms). 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease 
state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 4 weeks  (30 days) of the subject’s 
last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events. IP is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6972] , email , or other appropriate method (to be done by [CONTACT_101435]), using the Celgene 
pregnancy report form and the Medwatch3500A form ( Celgene pregnancy  reporting form and MedWatch 
3500A- to be completed by [CONTACT_3725]) . 
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion o f the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene (by 
[CONTACT_101436])  of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a 
follow- up to the initial report . If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is 
to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the ev ent to  BrUOG who will then report to Celgene  by 
[CONTACT_886232] 1 working day of being made aware of the event  via the sites formal submission 
of the SAE pregnancy forms ). 
 
Any suspected fetal exposure to Abraxane ® must be reported to BrUOG immediately  who will then 
report to  Celgene  within 1 working day  of being made aware of the event.  The patient should be referred 
to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
 All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1240064] to causality, as 
SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects to be related to the in 
utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. I n the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene  
should be advised as soon as the information is available.  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male subject 
taking IP should notify the Investigator, and t he pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately. Male patients treated with nab-paclitaxel are advised not to father a 
child during and up to 6 months after treatment. 
11.3.2: Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
All pregnanc ies or suspected pregnancies, including suspected fetal exposure or neonatal deaths must be 
reported to the Brown University Oncology Research Group immediately . BrUOG will report all 
pregnancies to Celgene within 1 working day, and once being made aware of the event  once in receipt of

notification via the 3500A. BrUOG will then alert Celgene within 1 business day of being in receipt of  the Medwatch report . BrUOG will submit the SAE memo, and Medwatch 3500A to the FDA within 7 
days.  
 11.3.3 Expedited Reporting by [CONTACT_210881], Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events of 
being related to  ABRAXANE ® based on the Investigator Brochure.  In the [LOCATION_002], all suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.  All events must be reported, by [CONTACT_101439],  to the 
Brown University Oncology Research Group who must inform Celgene in writing using the site provided 
MEDWATCH 3500A form, of any SAE within [ADDRESS_1240069](s), if available.  Information not 
available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values 
received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document 
resolution of the SAE  (such as discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  is required.  The Celgene tracking number (AX-

experiences. All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_1240070] withdraws consent from study participation (declines participation) or 
at the time patient becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first . 
 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be reported if a 
relationship to the Celgene  study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by [CONTACT_093].  
11.3.4 Overdose (to be reported as important medical event)  
 
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, refers to ABRAXANE
® dosing only.   
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified dose of 
ABRAXANE® assigned to a given patient, regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.  
PO any amount over the protocol- specified dose  
 IV 10% over the protocol- specified dose   
SC 10% over the protocol- specified dose  
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the protocol 
required schedule or frequency.   
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the proto col-specified rate.  For 
nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may increase Cmax by [CONTACT_3450] 20%, therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in less than 25 minutes will meet the infusion rate criterion 
for an overdose.  
Comp lete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was 
accidental or intentional, should be reported in the case report form.    
11.4 Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon:  
1. Whether investigational agents are suspected of causing toxicity  regardless of causality ; 
2. Whether the possibility of such a toxicity was reported in the protocol, consent form, or 
manufacturer’s literature (Expected toxicity); and  
3. The severity of grade of the toxicity.

Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that treatment caused or 
contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used: 
 
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical even t to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 
No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

 12.0 REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY 
Extraordinary medical circumstances or withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102]: If, at any time, the constraints 
of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the patient shall be withdrawn from protocol therapy.  Patients will also be withdrawn from study for 
the following reasons:  
1. Disease Progression: Any patient with disease progression should be removed from study.  
Details and tumor measurements should be documented on flow sheets.  
2. Patient is unable to tolerate the toxicity resulting from the study treatment, even with optimal 
supportive care, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_101401]. Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the 
investigator, may cause severe or permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug.

• Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects  
• Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group)  
• Increases in the number of invasive procedures  
• Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken by [CONTACT_886233].  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt to be 
necessary by [CONTACT_886234]. Amendments affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol amendments or IRB approval but the IRB must be kept informed of such administrative changes.  
• Changes in the staff used to monitor trials (Celgene considers a change in Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_886220]- site(s) to be substantial and requires Celgene approval prior to 
implementation)  
 
15.0 DATA MONITORING / QUALITY ASSURANCE/ RECORD RETENTION 
15.1 Good Clinical Practice:  The study will be conducted in accordance w ith the International

16.0 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARDS  
All trials initiated by [CONTACT_101448] (BrUOG) are subject to oversight 
by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB).   This board meets two times per year with any additional 
meetings scheduled when needed.  The responsibilities are as follows:  
• Familiarize themselves with the research protocol (s)  
• The DSMB reviews trial performance information such as accrual informatio n.   
• Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries to determine 
whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be 
terminated based on these data.   
• The DSMB also determines whether and to whom outcome results should be released prior to the 
reporting of study results. 
• All adverse events are reviewed by [CONTACT_942], with assurances that these have been in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs.  
• Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be changed or terminated.  
• Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_101404], incr easing 
target sample size).  
• Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written information concerning findings for the trial as a whole related to cumulative toxicities observed and any relevant recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
 
The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant recommendations to 
the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s.   
 17.0 STATISTICS 
Sample Size and Statistical Design: 
The primary goal is to evaluate the activity of FOLFOX -A for the treatment of locally adv anced pancreatic 
cancer.  Activity will be defined as a complete or partial response.   We hypothesize that FOLFOX -A would 
achieve a response rate of at least 40%. A  response rate of <20% would not be considered worthy of future

 (where the true response probability is denoted as p, an uninteresting level of probability is denoted as p 0 
and the desirable target level as p 1): 
A Simon ’s optimal  two-stage design will be used in this study. The first [ADDRESS_1240081] stage. The trial wil l be terminated early for futility if 5 or fewer responses 
are observed in these patients, and it will be concluded that the true response rate is unlikely to be >  40%.

You are being asked to take part in a research study.  All research studies at <INSERT 
HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]> follow the rules of the state of <INSERT STATE> , the [LOCATION_002] 
government and <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]> .  Before you decide whether to be in the study, 
you and the researcher will engage in the “informed consent” process.   During this process, the 
researcher will explain the purpose of the study, how it will be carried out, and what you will be 
expected to do if you participate.  The researcher will also explain the possible risks and benefits of being in the study, and will provide other information.  You should feel free to ask any questions you might have.  The purpose of these discussions is for you to decide whether 
participating in the study is the best decision for you. 
 If you decide to be in the study, you will be asked to sign and date this form in front of the person who explained the study to you.  This form summarizes the information you discussed.  
You will be given a copy of this form to keep.   
Nature and Purpose of the Study      
Your doctors are participating in this research study with the Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_774560], in collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will 
serve as the central coordinating office for the study.  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have recently been diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer . This means that your cancer has not spread to other organs in 
your body but it either can’t be removed by [CONTACT_886235]. A standard treatment for your cancer is called FOLFIRINOX using 
FDA approved chemotherapy drugs: fluorouracil, leucovori n, oxaliplatin and irinotecan). In this 
study you will receive the chemotherapy treatment FOLFOX -A (fluorouracil, leucovorin, 
oxaliplatin  and Abraxane ® ), removing irinotecan  and using Abraxane ®  instead . Even though 
Abraxane is FDA approved for the treatm ent of advanced (metastatic) pancreatic cancer, the 
combination of Abraxane with the other 3 drugs is considered investigational. Your doctors are studying the activity and side effects of FOLFOX -A in locally ad vanced pancreatic cancer.  
This study is supported by [CONTACT_159475], the maker of Abraxane ® .

Explanation of Procedures   
What will happen if I take part in this r esearch study?  
If you take part in this study, you will have exams, tests and procedures to show that you can be 
in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need the following tests and procedures, 
while on the study.  They are part of regula r cancer care.  
Screening:  
• Medical history and Demographics  
• Physical examination, inclusive of weight, vitals, performance status, toxicity assessment  
• Blood tests (requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood)   
• CT scan (or MRI/PET scan) of the abdomen and chest  
• EKG ( a test to  check your heart function) prior to starting treatment  
• Pregnancy Test -Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine 
pregnancy test within 7 days prior to starting treatment 
 
During treatment:  
• Physical examination approximately  every 2 weeks , inclusive of toxicity assessment, 
performance status, weight and vitals  
• Blood tests ( requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood)  every 2 weeks  
• CT scan (or MRI /PET scan ) of the abdomen and chest approxi mately every 10 weeks  (3 
months). 
 
 FOLFOX -A is administered intravenous ly (IV) every 2 weeks (one treatment cycle is equal to 2 
weeks). These drugs are given to you through a device called a port -a-cath. A port-a- cath is a 
standard intravenous device used for chemotherapy that is implanted beneath the skin below 
your collarbone. A surgeon or radiologist will place the port-a- cath. You will sign a separate 
surgical consent for placement of the port-a-cath.   
When you re ceive FOLFOX -A treatment, you will first be given Abraxane ® over 30 minutes. 
The oxaliplatin is then administered over 2 hours. Leucovorin is either administered at the same 
time as or after the oxaliplatin and also takes about 2 hours. The fluorouracil is then given using 
a small outpatient chemotherapy pump over the next 46 hours, which is usually started in the 
chemotherapy clinic and continued at home. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_886224]

next scheduled treatment, your treatment may be delayed. After approximately 5 treatments (10 
weeks), you will have another CT scan of your abdomen to see if your cancer is shrinking; if the cancer is growing or has spread to other organs the treatment will be stopped and you will be 
taken off of this study.  
You will receive FOLFOX -A for 10 treatments (20 weeks or approximately 5 months ) as long as 
your cancer does not grow or spread during the treatments  and you do not have such severe side 
effects from FOLFOX -A that the treatments have to be stopped early. After completion of 
FOLFOX -A, your doctors will discuss with you whether you will receive radiation treatments to 
the pancreas or whether they think it would be better to attempt to do surgery to remove your 
cancer.  
Off study/study completio n: 
• Physical examination at the time of study completion inclusive of toxicity assessment, 
performance status, weight and vitals and then approximately 30 days later, a physical exam inclusive of toxicity assessment, performance status, and weight  
• Blood te sts (requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood) at study completion  
• CT scan (or MRI/PET scan) of the abdomen and chest at study completion, if not done in the prior 2 months 
 
Follow-up: If you finish the [ADDRESS_1240087] scan (or MRI/PET scan) of the abdomen and chest  approximately every 4 months  for a year, then every 6 months for another year, then once a 
year. These scans will stop if your cancer progresses.  
All patients (whether you complete the treatment or not) will be followed approximately every 4 
months for up to 5 years for survival.  
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98358].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.

Risk of Seconda ry Cancers or Leukemia: The chemotherapy drugs oxaliplatin, fluorouracil or 
Abraxane ®  may increase the risk of other cancers or leukemia (a blood cancer).  
 
Reproductive Risks  
Chemotherapy may decrease the sperm count. This is usually temporary but is infrequently permanent, which would result in sterility. Because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby, you should not become pregnant while on this study. Ask your study doctor for more information regarding preventing pregnancy during the study treatments. You should not nurse your baby [CONTACT_56035]. If you are premenopausal, your periods are likely to stop temporarily and may stop permanently due to the study treatments, which may lead to symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, and the inability to become pregnant, which may be permanent. If you are concerned about this, ask your study doctor about options for preserving your reproductive choices, which may include referral to a specialist in this field.   
Females:  Abraxane ®  ( paclitaxel albumin) can cause harm to an unborn child if given to a 
pregnant woman.  You cannot take part in this study if you are pregnant or breast- feeding.  
Because of the possible risks to an unborn child, if you are a female who can become pregnant, 
you will be asked to take a pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_1240091].  If this happens, your participation in this study will be discontinued (stopped).  If you become pregnant within [ADDRESS_1240092].  The study doctor will follow  you and your pregnancy to birth.   
Males:  If you have a partner of childbearing age, you must agree to use a medical doctor-
approved form of contraception throughout the study, and should avoid fathering a child for [ADDRESS_1240093].

vomiting may cause drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, headache, restlessness, 
agitation, anxiety, dizziness, involuntary tremors, skin rash, and possible allergic reaction. 
You will receive pre-medication to reduce the risk of infusion/injection reactions on your 
treatment days. Overall, the pre- medications you wi ll be given are well tolerated.  
 Venipunct ure (inserting a needle into a vein to obtain blood or give medication): May cause 
inflammation, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection. 
When you receive chemotherapy by [CONTACT_59570], there is a slight risk that some of the drug may leak out 
around the needle at the injection site. A skin burn may result. Most skin burns are treatable and heal well.  
In order to monitor the side effects, and as part of standard of care, your physician will examine 
you frequently and obtain laboratory tests (blood tests, chest x- rays, or CT scans as needed) to 
determine the effects of your treatment and alter the drug dosages if necessary.  
There may be other side effects that have not been reported. If you have any unusual symptoms, you should report them immediately to your doctor or nurse.  
Benefits  
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. While doctors hope that FOLFOX -A will be active against pancreatic cancer and the side effects are not too severe, this 
is not yet known. We do know that the information fr om this study will help doctors learn more 
about these drugs as a treatment for cancer. This information could help future cancer patients. 
Alternative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_774538] I have if I do not take part in this study?  
• Receiving radiation therapy  alone  
• Receiving radiation therapy with the chemotherapy drug capecitabine.  
• You should discuss with your doctor whether there is the possibility of surgery at this time 
without first receiving chemotherapy or radiation.  
• Getting treatment or care for your c ancer without being in a study  such as receiving the 
chemotherapy drug gemcitabine or combinations of chemotherapy such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX  
• Taking part in another study 
• Getting no treatment  
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care. This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems, and other problems caused by [CONTACT_62565]. It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel. Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.

Refusal/Withdrawal 
It is up to you whether you want to be in the study.  You are not required to enroll or participate.  
If you decide to participate, you can always change your mind and quit at any time.  If you decide not to be in the study, or if you quit later, you will still be able to get the standard of care health care services you normally get.  If you join, but later on the researcher or your doctor feels 
being in the study is no longer good for you, they may choose to take you out of the study before 
it is over.  If new information becomes available that might change your mind about whether you 
want to stay in the study the researcher will share this information with you as soon as possible.  It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_101410].  Another reason to tell your doctor 
that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  
If you make the decision to withdraw from this study (stop taking study medication) for any 
reason, tell your doctor immediately. You will be asked to sign a form indicating whether you give your permission for your doctor and the research staff to continue to collect and submit follow-up information on your health status from your physicians and medical record. After 
signing the form, you still have the right to change your mind, at any time, regarding follow-up 
after withdrawal.  
Medical Treatment/Payment in Case of Injury  
A research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by [CONTACT_98690]. If you 
are injured by a medical treatment or procedure y ou would have received even if you were not in 
the study that is not a research injury. To help avoid research injury and added medical expenses, it is very important to follow all study directions carefully. If you do experience a research injury, <INSERT  HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]>  or the study doctor can arrange medical treatment for 
you. Such treatment will be paid for as described below.   Medical treatment will be available if you suffer a research related injury; however, you and/or your health insurance company will be charged for this treatment. The study will not pay for this 
medical treatment. Neither [CONTACT_774561], the sponsor of the study, nor BrUOG, the coordinating center, have money set aside to reimburse you for medical bills from treatment of a research related injury or otherwise compensate you in the event of a study-related injury.   If you have insurance and have a research injury that is not covered by [CONTACT_1758], it is possible that some or all of the cost of treating you could be billed to your insurer. If your health insurance will not cover such costs, it is possible you would have to pay out of pocket. In some cases, <INSERT HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_101405]>  might be able to help you pay if you qualify for free care

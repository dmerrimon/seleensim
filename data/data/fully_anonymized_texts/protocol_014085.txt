[Previously Allergen Research Corporation (ARC)] 
Number of Subjects Up to approximately 50 peanut-allergic subjects who complete ARC001 and 
consent to participate in ARC002 will be enrolled 
Objective The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of AR101 
[Characterized Peanut Allergen (CPNA)] when used in an oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) paradigm over an extended period ( 18 months) in 
peanut-allergic children and young adults who initiated OIT between the ages 
of 4 to 26 years, inclusive. 
The secondary objectives are: 
To confirm and extend prior observations from ARC001 on the efficacy 
of Characterized Peanut Allergen in OIT, as assessed through reduction in 
clinical reactivity to limited amounts of peanut allergen. Specifically: 
oTo assess the efficacy of OIT in inducing desensitization of allergic 
responses to peanut in the former placebo subjects from ARC001 
(Group 1) challenged with peanut flour in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) after approximately 
6 months of open-label treatment.  
oTo assess the efficacy of OIT in sustaining and/or enhancing 
desensitization of allergic responses to peanut in the former active 
AR101 (CPNA) treatment subjects from ARC001 (Group 2) and the 
former placebo subjects from ARC001 (Group 1) challenged with 
peanut flour in a DBPCFC after approximately 3 additional months 
of open-label treatment.  To evaluate the immunological effects of peanut OIT 
To determine the time course of tolerated up-dosing 
To evaluate safety based on physician global assessment of disease 
activity 
The exploratory objective is to assess a higher degree of desensitization, based 
on an Open-label Food Challenge (OFC) up to a cumulative dose of 4043 mg 
of total peanut protein.  Study Design This is a multi-center, open-label, follow-on study to gather additional 
information on the safety and tolerability of oral desensitization with AR101 
(CPNA) in the subjects who participated in ARC001.  
Group 1: 
Subjects who complete the placebo arm of ARC001 and consent to enroll in 
ARC002 (Group 1) will cross over to active treatment using the same dosing 
regimen used in ARC001, but in open-label fashion.  They will undergo a 2- 
to 3-day Initial Escalation Phase, followed by [CONTACT_149713] 6-month (20- 
to 36-week) Low-dose Buildup Phase to 300 mg/d of peanut protein.  They 
will maintain dosing at 300 mg/d for the last 2 weeks of this phase.  After 
completion of the Low-dose Buildup Phase, Group 1 subjects will undergo a > -

Immunotherapy (OIT) Safety Follow-On Study 
DBPCFC (to a maximum of 600 mg of peanut protein).  Subjects who fail to 
tolerate the post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC at  300 mg will be 
considered escalation failures and will be discontinued from the study for 
safety considerations.   
Those subjects who tolerate the DBPCFC at  300 mg of peanut protein will 
enter an approximately 3-month (12- to 24-week) Plateau Phase of continued 
dosing at 300 mg/d.  Following completion of the ~3-month Plateau Phase, 
Group [ADDRESS_628476]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC (to a maximum 
of 1000 mg of peanut protein).  Subjects who fail to tolerate the post-Plateau 
Phase DBPCFC at  [ADDRESS_628477]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC 
Plateau Phase to a total of 24 weeks and undergo a repeat DBPCFC (See 
Section 3.2.5  for details). 
Subjects who tolerate the DBPCFC at  300 mg of peanut protein will be 
given the option to increase further their daily dose of AR101 (CPNA) in an 
duration.  During this phase, the dose of peanut protein will be gradually 
increased at intervals of approximately 2 weeks to a target maximum of 
tolerated dose (MTD), is achieved, subjects in Group 1 will continue in an 
Extended Maintenance Phase with AR101 (CPNA) until the Study Exit visit.  
Subjects who elect not to escalate their daily dose of AR101 (CPNA) above 
300 mg of peanut protein will enter directly into the Extended Maintenance 
Phase.   
Group 2: 
Subjects who complete the active AR101 (CPNA) therapy arm of ARC001 
and consent to enroll in ARC002 (Group 2) will enter directly into the 
300 mg/d, ~3-month Plateau Phase of ARC002.  That is, they will forego the 
ARC002 Initial Escalation Phase, Low-dose Buildup Phase, and 
post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC, having completed these in ARC001.  
The procedures followed for Group [ADDRESS_628478] the option to undergo an OFC to a maximum cumulative dose 
of 4043 mg of peanut protein.  Regardless of completion of the exit OFC, 
subjects will be offered continued treatment in a rollover trial ARC008. 
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the study for safety. Study Duration Subjects in Group 1 are expected to reach the Extended Maintenance Phase in 
approximately 36 weeks (but possibly as long as 90 weeks if dose adjustments 
are required); subjects in Group 2 are expected to reach the Extended 
Maintenance Phase in approximately 12 weeks (but possibly as long as 
54 weeks if dose adjustments are required).  Subjects may continue to 
participate in ARC002 after reaching the Extended Maintenance Phase where 
they will continue treatment with AR101 (CPNA) until the Study Exit visit, 
when they will have the option to undergo an OFC to a maximum cumulative 2'.

Treatment Description All subjects will receive daily oral dosing of peanut OIT in the form of AR101 
(CPNA).   
All escalation doses will occur in a Clinical Research Center (CRC) or 
monitored clinic setting under direct observation. 
Group 1 (former ARC001 placebo subjects) only: 
Initial Escalation Phase (2 or 3 days): Eligible Group [ADDRESS_628483] tolerated dose (not 
exceeding 6 mg) over the subsequent 1 or 2 days (refer to Initial Escalation 
Schedule at end of synopsis).  Therapy details are found in Section 3 and 
Section 6  of the protocol. 
Low-dose Buildup Phase (~6 months): Group 1 subjects will embark on a dose-escalation regimen, with the dose of peanut protein being gradually 
increased at intervals of approximately 2 weeks to a maximum of 300 mg/d 
(refer to Low-dose Buildup Schedule at end of synopsis).  After successfully 
escalating to a 300 mg daily dose, subjects will maintain that dose level for an 
additional 2 weeks.  Therapy details are found in Section 3 and Section 6  of 
the protocol. 
Group 1 subjects unable to achieve a dose of 300 mg/d of peanut protein by 
[ADDRESS_628484]-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC: After completing 2 weeks of dosing at 300 mg/d, Group [ADDRESS_628485]-Low-dose 
Buildup Phase DBPCFC will be performed in accordance with PRACTALL 
(PRACTical issues in ALLergology Joint [LOCATION_002]/European Union 
Initiative) guidelines, but requiring progression in an unaltered sequence 
Table 6-1  without repeating any dose.  The procedure will also be modified in 
that the top dose will be capped at 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) peanut 
protein or placebo.  
Group [ADDRESS_628486]-Low-dose Buildup DBPCFC at 
the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) protein level with no, or only mild, 
symptoms will be considered escalation failures, will not be eligible to 
proceed to the ~3-month Plateau Phase, and will be discontinued from the 
study.   
Group 1 and Group 2: Plateau Phase (~3 months): Eligible subjects (Group 1 and Group 2) will 
receive peanut OIT at a daily dose of 300 mg of peanut protein for about 
3 months (although the period may be extended to as long as 24 weeks on an 
individual basis if dose adjustments are required).   •

Title Oral Desensitization to Peanut in Peanut-Allergic Children and Adults 
using Characterized Peanut Allergen (CPNA) Peanut Oral 
Immunotherapy (OIT) Safety Follow-On Study 
Post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC: Following the Plateau Phase, subjects will 
undergo a post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC, performed in the same manner as the 
post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC, but with escalation capped at 
1000 mg (2043 mg cumulative) of peanut protein or placebo.     
Optional High-dose Buildup Phase (approximately 10 to 30 weeks): 
Supplemental informed consent (and assent, as age appropriate) will be 
obtained from subjects (or parent/guardian, as age appropriate) prior to 
entering the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase.   
Subjects who do not consent to the Optional High-Dose Buildup Phase will 
enter directly into the Extended Maintenance Phase where they will continue 
to receive daily OIT dosing with 300 mg of peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA) 
for the duration of the study. 
Subjects who do consent to the Optional High-Dose Buildup Phase will embark on a dose-escalation regimen, starting at a dose based on the highest 
dose tolerated in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC.  They will return to the 
CRC on the day after the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC to confirm the 
tolerability of the highest dose tolerated in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC.  
They will then continue at this dose level with daily home-dosing for 2 weeks.  
Thereafter, doses will be gradually increased at intervals of approximately 
2 weeks to a target maximum of 2000 mg/d of peanut protein (refer to 
High-dose Buildup Schedule at end of synopsis).  Escalation to each new dose 
level will be conducted under direct observation in the CRC.  Therapy details 
are found in Section 3 and Section 6  of the protocol.  
Extended Maintenance Phase:  Subjects who do not consent to the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase will enter directly into the Extended Maintenance 
Phase and continue dosing at 300 mg/d.  Subjects who do consent to the 
Optional High-dose Buildup Phase will enter the Extended Maintenance 
until the Study Exit visit. 
Upon IRB approval of Protocol ARC008 and at the time of IRB approval of 
Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_628488] the option to undergo an OFC to a maximum cumulative dose 
of 4043 mg of peanut protein.  Regardless of completion of the exit OFC,

of the patient/family in the acute management of an allergic reaction.  The burden of avoidance 
and constant fear of accidental exposure negatively affects the health-related quality of life for 
both subjects and their families.1,2,[ADDRESS_628510] avoidance diets can be complicated due to difficulty 
in interpreting food labels4 and by [CONTACT_489130].5,6Accidental ingestions are unfortunately common, with up to 
50% of food-allergic patients having at least one allergic reaction over a two-year period.7
Allergic reactions to peanut can be severe and life-threatening; and peanut and/or tree nut 
allergies account for the vast majority of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis.[ADDRESS_628511] avoidance diets, the high incidence of accidental exposures, and the risk of severe or even 
fatal reactions with accidental exposures adds a tremendous burden and stress on patients and 
their families.    
Specific immunotherapy for food allergy, in particular for peanut allergy, in the forms of oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy, has been studied in recent years and has 
demonstrated encouraging safety and efficacy results in early clinical trials, including beneficial 
immunologic changes.9-[ADDRESS_628512] with peanut allergy from an 
accidental exposure to a small amount of peanut protein while maintaining a peanut-avoidant 
diet.  Protection to a whole peanut, approximately 250 mg of peanut protein (measured as 
500 mg of peanut flour), would afford a meaningful level of clinical protection against accidental 
exposure to peanut protein, since accidental exposures are typi[INVESTIGATOR_489094].[ADDRESS_628513] 2017 In addition, peanut OIT has been administered under IND (Investigational New Drug 
Application) at Duke and Arkansas and under a separate IND at Stanford.  A total of 44 cases 
from Duke/Arkansas were analyzed and [ADDRESS_628514].  Efficacy was demonstrated in 
26 cases (17 active and 9 placebo) matching the published information. Sixteen out of 17 active 
subjects were escalated to a dose between 2400 and 4000 mg over a year.  Oral food challenge 
results were significantly better for the active treatment group than the placebo group where both 
groups tolerated a mean of 12 mg of peanut protein at baseline, while at one year the mean for 
the active treatment group was 5000 mg of protein and for the placebo Group 180 mg of peanut 
protein (P < 0.[ADDRESS_628515]).15  
Dosing symptoms were typi[INVESTIGATOR_393211], wheezing, rhinorrhea, sneezing, 
itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Symptoms were noted in both the active 
treatment and the placebo group.  Of the 39 cases on active treatment, 4 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 2 during double-blind, placebo controlled food 
challenges (DBPCFCs).  The Stanford data reported on 14 subjects who were dosed with peanut 
OIT; the severity and rate of dosing symptoms were similar to those reported in the 
Duke/Arkansas data. 
These published findings, along with the additional clinical data, are the basis for a Phase II trial 
to investigate peanut OIT for efficacy and safety in desensitizing peanut-allergic subjects.  
Protocol ARC001 was designed to be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study establishing the 
efficacy of AR101 (CPNA)for conducting oral immunotherapy.  Protocol ARC002 is an 
open-label protocol designed to demonstrate the safety of daily dosing with AR101 (CPNA) for 
an extended period ( 18 months), to confirm unblinded the efficacy of OIT with AR101 
(CPNA)  at a dose of 300 mg/d of peanut protein in the former ARC001 placebo population, to 
provide an option to explore unblinded the safety and tolerability of AR101 (CPNA)  doses as 
high as [ADDRESS_628516] been 
achieved by [CONTACT_1766]. 
1.3 Rationale for Selection of Study Population 
The primary objective of the ARC002 study is to assess the safety and tolerability of AR101 
(CPNA)  when used in an OIT paradigm over an extended period ( 18 months) in 
peanut-allergic children and young adults.  The main secondary objective is to confirm and 
extend prior observations from ARC001 on the efficacy of AR101 (CPNA)in OIT.  To achieve 
these objectives, the study will enroll up to approximately 50 subjects with a history of allergy to 
peanuts or peanut-containing foods who successfully completed the ARC001 study.  Subjects 
who did not successfully complete ARC001, either because of early discontinuation (regardless 
of treatment assignment), or who were unable to tolerate with no or mild symptoms 300 mg of

be excluded from enrolling in ARC002 for safety considerations.     
1.4 Rationale for Selection of Study Drug Regimen 
The rationale for dosing builds on the work of the Consortium of Food Allergy Research 
(CoFAR) and its investigators and follows the same dosing strategy used in ARC001.  In 
ARC001, the dosing consisted of a single-day initial escalation at very low doses, followed by a 
buildup phase of dose escalation, with a dose-escalation occurring every 2 weeks.  This approach 
was demonstrated to be well-tolerated and efficacious in previous studies and will be used in this 
current trial.24 For the subjects rolling over to ARC002 from the placebo arm of ARC001 (Group 
1 subjects), the same dosing regimen used in the active treatment arm of ARC001 will be 
employed at the start of ARC002, but in an open-label fashion.  This regimen consists of an 
Initial Escalation Phase, a Low-dose Buildup Phase, and a DBPCFC to 600 mg of peanut protein.  
Following the same procedures (with the exception of blinding) as used for the active treatment 
arm in ARC001 will permit confirmation of key findings from ARC001 in a second cohort of 
subjects.   
After successful completion of the Initial Escalation Phase, Low-dose Buildup Phase, and 
post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC to 600 mg of peanut protein, Group 1 subjects will enter 
into an approximately 3-month Plateau Phase, wherein the daily dose of AR101 (CPNA)  peanut 
protein will remain at 300 mg.  Subjects rolling over to ARC002 from the active treatment arm 
of ARC001 (Group 2 subjects) will not repeat the Initial Escalation Phase, Low-dose Buildup 
Phase, and post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC, which were already undertaken in ARC001, 
but instead will enter directly into the ~3-month Plateau Phase.  The Plateau Phase will permit 
assessment of the tolerability of the [ADDRESS_628518]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC, information as to whether the level of 
desensitization might improve with continued daily exposure to sub-gram quantities of peanut 
protein will be gained.  At present, the role of protracted exposure to relatively low (sub-gram) 
quantities of peanut protein in promoting desensitization cannot be ascertained from the medical 
literature with any degree of certainty, neither in terms of duration nor dose.  Maintenance 
phases reported for OIT procedures have varied in duration from a few weeks to more than 
7 years; and maintenance doses have ranged from 300 to 8000 mg.15,19,20,25-27 For those studies 
reporting oral food challenges after a maintenance phase, the range in maintenance dose has been 
from 300 to 4000 mg, and the range in durations has been from 6 weeks to 22 months.15,19,20,25,26  
After successful completion of the 3- to 6-month 300 mg/d Plateau Phase and DBPCFC, all 
subjects (Group 1 and Group 2) will be given the option to increase their daily dose of AR101 
(CPNA)  peanut protein incrementally to a target maximum of 2000 mg/d, by [CONTACT_489131]-dose Buildup Phase.  The procedures to be followed during this optional phase 
adhere to the same principles as for the Low-dose Buildup Phase and are consistent with those 
advanced by [CONTACT_489132].  Subjects who do not consent to the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase 
will enter directly into the Extended Maintenance Phase.   
Allowing for a high-dose option is considered important, as the optimal dose of peanut protein 
for maintaining desensitization remains unknown.  Moreover, there may, in fact, be no single 
optimal dose for maintaining desensitization, as desensitization is not an absolute, but rather a 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628519] higher levels of accidental exposure; thus, it may be of value to offer 
peanut-allergic patients more than one OIT dosing option.  The Optional High-dose Buildup 
Phase will provide basic safety and tolerability information that will lay the groundwork for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a high-dose treatment option, should such an option be pursued. 
Following the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase, both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects will enter 
an Extended Maintenance Phase, wherein they will continue to take their maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD), up to 2000 mg/d, until the Study Exit visit whenthey will have the option to 
undergo an OFC to a maximum cumulative dose of [ADDRESS_628520] been 
achieved. 
1.5 Rationale for the Dose Used for the DBPCFC 
The study DBPCFCs will be conducted in accordance with the recommended PRACTALL 
(Practical Issues in Allergology, Joint [LOCATION_002]/European Union Initiative) consensus 
guidelines,28 although the DBPCFC performed after the Low-dose Buildup Phase in Group 1 
(former ARC001 placebo) subjects will not go above a 600 mg (1043 mg cumulative) dose to 
help ensure patient safety.  This DBPCFC will assess protection against slightly more than 1 ein, 300 mg (443 mg cumulative dose), inasmuch as accidental 
exposures typi[INVESTIGATOR_393214].  Group 1 subjects who fail to tolerate 
with no or mild symptoms the 300 mg dose will not progress further in the DBPCFC and will 
undergo early termination from the study.  To assess further desensitization, patients tolerating 
the 300 mg (443 mg cumulative) incremental dose in the DBPCFC will also be challenged with a 
600 mg dose (cumulative 1043 mg).  They will not receive the 3000 mg dose (4443 mg 
cumulative) outlined in the PRACTALL guidance, since at this point they will have been 
up-dosed only to the [ADDRESS_628521] 2 weeks. 
The DBPCFC performed after the ~3-month, 300 mg/d, Plateau Phase in all subjects (both 
Group 1 and Group 2) will also assesspeanut protein, i.e., 300 mg (443 mg cumulative dose).  It will be of interest to observe whether a 
greater proportion of subjects tolerate the 300 mg dose with no symptoms versus mild symptoms 
in this DBPCFC as compared to the ARC001 exit (or ARC002 post-Low-dose Buildup Phase) 
DBPCFC.  By [CONTACT_489133], all subjects should 
have been tolerating a daily dose of [ADDRESS_628522]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC at 100 or 300 mg may, at continue dosing in the Plateau Phase to a total of 24 weeks and undergo a repeat DBPCFC (See 
Section 3.2.5 for details).  To assess further desensitization, patients tolerating the 300 mg 
incremental (443 mg cumulative) dose will continue the DBPCFC with a 600 mg dose 
(cumulative 1043 mg), and, if that is tolerated, a final 1000 mg dose (cumulative 2043 mg).  This 
represents a modification from PRACTALL guidelines in that a 600 mg incremental dose is peanut's worth of peanut prot 
protection against slightly more than 1 peanut's worth of 
the investigator's discretion, 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628523] been many oral immunotherapy studies performed 
using procedures and dosing similar to those proposed in this Phase 2 study.  In general, the 
safety profile has been very good across the studies, and based on those studies, approximately 
80%, 15%, and < 1% of the subjects are expected to have mild, moderate or severe symptoms, 
respectively, during some point in their dosing with the peanut OIT.  It is important to note that 
essentially all adverse events have been allergy-related, predictable, and reversible.  The major 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_489095] a single case of 
eosinophilic esophagitis, reversible upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90524]. 
The buildup and daily maintenance doses of peanut OIT may cause allergic symptoms including 
sneezing, rhinorrhea, urticaria, angioedema, flushing, flares of eczema, ocular, nasal, oral and/or 
throat pruritus, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, cough, wheezing, and/or shortness of 
breath in addition to severe anaphylaxis.  The likelihood of a subject experiencing a severe 
allergic symptom is expected to be lessened by [CONTACT_489134]101 (CPNA)and by [CONTACT_489135] a clinical setting until the 
maintenance dose is achieved. 
Oral food challenges may induce an allergic response.  Allergic reactions can be severe, 
including life-threatening allergic reactions; however, the risk of an allergic reaction is reduced 
by [CONTACT_80927] a very small amount of the food, gradually increasing the dose, 
and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_80872] a reaction.  If subjects have allergic reactions 
during the challenges, they may need oral, intramuscular, or intravenous medications, and will be 
treated per study center standard of care.  Trained personnel, including a physician, as well as 
medications and equipment (per PRACTALL recommendations and investigational site standard 
operating procedures), will be immediately available to treat any reaction.  The anticipated rate 
of serious life-threatening anaphylactic reactions would be < 0.1%. 
There may be a risk that during participation in the trial subjects may decrease their vigilance 
against accidental peanut ingestion because they believe they are protected from it.  This 
phenomenon has been reported in previous trials; and subjects in the trial and their participating 
family will be warned that they should continue to practice their usual vigilance against 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628524] 2017 accidental ingestion of peanuts or peanut-containing foods (please refer to the current AR101 
1.6.[ADDRESS_628525].  Information from this 
study may help researchers to better understand peanut allergy or to develop future tests or 
treatments to help patients with this condition.

ARC002 is a multi-center, open-label, follow-on study to gather additional information on the 
safety and tolerability of oral desensitization with AR101 (CPNA)in the subjects who 
participated in ARC001. The study design is illustrated in Figure 3-1 , Figure 3-2 , and 
Figure 3-3 . 
Group 1: 
Subjects who complete the placebo arm of ARC001 and consent to enroll in ARC002 (Group 1) 
will cross over to active treatment using the same dosing regimen used in ARC001, but in 
open-label fashion.  They will undergo a 2- to 3-day Initial Escalation Phase, followed by [CONTACT_489136] 6-month (20- to 36-week) Low-Dose Buildup Phase to 300 mg/d of peanut 
protein.  They will maintain dosing at 300 mg/d for the last 2 weeks of this phase.  After 
completion of the Low-dose Buildup Phase, Group 1 subjects will undergo a DBPCFC (to a 
maximum of 600 mg of peanut protein).  Subjects who fail to tolerate the post-Low-dose Buildup 
Phase DBPCFC at  300 mg will be considered escalation failures and will be discontinued from 
the study for safety considerations ( Figure 3-1 ).   
Those subjects who tolerate the DBPCFC at  300 mg of peanut protein will enter an 
approximately 3-month (12- to 24-week) Plateau Phase of continued dosing at 300 mg/d.  
Following completion of the ~3-month Plateau Phase, Group [ADDRESS_628527]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC (to a maximum of 1000 mg of peanut protein).  Subjects who fail to 
tolerate the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC at  30 mg will be discontinued from the study for 
safety considerations ( Figure 3-1 ).  Subjects who fail to tolerate the post-Plateau Phase 
DBPCFC at 100 or 300 mg may, at the investigato dosing in the Plateau 
Phase to a total of 24 weeks and undergo a repeat DBPCFC (See Section 3.2.5  for details). 
Subjects who tolerate the DBPCFC at  300 mg of peanut protein will be given the option to 
increase further their daily dose of AR101 (CPNA)in an Optional High-dose Buildup Phase of 
this phase, the dose of peanut protein will be 
gradually increased at intervals of approximately 2 weeks to a target maximum of 2000 mg/d.  
individual maximum tolerated dose (MTD), is 
achieved, subjects in Group [ADDRESS_628528] not to escalate their daily dose of AR101 (CPNA)  above 300 mg of peanut protein will enter directly into the Extended Maintenance Phase ( Figure 3-3) .At the end of this period, 
subjects will complete a Study Exit visit.  At this visit, subjects will be offered the option of an 
OFC to a maximum cumulative dose of 4043 mg of peanut protein.  
Group 2: 
Subjects who complete the active AR101 (CPNA)therapy arm of ARC001 and consent to enroll 
in ARC002 (Group 2) will enter directly into the 300 mg/d, ~3-month, Plateau Phase of ARC002 
(Figure 3-2 ). That is, they will forego the ARC002 Initial Escalation Phase, Low-dose Buildup 
Phase, and post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC, having completed these in ARC001.  The 
procedures followed for Group [ADDRESS_628529]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC, 
Optional High-dose Buildup Phase, and Extended Maintenance Phase will be the same as for 
Group 1 ( Figure 3-2  and Figure 3-3).  Subjects in Group 2 will also undergo a Study Exit visit >

and concomitant medical history will also be updated.  An interval medical examination will be 
performed, as well as Peak Expi[INVESTIGATOR_29330] (PEFR).
Subjects in Group 2, formerly receiving active treatment in ARC001, will enter the Plateau Phase 
during this visit.  
Subjects in Group 1, formerly receiving placebo in ARC001, will begin dosing in ARC002 
approximately 5 to 10 days after the ARC001 Exit /ARC002 Rollover Visit.   
3.2 Treatment Phases 
The ARC002 study consists of a maximum of five phases as follows: 
Initial Escalation Phase 
Low-dose Buildup Phase 
Plateau Phase 
Optional High-dose Buildup Phase 
Extended Maintenance Phase 
The former ARC001 placebo subjects (Group 1) will complete all five phases.  The former 
ARC001 active AR101 (CPNA)  treatment subjects (Group 2) will complete the last three. 
For the former ARC001 placebo subjects (Group 1), treatment will comprise an Initial Escalation 
Phase (2 to 3 days), an ~6-month Low-dose Buildup Phase (20-36 weeks), an ~3-month Plateau 
Phase (12-24 weeks), an Optional High-dose Buildup Phase (10-30 weeks), and an Extended 
Maintenance Phase.  The durations of the phases are described in terms of ranges or approximate 
lengths of time to allow for subjects who may require their dose-level to be held or reduced 
(within protocol-defined limits) during a particular phase of the study. 
DBPCFCs will be performed at the end of the Low-dose Buildup Phase, at the end of the 
~3-month Plateau Phase, and an optional OFC will be conducted at the end of the Extended 
Maintenance Phase (Study Exit visit). 
Former ARC001 active AR101 (CPNA)treatment subjects (Group 2), will enter directly into the 
~3-month Plateau Phase, followed by [CONTACT_7620]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC, the Optional High-dose 
Buildup Phase (10-30 weeks), and the Extended Maintenance Phase.

3.2.4 Plateau Phase (Group 1 and Group 2) 
Eligible subjects from both Groups 1 and 2 will receive OIT at a dose of 300 mg/d of peanut 
protein for about 3 months (12 weeks).  The Plateau Phase may, however, be extended to a 
maximum of 6 months (24 weeks) if dose-reduction and re-escalation is required during this 
phase.   
3.2.[ADDRESS_628551]-Plateau Phase DBPCFC (Group 1 and Group 2) 
After ~3 months of peanut OIT at 300 mg/d, all subjects will undergo a DBPCFC.  The 
post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC will be performed in accordance with PRACTALL guidelines in 
the same manner as the post-Low-dose Buildup Phase DBPCFC, except that a 600 mg dose will 
be added to the escalation sequence and escalation will be capped at 1000 mg (2043 mg

3.2.6 Optional High-dose Buildup Phase (Group 1 and Group 2)  
Supplemental informed consent (and assent, as age appropriate) will be obtained from subjects 
(or parent/guardian) prior to entering the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase.   
Subjects who do not consent to the Optional High-Dose Buildup Phase will enter directly into the Extended Maintenance Phase and continue to receive daily OIT dosing with 300 mg of 
peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA)for the duration of the study in the Extended Maintenance 
Phase. 
Subjects who do consent to the Optional High-Dose Buildup Phase will embark on a dose-escalation regimen, based on the highest dose tolerated in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC 
(see Figure 6-1 ).  They will return to the CRC on the day after the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC 
to confirm the tolerability of the highest dose tolerated in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC.  They 
will then continue at this dose level with daily home-dosing for 2 weeks.  Thereafter, doses will 
be gradually increased at intervals of approximately 2 weeks to a target maximum of 2000 mg/d 
of peanut protein (refer to High-dose Buildup Schedule in Table 3-3 , below).  Escalation to each 
new dose level will be conducted under direct observation in the CRC.    <

encouraged to continue their participation in follow-up safety assessments.  If a subject fails to 
return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine the reason. 
4.3.2 Follow-up of Subjects Who Discontinue Treatment 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will be monitored for safety for approximately 
an additional 14 days from the time of cessation of dosing, if possible, and should return for an 
Early Termination visit at that time (see Section 6.3.17 ). 
5. Study Medication 
5.[ADDRESS_628561] is AR101 [Characterized Peanut Allergen (CPNA)] in the form of 
peanut flour formulated with a bulking agent and a flow agent in pre-measured graduated doses 
comprising break-apart capsules containing 0.5, 1.0, 10, 100, and 475 mg each of peanut protein 
for administering doses of up to 2000 mg, inclusive.  For doses  1000 mg, and for 300 mg 
dosing during the Extended Maintenance Phase, AR101 (CPNA) may alternatively be provided 
in foil sachets during the High-dose Buildup and Extended Maintenance Phases.  Study product 
is characterized with a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprint and specific 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) performed against key allergenic proteins to 
demonstrate stability and lot-to-lot comparability. 
All study products will be packaged and labeled at the central manufacturer.  The products will 
then be shipped to a drug depot where they will be labeled and inventoried for shipment to the 
clinical sites.  Study products will be shipped by [CONTACT_489138].  A clinical site pharmacist will dispense study products to 
the investigational site staff in a manner consistent with the current dose level.

with the vehicle food. 
Subjects will receive at their clinic visits a set of capsules to be taken at home according to their 
specific dose level.  The subjects should be instructed to document capsules and sachets taken at 
home using diary logs and bring all unused capsules and sachets back to the clinic at every visit. 
Subjects should withhold their daily home dose on an in-clinic dosing day but should take all 
other prescribed medications.  Note that the daily home dose should be taken as part of a meal.  
It is recommended that the dose be taken at a consistent time (within a 4-hour time period), and it 
is critical to take the dose every day.  Doses should be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 12 h.   
5.3 Drug Accountability 
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the investigator is required 
to maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational agent, including the date 
and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispensed (subject-by-subject 
accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or deliberately destroyed. 
Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A 
drug-dispensing log will be kept current for each subject.  This log will contain the identification 
of each subject and the date and quantity of drug dispensed. 
All records regarding the disposition of the investigational product will be available for 
inspection by [CONTACT_93243]. 
5.4 Assessment of Compliance with Study Treatment and Monitoring daily dosing and any reaction to at-home dosing 
on diary logs.  Central monitoring of compliance will be performed.  Subjects/families will be 
provided with 24-h emergency contact [CONTACT_489139]. 
All unused study medication and diary logs should be brought back to the clinic with each visit 
for reconciliation of remaining capsules.  
5.5 Modification of Study Treatment  
As described in the protocol ( Section 6.6 ), peanut OIT doses may be adjusted by [CONTACT_489140].  If such a dose modification The subject or subject's family will document

6.3.8 All Subjects (Groups 1 and 2): Optional High-dose Buildup Phase 
Initiation Visit 
The Optional High-dose Buildup Phase Initiation Visit is to occur on the day following the 
post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC (End of Plateau Phase Visit).  The visit is intended to confirm the 
safety of the starting dose for the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase.  Based on the outcome of 
the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC, subjects will target a starting dose for the Optional High-dose 
Buildup Phase of either 400 mg, 575 mg, or 950 mg (see Figure 6-1 ).   •

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628595] 2017 If the target starting dose for the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase is tolerated, subjects will 
continue daily home dosing at that dose level and undergo dose-escalation at their biweekly CRC 
visits according to the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase schedule  
(Table 3-3).   
If the target starting dose for the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase is not tolerated, subjects may 
return to the CRC for up to 2 additional consecutive days to establish the appropriate dose level 
for starting their individual high-dose buildup. 
Testing of the target starting doses and assignment of the subsequent dosing levels is to proceed 
as follows: Subjects whose highest tolerated dose in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC was 300 mg 
will escalate to a dose of 400 mg of peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA) in the CRC. 
oThose subjects who tolerate the 400 mg dose will receive capsules and instructions 
for daily dosing of 400 mg. 
oThose subjects who fail to tolerate the 400 mg dose are to continue home dosing at 
the 300 mg/d dose and may attempt dose escalation according to the Optional 
High-dose Buildup Phase schedule ( Table 3-3) at the next biweekly visit. Subjects whose highest tolerated dose in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC was 600 mg 
will confirm tolerability at a 575 mg dose of peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA)  in the 
CRC. 
oThose subjects who are confirmed to tolerate a 575 mg dose will receive capsules and 
instructions for daily dosing of 575 mg. 
oThose subjects who fail to tolerate the 575 mg dose may return to the CRC the 
following day (Day 2) to be tested with a [ADDRESS_628596] will 
receive capsules and instructions for daily dosing of 400 mg; if not tolerated, the 
subject is to continue home dosing at the 300 mg/d dose.  In either case, dose 
escalation may be attempted according to the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase 
schedule ( Table 3-3) at the next biweekly visit. Subjects whose highest tolerated dose in the post-Plateau Phase DBPCFC was 1000 mg 
will confirm tolerability at a 950 mg dose of peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA)  in the 
CRC. 
oThose subjects who are confirmed to tolerate a 950 mg dose mg will receive capsules 
and instructions for daily dosing of 950 mg.

Up-dosing Visits  
The Optional High-dose Buildup Phase will last for approximately 10 to 30 weeks with subjects 
returning to the CRC every 2 weeks for up-dosing to a target maximum of 2000 mg/d.  Subjects 
will proceed with dose escalation according to the Optional High-dose Buildup Schedule 
(Table 3-3), continuing on from the point at which they entered the schedule.  Subjects should 
not take their daily maintenance dose on the day of clinic visit.

Subjects who require dose reduction during the 2-week period will reset their 2-week escalation 
schedule to maintain the new dose for a 2-week period prior to attempting to escalate again.  Any 
dose escalation attempts may be postponed for 1-2 extra weeks based on clinical judgment.  If 
escalation is not successful by 4 weeks, the dose level that is tolerated will be considered the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD); escalation will be delayed further in the event that epi[INVESTIGATOR_489102], as defined in Section 6.6 .   
Subjects who fail to successfully re-escalate for three consecutive attempts should end the 
Optional High-dose Buildup Phase and enter the Extended Maintenance Phase; the tolerated dose 
level should be maintained as the new MTD for the duration of the Extended Maintenance Phase.  
The exception to this is if, after three consecutive attempts, the subject is unable to re-escalate to 
a minimum dose of 300 mg/d, the subject should be considered unable to tolerate 300 mg of 
peanut protein as AR101 (CPNA), discontinued from the study, and asked to return to the CRC 
[ADDRESS_628604] dose of AR101 (CPNA)  to undergo an Early Termination Visit (see

6.5 Other Assessments 
6.5.1 Physician Global Assessment 
A 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) will be used by [CONTACT_489151] a marker for safety. 
In assessing overall disease activity, the investigator should consider the frequency of allergic 
reactions (both observed and reported), their type, their severity, and the dose level at which they 
have occurred.  With these factors in mind, the investigator is to assign a single integrated overall 
disease activity score.  
The investigators will be asked: 
 “How would you rate the severity of the overall disease activity on a scale of 0, no disease 
activity, to 100, very severe disease activity?” 
0  100 
No 
Activity  Very 
Severe 
Investigators are permitted to refer back to previous assessments when making their VAS 
determination of overall disease activity. 
Although not validated specifically as an instrument for evaluating food allergies, the VAS is, 
nevertheless, a widely used tool in assessing disease activity, especially in inflammatory 
diseases. 
6.5.2 Exit Assessments

If moderate symptoms occur at any of the doses below 6 mg (i.e., up to and including 3 mg), 
then the desensitization protocol will be discontinued and the subject considered an escalation

The actions taken should be to discontinue the initial escalation and administer the appropriate 
rescue medications.  The desensitization protocol will be discontinued regardless of the dose at 
which the severe symptom or symptoms occurred, and the subject considered an escalation 
failure. 
Summary of Initial Escalation Phase (Group 1 only) Dosing Requirements (see also Figure 6-2 ):  
In general, if the subject requires one or two doses of antihistamine treatment for mild symptoms 
during the initial escalation protocol, then the initial escalation may be continued.  If, however, 
the subject requires a second medication (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], a beta-agonist, or other medications) 
in addition to an antihistamine, or more than [ADDRESS_628635] will receive no further OIT, regardless of whether treatment is 
instituted or what type of treatment is instituted.  The only exception to this is if the occurrence 
of moderate symptoms is restricted to the 6 mg dose.  In this case, and this case only, may testing 
be attempted the following day (Day 2 or Day 3) at a reduced dose (3 mg). 
If the initial escalation is completed with no symptoms or only mild symptoms, subjects should 
have, at a minimum, a 2-h post -dosing observation period before continuing in the study.  If the 
subject experiences moderate to severe symptoms, the observation period is to be at least 4 h, 
and up to 24 h (in an appropriate facility), based on the nature and severity of the symptoms and 
the treatment regimen required to stabilize the subject6.6.2 Reactions to Peanut OIT during Buildup Phases: Preventative and

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628636] 2017 Subjects will begin their appropriate dosing scheme in the CRC as outlined for either the 
Low-dose Buildup Phase (Group 1 only) or the Optional High-dose Buildup Phase (both Group 1 
and Group 2).  Subjects will return for a supervised dose escalation in the clinic every [ADDRESS_628637] with subjects the morning 
of the day after each dose escalation visit to assess for delayed allergic reactions.  Subjects will 
also be called 1 week after each dose escalation visit to assess for dosing compliance and dose 
reactions.   
With the occurrence of symptoms of a dose-reaction or any allergic reaction, subjects/parents (or 
guardians) are instructed to call the study site. 
Should significant systemic symptoms, which may include mild symptoms based on physician 
discretion or moderate or greater symptoms, be reported during the daily home dosing, the 
symptom/dosing algorithm will be followed (see Figure 6-3 ) to determine the best course of 
action.  The appropriate treatment will depend on the type and severity of symptoms. 
Subjects will be free from active wheezing or a flare of atopic dermatitis prior to any dose 
escalation.  Subjects will be maintained on their current dose of study product until their flare of 
asthma or atopic dermatitis resolves.   
Subjects will be cautioned against activities likely to increase reactivity (e.g., exercising or 
taking hot showers or baths within 4 h after dosing).   e reductions, ranging from a 1-step decrement 
(i.e., to the previous dose) to approximately half of the current dose level (to the nearest feasible 
whole dose), can be instituted while subjects are suffering from symptoms of an upper

For specific questions related to dosing escalation or continuation of the same dose that are not 
answered in the above protocol, the Medical Monitor will be available for questions.   
Any subject who discontinues buildup dosing due to repeated allergic reactions to the AR101 
(CPNA)  will have his/her mechanistic blood draw (refer to Section 8 ) within approximately

6.6.3 Treatment for Reactions during the Buildup Phases: Pharmacological and 
Supportive Treatments 
Treatment of individual reactions should be with an antihistamine and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], along with 
IV fluids, a beta-agonist (e.g., albuterol, by [CONTACT_107606]), oxygen, and 
glucocorticosteroids, as indicated.  Generally, for mild symptoms requiring treatment, the subject 
should receive antihistamines.  Generally, for moderate symptoms requiring treatment, the 
subjects should receive antihistamines and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_489106].  If severe anaphylaxis 
(stage 3 defined in Appendix 3 :  Anaphylaxis Staging System) occurs at any time, dose 
escalation will stop and the dose will be reduced to the last tolerated dose and the subject 
continued on that dose as long-term maintenance without further escalation. 
Antihistamines  If a subject receives antihistamines only, the dose escalation can be continued.  If symptoms 
during a build-up day require antihistamines in multiple doses (> 2) or in combination with other 
medications (except epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), there should be a dose reduction by 1-2 doses with the next 
dose given in the CRC.  If epi[INVESTIGATOR_393225], then a different course of action is to be

Dose re-escalation would occur under observation in the CRC with an escalation no 
sooner than weekly and no longer than every 4 weeks with dose increases of 1-dose level 
at each escalation.  If symptoms occur, the dosing symptom rules in the buildup phase 
would apply. Additionally; excessive missed doses due to noncompliance, i.e., [ADDRESS_628659] dispensing error, dosing may be reinitiated at approximately 25% 
of the last tolerated dose (to the nearest feasible available whole dose that is  25% of the 
last tolerated dose) if the lapse in dosing occurred during an Up-dosing Period. If the 
lapse in dosing occurred during the Plateau or Extended Maintenance Period, dosing 
ted at 50% of the last tolerated dose (to the 
nearest feasible available whole dose that is  50% of the last tolerated dose). The 
reduced dose is to be administered under supervision in the CRC. If tolerated, dose 
escalation may resume with dose increases of 1-dose level occurring no more frequently 
than weekly and no less frequently than every [ADDRESS_628660] has returned to

an allergen into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196].  Positive (histamine) and negative (saline-glycerin) controls are 
placed to establish that the response is not blocked and to determine if there is dermatographism, 
respectively.   
6.[ADDRESS_628664] adherence to the dosing schedule should be maintained:   Study visits should occur within a ±2-day window of the scheduled visit date (i.e., 2 days 
before or 2 days after the scheduled visit date) for all phases of the study up until 
Week 24 of the Extended Maintenance Phase.   
Starting at Week 24 of the Extended Maintenance Phase, the permissible window around 
study visits will be extended to 1 week before or 1 week after a planned in-clinic dosing 
visit (i.e., ±1 week).   
The Early Termination Visit is to occur [ADDRESS_628665] dose of AR101 (CPNA).  
The permissible window is (minus 3 days to plus 7 days). 
Study visits for scheduled blood draws or DBPCFC should take place within 2 weeks of 
the scheduled visit.

7. Safety Monitoring 
This section defines the types of adverse events (AEs) that should be reported and outlines the 
procedures for appropriately collecting, grading, recording and reporting them. 
7.1 Definitions for Recording of Safety Events 
All safety events observed under this protocol are recorded in the data system. Some safety 
events arising under certain defined conditions are recorded on specific eCRFs and/or specific 
reporting forms as follows.  
Accidental exposures to food allergens are recorded on a Food Allergy Epi[INVESTIGATOR_489109].  If these events result in an AE, the AE is recorded as described below.  These do 
not include protocol-specified exposures to food challenge reagents or study treatments.  
Any in-clinic dose-related symptoms will be recorded on the Dosage of Study 
Product/Reaction eCRF.  In addition, symptoms should be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_489110], as well as the severity and 
relatedness to study-product, and recorded on the AE eCRF (please refer to eCRF 
Completion Guidelines for more detail). Dose-related symptoms recorded in the subject diary, should be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_489110], as well as the severity and 
relatedness to study-product, and should be recorded on the AE eCRF (please refer to 
eCRF Completion Guidelines for more detail). 
Events occurring after a subject has signed the informed consent form that meet the 
definition of anaphylaxis ( Appendix 3 ) will be recorded in the Anaphylaxis Reaction 
eCRF.  In addition, anaphylaxis events will be recorded on the Anaphylaxis Reporting 
Form.  Events associated with any of the following must be reported within 24 hours of 
site knowledge to facilitate expedited reporting.   
oAn emergency room (ER) visit;  
oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
oMore than 2 doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_266776];  
oAssessment of the anaphylaxis as severe, as defined in Appendix 3 :  Anaphylaxis 
Staging System.  • 
• 
• 
• 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628667] 2017 Oral food challenge reactions that occur in the clinic are captured on study-specific 
eCRFs and are not reported on the AE eCRF unless the event is considered a serious 
adverse event (see below). 
AEs occurring during skin prick test should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 
Serious adverse events (whether or not related to dosing) will be recorded on an adverse 
event (AE) eCRF and a serious adverse event (SAE) form.  
7.[ADDRESS_628668] may be asked to return to the site.  A Food Allergy Epi[INVESTIGATOR_489111] a reaction 
occurs.  If the accidental food ingestion safety event meets the definition of an SAE, as defined 
below, the AE/SAE form will be completed as well.   
7.3 Definitions 
7.3.1 Adverse Event (AE) or Medical Event   
An adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in humans, whether or not considered 
drug related which occurs during the conduct of a clinical trial. Any change in clinical status, 
ECGs, routine labs, x-rays, physical examinations, etc., that is considered clinically significant 
by [CONTACT_65227].  
Suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event. A reasonable possibility implies that there is evidence that the 
drug caused the event. 
Adverse reaction is any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
7.3.2 Serious Events (Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected Adverse 
Reactions or Serious Adverse Reactions)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) including a serious suspected adverse reaction or serious adverse 
reaction as determined by [CONTACT_489153]: 
1. Death 
2. Life-threatening AE (Life-threatening means that the study subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_266764], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct

7.4 Data Monitoring Committee 
Although the safety of peanut OIT overall is well established, a Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) has been established to monitor the study for safety.  The DMC Charter has been 
adopted. 
7.5 Toxicity Grading  
The study site assigns toxicity grades to indicate the severity of adverse experiences and 
toxicities.  The CoFAR adopted usage of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v 4.0 for application in adverse event reporting and 
will likewise be used for this protocol.  The allergic reactions in this protocol are defined beyond 
the NCI-CTCAE system, and include further characterization of anaphylaxis.  Anaphylaxis is 
characterized as mild, moderate, or severe in Appendix 3 :  Anaphylaxis Staging System, 
independent of the toxicity grade associated with the event.  Toxicity grading for allergic 
reactions including anaphylaxis is modified from the NCI-CTCAE system to be more 
appropriate for this study population, and is displayed in Appendix 4 :  Allergic Reaction 
Toxicity Grading.

7.5.1 Guidelines for Determining Causality of an Adverse Event 
The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to 
study drug:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event? 
An affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction. 
7.[ADDRESS_628673]. 
Adverse events may be discovered through any of these methods: 
Observing the subject 
Questioning the subject, which should be done in an objective manner 
Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject 
Review of medical records/source documents 
Review of home dosing diary logs (provided to record symptoms between visits) 
7.6.1 Reporting Procedures 
A multi-page adverse event form will be used allowing all adverse events to be submitted 
through a single reporting mechanism.  Serious adverse events will require additional 
information reported on additional pages within the Internet data entry system.  Source • 
• 
•

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628674] identifiers redacted, can be scanned and attached to the adverse event 
form as well.  The investigator will treat subjects experiencing adverse events appropriately and 
observe them at suitable intervals until their symptoms resolve or their status stabilizes. 
7.6.2 SAE Reporting Procedures 
Serious adverse events will be recorded on the adverse event case report form (CRF).  All sites 
are obligated to report SAEs within 24 h of their occurrence and/or the sites knowledge of the 
event to the Sponsor or designee.  The following attributes will be assigned:  
Description 
Date of onset and resolution (if known when reported) 
Severity 
Assessment of relatedness to test article  
Action taken 
The site investigator will apply his/her clinical judgment to determine whether an adverse event 
is of sufficient severity to require that the subject be removed from treatment.  If necessary, an 
investigator will suspend any trial procedures and institute the necessary medical therapy to 
protect a subject from any immediate danger. 
Subsequent review by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA), the DMC, Institutional Review 
Board (IRB), or the sponsor may suspend further trial treatment or procedures at a site.  The 
study sponsor and the FDA retain the authority to suspend additional enrollment and treatments 
for the entire study as applicable. 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to what he/she perceives as an 
intolerable AE, or for any other reason.  If voluntary withdrawal is requested, the subject should 
be asked to complete an Early Termination Visit and be given appropriate care under medical 
supervision until the symptoms of any AE resolve or their condition becomes stable.

The investigator will ensure the timely dissemination of all AE information, including expedited 
reports and DMC safety reviews, to the IRB in accordance with applicable local regulations and 
guidelines. 
7.8 Other Safety Assessments 
7.8.1 Physical Examination and Vital Signs 
Physical examinations will be conducted at visits indicated in Appendix 1 :  Schedule of Events. 
Height and weight will also be recorded. Vital signs will also be assessed, including blood 
pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. 
7.8.[ADDRESS_628680]

consequence of dosing with study medication. Suspension of the study will entail refraining from 
any dose increases, but will not entail cessation of dosing unless so directed by [CONTACT_1622], or 
advised by [CONTACT_489154].  Dose escalation will not be resumed until the 
information has been discussed with FDA and the FDA either concurs with resumption of up-
dosing or directs discontinuation of the study.   
The DMC will also be continually reviewing safety data, and can also recommend, in its 
judgment, halting the study for any substantial imbalance in adverse events, apart from dosing 
symptoms.   • 
• 
• 
• 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628682] halt up-dosing and re-start with a reduced dose if more 
than four days of dosing are missed.  Fifteen or more days of missed dosing constitutes an 
individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], as does a significant number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_393237] (i.e., three 
consecutive days on at least three occasions within a 9-month period, due to noncompliance).  
For additional individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the reader is referred back to Section 4.3.1 . 
Failure to accomplish up-dosing after three attempts will result in halting further up-dosing 
attempts.  Additionally, administration of two or more doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_489116] a 
dose-related allergic reaction will result in halting further up-dosing attempts.  In either event, if 
the final tolerated dose is below 300 mg/d, then all subsequent dosing is to be discontinued.  The 
subject will be considered an escalation failure and asked to return to the CRC [ADDRESS_628683] dose of AR101 (CPNA)  to undergo an Early Termination Visit.  If the final tolerated 
dose is  [ADDRESS_628684] tolerated dose and continued long 
term without further escalation. 
8. Mechanistic Assays  
Complementary studies will be performed to measure humoral immune responses at baseline and 
at 6 months.   
Measurement of antigen-specific IgE and IgG4 levels 
SPT to peanut 
8.1 Peanut-specific Antibody 
Antigen immunotherapy has been shown to induce antigen-specific humoral responses.  The 
balance of isotypic response may play a role in allergen sensitivity (e.g., an increase of IgG/ 
IgE).  
At each of the mechanistic time points, a sample of plasma will be stored for assessment of 
peanut-specific antibody levels.  Total IgE and peanut-specific IgE and IgG4 will be measured 
using UniCAP.  Peanut-specific IgE and IgG4 blood draws will be measured at the end of the 
Low-dose Buildup Phase (Group 1 only), the end of the Plateau Phase, and the end of the High-
dose Buildup Phase.  Mechanistic studies will also be performed at 3 months and 6 months into 
the Extended Maintenance Phase, and at 6-monthly intervals thereafter.  The amount of blood to 
be drawn for IgE and IgG4 assays is determined by [CONTACT_489155].

• 
> 
Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_628685] 2017 No formal statistical testing is planned for this protocol.  Descriptive statistics will be presented 
in the following manner: 
Continuous data (i.e., age, body weight and height) will be summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_8477], standard deviation, median, and range.   
Categorical data (i.e., sex and race) will be presented as enumerations and percentages. 
For purposes of summarization, the treatment group assignments in ARC002 are based on the 
original randomized treatment assignment from ARC001.  Namely, Treatment Group 1 is former 
ARC001 placebo subjects and Treatment Group 2 is former ARC001 active subjects. Data will 
be summarized in tables for each treatment group, treatment groups combined, treatment phase 
(as defined in Section 3.2 Treatment Phases), and across all treatment phases.  Data from 
ARC001 will be combined with ARC002 and will be used to define baseline, as appropriate.

ia specified in this study protocol.  Before 
study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_489156].  Any amendments to the protocol must also be approved 
by [CONTACT_1034], DMC, IRB and submitted to the FDA before they are implemented.  Any 
amendments to the consent materials must also be approved by [CONTACT_489157]. 
11.2 Informed Consent/Assent 
The informed consent form is a means of providing information about the study to a prospective nt/guardian and allows for an informed decision about participation in 
the study.  Because the study population will be comprised of a significant percentage of 
children, parents or legal guardians will be asked to read, sign and date a consent form before a 
child enters the study, takes study drug, or undergoes any study-specific procedures.  Children 
will sign an assent as appropriate.  Consent materials for parents/guardians who do not speak or 
read English will be translated into the appropriate language.  The informed consent form will be 
reviewed to determine whether a revision is required whenever the protocol is amended.  A copy 
of the informed consent will be given to a prospective parent/guardian for review.  The attending 
physician or his/her designee, in the presence of a witness, will review the consent and answer 
questions, as well as emphasize the need to avoid allergen exposure other than to AR101 
(CPNA), and the necessity to continue exposure to AR101 (CPNA)to maintain de-sensitization.

 1.   Acute onset of an illness (min to h) with involvement of: 
Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch or flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
AND
Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor, wheeze/ bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) AND /OR
Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
2.  Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_80909] (min to h):
Skin/mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized  hives, itch/flush, swollen lips/tongue/uvula) 
Airway compromise (e.g., dyspnea, stridor wheeze/bronchospasm, hypoxia, reduced 
PEF) 
Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia, syncope, incontinence) 
Persistent  GI symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain) 
3.   Reduced BP after exposure to the allergen (min to h): 
Infants and Children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or > 30% drop in systolic BP* 
Adults: systolic BP < 90 mm Hg or > 30% drop from their baseline 
* Low systolic BP for children is defined as < 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year; less than

event satisfy one of the outcome-based definitions of SAE specified in Section 7.3.2  of the 
ARC002 Protocol, with the stipulations (denoted in italics) indicated.  These stipulations follow 
from, and are consistent with, the criteria for DMC reporting (refer to Section 7.7.2 ): 
1. No further stipulation . 
2. Life-threatening AE (Life-threatening means that the study subject was, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred.): For anaphylaxis to be considered life-threatening it should be assessed to 
have been severe, as defined in Appendix 3 and of a Grade 4 allergic reaction, as defined 
inTable A4-3  of Appendix 4 . 
3.Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]: The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489120], as, for example, might be implemented to watch for a delayed or biphasic 
reaction.

normal life functions: No further stipulation . 
5. Congenital abnormality or birth defect: No further stipulation . 
6. Important medical event that may not result in one of the above outcomes, but may 
jeopardize the health of the study subject or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event: 
oIn general, for an anaphylactic epi[INVESTIGATOR_489121] “important medical event,” it should have resulted in an emergency room 
visit, and the emergency room visit should have been associated with intensive 
therapy. What constitutes intensive therapy is to be determined by [CONTACT_093], 
but may include such interventions as IV epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intubation, or admission to an 
intensive care unit. 
oOne or two intramuscular injections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_489122] “important medical 
event” when the epi[INVESTIGATOR_489123], the rationale for the assessment must be explained in detail in the

ONE-ON-ONE CONCEPT ELICITATION SCRIPT 
Good (morning/afternoon/evening) and welcome to our session. 
[Introduce self] 
Thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview. Today I will talk with you about their peanut allergy impacted your life before they started 
immunotherapy trial, and if and how the impact of their peanut 
allergy may have changed since then.  We will also discuss your experience of the required 
treatment regimen, any positive or negative aspects of the treatment you feel are important. The 
information you provide will help us better understand how peanut allergy impacts the lives of 
people with peanut allergy and their families, and what improvements or changes are most 
meaningful and important to allergy sufferers and their families. The session will last 
approximately one hour.  
There are no right or wrong answers.  We understand everyone has different experiences.  We 
are interested in what you have to say. Please feel free to share your point of view. Please keep in 
mind that all information you provide us will be kept confidential.  This discussion is being

TITLE A Six-Week, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized -
Withdrawal , Multic enter  Study of the Safety and Efficacy of 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] 
in the Treatment of Excessive Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238142] (OSA) 
STUDY NUMBER  14-004 
STUDY PHASE  Phase 3  
LOCATION  This trial will be conducted at approximately 60 sites in North 
America and Europe. 
PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once daily 
compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238143].  
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of JZP -110 administered 
once daily for up to 6 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238143].  
DESIGN  
 
        This trial is a 6 -week, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized-withdrawal, multicenter study of safety and 
efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238144] . Following the completion of a 
Screening Phase, subjec ts will enter a 2 -week , open- label  
Titration Phase . 
During the 2-week Titration Phase, subjects will be titrated to the maximal dose that is tolerated.  Subjects will start at a 
once-daily dose of 75 mg JZP- 110 and will be able to titrate up 
one dose level (to 150 mg/day or a maximum dose of 300 mg/day) once every [ADDRESS_288558] been titrated to an efficacious and tolerable dose will remain on that dose for the subsequent 2 weeks during an open- label Stable 
Dose Phase. During the 2- week Stable Dose Phas e, subjects

   will receive a once daily dose of JZP -110 equal to the dose that 
they received at the end of the Titration Phase. 
At the end of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4), subjects  who 
report much or very much improvement on the Patient Global 
Impression of Change ( PGIc) scale as compared to the 
beginning of the Titration Phase ( after discontinuation of prior 
medications and before receiving JZP -110) will undergo 
additional assessments, which will include an overnight stay at the investigational site for n octurnal polysomnography (PSG) 
followed by a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) as well as safety assessments.  Subjects who complete the Week 4 
Visit and who report much or very much improvement on the 
PGIc scale and whose mean sleep latency on the MWT and 
Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) scores also improve w ill be 
randomized in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase. S tratified 
randomization on the basis of subjects’ compliant or non-compliant use of their primary OSA therapy will be used to assign subjects i n a 1:1 ratio  to continue to receive JZP -110 at 
the dose that was received in the Stable Dose Phase or to receive placebo  for 2 weeks in the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase. Subjects who do not report being much or very much improved on the PGIc scale or who do not improve on the MWT and ESS from the beginning of the Titration Phase to 
Week 4 will be discontinued from the study. 
At the conclusion of the 2- week Double -blind Withdrawal 
Phase (end of Week 6), subjects will return to the investigative 
site for a nocturnal PSG and MWT in addition to other efficacy 
and safety assessments.  The final dose of study medication will 
be taken prior to the initiation of the Week [ADDRESS_288559] 4  trials of a 5-trial, 40 -minute MWT  and by [CONTACT_238220] 4 to Week 6  as co -primary 
endpoints, percentage of patients who report a worsening of their condition on the PGIc  from Week 4 to Week 6 as a key 
secondary endpoint , and Clinical Global Impression of Change 
(CGIc) and Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire Short 
Version (FOSQ -10) from Week 4 to Week 6 as additional 
secondary endpoints. 
Subjects will return at the end of Week 8, 2 weeks after the final dose of study medication, for fo llow-up assessments. 
Unless there are any outstanding safety issues that require follow-up, subjects will be discharged from the study at the Week 8 visit.

SAFETY 
ASSESSMENTS  Safety and tolerability evaluations will consist of treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and changes in clinical 
laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), vital 
signs, 12- lead ECGs, physical exams, and C -SSRS assessments.  
STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  For comparison s between JZP -[ADDRESS_288568] to multiple doses in the 
hypotheses testing. A fixed sequential testing strategy will be 
employed to addres s the multiplicity issue s in testing multiple 
endpoints ( co-primary and key secondary endpoints). 
For the analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used. This model will include treatment group , the measurement at the end 
of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) , and randomization 
stratification factor as fixed effect s. SAS procedure PROC 
GLM will be used to carry out this analysis. The estimates of treatment difference v ersus  placebo and their 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented. The last- observation carried forward 
(LOCF) approach will be used for subjects who discontinued early in the Double- Blind Withdrawal Phase.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses 
associated with the analysis of  PGIc.

 1 INTRODUCTION 
JZP-110 [(R)-2-amino -3-phenylpropylcarbamate hydrochloride] is a phenylalanine derivative 
(previously known as ADX-N05, R228060, and YKP10A) that is currently being 
investigated as a potential treatment for excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238147] s leep apnea (OSA). Nonclinical data indicate that JZP -110 is a wake-promoting 
agent that lacks the noradrenergic releasing effects of amphetamines (EDMS  PSDB -4956838, EDMS -PSDB -2735318, EDMS -PSDB -5305783) and does not 
produce rebound hypersomnia in rodent models ( Hasan et al. 2009 )
. Pharmacologically, 
JZP-110 appears to be a low-potency reuptake inhibitor at
 dopamine and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_202607].  
JZP-110 was originally synthesized by [CONTACT_238222] S
cience (South Korea). The molecule has 
been under development for the treatment of depression and for the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238148]. Jazz Pharmaceuticals intends to complete development of JZP-[ADDRESS_288580] (MWT) and decreased subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_156123] (ESS).  
OSA is diagnosed accor ding to The International Classification of
  Sleep Disorders, Third 
Edition (ICSD-3, American Academy of Sleep Medicine [AASM
 2014] ) or Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fifth Edition (DSM -5, American Psychiatric 
Association 2013) on the basis of the number of predominantly obstructive respi[INVESTIGATOR_238149] a nocturnal polysomnogram (PSG) or per hour of monitoring during an out of center sleep test (OCST); often in addition to a patient complaint of dayti me sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], non -restorative or unrefreshing sleep, or fatigue; or a report of a 
nocturnal breathing disturbance such as snoring, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], choking, or pauses in breathing (see ICSD -3 criteria in Appendix 14). Essential features of OSA inclu
de repetitive epi[INVESTIGATOR_238150] (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) upper airway obstruction during sleep and excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238151] a major presenting complaint in many 
but not all cases  (AASM 2014) . Most patients with OSA awaken in the morning feeling tired 
and unrefreshed regardless of the duration of their time in bed. During the day, their sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238152]; however, w ith extreme 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], sleep may occur while actively conversing, eating, walking, or driving (AASM 2014). 
Positive airway pressure (PAP) applied through a nasal, oral, or oronasal interface during 
sleep is considered to  be the reference- o
r gold -standard treatment for OSA by [CONTACT_238223][INVESTIGATOR_3764] ( Gay et al. 2006, Fietze et al. 2011 , Randerat
h et al.  
2011). However, the effectiveness of PAP is li
mited by [CONTACT_238224]-compliance or non-
adherence to therapy. Non- compliance with PAP is a widely recognized problem that limits 
its effectiveness ( Weaver & Grunstein 2008, Weaver & Sawyer 2010, Sawyer et al. 2011). 
Compliance with PAP is typi[INVESTIGATOR_238153] ≥4 hours per night on ≥70% of nights (Gay et al. 2006). When compliance is defined as ≥4 hours of nightly use, it is

 estimated that 46 -83% of patient s with OSA are non- compliant with their prescribed 
continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy ( Weaver & G
runstein 2008).  
In addit ion to PAP, there are alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_238154]
P therapy is refused or is unsuccessful. The Clinical Guideline for the 
Evaluation, Management and Long-term Care of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults that wa s 
authored by [CONTACT_238225][INVESTIGATOR_238155], use of an oral appliance, surgical intervention, or adjunctive treatment should be discussed with a patient when PAP is not accepted by [CONTACT_238226] ( Epstein et al . 2009). Similarly, the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238156]-CPAP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_238157], that maxillomandibular osteotomy seems to be as efficient as CPAP in patients who refuse conservative treatment , 
and that there is a trend towards improve ment in OSA symp toms after weight  reduction  
(Randerath et
 al. 2011). 
Although PAP therapy is considered to be the international reference - or  gold -standard 
treatment for OSA ( Gay et al. 2006, Fietze et al. 2011 , Randerath et al. 2011), the 
effectiveness of PAP therapy to adequately treat objective and subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238158]. The Positive Airway Pressure Task Force of the Standards of Practice Committee of the AASM has concluded that although PAP has been shown to be effective in elimin ating respi[INVESTIGATOR_238159]/hypopnea index (AHI), Level I and Level II evidence for CPAP improving objective measures of wakefulness in patients with OSA is equivocal (Gay et al. 2006). In addition, data from a multicenter study o n the relationships between hours of PAP use and measures of 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238160] 34% of OSA subjects who had ESS scores >10 at baseline and that objective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238161] 65% of OSA subjects who had an MSLT sleep latency <7.5 minutes at baseline ( Weaver et al. 
2007 ). Similarly, data from a multicenter study in 
[LOCATION_009] and f
rom the French National Sleep Registry have estimated the prevalence of 
residual excessive sleep iness in OSA patients without major comorbidities who use CPAP to 
be 6 and 13%, respectively ( Pepin et al. 2009, Gasa et al. 2013 ). 
These data are consistent with a consensus statement from the Medical Therapy for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Task Force of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine that concluded that many patients have residual sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238162] ( Veasey et al.
 2006 ). These findings highlight the

 latency using a 20- minute MWT with maximal di fferences in the means between drug and 
placebo groups ranging from 2.3 to 4.5 minutes ( US Modafinil 
in Narcolepsy Multicenter 
Study Group 1998, US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 2000, Harsh et al. 
2006). In contrast, data for the [ADDRESS_288582] that JZP -110 may offer an important 
advance in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238164]’ ability to stay awake throughout the day. 
Modafinil and armodafinil are indicated in the US to improve wakefulness in adult patients 
with excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238165] (Provigil P
rescribing 
Information; Nuvigil Prescribing Information ). Although ch anges in sleep latency on the first 
four trials of a 20 -minute MWT with modafinil were slightly lower in patients with OSA 
(mean changes of 1.5 -1.6 minutes; Black & Hirshkowitz 2005) as compared to patients with 
narcolepsy (mean changes of 1.9 -2.3 minutes; US Modafinil in Narc olepsy Multicenter 
Study Group 1998, US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Multicenter Study Group 2000), these data 
suggest that wake-promoting agents (such as JZP-110) should have similar therapeutic effects in the narcolepsy and OSA patient populations. 
Another limitation of modafinil and armodafinil is that the therapeutic effects of these drugs 
do not appear to last throughout the day and are markedly reduced by [CONTACT_156225] a (5- or 
6-trial, 20 - or 30- minute) MWT in patients with narcolepsy or OSA ( Schwart z et al. 2003, 
Harsh et al. 2006, Roth et al. 2006)
. For example, the effects of [ADDRESS_288583] zero on the fifth and sixth tria ls of a 6 -trial, 20 -minute MWT 
(5-7 PM) when modafinil was given once daily in the morning (Schwartz et al. 2003). 
Similarly, the effects of [ADDRESS_288584] zero for 250 mg armodafinil at 1700 hours (5 pm) (Harsh et al. 2006). In addition, the effects of [ADDRESS_288585] three trials (3 -7 pm) were not statistically different from placebo (for the individual doses or when 
combined) at the end of this 12-week trial (Harsh et al. 2006). 
In contrast t

trial of a 20 -minute MWT in narcolepsy patients, (Schwartz et al. 2003; Harsh et al. 2006) , 
data from the 12-week, Phase 2b study of JZP-110 (ADX-N05 202) in 93 subjects with 
narcolepsy (44 subjects randomized to receive JZP-110) showed that the mean change from baseline in sleep latency on the fifth trial of a 5 -trial, 40-minute MWT was 8.2 minutes for 
the 300 mg dose of JZP-110 (significantly greater than placebo at p=0.0007). The mean change from baseline on the fifth trial  of a 5 -trial, 40- minute MWT was also significantly 
greater than placebo (p=0.0002) for the 150 mg dose of JZP-110 at 5.4 minutes. The 4 -week

and safety pharmacology, abuse liability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, 
and toxicology of JZP -110. 
JZP-110 was extensively absorbed and showed high oral bioavailability (71 to 100%) in 
mice, rats, and dogs. In humans, bioavailability was >90% as evidenced by [CONTACT_238227] a human mass balance study, along with urinary recovery of >90% of the dose as unchanged drug. Plasma protein binding 
was low (8 to 17%) in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, and human plasma. In the in vitro metabolism studies, no notable inhibition of CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 occurred (15%) with concentrations up to 1000 μM. Notable 
inhibition of CYP1A2 (73%) and CYP2D6 (56%) activity was observed only at the highest concentration (1000 μM) investigated. However, this level of inhibition is unlikely to result in clinically significant drug -drug interactions with CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 substrates. The 
plasma C
max level after oral administration to humans at 400 mg/day is approximately 7.6 μM 
(1482 ng/mL). JZP- 110 (5 to 100 μM) did not inhibit P-glycoprotein–mediated tra nsport. 
More detailed information is provided in the JZP-110 Investigators Brochure. 
1.3 Clinical Experience  
At the start of the Phase 3 program, nine clinical studies (six  Phase 1 and three Phase 2a 
studies) had been conducted in 262 healthy subjects and 602 subjects (two of whom did not receive study drug) with major depressive disorder (MDD). Of these [ADDRESS_288588] 90% of the dose being 
excreted as unchanged drug within 48 hours. Following repeated doses administered once or twice daily, JZP -110 exposure was dose proportional, absorption (t
max: 1.3 to 2.5 hours) and 
elimination (t ½: 6 to 7.6 hours) were rapid, and steady state was reached in 3 days. 
Pharmacokinetics were linear over the multiple -dose (14 day) range of 200 to 1000 mg/day. 
Limited accumulation and no enzyme induction were evident.

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288589] included 150 and 300 mg in subjects with narcolepsy.  
1.3.2  Efficacy of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted in 126 adult 
subjects with narcolepsy. In these studies, once daily doses included 150 and 300 mg/day JZP-110; the doses were based on the free base of the molecule.  
Study ADX-N05 201 was a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of JZP-110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subjects with narcolepsy (N=33). The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT at the end of 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of 2 weeks of treatment, the mean  sleep latency on the MWT increased by 
12.7 minutes for the JZP-110 300 mg/day treatment period versus 0.9 minutes for the placebo period. The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically significant in favor of the active treatment period (mixed model analysis of variance; p=0.0002). All secondary endpoints in this study were also positive including the mean change in the ESS.  
Study ADX-N05 202 was a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of JZP -110 150 and 300 mg given once daily in adult subjects with narcolepsy (N=93). The 
primary efficacy endpoints were the change from Baseline in the mean  sleep latency time (in 
minutes) averaged across the first four trials of the MWT and the Clinical Global Imp ression 
of Change ( CGIc ) scores for JZP -[ADDRESS_288590] (Week 12) assessment at the 
300 mg dose. At Week 12/Last Assessment, the mean  sleep latency increased by 
12.8 minutes for the JZP -110 group (300 mg/day) versus 2.[ADDRESS_288591] bo group. 
The difference in mean change from Baseline was both statistically and clinically significant in favor of the active treatment group (two- sample t-test; p<0.0001). All secondary endpoints 
in this study were also positive.  
1.3.3  Safety of JZP -110 in Clinical Studies of Narcolepsy  
In Study ADX -N05 201, 1 week of treatment with JZP-110 150 mg/day followed by [CONTACT_238228] 300 mg/day for a second week was safe and well tolerated. The most common treatment -emergent adverse events  (TEAEs) with JZP -110 treatment included nausea (12%), 
chest discomfort (9%), headache (9%), anxiety (6%), decreased appetite (6%), initial insomnia (6%), insomnia (6%), and muscle tightness (6%). None of these events were reported during placebo treatment. There were no deaths, trea tment- emergent serious AEs 
(SAEs ), or discontinuations due to AEs. Severe TEAEs were limited to two subjects (one 
with intermittent nausea and one with insomnia). JZP- [ADDRESS_288592] on heart rate and blood pressure, and T EAEs suggested a profile of effects 
consistent with those of a wake- promoting drug (decreased appetite, headache, anxiety, 
insomnias, and gastrointestinal complaints). Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238166] (3%) and chest pain was reported by 3  subjects  (9%; all reported as non- cardiac pain) while on 
JZP-110. There were no reports of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238167].

 In Study ADX -N05 202, the JZP-110 dose regimen of 150 mg/day for 4 weeks followed by 
300 mg/day for [ADDRESS_288593] common TEAEs 
with JZP -110 treatment included headache (16%), nausea (14%), insomnia (14%), decreased 
appetite (14%), diarrhea (11%), and anxiety (11%); all of these events were more common in the combined JZP-110 group than in the placebo group. There were no deaths in this study. Treatment -emergent SAEs occurred in two subjects (both in the JZP-110 group): one subject 
had conversion disorder and one had acute cholecystitis. Three subjects (6.8%) in the JZP-110 group and two subjects (4.1%) in the placebo group had TEAEs that led to study 
discontinuation. It appears likely that JZP-110 is causally associated with insomnia, decreased appetite, anxiety, irritability, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and perhaps nausea and diarrhea.  
In the ADX-N05 202 study, JZP- 110 treatment was associated with small effects on placebo -
corrected changes in heart rate (both measured and from ECGs), blood pressure, and 
quantitative ECG parameters (mean heart rate increased from Baseline at 2 hours after d osing 
by 3 to 5 beats per minute [bpm ] with little or no change at 9 to 10 hours after dosing; mean 
PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF demonstrated no significant changes). There were no clinically significant effects on the ECG parameters of PR, QRS, QTcF , or QTc B in any 
subject. Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238168] 4 subjects (9%) and chest pain was reported by 2 subjects (both appeared to be non- cardiac pain) while on JZP -110. There was one report of 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238169]- N05 202 study. There were two subjects who had TEAEs that were related to vital 
signs: mildly elevated blood pressure beginning on Day [ADDRESS_288594] on placebo. There were two subjects who had TEAEs related to ECG findings: one subject had a TEAE of “heart rate increased” on JZP-[ADDRESS_288595] a TEAE of “occasional ventricular premature complexes.”

10, and R228060- MDD-201) have been conducted in a total of 600 adult subjects with MDD. 
In these studies, doses ranged from 100 to 900 mg/day JZP-110 with the dose based on the hydrochloride salt of the drug. These studies di d not demonstrate efficacy for JZP -110 in 
treating MDD.  
• Study SKUP -9801 was an 8-w

• Stud
y R228060- [LOCATION_003]- 10 was a 3-week, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group 
study to assess the tolerability of JZP -110 200 mg/day (100 mg morning, 100 mg evening) 
and 500 mg/day (300 mg morning, 200 mg evening) in adult subjects with MDD (N=77), with efficacy as an exploratory objective ( R228060- [LOCATION_003]-10).

 • Study R228060- MDD- 201 was  a large-scale (27 centers, N=488), 6-week, double-blind, 
active- (paroxetine) and placebo -controlled, parallel-group study of JZP-110 100 and 200 mg 
given twice daily in adult subjects with MDD (N=488) ( EDMS -PSDB -3696001).  
Most
 of the 219 healthy subjects and 600 subjects with MDD reported adverse events (AE s), 
the majority of which were mild or moderate.  The AEs from these 219 healthy subjects do 
not include data from a recently completed Phase 1 human abuse liability study in 
43 subjects because data analysis from that study is ongoing (preliminary data will be 
included in the JZP- 110 Investigators Brochure). The most common TEAEs that occurred 
≥5% and more often with JZP-110 than placebo across doses of 200 to 1200 mg/day included insomnia (34%), headache (23%), dizziness (16%), anorexia (16%), dry mouth (16%), nervousness (15%), nausea (14%), palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332] (11%), agitation (10%), abdominal pain (10%), anxiety (9%), fatigue (9%), concentration impaired (8%), and diarrhea (6%). There were no deaths. One healthy JZP -110-treated subject (1000 mg/day) reported a serious 
adverse event (SAE, confusion) that was considered unrelated to study drug. Four JZP-110-treated subjects with MDD reported SAEs: cellulitis (100 to 300  mg/day), aggravated 
depression (200 mg/day), aggravated depression and suicidal ideation (400 mg/day), and 
myocardial infarction (200 mg). The myocardial infarction was the only SAE that was classified as possibly related to study drug (see the JZP- 110 Investigators Brochure for 
additional information on this SAE). 
In addition, there were reports of mostly mild cardiovascular AEs in other studies (see the 
JZP-110 Investigators Brochure for additional information). Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_238171] 9603-[ADDRESS_288597] in each of the Y[LOCATION_006]IC -9603 and Y[LOCATION_006]IC-9702- 01 studies  and in three subjects in the 
MDD-201 study (which includes the myocardial infarction described above) . Ventricular 
ectopy (seen on 12-lead ECG) was reported in one patient in Y[LOCATION_006]IC-9702-[ADDRESS_288598] degree AV block, about equally common in JZP-110 and controls, and rarely new and sustained. These were usually considered not clinically significant findings or adverse events.  
Three healthy subjects (two on 200 mg and one on 800 mg JZP-110) and two subjects with 
MDD (both on 500 mg JZP-110) had treatment- emergent reversible elevations of liver 
enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase) of 1.1 to 4.1 × the upper limit of normal (ULN). Two placebo-treated subjects also developed mild elevations in liver enzymes. There were no other findings in laboratory safety tests.  
1.4 Summary of Potential Benefits and Risks 
JZP-110 has not been studied in OSA. Based on two clinical studies in narcolepsy, t he 
potential benefits of JZP -110 to subjects who are titrated to an efficacious and tolerable dose 
in this study are expected to be a clinically significant increase in the ability to stay awake and a clinically significant decrease in subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. These benefits are anticipated

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288599] is  anticipated to benefit  from JZP -110. It is not 
known if the 75 mg dose will provide a clinical benef it in this study, however, all subjects 
will undergo titration in an attempt to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of JZP -110 at a dose 
that is safe and tolerable. The administration of placebo during the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase is not anticipated to provide any benefit. 
The risks to subjects in this study who receive 150 mg or 300 mg JZP -110 are expected to be 
similar to those seen in prior clinical studies that evaluated the effects of 150 mg and 300 mg JZP-110 in narcolepsy patients ( Section 1.3.3). However, JZP-[ADDRESS_288600] been on the order of 
up to 5 beats per minute, up to 6 mmHg in systolic blood pressure, and up to 3 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. In a recently completed thorough QT study, JZP-110 did not cause QT interval prolongation above the threshold of regulatory concern when given at either the 300 mg or 900 mg dose (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] E14 Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs, 2005). 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective   
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of JZP -110 administered once 
daily compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238172].  
2.2 Secondary Objective   
The secondary o bjective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of JZP -110 
administered once daily for up to 6 weeks in doses of 75, 150, and 300 mg compared to placebo in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238143].

 This trial is a 6 -week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized- withdrawal, multicenter 
study of safety and efficacy of JZP -110 in the treatment of excessive sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238173]. Following the completion of a Screening Phase, subjects will enter a 
2-week, open -label Titration Phase.  
During the 2-week Titration Phase, subjects will be titrated to the maximal dose that is 
tolerated. Subjects will start at a once -daily dose of 75 mg JZP- 110 and will be able to titrate 
up one dose level (to 150 mg/day or a maximum dose of 300 mg/day) onc e every [ADDRESS_288601] been titrated to an efficacious and tolerable dose will remain on that dose for the subsequent 2 weeks during an open- label Stable Dose Phase. During the 2 -week Stable Dose Phase, 
subjects will receive a once daily dose of JZP -110 equal to the dose that they received at the 
end of the Titration Phase. 
At the end of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4), subjects who report much or very much 
improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc) scale as compared to the beginning of the Titration Phase (after discontinuation of prior medications and before receiving JZP -110) will undergo additional assessments, which will include an overnight stay 
at the investigational site for nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) followed by a Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) as well as safety assessments. Subjects who complete the Week  4 Visit and who report much or very much improvement on the PGIc scale and whose 
mean sleep latency on the MWT and Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS) scores also improve 
will be randomized in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase. Stratified randomization on the basis of subjects’ compliant or non- compliant use of their primary OSA therapy will be used 
to assign subjects in a 1:1 ratio to continue to receive JZP-110 at the dose that was received in the Stable Dose Phase or to receive placebo for 2 weeks in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase. Subjects who do not report being much or very much improved on the PGIc scale or who do not improve on the MWT and ESS from the beginning of the Titration Phase to Week 4 will be discontinued from the study. 
At the conclusion of the 2- week Double -blind Withdrawal Phase (end of Week 6), subjects 
will return to the investigative site for a nocturnal PSG and MWT in addition to other 
efficacy and safety assessments. The final dose of study medication will be taken prior to the initiation of the Week [ADDRESS_288602] 4  trials of a 5 -trial, 40 -minute MWT and by [CONTACT_238229] 4 to Week 6 as co -primary endpoints, percentage of patients who report a 
worsening of their condition on the PGIc from Week 4 to Week 6 as a key secondary endpoint, and Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIc) and Functional Outcomes of 
Sleep Questionnaire Short Version (FOSQ-10) from Week 4 to Week 6 as additional secondary endpoints. 
Subjects will return at the end of Week 8, 2 weeks after the final dose of study medication, for follow -up assessments. Unless there are any outstanding safety issues that require follow-
up, subjects will be discharged from the study at the Week 8 visit.

 3.1.1  Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
This study was designed to be consistent with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry on Providing Clinical Evidence of Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, with The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), Guidance on The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess Clinical Safety for 
Drugs Intended for Long- Term Treatment of Non -Life-Threatening Conditions and with the 
ethical principles given in these guidances which have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The inclusion of a placebo as a control arm in the 2- week Double -blind Withdrawal 
Phase of this study is necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of t his new 
investigational medicinal product.

 5.1.2  Placebo  
Placebo tablets are composed of mannitol, MCC, and magnesium stearate, and a polymer 
film coat (Opadry®). Placebo tablets  will be overencapsulated  in the same opaque gelatin 
capsules that will be used for the active JZP -[ADDRESS_288614] four trials of the MWT by 9.5 and 12.8 minutes from bas eline, 
respectively, and increased the sleep latency on the fifth trial of the MWT by 5.4  and 
8.2 minutes from baseline, respectively. Based on these findings and the safety and tolerability profiles of 150 and 300 mg JZP-110 in adult patients with narcolepsy in these trials, this study will further evaluate of the safety and efficacy of 150 and 300 mg, in addition to the lower dose of 75 mg JZP -110 given once a day in the morning. 
In this study, subjects will be titrated to an effective and tolerated dose over 2 weeks in the Titration Phase, will continue to receive that dose for 2 weeks in the Stable Dose Phase, and will be randomized 1:1 as described in Section 5.5 to either continue to receive JZP-110 at 
the dose that was received in the Stable Dose Phase or to receive placebo for 2  weeks in the 
Double-blind Withdrawal Phase. In each phase of the study, subjects will be instructed to take a single daily dose of study drug in the morning, on an empty stomach within one hour of awakening. Subjects will also be instructed to abstain from eating or drinking (except for 
water) for [ADDRESS_288615] should be instructed to take the study drug, if he/she is able to do so, at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime. If the subject cannot take the study drug at least 12 hours before his/her anticipated bedtime, the subject should not take the study drug for that day. 
The titration schedule in this protocol is based on the pharmacoki netics of the JZP -110 as 
well as the titration experience in clinical trials to date. Steady state levels of JZP -110 are 
reached within 3 days ( Section 1.3.1). In the previous ADX- N05 201 and ADX -N05 202 
studies in narcolepsy patients, subjects received 150 mg JZP-110 for 1 or 4 weeks, 
respectively, prior to receiving 300 mg JZP- 110. In this study, subjects will initially receive 
75 mg from Day 1 through Day 3 of the Titration Phase and will be able to titrate up one dose level (to 150 mg/day or a maximum dose of 300 mg/day) once every 3 days following a telephone consultation with investigative site staff. Subjects will also be able to titrate down to any dose at any time following a telephone consultation with investigative site staff to

evaluate whether titration to the 150 mg dose in this study will result in fewer AEs as 
compared to a starting dose of 150 mg without titration. 
 
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
Subjects who complete the Week 4 Visit at the end of the Stable Dose Phase, who report 
much or very much improvement on the PGIc scale, and who also show a numerical 
improvement in mean sleep latency on the MWT and ESS score from the beginning of the Titration Phase (Day -1) to Week 4 will be randomized in the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase. Stratified randomization on the basis of subjects’ compliant or non-compliant use of their primary OSA therapy at the end of the Stable Dose Phase will be used to assign subjects 
in a 1:1 ratio  to continue to receive JZP-110 at the dose that was received in the Stable Dose 
Phase or to receive pla cebo for 2 weeks in the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase. Compliant 
use of a primary OSA therapy will be defined as use of ≥4 hours per night on ≥70% of nights (≥5 of 7 nights/week) for subjects who use a device from which hourly usage data can be extracted. Compliant use of a primary OSA therapy will be defined as ≥70% of nights (≥5 of 
7 nights/week) by [CONTACT_238232] (with investigator concurrence) for subjects who use a device for which usage data cannot be retrieved.  Receipt of a surgical intervention f or OSA 
symptoms  that is deemed to be effective will also be considered compliant use of a primary 
OSA therapy . Non -compliant use of a primary OSA therapy will be defined as use at a 
frequency or duration less than that described above, or receipt of a surg ical intervention that 
is no longer effective in the absence of compliant use of another primary OSA therapy . The 
investigator will access an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or an Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS) to randomize subjects. 
5.[ADDRESS_288617] ’s assigned treatment, the 
code will not be broken or released until all study data are collected and accepted for 
analysis.  
5.6 Blinding 
The Titration and Stable Dose Phases  of this study will not be blinded to the subjects or the 
investigator s. A double-blind approach will be used during the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase with subjects and all study personnel blinded to treatment. All study drug throughout 
the study will be prepared in identical opaque gelatin capsules to ensure adequate blinding in 
the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase.

 6.5 Vital Signs  
Vitals signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature) will be obtained at eve ry clinic visit after the subject has been resting and seated 
for at least [ADDRESS_288626]’s legs should not be crossed. The arm should be supported at heart level, and the bladder of the cuff should encircle at least 80% of the arm circumference. Neither the subject nor the observer should talk during the measurement. 
A minimum of 2 blood pressure and pulse rate measurements should be taken and the 
measureme
nts should be separated by [CONTACT_3450] 5 minutes. If there is >[ADDRESS_288627] and second blood pressure measurement (systolic or diastolic 
reading), an additional measurement should be taken ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_238176]. 2005). Vital signs will 
be recorded on t
he CRF. 
The mean of 
the two or three blood pressure assessments taken at the Screening visit will be 
used to meet entrance criteria to the study . Body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood 
pressure and pulse will be obtained on admission to the site the evenings before the PSG nights at Day -1 and the end of Weeks 4 and 6; at Week 2; and at the Follow -up visit or at 
Early Termination.  
On the MW T day  at the start of the Titration Period (Day -1), body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], blood pressure and pulse will be taken approximately 30 minutes after awakening (prior to the start of the MWT). Blood pressure and pulse will also be taken approximately 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 hours after awakening. 
On MWT days at the end of Weeks 4 and 6 (or Early Termination if PSG/MWT is 
performed), body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure and pulse will be taken approximately 1 hour before dosing (shortly before the first MWT trial) . Blood pressure and 
pulse will be taken at approximately 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hours (approximately [ADDRESS_288628] MWT trial) after dosing.  The schedule of assessment for vital 
signs during PSG/MWT visits is described in Section [ADDRESS_288629] ion 7 and  Appendix 2. 
6.7 Polysomnography (PSG) 
A PSG followed by [CONTACT_238236] (Day  -2) and at Weeks 4 and 6 (or Early Termination if the subject is willing and able to take 
study drug for the assessments).  If a subject is allowed to be rescreened, a repeat PSG and 
MWT will not be required if the results of the previous PSG and MWT in the study meet the current inclusion/exclusion criteria  and there have been no chan ges to the medical history, 
concomitant medications , or primary OSA therapy that would likely affect the MWT results.

will be provided in a manual to each site. The manual will include all parameters to be recorded, methods, and a scoring appendix. Oxygen saturation will be monitored according to the study center’s standard procedures. Standard P SG parameters will be recorded. All 
polysomnographic data will be read by a central reader.  
For the purposes of this study, primary OSA therapy includes use of PAP, oral pressure therapy, an oral appliance, or an upper airway stimulator. Subject s who are compliant with a 
primary OSA  therapy  (see Section 5.4) should use their primary OSA therapy  during each 
PSG assessment . Subjects who use a primary OSA therapy at a frequency or duration less 
than the compliant definition in  Section 5.4 should decide with the clinician/investigator 
whether they will use their primary OSA therapy  during a ll or none of the PSG assessments.  
Subjects who do not have a documented diagnosis of OSA according to ICSD- [ADDRESS_288631] be present to monitor the PSG during PSG nights. 
6.8 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) 
At the Screening Visit, the Baseline/ Screening Version of the C- SSRS will be administered 
to subjects to exclude any individuals with active suicidal ideation or behavior ( Appendix 7). 
The C -SSRS
 is a widely used measure of suicidal ideation and behavior. The instrument 
reliably predicts a potential suicide attempt in those who had previously att empted suicide 
and is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a person may be at risk for an 
impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011
). Suicidal ideation will be assessed for lifetime 
and over the pas
t [ADDRESS_288632] 5 years with the Baseline/Screening Version of the C -SSRS. The Since Last Visit 
Version of the C- SSRS will be administered to subjects at every clinic visit after their 
Screening visit including the Follow-up visit ( Appendix 8).  
6.9 Clinical Laboratory Tests  
6.9.1  Laboratory Parameters  
Subjects will be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526]. Screening labs may be repeated one time.  Clinical laboratory tests to be conducted are listed in Table 1. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory. An authorized back-up laboratory, as indicated on the Form FDA  1572 or equiva lent, may be used if necessary as an 
emergency laboratory. The investigator will supply Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee with the back -up laboratory’s current licensure and laboratory reference ranges.  
Please note exclusionary clinical laboratory param eters listed in the exclusion criteria  
(Section 4.3). In addition, any laboratory parameter that is out of range and considered 
clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_093]) at the end of treatment must be

 6.10  Dispensing Study Drug 
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects at the beginning of the Titration Phase and at the 
end of Weeks 2 and 4 or at alternative intervals if necessary to comply with State and local laws and regulations. Subjects will be instructed to begin daily dosing with the new supply of study drug the day after the completion of visits at the beginning of the Titration Phase and at the end of Weeks 2 and 4. Subjects will also be provided with dosing instructions consistent with the restrictions described in Section 5.8. On the day after the overnight PSG, on the 
morning of the MWT at Weeks 4 and 6, and at Early Termination if a PSG/MWT is 
performed , study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_238237] [ADDRESS_288638] (MWT)  
The MWT is the standard objective measure of an individual’s ability to remain awake during the day
time in a darkened, quiet environment and is commonly used to assess 
response to treatment ( Doghramji et al
. 1997, Mitler et al. 1982, AASM 2 014). A five -trial, 
40-minute MWT will be performed at the beginning of the Titration Phase ( Day -1) and at 
the Week 4 and 6 visits (or Early Termination if the subject is willing and able to take study 
drug for the assessments) on the morning after an overnight PSG according to a standard protocol, which will be provided in a manual to each site.  
Each MWT during the study should be started at approximately the same time of the day. 
During the MWT trials, s ubjects should be seated in bed in a darkened room with the back 
and head supported by a bed rest (bolster pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356]) such that their neck is not uncomfortably 
flexed or extended  (Littner et al.
 2005 ). Subjects will be instructed t o sit still and remain 
awake for as long as possible during each of the [ADDRESS_288639] MWT trial should occur approximately 2 hours after “lights on” 
at the beginning of the Titration Phase (Day -1) and approximately [ADDRESS_288640] is then instructed to remain awake (and will be awoken if they fall asleep) until the next trial.  
Data from the
 MWT should be recorded and saved electronically, and any technician notes 
should also be maintained for potential transfer to Jazz Pharmaceuticals  at the end of the 
study.  
6.11.2  Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] (ESS)  
The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire with [ADDRESS_288641] how likely 
they would be to doze off or fall asleep in different situations. Responses range from 0 = would never doze to 3 = high chance of dozing ( Appendix 5). Subje cts will be asked to

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288642] 7 days 
at the beg
inning of the Titration Phase ( Day -1) and  at Week s 2, 4, and 6 (or Early  
Termination) . The ESS provides a measure of a person’s ge neral level of daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
or their average sleep propensity in daily life. It is a validated measure with high specificity 
and sensitivity for assessing subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Johns 1991, 2000;  Brode
rick et al. 2013).  
6.11.3  Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGIs)  
The CGIs is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment in clinical 
psychopharmacology trials to assess severity of illness ( Appendix 9). The responses of this 
investigator -completed scale range from 1 = normal, no signs of illness to 7 = among the 
most extremely ill patients. The Investigator will rate his/her impression of the severity of the 
subject’s condition at the beginning of the Titration Phase relative to his/her experience with 
this patient population. 
6.11.4  Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIc)  
The CGIc is a [ADDRESS_288643]’s condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very 
much worse at Week 4 (Appendix 10) and at Week 6 (or Early Termination) (Appendix 11). 
6.11.5  Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIc)  
The PGIc is a 7 -point Likert -type rating scale and a widely used assessment to assess 
efficacy in clinical drug trials. Subjects will rate the change in their condition on a 7-point 
scale ranging from 1 = very much improved to 7 = very much w orse at Week 4  
(Appendix 12) and Week 6 (or Early Termination ) (Appendix 13) . 
6.11.6  Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ -10) 
The FOSQ is a 30 -item disease specific quality of life questionnaire to determine functional 
status in adults; measures are designed to assess the impact of disorders of excessive 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_238178]  (Weaver et al . 1997) . The FOSQ -10 is a short version of the 
original 30- item FOSQ t hat has been shown to perform similarly to the longer version  
(Chasens et al . 2009). The FOSQ -[ADDRESS_288644] -treatment differences that are highly correlated with the longer 
version (Chasens et al 2009) Subjects will complete the FOSQ -10 at the beginning of the 
Titration Phase (Day -1) and at Week 4 and 6 (or Early Termination) ( Appendix 6).

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288646]  at each clinic visit from Screening and through the Double-blind Withdrawal 
Phase (Week 6). Subjects who report using a device for which usage data cannot be retrieved  
will record their primary OSA therapy usage and the estimated duration of use (more than 
half of the night, less than half of the night, or don’t know) on a daily basis from Screening 
and through the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6). Subjects who report not using a primary OSA therapy at Screening will be asked to confirm that they have continued to not 
use a primary OSA therapy . The study staff will review the information that each subject 
provides regarding their primary OSA therapy use at each study visit and will discuss it with 
the subject at each phone contact. A stable level of use of a primary OSA therapy is defined as a change of <30% o f the number of nights used per week. 
Subjects will be encouraged to stay on their current primary OSA therapy at the same level of use throughout the study. 
6.12 Adverse Event Reporting 
6.12.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure.  
Adverse events include, but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, 
or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; and/or (5) abnormal clinically significant laboratory values.  
• Symptoms of the underlying medical condition of OSA are not considered as adverse 
events unless there is an exacerbation  of the symptoms from baseline.  
• During the study, clinically significant ad verse changes in ECGs, routine laboratory 
tests, and physical examinations are considered AEs. Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE.  
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_423], determined from laboratory findings, or other means, will be recorded on the AE CRF, with each individual AE to be listed as a separate entry on the AE CRF.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs/symptoms, should be documented as the AE.  
Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_238238], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on  the 
AE CRF. Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, and causal relationship to the study drug or procedure.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Severity Assessment  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_27414], moderate, or severe as defined 
below. W hen the severity of the AE changes over time, the change in severity will be 
recorded on the AE CRF as a new AE, and the original AE will stop when the new AE starts. 
Mild  Symptom(s) barely noticeable to subject or does not make subject 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) but may be given. 
Moderate  Symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities is influenced; treatment for symptom(s) may 
be needed.  
Severe  Symptom(s) causes severe discomfort; symptom(s) incapacitate or 
significantly affect subject’s daily life; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events and Seriousness Assessment  
An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per Title [ADDRESS_288647] also be entered on the AE CRF. 
• Is fatal (results in death)  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe) 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability, defined as substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
• Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE.  
• Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product [for EU sites only;

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288648]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.  
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug or procedure and at least one of the following instances of clinical evidence:  
• Follows a known or suspected response pattern to the 
study drug or procedure. 
• Is confirmed by [CONTACT_48017][INVESTIGATOR_238179] (dechallenge). 
• Reappears upon repeated exposure (rechallenge) if 
medically appropriate.  
There is  a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure 
caused the event —i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. In such case, the AE is considered an adverse reaction  
(AR). A suspected  AR has a lesser degree of certainty about causali ty 
than an AR. 
Not 
Related 
to Study Drug or Procedure Event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event. 
A reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or procedure caused the event is lacking. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Immediately Reportable Experiences  
The following immediately reportable experiences may occur during participation in this clinical trial and must be entered on the AE CRF and SAE Report form and reported within [ADDRESS_288649] or designee:  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) with a 3 -fold or 
greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in addition to an elevation of serum total bilirubin greater than two times the ULN, with no other identifiable etiology  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_288650] 
 
As with other SAEs ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]), immediately reportable experiences must be reported 
on the SAE report form, which should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by 
[CONTACT_15009]/her designee before transmittal to the contact [CONTACT_238239]. The investigator must provide his/her assessment of causality to study drug or procedure a t 
the time of the initial report. Where the investigator does not provide causality assessment of the SAE at the time of the initial report, the event by [CONTACT_156249] “Related.” If

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Recording and Reporting 
The investigator must report to Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee all AEs that occur during 
the study from the time written informed consent is obtained until the final study visit or 
early termination, regardless of their relationship to study drug or procedure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically significant laboratory tests, ECGs, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, or the subject is lost to fo llow up. If resolved, a resolution 
date should be provided, and for SAEs, a follow- up SAE Report form must be submitted 
indicating the resolution date. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional clinical laboratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical.

Clinical Trial Protocol: [ADDRESS_288655]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment 
is necessary for the immediate medical management of the subject or to ensure subject safety 
in the trial. In the case of an immediate medical emergency, an I nvestigator or his/her 
designee will be able to unblind a subject at any time via the IVRS. Every attempt should be 
made to contact [CONTACT_238241] a subject as long as this does not compromise the safety of the subje ct. If a request for unblinding is received 
from an Investigator, the Medical Director/Medical Monitor will discuss with the Investigator the rationale for the request.  If the treatment assignment is unblinded , then any 
broken blinding code must be clearly justified and explained by a comment in the source documentation, along with the date on which the code was broken and the identity of the person authorizing the unblinding. In addition, the study biostatisti cian will document the 
occurrence of investigator -initiated unblinding in the section of “Documentation of Statistical 
Method” in the final study report. Subjects for whom the blind is broken will be withdrawn from the study. 
If the request for unblinding is related to the occurrence of an SAE, all procedures for the 
reporting of an SAE must be followed ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). The blinded SAE will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_238242] a potential safety concern for the individual subject or the other subjects in the study.  
6.[ADDRESS_288656] states that he/she wants to stop participating in the study. 
The investigator, Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee may remove a subject from the study 
at any time and for any reason.  
If any of the criteria below are met during the study, study drug administration must be stopped and the subject discontinued from the study. 
• Suicide risk reported or assessed by C- SSRS 
• 3-fold or greater elevation above the upper limit of normal (ULN) of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) accompanied by [CONTACT_238243]  
• Liver enzyme (AST, ALT) value greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_288657] 
• Creatinine ≥2 mg/dL  
• Positive urine drug screen 
• Positive pregnancy test  
• Subject demonstrates a QTc value above 500 msec (determinations should be based 
on at least two ECG recordings performed on drug in close proximity)

 • Subject experiences a serious adverse event that is considered related to study drug or 
procedure  
 
For all subjects who prematurely discontinue, an attempt should be made to perform all early termination assessments  as indicated in Section 7.6. Subjects should be asked to return 
2 weeks later for a safety follow -up visit.  
The specific reason for the discontinuation should be carefully documented on the termination CRF. If a subjec t withdraws informed consent, the specific reason for 
withdrawing the informed consent should be stated. 
Adverse events resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and 
determination of outcome as ascertained by [CONTACT_093]  (and/or Jazz Pharmaceuticals or 
its designee). The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
6.13.[ADDRESS_288658] terminates early from the study, either at his /her request or at the investigator’s 
discretion, the investigator will record the reason(s) for early termination on the relevant CRF page and notify Jazz Pharmaceuticals  immediately. All subjects who terminate from the 
study early should undergo all final study visit assessments as indicated in Section 7.6. 
It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject who terminated because of an AE, 
abnormal laboratory test, or ECG finding. In any case, every effort must be made to 
undertake safety follow-up procedures. 
6.13.2  Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ Termination of Study  
Jazz Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time for clinical or 
administrative reasons.  
Such a termination must be implemented by [CONTACT_34462], if instructed to do so by [CONTACT_156255] a time frame that is compatible with the subject’s well-being. 
6.14 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The MWT is a validated objective measure of the ability to stay awake for a defined period 
of time and is particularly useful for determining efficacy of treatment ( Doghramji et al. 
1997, Mitler et al. 1982). T he ESS is a validated measure with high specificity and sensitivity 
for assessing subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008] ( Johns 1991, 2000;  Broderick et al. 2013). Additionally, 
the CGIc, PCIc, and FOSQ -[ADDRESS_288659] been selected to assess the safety of the study drug are appropriate since they are routinely used to assess the safety profile of drugs in clinical studies and pertinent to known risks of JZP -110. The C- SSRS is able to determine clinically meaningful points at which a 
person may be at risk for an impending suicide attempt ( Posner et al. 2011
).

The study will be conducted according to GCP guidelines and according to national l aw. 
Quality Assurance audits may be performed at the discretion of Jazz Pharmaceuticals.  
9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
All study data will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846]. Categorical 
variables will be reported as frequency and percent (e.g., gender, race). Continuous variables 
will be reported as number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum (e.g., age, weight).

9.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data 
For the analysis of the co-primary efficacy parameter of MWT and ESS, the key secondary efficacy parameter of PGIc, and secondary efficacy parameter of CGIc, single  imputation 
methods will be used to impute the missing data in order t o assess the sensitivity of the 
results.  These methods will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
The assumptions important to the validity of these imputation methods will be examined and discussed in the final study report where the sensitivity analysis is presented.  
9.7 Pooling of Investigation Centers 
Data from all investigational centers will be pooled for primary analyses. Data may also be pooled by [CONTACT_238245]. 
9.8 Efficacy Endpoints 
9.8.1  Co-primary Efficacy Endpoint  
• MWT: Change in the mean  sleep latency time (in minutes) as determined from the first 
four trials of a 40 -minute MWT from the end of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) to the 
end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6)

PGIc at the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6)  
9.8.3  Additional Secondary Endpoints  
• CGIc: Percentage of subjects reported as worse  (minimally, much, or very much) on the 
CGIc at the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6) 
• FOSQ -10: Change in the total score from the beginning of the Titration Phase (Day - 1) 
to the end of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) and from the end of the Stable Dose 
Phase (Week 4) to the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6) 
9.8.4  Exploratory Endpoints  
• Change in the frequency of use of primary OSA therapy from the beginning of the 
Titration Phase (Day -1) to the end of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) and from the end 
of the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) to the end of the Double-blind Withdrawal Phase (Week 6)  
• Change in PSG parameters including total sleep time ( TST), time in Stages N1, N2, N3, 
wake after sleep onset ( WASO), number of awakenings, AI, AHI, central apneas, SaO2

 address the multiplicity issues in testing multiple endpoints ( co-primary  and key secondary 
endpoints). 
For the analysis of the co- prima ry efficacy endpoints, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model will be used. This model will include treatment group , the measurement at the end of 
the Stable Dose Phase (Week 4) , and randomization stratification factor as fixed effect s. SAS 
procedure PRO C GLM will be used to carry out this analysis. The estimates of treatment 
difference versus  placebo and their 95% confidence intervals will be presented. The last-
observation carried forward (LOCF) approach will be used for subjects who discontinued 
early in the Double- Blind Withdrawal Phase.  
The chi -squared test will be used to test the hypotheses associated with the analysis of the 
PGIc  endpoint.  
For the FOSQ -10 endpoints, a similar ANCOVA model will be used as the method of 
analysis; the CGIc endpoint w ill be analyzed using the chi -squared test.  
No sensitivity analyses and no multiplicity adjustments will be employed for these endpoints. 
9.11 Safety Analys es 
Safety analyses will be performed for the Safety Analysis Population. No formal statistical testing w ill be performed for the safety analyses.  
9.11.1  Adverse Event  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities system to classify events under primary system organ class and preferred term.  
The number and percent of subjects who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, or SAEs; who died during the study; or who discontinued study drug or withdrew from the study due to an AE will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148]. Results will be presented by [CONTACT_6657]. The overview will also report TEAEs by [CONTACT_764].  
A TEAE is defined as an AE that either began after first study drug dose or worsened after the first dose. When determining the percent of subjects who experience an AE, multiple increases in sev erity are only counted as one AE. For example, a subject who develops a mild 
headache after the first study drug dose (that was not present during screening or at baseline), which subsequently worsens to moderate, then severe, is only counted once under the preferred term of headache. The increase in severity will be accounted for in the maximum severity analysis.  
For all AE summaries, if a subject has more than one AE within a preferred term, the subject is counted only once at the maximum severity and with the closest relationship to study drug. If a subject has more than one AE within a system organ class, the subject is similarly counted once when reporting results for that system organ class.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must ask about all types) LifetimePast __
Years
Actual Attempt:
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill 
oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%.  If there is anyintent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide 
attempt.There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in 
mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an atte mpt.  
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumsta nces. For example, a 
highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g .,gunshot to head, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a 
high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. 
Have you made a suicide attempt?
Have you done anything to harm yourself?H
ave you done anything dangerous where you could have died?
What did you do?
Did you______ as a way to end your life? Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? Were you trying to end your life when you _____?Or Did you think it was possible you could have died from_____?
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yoursel f(like to relieve stress, feel better, 
get sympathy, or get something else to happen )? (Self-Injurious Behavior without suicidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:
When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_24662]) from starting the potentially se lf-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would 
have occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather th an an interrupted 
attempt. Shooting: Person has gun poin ted toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once 
they pull the trigger, even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and tak en down from ledge. 
Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang -is stopped from doing so.

When the person is interrupted (by [CONTACT_156279]) from starting the potentially self-injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).
Overdose: Person has pi[INVESTIGATOR_24609].  Once they ingest any pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by [CONTACT_24663], or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: Person is poised to jump, is grab bed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around 
neck but has not yet started to hang -is stopped from doing so.

Actual Lethality/Medical Damage:  
0.  No physical damage or very minor physical damage (e.g. , surface scratches).
1.  Minor physical damage (e.g. , lethargic speech; first- degree burns; mild bleeding; sprains).
2.  Moderate physical damage; medical attention needed (e.g., conscious but sleepy, somewhat responsive; second- degree burns; bleeding of major vessel).
3.  Moderately severe physical damage; medicalhospi[INVESTIGATOR_24610] (e.g., comatose with reflexes intact; third-degree bu rns 
less than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures).
4.  Severe physical damage; medicalhospi[INVESTIGATOR_24611] (e.g.,comatose without reflexes; third- degree burns over 20% of body; 
extensive blood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area).
5.  DeathEnter Code
______
Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medica l damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away 
before run over).
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injur y
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death
2 = Behavior likely to result in death despi[INVESTIGATOR_156187]

ICSD -3 Diagnostic Criteria for Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Adult 
ICD-9-CM code: 327.23 
ICD-10-CM code: G47.[ADDRESS_288746] resistance syndrome (UARS) is subsumed under this diagnosis because the pathophysiology does not significantly differ from that of obstructive sleep apnea. Use of the term Pi[INVESTIGATOR_238214], but also indiscriminately used to describe persons who are only obese and those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 
 
Diagnostic Criteria  
(A and B) or C satisfy the criteria  
A. The presence of one or more of the following: 1. The patient complains of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, or insomnia symptoms.  
2. The patient wakes with breath holding, gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or choking. 
3. The bed partner or other observer reports habitual snoring, breathing interruptions, or both during the patient’s sleep. 
4. The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension, a mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
B. Polysomnography (PSG) or OCST
1 demonstrates:  
1. Five or more predominantly obstructive res pi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]2 (obstructive and 
mixed apneas, hypopneas, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_238215] [RERAs])3 per 
hour of sleep during a PSG or per hour of monitoring (OCST).1

The term respi[INVESTIGATOR_238217] (REI) may be used to denote event frequency based on monitoring time rather than total sleep time.  
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_238218].

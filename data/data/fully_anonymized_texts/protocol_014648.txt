PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title:  A Phase 2, Open -Label, Multi -Dose, Dose Escalation Trial to 
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and 
Pharmacodynamics of Intravenous Infusions of ALN- TTR02  
in Patients with TTR Amyloidosis  
Indication:  Treatment of patients with  transthyretin  (TTR )-mediated 
amyloidosis (ATTR) 
Protocol Number:  ALN -TTR02 -002 
Phase of 
Development:  2 
Design:  Multi -center, multi -national, open -label, multi -dose, dose 
escalation study.  
Consented patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into sequential cohorts of increasing doses of ALN-TTR02, the investigational drug.  Each cohort will comprise 3  patients, who are to  receive 2 intravenous ( IV) 
infusions of ALN- TTR02 , 4 weeks apart . 
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) will evaluate safety in the 
study and determine if it remains acceptable to continue 
dosing per their safety review charter.  To ensure timely safety information exchange across the participating study 
centers,  the SRC will be comprised of all Principal 
Investigators (PIs) participating in the study or their designee, 
the Alnylam Medical Monitor, and the Contract Research Organization (CRO) Medical Monitor.  
The dos ing of cohort s will be as follows:  
• Dosing within a cohort: The first patient will receive 
their first dose and if the dose is well tolerated, per 
Section 5.7.3 (Dose- limiting Toxicity), Patients [ADDRESS_917192] 
48 hours separating dosing of each patient.   
• Dosing of the next cohort: Collective cohort safety and 
tolerability data on Patients [ADDRESS_917193] dose will be reviewed by [CONTACT_12217]; 
if the administered dose i s found to be safe and well 
tolerated, dosing for the next cohort will begin no 
sooner than 96 hours after Patient 3 had safely 
received dose 1 from the previous cohort.  Patients in the cohort would be dosed and reviewed for safety and tolerability follow ing the same procedures as used for 
other cohorts (as stated above) .   
For patients on all dose levels other than the starting 
dose level of 10 µ g/kg, prior to receiving the second 
dose, the SRC will review the cumulative safety and 
tolerability data of at least 2  patients from the previous 
dose level(s) with at least 96  hours of follow-up after 
receiving a second dose of study drug. 
The SR C will also be convened in the event of any potential 
dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) to determine whether stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677957].  
Study Sites  This study is planned to be conducted at up to 10 study 
centers worldwide. 
Investigational Drug:  ALN -TTR02 is comprised of drug substance ALN -[ZIP_CODE] 
(small interfering ribonucleic acid [siRNA] targeting wild type TTR messenger ribonucleic acid [mRNA ] as well as all 
TTR mutations) formulated in a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) containing the following lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: DLin -MC3 -DMA, 
PEG
2000-C-DMG, DSPC, and cholesterol. 
Control Drug:  Not applicable.  
Dosage, Route of 
Administration and Duration of Treatment of Investigational Drug:  Four  cohorts are planned to be enrolled to evaluate 
2 consecutive doses, 4 weeks apart of the following dose levels: 10, 50, 150, and 300 µg/kg ALN-T TR02 .  Based on 
the interim evaluation of safety data, it may also be decided by [CONTACT_677997] 3 additional patients.  Dosing in these 
optional cohorts 
may occur at a previously tested dose that was found to be safe and where stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677958].  Patients in the optional cohort would be dosed and reviewed for safety and tolerability following the same procedures as used  for other cohorts.  Optional 
cohort (s) would be included to further confirm the safety 
and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of previously evaluated dose levels, which may include evaluation of the original dosing regimen  (once every 4 weeks), an alternative  dosing 
regimen (once every 3 weeks), and/or an alternative 
[ADDRESS_917194] 
2 optional cohorts will use the original premedication regimen, and the remaining 3 optional cohorts may be used to explore the alternative premedication regimen and infusion rate.   
The SRC will review all  available safety data and make 
recommendations on dosing and premedication regimens prior to dosing of any of the optional cohorts.  
The Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) will be informed 
of the implementation of optional cohorts.  Up to [ADDRESS_917195]-TTR02:  
• Oral (PO) dexamethasone  (8 mg ) or equivalent 
administered the evening before dosing and [ADDRESS_917196]-TTR02;

• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 
(or equivalent other IV H1 blo cker available at the 
study site) at least [ADDRESS_917204] -TTR02 will be administered IV 
over 60 minutes by a controlled infusion device at a flow rate 
of approximately 3.3 mL/min.   
For patients enrolled in the optional cohorts evaluating the alternative premedication regimen and infusion rate, the flow rate of ALN -
TTR02 will be approximately 1.1 mL/min during 
the first 15 minutes (1/3rd the original flow rate) with the 
remainder of the infusion administered at a flow rate of 3.3 mL/min for a total in fusion time of approximately 
70 minutes. 
The infusion time may be extended up to 3 hours in the event of a mild or moderate infusion reaction (study drug administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe infusion reaction).   
Patients will remain  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677959] 
24 hours following completion of dosing on Days 0 and 28,

[ADDRESS_917228] of Transthyretin Lowering 
Transthyretin (TTR), also known as prealbumin, is a tetramer protein produced 
predominantly by [CONTACT_6566] (>95% of TTR is liver- derived), with a small fraction 
produced in the choroid plexus and retina.1
In humans, approximately 15% of T4 circ ulating in the plasma is bound to TTR; the 
remainder is predominantly bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).  In the mouse, where TTR plays a greater role as a carrier for T4, the absence of TTR reduces circulating levels of T [ADDRESS_917229] the concentration of the hormone in 
peripheral tissues.
2,3     The primary physiological role of TTR is to 
serve as a carrier of retinol (also known as vitamin A); it also plays a minor role as a carrier for thyroxine (T 4).   
Vitamin A circulates through the plasma primarily bound to retinol binding protein (RBP).
[ADDRESS_917230] demonstrated that in the absence of TTR, circulating levels of both RBP and vitamin A are dramatically reduced (e.g., 5% of vitamin A seen in wild type [WT] mice); however, the concentration of vitamin A in the tissues is comparable with that seen in WT mice.
4,[ADDRESS_917231] 30 months with the retinoid fenretinide, which causes a 75% 
reduction in circulating vitamin A levels, there were no reports of night blindness or any other signs of vitamin A deficiency, and only subtle changes in retinal function were seen on electroretinograms in women older than [ADDRESS_917232]-TTR01 who experienced substantial lowering of both TTR and vitamin A (see 
Section 1.3 ). 
1.1.2 Disease Overview  
Mutations in the TTR gene can lead to destabilization of the tetrameric protein and disassociation of the TTR subunits into dimers and individual monomers.  These misfolded TTR monomers (both mutant and WT) can then self-assemble into amyloid fibrils.
[ADDRESS_917233],  and heart being major sites of deposition. 
There are over 100  reported TTR genetic mutations.  These mutations are phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_677964]  a spectrum of disease which is collectively referred to as TTR -mediated 
amyloidosis (ATTR).
10  There is a range o f clinical manifestations of ATTR; the most 
common manifestations include some form of cardiac and/or neurologic involvement (e.g., cardiomyopathy, autonomic neuropathy, and sensory and motor neuropathy) that depends, in part, upon the particular TTR mutat ion and the site of amyloid deposition.  
Transthyretin amyloidosis is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, with a life expectancy limited to approximately [ADDRESS_917234] been de scribed: familial amyloidotic 
polyneuropathy (FAP) and familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (FAC), both of which are characterized by [CONTACT_678000].
12   
Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy , caused predominantly by [CONTACT_941] V30M mutation, 
occurs primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden and Japan, has an earlier onset (age 30 -50 years), and is characterized initially by [CONTACT_678001], orthostatic hypotension, and bladder dysfunction.
13,14  Amyloid infiltration of the sinus node and atrioventricular conduction 
system in the heart is also common in FAP.  Sudden death is not uncommon in FAP, and is believed to result from heart block or tachyarrhythmias.
15,16   
Familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, caused primarily by [CONTACT_678002] V122I, is a late-onset (age >60 years) syndrome in which amyloid deposition is largely restricted to 
the heart a nd manifests as conduction defects, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and 
death; neuropathy is uncommon.
17  The V122I mutation is found in up to 4% of African 
[ADDRESS_917235]-TTR02- 002

Americans and in over 5% of West African populations, although rates of disease 
penetrance ar e low.18   
It is estimated that 45,000 – 50,[ADDRESS_917236] 20 years in an attempt to treat ATTR.
1  However, the procedure is only 
effective in halting or slowing the progression of disease in patients with an e arly age of 
onset,21 especially for those with the V30M mutation and short disease duration prior to 
transplant; consequently almost two- thirds of ATTR patients are not transplant -eligible.  
When performed early in the course of the disease, liver transplantation can stabilize and slow progression of neuropathy in patients with FAP due to V30M.  However, in FAC patients and FAP patients with evidence of cardiac involvement, liver transplantation is contraindicated since it does not halt the progression of ca rdiac disease in these 
patients ,
22,23,24,25 and may actually accelerate the course of cardiomyopathy due to further 
deposition of WT TTR (originating from the transplanted liver) in the heart.26 
Tafamidis, a TTR tetramer stabilizer, was approved (November 2011)  in the European 
Union (EU) for the treatment of ATTR in adult patients with stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy to delay peripheral neurologic impairment.
27  However, t he large 
majority of ATTR patients do not qualify for either liver transplantation or taf amidis.  In 
these patients, the disease is primarily managed with palliative care.   
1.1.3 RNA interference  
Ribonucleic interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring cellular mechanism for regulating gene expression that is mediated by “small interfering ribonucleic acids” (siRNAs).
28  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], synthetic siRNAs are 19 to 23 base pair double-stranded 
oligonucleotides in a staggered duplex with a 2-nucleotide overhang at one or both of the 3' ends.  Such siRNAs can be designed to target an endogenous or vir ally-expressed gene.  
When introduced into cells, the net effect of an RNAi- based pharmacological approach is 
the binding of the siRNA to its complementary messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence, cleavage of this target mRNA, and suppression of the tar get protein.

Unformulated siRNAs, and those without chemical modification, are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_677965], and thus do not achieve significant tissue 
distribution.30  As a result, various formulations are used to target siRNA distribution to 
tissues, and to facilitate their uptake into the relevant cell type.  One  approach that has 
been used successfully in vivo , including in rodents and non- human primates (NHPs), 
employs intravenous (IV) delivery of siRNAs in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs).,31,32,33,34  
These LNPs, with their small size (<100 nm) and low surface charge, c an pass through 
the fenestrated vascular endothelium of the liver.  Endocytosis of the intact LNPs, followed by [CONTACT_192130], results in the siRNA engaging the endogenous RNAi machinery desc ribed 
above to cause targeted degradation of the mRNA, and a consequent reduction in target protein levels.

referred to as ALN -TTR02), a synthetic investigation al RNAi therapeutic comprising an 
siRNA (ALN-[ZIP_CODE]) targeting the TTR mRNA. 
Unformulated synthetic siRNAs administered by [CONTACT_678003][INVESTIGATOR_677966], 
thus, do not achieve significant tissue distribution.37  Since 95% of TTR is produced in 
the liver, it was necessary to develop a formulation that could deliver ALN-[ADDRESS_917239]-TTR02, a second generation siRNA LNP formulation termed AF -011, employs the 
same siRNA (ALN -[ZIP_CODE]) as ALN-TTR01, which utilizes the first generation LNP 
(termed stable nucleic acid lipid particles [ SNALP ]).  Both ALN- TTR01 and 
ALN- TTR02 are intended fo r the treatment of patients with ATTR; the AF -[ADDRESS_917240] -TTR02, but has a siRNA targeting a different liver derived protein, that of 
PCSK9.  Since the overall nonclinical toxicology findings are attributable primarily to the 
lipid formulation regardless of the encapsulated siRNA , previous non- clinical evaluation 
(including pharmacology, pharmacokinetics [PK], metabolism, and safety/toxicity), and clinical evaluations of ALN -PCS02 and ALN-TTR01 can provide important data 
regarding the anticipated safety of ALN -TTR02  (see Section  1.3).

1.3 Summary of Clinical Data with siRNA -LNPs  
Clinical trials with multiple different RNAi medicinal products using local or systemic 
administration in indications including age- related macular degeneration, respi[INVESTIGATOR_14256] (RSV) infection, oncology, and renal failure  have been conducted.[ADDRESS_917242]-TTR02 Investigator’ s Brochure (IB), Edition 3, dated 
[ADDRESS_917243]-
TTR02 -001 was a multicenter , randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, single-
ascending dose clinical study conducted in the [LOCATION_006] to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, 
and pharmacodynamic (PD) in healthy volunteers (EudraCT # 2011 005291-42).  ALN-TTR02 was administered as a single 60 -minute IV infusion to healthy volunteers at the 
following doses: 10, 50, 150, 300, and 500 µ g/kg (4 patients per dose level; [ADDRESS_917244]- TTR02 and 1 receiving placebo).  Patients were pre medicated with dexamethasone,

reversible following administration of a single dose, and there were no AEs  associated 
with lowering TTR by >90%.  Further details on this study can be found in the ALN-
TTR02 IB , Edition  3.

siRNA (ALN-[ZIP_CODE]) targeting both WT and all known mutant forms of TTR.  Since TTR amyloid deposits consist of both mutant and WT TTR, it is desirable to be able to 
lower the production of both WT and mutant TTR with a single drug in order to treat the different variants of ATTR.  While liver transplantation has shown both the advantages as well as the limitations of eliminating mutant TTR in FAP, it also underscores the potential advantage of a drug that can lower both  mutant and WT TTR for treating both 
the cardiac and neuropathic complications of ATTR.   
The ALN -TTR02  nonclinical pharmacology data described in Section 1.[ADDRESS_917247]- TTR02  doses, separated by a 4-week period (or a [ADDRESS_917248] optional cohorts), will be administered to patients .  Study drug will be 
administered as a 60-minute IV infusion with the following proposed doses for each  of 
the original cohorts :  10, 50, 150, and 300 μg/kg ALN- TTR02.   For those patients 
enrolled in an optional cohort evaluating the alternative premedication regimen and 
infusion rate, the study drug will be administered IV over approximately [ADDRESS_917249]-TTR02- 002

Based on the preclinical and clinical experience with siRNA -LNPs t o date, it appears that 
the translation of data from animals to humans occurs based on a mg/kg basis.  However, 
taking a more conservative approach, exposures based on allometric scaling as well as body surface area have been estimated, and safety margins were calculated (see Investigator’s Brochure).  Based on allometric scaling, a 2 -fold and 44-fold safety margin 
was determined for the starting dose in humans (10 μg/kg)  
 a similar margin was obtained based o n body surface area.  Based 
on body weight, the margin for the proposed human starting dose is 10-fold and 100-fold

(SRC) prior to approving dosing for the next dose level.  In addition, cumulative safety 
and tolerability data observed in at least [ADDRESS_917252]- second 
dose of the previous cohort will be reviewed by [CONTACT_678004].   
Based on the interim evaluation of safety data, it may also be decided by [CONTACT_678005] 3 additional patients.  Dosing in these cohorts may occur at a previously tested dose that was found to be safe and where stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677958].  Patients in the optional cohort would be dosed and reviewed for safety and tolerability following the same procedures as used for other cohorts.  The optional cohort (s) would be included to further 
confirm the safety and/or PD effect  of previously evaluated dose levels, which may 
include evaluation of the original dosing regimen (once every 4 weeks), an alternative dosing regimen (once every 3 weeks), and/or an alternative premedication regimen and 
[ADDRESS_917253] 2 optional cohorts will use the original 
premedication regimen, and the remaining 3 optional cohorts may be used to explore the alternative premedication regimen and infusion rate .  The SRC will review all available 
safety data and make recommendations on dosing and premedication regimens prior to dosing of any of the optional cohorts.  If this occurs, the Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) will be informed o f the implementation of optional cohorts.  Up to 5 optional 
cohorts of 3 patients each are permitted in this study.  
The optional cohorts will follow the same treatment schema as cohorts 1 to 4, as outlined in Section  5.6. 
1.6 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
No benefit is expected from the transient lowering of TTR during this study.  Please see Investigator’s Brochure for expanded risk/benefit assessment.  
1.6.1 Infusion -Related Reactions 
Infusion- related reactions can occur with systemic administration of certain biological 
agents such as liposomes or monoclonal antibodies.  These may include acute reactions or delayed febrile reactions.  Premedicating patient s with corticosteroids and/or 
antihistamines, or slowing o f the infusion rate, are approaches that have been taken to 
reduce the incidence and/or severity of IRRs.
41,42  Consistent with this, a premedication 
regimen (dexamethasone or equivalent , paracetamol or equivalent, histamine H1/H2 
receptor antagonist [H1/H2 blocker]) similar to that proposed for this study was used in the prior ALN- PCS02 and ALN -TTR01 clinical studies that employed siRNAs in LNP 
formulations ( Section 1.3 ). 
In order to reduce the potential for an IRR with ALN -TTR02, all patients in this study 
will be premedicated prior to dosing with ALN-TTR02.  The premedication regimen will include dexamethasone (or equivalent), paracetamol (or equivalent), and H1 and H2 blockers (as described in Section 5.5).  The infusion rate of [ADDRESS_917254]-TTR02- 002

and reviewed for safety and tolerability following the same procedures as used for other 
cohorts (as stated above).   
For patients on all dose levels other than the starting dose level of 10 µ g/kg, prior to 
receiving the seco nd dose the SRC will review the cumulative safety and tolerability data 
of at least 2  patients from the previous dose level(s) with at least 96  hours of follow-up 
after receiving a second dose of study drug. 
For any DLT, accrual to that dose level will sto p, all dosing will be discontinued, and 
dose escalation will end , pending further evaluation of all available safety data by [CONTACT_203851] (see Section 5.7.4 ).  The SRC may be convened earlier at the discretion of Alnylam 
if important safety issues arise requiring the attention of the committee  (e.g., new safety 
information attained in other ongoing studies with ALN- TTR02 ). 
The duration of patient participation in this study is approximately 36 weeks.  Patients 
will be screened from -45 to -3 days prior to dose administration.  Eligible patients will 
undergo further pre- treatment assessments (performed on Day  0).  P atients receiving the 
original premedication regimen will receive oral premedication with dexamethasone  (or 
equivalent) , paracetamol (or equivalent), and H1 and H2 blockers the night before and [ADDRESS_917261]-TTR02 to reduce the potenti al of an IRR (see 
Section  5.5).  Those patients in an optional cohort evaluating the alternative

The SRC will evaluate safety in the study and determine if it remains acceptable to dose 
escalate or administer the second dose to the next dose level per their safety review 
charter.  To ensure timely safety information exchan ge across the participating study 
centers, the SRC will be comprised of all Principal Investigators (PIs) participating in the study or their designee, the Alnylam Medical Monitor, and the Contract Research 
Organization (CRO) Medical Monitor.  The SRC will communicate frequently to ensure that patients are dosed according to the time intervals specified in Section 5.6 , even as 
patients are being accrued across multiple centers.  
3.2 Safety Assessments  
Safety monitoring will include assessment of AEs, 12- lead ECGs , cardiac monitoring 
(telemetry), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO

pressure, pulse rate, oral body temperature, and respi [INVESTIGATOR_697]), clinical laboratory 
safety tests ( hematology, serum chemistry, LFTs , thyroid function parameters, serology, 
coagulation parameters, urinalysis, cytokines, CRP, and complement factors), and 
physical examinations.  Patient s will be closely monitored for both acute and delayed 
IRRs (see Section 5.11 for clinical guidance).  All IRRs will be recorded as AEs.

4.4.[ADDRESS_917271].  
4.4.2 Blinding Procedures  
Not applicable. 
4.5 Early Patient Withdrawal  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, without 
penalty to their continuing medical care.  A patient will be considered to ha ve completed 
the study if the patient receives both doses of study medication and completes protocol-
specified procedures up through Day  56.   
4.5.1 Reasons for Withdrawal 
The Investigator may withdraw a patient from the study if the patient: 
• Is in violation of the protocol. 
• Experiences a serious or intolerable AE (including infusion reactions). 
• Experiences a DLT ( see Section 5.7.3).  
• Develops conditions lis ted in the exclusion criteria during the course of the study. 
• Becomes pregnant.  
• Requires a prohibited medication ( see Section 5.10).  
• Requests to be withdrawn from the study. 
The Investigator will also withdraw the patient from the study upon the request of 
Alnylam or the SRC, or if Alnylam terminates the study.  Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the Investigator will confer with Alnylam before discontinuing the 
patient , and the SRC will be notified .  A patient may withdraw consent to participate in 
the study at any time. 
[ADDRESS_917272] be 
informed immediately.  If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the Investigator for protocol-specified safety follow up procedures.  The SRC may be notified. 
Patient s who voluntarily withdraw are termed dropouts.  Dropouts may be replaced 
following discussion with the Investigator and Alnylam (see Section 4.5.3).   
Patient s who are withdrawn due to AEs during infusion of the ALN-TTR02 will not be 
replaced.  
If a patient  is withdrawn/withdraws the discharge procedures should be performed and an 
early termination  (ET)  visit scheduled as follows:  
• If a patient  is withdrawn/withdraws prior to Day 56 then the Day 56 assessments 
should be completed; 
• If a patient  is withdrawn/withdraws after Day [ADDRESS_917273] be 
recorded in the appropriate section of the case report form (CRF) and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible.   
4.5.3 Patient Replacement  
Any patient who misses a dose, does not receive 80% of each ALN -TTR02 dose, or who 
discontinues from the study for a non- safety related issue, as determined by [CONTACT_12217], 
[ADDRESS_917274]-[ZIP_CODE] (siRNA targeting TTR mRNA) formulated in LNPs.  The ALN- TTR02 drug 
product is a sterile formulation of ALN- [ZIP_CODE] with lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (DLin -MC3 -DMA, 
DSPC, cholesterol and PEG 2000-C-DMG) in isotonic phosphate buffered saline.  
ALN-TTR02 Solution for Injection contains 2 mg/mL of drug substance ALN-[ZIP_CODE]. 
The ALN -TTR02 drug product is packaged in 10 mL glass vials with a fill volume of 
5.5 mL.  The container closure system consists of a Unite d States 
Pharmacopeia/European Pharmacopoeia ( USP/EP) Type I borosilicate glass vial, a 
Teflon -faced butyl rubber stopper and an aluminium flip- off cap.  
5.[ADDRESS_917275] will prepare the study drug under aseptic conditions.  The amount (in µ g) 
of ALN -TTR02 to be administered will be determined based on the patient’s weight (kg) 
and the dose cohort they are assigned to.  For the first dose, the weight obtained pre- dose 
on Day 0 will be used to calculate the dose of study drug.  The patient’s weight measured 
pre-dose on Day [ADDRESS_917276]-TTR02 dosing based on an assumption of a 
body weight of 104 kg. 
Approximately 200 mL of sterile normal saline (0.9% NaCl) will be added to a sterile 
infusion bag, and the calculated volume of ALN -TTR02  will be withdrawn from the vials 
and injected into the infusion bag. 
Additional study drug preparation details are provided in the ALN- TTR02  Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.[ADDRESS_917277], as appropriate.  All study medication will be stored upright and refrigerated 
at approx imately 5 ± [ADDRESS_917278](s) may be administered to any person not enrolled in the trial.  
Additional preparation details are provided in the ALN-TTR02 Pharmacy Manual. 
5.4 Labeling and Packaging of Study Drug  
All packaging and labelling as well as the production of study medication will be in 
compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) specifications, as described in the Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products Volume [ADDRESS_917279]-TTR02 to reduce the 
potential for an infusion reaction.   
Patients receiving the original premedication regimen will be administered the following : 
• Oral dexamethasone  (8 mg)  or equivalent administered the evening before dosing 
and [ADDRESS_917280]- TTR02;  
• Oral paracetamol (500 mg)  or equivalent the evening before dosing and [ADDRESS_917281]- TTR02;  
• Oral H2 blocker ( e.g., ranitidine 150 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent other 
H2 blocker dose) the evening before dosing and [ADDRESS_917282]- TTR02;  
• Oral H1 blocker, 10 mg cetirizine (hydroxyzine 25 mg, fexofenadine, or equivalent may be substituted if patient does not tolerate cetirizine) the even ing 
before dosing and [ADDRESS_917283] the patient by 
[CONTACT_678008] (Days -1 and 27) to remind the patient of the premedication regimen.  
An alternative premedication regimen and infusion rate can be used in select optional cohorts, as agreed upon by [CONTACT_12217].  The dosing regimen for the first optional cohort will 
be once every [ADDRESS_917284] -TTR02, these patients will rece ive the following premedications: 
• Intravenous (IV) dexamethasone (10 mg) or equivalent, administered at least [ADDRESS_917285] -TTR02;  
• Oral paracetamol (500 mg) or equivalent at least [ADDRESS_917286] -TTR02;  
• Intravenous H2 blocker (e.g., ranitidine 50 mg, famotidine 20 mg, or equivalent, other H2 blocker dose) at least [ADDRESS_917287]-TTR02; and 
• Intravenous H1 blocker: diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent other IV H1 blocker available at the study site) at least [ADDRESS_917288] of  3 patients.  
Study drug will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or designee .  
Study drug doses will be administered as a 60-minute IV infusion (flow rate of approximately 3.3 mL/min) [ADDRESS_917289]-TTR02- 002

Infusion products containing polyvinyl chloride, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (PVC, DEHP) 
must  NOT be used.  For patients enrolled in an  optional cohort evaluating the alternative 
premedication regimen, the flow rate will be approximately 1.1 mL/min during the first 
15 minutes (1/3rd the original flow rate) with the remainder of the infusion taking place 
over 55 minutes (at a  flow rate of approximately 3.3 mL/min)  for a total infusion time of 
approximately 70 minutes. 
The patient’s infusion site will be checked pre- dose, during infusion, and after infusion 
for any safety concerns (e.g., infusion- associated reactions).  The infusion time may be 
extended up to 3  hours in the event of a mild or moderate infusion reaction (study drug 
administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe infusion reaction).  
Patients will remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677959]  24 hours following 
completion of dosing on Day  0 and Day  28 to be observed for safety assessments and PK 
sampling. 
The planned study drug doses are 10, 50, 150, and 300 µ g/kg.

5.8 Measurement of Patient Compliance  
Patient compliance with study drug administration is dependent on the proper preparation 
and administration of IV infusions by [CONTACT_223060].  Because the  study drug 
will be administered by [CONTACT_678009], treatment compliance will be verified by [CONTACT_678010] .  Treatment will be considered 
completed if 80% or more  of each of the doses (based on total volume of the IV solution) 
has been administered to the patient.  
5.[ADDRESS_917302] also be recorded. 
Drug accountability records and inventory will be available for verification by [CONTACT_678011].  Remaining study drug (all used, partially used and unused vials) will be returned to Alnylam  or its specified designee/depot or destroyed at the site 
according to applicable regulations. 
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study.  Study drug 
which has been dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re dispensed to a 
different patient.  
Further instructions about study drug accountability are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. 
5.10 Concomitant Medication / Treatment  
Use of the following medications/treatments is prohibited during study participation: 
• Any investigational agent other than ALN- TTR02 , tafamidis , or diflunisal ; 
• Corticosteroids, other than those administered as premedication s prior to the dose 
of ALN -TTR02 , those used to treat an infusion reaction, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_507919].  
Medications and treatments other than those specified above, including palliative and 
supportive care for disease- related symptoms, are permitted during the study.  
Use of all concomitant medications during screening, pre-dose and post-dose up to Day 56/ET will be recorded on the patient’s CRF.  This will include all prescription 
[ADDRESS_917303]-TTR02- 002 
 16 January 2013 
 
 
Amendment 2.1   
Page 57 of 116 
drugs, herbal preparations, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins, and minerals.  
Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the CRF. 
Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be given by 
[CONTACT_737].  However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details 
regarding the medication are recorded on the CRF, and coded using an internationally recognized and accept ed coding dictionary.  
5.11 Suggested Guidelines for Management of Infusion Reactions 
In the event of an acute infusion reaction, the infusion of study drug will be stopped and the patient closely monitored until resolution of the reaction.  A blood sample shoul d be 
obtained for analysis of tryptase, complement factors (including C3a),  and cytokines at 
the time of the event, or as soon as possible after onset, 1  hour, and 24 hours after the 
start of the reacti on.  In addition, if the infusion is stopped and the s ite is considering 
restarting, a PK blood sample will be taken when the infusion is stopped and this will be 
treated as the EOI sample if the infusion is restarted . 
Drugs that may be used to facilitate resolution and permit resumption of study drug administration include, but are not limited to: paracetamol (or equivalent) , additional 
H1/H2 blockers (e.g., ranitidine), non -steroidal anti- inflammatory  [NSAID], adrenaline, 
supplemental oxygen, IV fluids, and corticosteroids.  For moderate infusion reactions (see Appendix 1), resumption of study drug administration at a sl ower infusion rate (but 
not to exceed 3 hours) may be considered at the Investigator’s discretion.  Study drug administration will not be resumed for any patient following a severe infusion reaction.  If the infusion is delayed, the administration of the infusion should be completed no more than [ADDRESS_917304] a delayed onset following the completion of the infusion.  
The medical management of a delayed reaction (e.g., use of corticosteroids, etc.) would follow similar guidelines as provided above for acute infusion reactions (see Appendix 
2). 
After dosing, patients will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677969] [ADDRESS_917305]-TTR02- 002 
 16 January 2013 
 
 
Amendment 2.1

include, but are not limited to: antipyretics, antihistamines, and oral corticosteroids.  All 
concomitant medications, including self-administered medications, are to be listed on the 
CRF.

6 STUDY VISITS  
The duration of a patient’s participation in this study is approximately 36 weeks.   This 
duration may be extended should optional cohorts with dosing intervals greater than 
4 weeks be included. 
An open- label extension study at the recommended Phase 3 dose and regimen (as derived 
from Study ALN- TTR02 -002) is planned, which will enable the patients who enrolled in 
Study ALN- TTR02 -[ADDRESS_917307] dose 
of study drug, as indicated in Table 1-1 ( Appendix 4 provides the schedule of 
assessments for the optional cohort(s) administered ALN -TTR02 once every 3 weeks). 
Patients determined to be eligible based on screening assessments will receive treatment 
(IV infusion of study drug) on Days 0 (B aseline)  and 28 (or date of second dose 
administration in optional cohorts with dosing intervals greater than 4 weeks) ; for 
patients in optional cohorts evaluating the alternative dosing regimen (once every 3 weeks), ALN -TTR02 will be administered on Days 0 (Baseline) and 21.  Patients will 
remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_677959]  24 hours following completion of dosing 
to be observed for safety assessments and PK sampling.   Patients will return to the study 
site on Days 2, 7, 10, 14, and 21 for follow -up assessments.  In addition, follow-up visits 
after the second dose of study drug (Day 28) will occur on Days 30, 35, 38, 42, 49, and 56 (end-of-study); patients in optional cohorts evaluating the alternative dosing regimen (once every 3 weeks) will have follow -up visits on Days 21, 22, 23, 28, 31, 35, 42, 49, 
and 56.  Patients will also return to the site for a follow -up visit on Days [ADDRESS_917308] visits after Day 2  (but not 
Day 208) that do not require physical examinations.  All patients who discontinue the

• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (an even t which places the patient at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred.  It does not include an event that had it occurred in a

8.3 Eliciting Adverse Event Informatio n 
The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the 
last visit.  The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC).

considerations along with good clinical and scientific judgment when determining the 
relations hip of drug treatments to an AE: 
Definitely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The response to with drawal of the drug should be 
clinically plausible.  
Possibly Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_678021] r drugs 
or chemicals.  Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Unlikely Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality that has no temporal relationship to the medication or has more likely alternative etiology.  
8.7 Assessment of Severity  
Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below.  
Mild:  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal daily activity.  
Moderate:  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with daily activity.  
Severe:   Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity.  Adverse event s characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence.  When changes

in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity 
for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
8.8 Action Taken for Adverse Event  
Action taken in regards to study medication will be defined as: 
• None; 
• Infusion interrupted and restarted at  a later time; 
• Infusion stopped and was not restarted at a later time. 
8.9 Outcome of Adverse Event  
Outcome will be defined as:  
• Resolved (with or without sequelae); 
• Ongoing; 
• Lost to follow up. 
8.10 Coding of Adverse Events 
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
) will be used to code AEs. 
8.11 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by [CONTACT_737].  Any AE 
and laboratory abnormality that meets the above seriousness criteria (Section 8.2) must 
be reported immediately to Alnylam, always within [ADDRESS_917364] the following information:

proportionality of ALN- TTR02  following a single, 15-minute infusion will also be 
determined. 
Plasma and urine samples will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_2329] a validated 
hybridization enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for each of the two siRNAs (both 
encapsulated and unencapsulated).  Analysis of the concentration- time data will also be 
performed by .  The methods will be validated as per

.  Parameters will include, but may not be limited to: C max, tmax, AUC, CL, V ss, and 
Vz.  The AUC will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method (linear 
interpolation).  Other parameters may be calculated, if deemed necessary.  If possible, the terminal elimination phase of th e PK profile will be identified and its slope calculated 
using log- linear regression.  The coefficient of determination of the line fitted to the 
terminal elimination phase will be calculated.  Pharmacokinetic parameters describing the 
systemic exposure of  the test article in the test system will be estimated from observed 
plasma concentration values for each patient.  The amount of siRNA excreted in the urine over the 2 separate and combined collection intervals will be determined and CL

timely manner.  The completed CRF will be collected by [CONTACT_678023].  A copy of the CRF will remain in the Investigator’s files.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_917376] to Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and current standard operating procedures. 
10.1.3 Inspections  
The Investigator will permit trial -related monitoring, audits and review by [CONTACT_678024]/or 
Regulatory Authorities, providing direct access to source data/documents.  The study 
[ADDRESS_917377] agree to allow access to the required patient 
records.  In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow Alnylam, representatives from Alnylam, or regulatory agencies access to all study records.  
10.2 Regulatory Guidelines  
This study will be performed in accordance with the clinical trial agreement, the protocol, all applicable government laws, regulations, and guidances where the study is being conducted including the World Health Organization (WHO) Declaration of Helsinki (Appendix 6 ), the Internation al Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) of Technical 
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), and all other applicable medical privacy laws and regulations. 
10.2.1 Inde pendent Ethics Committee  
National regulations and ICH require that approval be obtained from an IEC prior to 
participation of patients in research studies.  Prior to the study onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICFs, advertisements to be used for patient recruitment, and any other written information regarding this study to be provided to a patient or patient’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_6179]. 
All IEC approvals must be dated and signed by [CONTACT_678025], the clinical protocol by [CONTACT_29985]/or protocol number, and the date approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_139611]. 
No drug will be released to the site to dose a patient until written IEC authorization has  
been received by [CONTACT_192115]. The Investigator is responsible for obtaining continuing review of the clinical research at 
least annually or more often if specified by [CONTACT_6179].  The Investigator must supply Alnylam with written documentation of the approval of the continued clinical research.  
The Investigator will make all attempts to ensure that the IEC is constituted and operates in accordance with Federal and ICH GCP and any local regulations.  
10.2.[ADDRESS_917378] be submitted in writing to the Investigator’s IEC and the Competent Authority for approval prior to patients being enrolled into the amended protocol. 
10.2.4 Informed Consent Form  
Written informed consent in compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR) § [ADDRESS_917379] be approved by [CONTACT_192115], and a copy of the revised ICF provided to Alnylam. 
Before recruitment and en rollment, each prospective patient (or legal guardian) will be 
given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the ICF.  Once the 
Investigator is assured that the patient/legal guardian understands the commitments of participating in the study , the patient/legal guardian will be asked to sign and date the 
ICF.  A copy of the fully signed and dated ICF will be given to the patient.  The original will be maintained in the patient’s medical record at the site.  All active patients will sign an updated ICF if revisions are made to the ICF during the course of the study. 
10.2.5 Study Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator will submit reports of SAEs  as outlined in this protocol.  In addition, the 
Investigator agrees to submit progress reports to his/her IE C per their local reporting 
requirements, or at least annually and at the conclusion of the study.  The reports will be 
made available to Alnylam or designee.  
Deviations from the protocol necessary to protect patient safety should be reported to Alnylam wi thin [ADDRESS_917380] this protocol or the qualifications of study personnel should be promptly reported to Alnylam.  
10.2.6 Financial Disclosure Reporting Obligations  
Each Investigator (including principal and/or any subinvestigators) directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of study patient s is required to provide financial disclosure 
information according to all applicable legal requirement s.  In addition, Investigators 
must commit to promptly updating this information if any relevant changes occur during the study and for a period of one year after the completion of the study. 
10.3 Study Committees  
An SRC will be formed that will evaluate safety  and tolerability data and determine if it 
remains acceptable to continue dosing (administration of second dose of study drug 
within cohorts) or to dose escalate (between cohorts).  The SRC will also be convened in the event of any potential DLT to determine whether stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_677973] a particular dose level have been met (see Section  5.7.4 for  study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]).  The SRC 
is also responsible for making recommendations regarding replacement of subjects that have withdrawn before Day 56 without experiencing a DLT.  In addition, the SRC may be convened at the discretion of Alnylam if important safety issues arise requiring the attention of the committee (e.g., new safety information attained in other ongoing studies with ALN- TTR02).  
To ensure timely safety information exchange across the participating study centres, the SRC will be comprised of all  Principal Investigators  participating in the study, or their 
designee, Alnylam Medical Monitor, and the CRO Medical Monitor.  The SRC will 
evaluate the available safety data post infusion including but not limited to: AEs, vital signs, pulse oximetry, 12- lead ECGs, and available laboratory parameters.  The SRC wi ll 
communicate frequently to ensure that patients are dosed according to the time intervals specified in Section 5.6, even as patients are being accrued across multiple centers.  
The options based on SRC discussion (if stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_27445]) are to:  
• Escalate the dose as planned;  
• Escalate/decrease the dose to an intermediate level;  
[ADDRESS_917381]-TTR02- 002 
 16 January 2013 
 
 
Amendment 2.1   
Page 96 of 116 
• Repeat the dose level only in the event of a safety signal  (not considered severe) 
that indicates that any further dose escalation may affect the safety of the study 
patient s (or to re -evaluate the  PK data or to further characterize PD markers);  
• Terminate the study. 
The membership of the SRC and reporting structure are defined in the SRC Charter.  
10.[ADDRESS_917382] Retention 
Essential documents should be retained for the period of time re quired by [CONTACT_192168].  The essential documents include the signed and dated final protocol, signed and 
dated amendments(s) , if applicable, signed and dated Curriculum Vitae (CVs) of the 
Investigators, copi[INVESTIGATOR_87297], signed ICFs, IEC approval and all related correspondence, financial agreements, regulatory approval, drug accountability, study correspondence, and patient identification codes.  Records will not be destroyed without informing Alnylam in writing and giving Alnylam the opportunity to store the records for a longer period of time at Alnylam’s expense. 
The International Conference on Harmonization requires that patient identification codes 
be retained for at least 15  years after the completion or discontinuation of the study. 
10.6 Discontinuation of the Study by [CONTACT_192169].  If the site does not recruit at a reasonable rate, the study may be discontinued.  Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study medication pertaining to the study must be returned to Alnylam or its representative, and the Investigators, IEC and Regulatory Authorities will be promptly informed of the termination and the reason for the decision.  The Investigator should promptly inform the patients and assure appropriate therapy and follow-up.

• An original signed Investigator agreement page of the protocol and any 
amendments;  
• An IEC and Alnylam approved ICF; 
• Independent Ethics Committee approval of the protocol, and any amendments; 
• Curriculum Vitae  for the Investigator signed and dated by [CONTACT_678026];  
• Financial Disclosure information (if applicable).  
• Other documents which the Investigator should provide before study start or shortly thereafter include: 
o Curricu lum Vitaes  for all Sub -Investigators; these should be signed and dated 
by [CONTACT_192171]- investigators indicating that they are current;  
o Financial disclosure information for all Sub- investigators (if applicable);  
o Advertisements for patient recruitment and any other written information to be 
given to patients or legal guardians and IEC approval of any advertisements and any other written information; 
o Independent Ethics Committee composition:  If the Investigator or any of the Sub-investigators is a member of the IEC, assurance that he/she refrained 
from voting should be provided; 
o Laboratory accreditation and reference ranges for any laboratory values for local laboratories.  
10.[ADDRESS_917385] ensure that the patients’ anonymity will be maintained.   On the 
CRFs or other documents submitted to Alnylam, patients should not be identified by [CONTACT_111242], but by [CONTACT_192172].  If patient names are included on copi[INVESTIGATOR_677974], the names (except for init ials) will be 
obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document.  Documents not for submission to Alnylam (e.g. signed ICFs) should be maintained by [CONTACT_30379].  
Following the principles of the Good Clinical Research Practices and the Portuguese Protection of Personal Data Directive 95/46/EC, only a patient’s number and initials will be used to identify the patient on their study records.  Laboratory samples will be labeled with an independent numbering code, and the label will not contain any other personal identification information.  The numbering code associated with these labels will be held by [CONTACT_192173], thereby [CONTACT_192174].  When reporting results for inter im safety assessment and at the end of the 
[ADDRESS_917386]- TTR02  is halted.  Throughout sample collection, storage (limited, 
staff only access area containing locked sample storage, and limited access sample tracking) and processing, the samples will only be handled by [CONTACT_192175]’s standar d operating procedures.  
The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compi[INVESTIGATOR_677975].  Alnylam must approve any transfer of information not directly involved in the study.

Ethical Principles for Medical Research In volving Human Patient s 
Recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human patient s 
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly Helsinki, Finland, June 1964 and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan (October 1975)  
35th  WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy (October 1983)

INTRODUCTION  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human patient s, including research on identifiable human material and data. The 
Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research in volving human patient s to 
adopt these principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, "The health of my patient will be my first consideration," and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, "A physician shall act in the patient's best in terest 
when providing medical care." 
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human patient s. Populations that are underrepresented in medical 
research should be provided appropriate access to participation in re search.  
6. In medical research involving human patients, the well -being of the individual 
research patient must take precedence over all other interests.  
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human patients is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
[ADDRESS_917412], incentives for patients and provisions for treating and/or compensating patient s who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the 
research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post- study access 
by [CONTACT_156387] s to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or access to 
other appropriate care or benefits.  
15. The resea rch protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance 
and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into cons ideration the laws and regulations of the 
country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research patient s set forth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information 
about any serious adverse events. No change to the protocol may be made without 
consideration and approval by [CONTACT_942]. 
16. Medical research involving human patient s must be conducted only by [CONTACT_678029]. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the sup ervision of a competent and appropriately 
[ADDRESS_917413] then seek the potential patient 's freely -given informed consent, 
preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
[ADDRESS_917414] 
normally seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research or would pose a threat to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential patient is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_30388]. 
27. For a potential research patient  who is incompetent, the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a resea rch study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote the health of the population represented by [CONTACT_545368], the research cannot instead be performed with competent persons, and the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden. 
28. When a potential research patient  who is deemed incompetent is able to give 
assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to the consent of the legally authorized representativ e. The 
potential patient 's dissent should be respected.  
29. Research involving patients who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving inf ormed consent is a necessary 
characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such representative is available and if the research cannot be delaye d, the study 
may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving patient s with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a re search ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the patient or a legally authorized representative.  
30. Authors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication of the results of research. Authors have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human patients and are accountable for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. They should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results should be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be declared in the 
publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this 
Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
[ADDRESS_917415] current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current 
proven interve ntion exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be patient to any ri sk of 
serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be 
informed about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result f rom 
it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a patient to part icipate in a study or the patient's 
decision to withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient -
physician relationship. 
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, after seek ing expert advice, with informed consent 
from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing health or alleviating suffering.  Where possible, this intervention should be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy.  In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

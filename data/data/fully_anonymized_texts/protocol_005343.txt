Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version:  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  11 CONFIDENTIAL   Exploratory Objective  
• To evaluate the benefit of relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered 
with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate on endometriosis-
associated quality of life (EHP -30 total score), work (EHP Work 
Domain), and patient-reported quality of life outcomes (European 
Quality of Life Five -Dimension Five- Level Scale [EQ -5D-5L]) for up to 
52 weeks among patients who previously completed a 24- week treatment 
period in one of the parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102). 
Study Design  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639789] [ADDRESS_855910] completed their participation in one of the 
phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102).  All patients will receive oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered with 
low-dose estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for up to 28 weeks.  Approximately 800 women with endometriosis- assoc iated pain will be enrolled.  The objectives of the study are to 
evaluate long -term efficacy and safety through up to 52 weeks of treatment (including treatment during 
the parent study) of  relugolix co-administered with low-dose estradiol/norethindrone ace tate.  Eligible 
patients will have completed participation in one of the parent studies and consented to participate in this extension study.  B aseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension study 
(referred to as the “Week 24/Baseline visit” in this study)  that coincides with the Week  [ADDRESS_855911] Week 24 procedure in the parent study.  The Week 24/Baseline visit will include vital signs, physical examination,  laboratory 
assessments, a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), bone densitometry, patient-reported outcome 
assessments, and endometrial biopsy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_855912] 
been completed, the investigator will assess patien t eligibility for participation in the open -label 
extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the Week  24/Baseline 
visit.  No MVT -601-[ADDRESS_855913] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week  24/Baseline visit, and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the 
clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior 
to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT-601-3103 
will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take the open- label study treatment 
(relugolix 40 mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once 
daily for 28 weeks.  
During the 28- week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~30-day Follow- Up Period, patients will 
continue to record study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic use, and the functional effects of endometriosis- associated pain (sB &B) in the  electronic diary  
(eDiary ).  Only study- specific rescue analgesic medications will be allowed starting with the 
Week  24/Baseline visit and through the Follow -Up visit and these medications will be taken for control 
of pain and not prophylacticall y.  Health -related quality of life questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, 
NMPP, and dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet or on paper, according to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1 ). 
At the Week 36 visit and Week 52/Early Termination visit, each patient will have an assessment of bone mineral density via dual-ene rgy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA). 
 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version:  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  12 CONFIDENTIAL   
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and 
weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12- lead ECG s, and bone mineral density with 
DXA.  
Patients with a bone mineral density loss of > 3% at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or total hip at their 
Week  52/Early Termination visit relative to the parent study Baseline measurement will undergo 
another bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months after the last dose of study medication . 
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow -up visit.  Patients whose menses has 
not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption 
(eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+0.5) months after the 
Follow- Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked about factors that may affect 
resumption of menses. 
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week 52 
visit, then the Follow -up visit and the follow -up procedures performed under this protocol, including 
the follow -up bone densitometry scan at 6 (±1) months and status of menstruation recovery, may be 
waived.

Dose and Route of 
Administration  Test Product (all patients)  
• Relugolix 40 mg tablet will be co -administered orally once daily with 
1.0 mg estradiol/0.5  mg norethindrone acetate.  The low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy will be over- encapsulated.  Study treatment will be 
administered on an empty stomach. 
Duration of 
Treatment  Study treatment will be self -administered for 28 weeks (Open -Label 
Treatment Period ). 
Concomitant Medicinal Products Systematically Prescribed for All Study 
Patients  
Two protocol- specified analgesics include a first -line non- steroidal anti -
inflammatory drug and a second-line opi[INVESTIGATOR_289355]/acetaminophen 
combination for endometriosis- related pain relief as requ ired.  The specific 
analgesic drugs offered may differ for different countries or regions.   The 
analgesics for each patient will be the same as those prescribed for her during 
the parent study. 
Criteria for 
Evaluation  Descriptive assessments of long -term efficacy and safety will be made 
between the parent study Baseline and the end of the extension study 
(Week  52) for the following parent study treatment groups: 
• Parent Study Group A:  Randomized to 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administere d with 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5  mg 
norethindrone acetate in the parent study; 
• Parent Study Group B:  Randomized to 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily 
co-administered with 1.0 mg estradiol and  0.5 mg norethindrone acetate 
in the parent study; 
• Parent Study Group C:  Randomized to placebo in the parent study. 
The parent study Baseline will be used as the reference point for this 
extension study for all change from baseline- related endpoints.  The pain 
scores during the Baseline Pain Assessment Period of the parent study will establish the patient’s baseline for both the parent study and the extension 
study.

Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_639853] (ie, Parent Study Groups A, B, and C) for the Intent- to-Treat Population.  T he analyses methods 
for efficacy endpoints are similar to those used for the parent studies, unless otherwise specified in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The point estimate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic medications,  
proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic medications) will be calculated.  
The methods for analyzing the additional efficacy endpoints are described in the SAP . 
Safety  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and bone mineral density with DXA.  Safety data analyses wi ll use data from all patients from the parent studies who receive any amount of study drug 
(ie, from parent study Baseline to Week 52).  
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086].  Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse 
events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_639854] (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, high  level 
term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA).  The 
number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_99130], relationship to study drug, and severity.  Laboratory values will be classified 
by [CONTACT_639855] C ancer Institute  CTCAE.  Laboratory shift tables of the parent 
study Baseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced. 
Bone mineral density will be evaluated in all patients at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), femoral neck, and 
total hip at the W eek 24/Baseline, Week 36, and Week 52/Early Termination visits.  The absolute 
change and percent change from parent study Baseline and Z- scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_639856]. 
The mean percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density and 
corresponding 95% CI will be provided for each treatment group.  For patients who were randomized 
to 24 weeks of treatment with relugolix and add-back in the parent studies (Group A in MVT-601-3101 
or MVT -601-3102) and enrolled in the extension study, the lower bound of the 95% CI for mean 
percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(L1-L4) will be compared with a pre- specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to evaluate 
magnitude of bone mineral density loss after 52 weeks of treatment.  If the lower bound is > -2.2%, 
bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add- back treatment will be considered insignificant . 
Sample Size Estimation  
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639857] a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102) and who are eligible and willing to 
participate in the extension study .  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients (67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855925] common gynecologic disorders, evident in 70 to 90% of women with pelvic 
pain symptoms [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown but estimates range from 2 to 10% of women 
of reproductive age [ Dunselman , 2014].  Symptoms range from minimal to severely debilitating.  
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the 
uterine cavity.  Although the ectopic endometriotic lesions are most commonly found in the 
pelvis, they may also be located in the bowel, in the pleural cavity, and elsewhere.  Women with 
endometriosis have an increased risk of abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia 
compared with controls without endometriosis [ Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  In a study of [ADDRESS_855926] common 
symptom leading to diagnosis was dysmenorrhea in approximately 90%, pelvic pain in 
approximately 80%, and dyspareunia in approximately 45%, with 34% of women diagnosed on 
the basis of all three symptoms [Sinaii , 2008 ].  Presenting symptoms of infertility (25%) and 
endometrioma (ovarian mass) (20%) were also common [ Sinaii, 2008].  
The mechanisms of pain in endometriosis are generally postulated to involve production of 
substances such as growth factors and cytokines, the direct and indirect effects of active blee ding 
from endometriotic implants, and irritation of pelvic floor nerves or direct invasion of those 
nerves by [CONTACT_639859] [Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
According to the American Soc iety for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee, 
“Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan with the goal of  
maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgical procedures” [Practice 
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
Although hysterectomy with bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oopherectomy is a definitive treatment of 
endometriosis, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that this option be 
reserved as a last resort for women with debilitating e ndometriosis symptoms who have 
completed childbearing and have failed to respond to alternative treatments [ Practice Committee 
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  Other surgical options for treatment 
of endometriosis include uterosacral nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic 
resection.  Rates of recurrent dysmenorrhea 1  and 3 years after laparoscopic surger y with 
uterosacral nerve ablation were not better than with laparoscopic surgery without nerve ablation 
in a large randomized trial.  Presacral neurectomy, which involves interrupting the sympathetic 
innervation to the uterus, improves pain but is a techni cally challenging procedure associated 
with significant risk of bleeding from the adjacent venous plexus.  Patients may also experience 
constipation and/or urinary retention postoperatively.  Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis 
was found to be more eff ective at reducing pain than diagnostic laparoscopy in a meta- analysis 
of 5 randomized controlled studies.  While laparoscopic treatment is effective, pain can recur, 
and the option of performing multiple surgeries is limited  by [CONTACT_639860]:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  22 CONFIDENTIAL  of pelvic pain from adhesions and decreased ovarian reserve, resulting in reduced fertility.  In 
one retrospective study, subsequent surgery was performed after laparoscopic treatment in 21%, 
47%, and 45% of women after 2, 5, and 7 years, respectively [ Practice Committee of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014]. 
Medical management of endomet riosis includes analgesics and treatments aimed at 
decidualization followed by [CONTACT_639861].  Compared to normal endometrium, 
endometriotic implants are charac terized by [CONTACT_639862], which synergize the activities of each other and promote 
implantation of ectopic endometrium.  In addition, the implants have upregulated estrogen 
synthesis pathwa ys [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 
2014].  Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synergistic process, 
thereby [CONTACT_639863]- associated  pain. 
Medical hormonal options include hormonal contraceptives, progestins, gonadotropin- releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists, danazol, and aromatase inhibitors.  Because of l ack of data 
supporting use of one treatment over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom 
severity, patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability 
[Dunselman , 2014].  The main adverse effects of GnRH agonists relate to induction of a 
hypoestrogenic state (eg, bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms) whereas danazol 
produces androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism, weight gain, and deepening of the voice.  
Some patients treated with GnRH agonists also experience an initial “flare effect” (increased 
pain and bleeding), and this can result in premature discontinuation of treatment.  Side effects of 
progestin treatment can include irregular uterine bleeding, weight gain, mood changes such as 
depression, and bone mineral density loss with long- term use of certain agents.  
The goal of the relugolix phase 3 development plan is to demonstrate that relugolix can decrease 
dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain  (NMPP ) in women with endometriosis safely 
through 12 months of therapy and to evaluate effects on pain-related quality of life and function.  
By [CONTACT_639864] -administration of 
low-dose hormonal add- back therapy, the program ultimately aims to bring to women suffering 
endometriosis- associated pain a long -term oral medical therapy th at significantly reduces pain 
and improves quality of life and provides an alternative to invasive procedures. 
2.2. Relugolix 
Summaries of nonclinical toxicology and previous human experience with relugolix, including 
results of phase 1 and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and in men with prostate cancer, are pro vided in the current relugolix Investigator Brochure, along with 
a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix. 
2.2.1. Indication 
Relugolix  co-administered with low -dose es tradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed 
as a once- daily oral medication for the treatment of  endometriosis- associated pain .  The proposed 
dose of relugolix is 40 mg  administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and 
norethi ndrone acetate are 1 .0 mg  and 0.5 mg  once daily, respectively . 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855927] for the human GnRH receptor.  The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the pr esence of protein 
(40% fetal bovine serum).  Transgenic knock-in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively.  Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_639792] 1 mg/kg and higher.  
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS
Descriptive assessments of long -term efficacy and safety will be made between the parent study 
Baseline and the end of the extension study (Week 52) for the following parent study treatment groups: 
•Parent Study Group A:  Randomized to 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-
administered with 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate in the parent study;
•Parent Study Group B:  Randomized to 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once dailyfollowed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with 1.0 mg
estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate in the parent study;
•Parent Study Group C:  Randomized to placebo in the parent study.
The parent study Baseline will be used as the reference point for this extension study for all 
change from baseline-related endpoints.  The pain scores during the Baseline Pain Assessment 
Period of the parent study will establish the patient’s baseline for both the parent study and the extension study.

4.1. Overall Study Design 
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639789] [ADDRESS_855928] completed their participation 
in one of the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies (MVT-601-3101 or MVT-601- 3102).  All patients will receive oral relugolix 40 mg once daily 
co-administered with low -dose estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for up to

objectives of the study are to evaluate long -term efficacy and safety through up to 52 weeks of 
treatment (including treatment during the parent study) of relugolix co -administered with low -
dose estradiol/norethindrone acet ate.  Eligible patients will have completed participation in one 
of the parent studies and consented to participate in this extension study.  Baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension study (referred to as the “Week 24/Baseline visit” in this study)  that coincides with the Week  [ADDRESS_855929] Week  24 procedure in the parent study.  The Week 
24/Baseline visit will include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, a 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), bone densitometry, patient-reported outcome assessments, and endometrial biopsy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_855930] been completed, the investigator will assess patient eligibility for participation in the open -label 
extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the Week  24/Baseline visit.  No MVT-601-[ADDRESS_855931] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week  24/Baseline visit, and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in 
the clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  27 CONFIDENTIAL  drug for MVT -601- 3103 will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take 
the open- label study treatment (relugolix 40  mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and 
norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once daily for 28 weeks.  
During the 28- week O pen-Label Treatment Period and the ~[ADDRESS_855932] study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, 
analgesic use, and the functional effects of endometriosis -associated pain (sB&B) in the 
electronic diary (eDiary).  Only study- specific rescue analgesic medications will be allowed 
starting with the Week  24/Baseline visit and through the Follow-Up visit and these medications 
will be taken for control of pain and not prophylactically.  Health- related quality of life 
questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet or on paper, according to the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.1). 
At the Week 36 visit and Week 52/Early Termination visit, each patient will have an assessment of bone mineral density via DXA. 
Safety will be assessed throughou t the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and 
weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG s, and bone mineral density 
with DXA.  
Patients with a bone mineral density loss of > 3% at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or tot al hip at their 
Week  52/Early Termination visit relative to the parent study Baseline measurement will undergo 
another bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months after the last dose of study medication. Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow-up visit.  Patients whose 
menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+ 0.5) months after the Follow-Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked 
about factors that may affect resumption of menses. 
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the 
Week  52 visit, then the Follow-up visit and the follow -up procedures performed under this 
protocol, including the follow-up bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months and status of menstruation recover, may be waived.

4.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing 
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639793] (MVT -601-3103) is an extension of 2 replicate, 24- week 
phase 3 studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) designed to establish the efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40  mg once daily in women with endometriosis- associated pain .  This 
28-week extension study pr ovides additional efficacy and safety data up to 52 weeks to 
demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol (1  mg) 
and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg).  The primary objectives of the study are to assess long -term 
efficacy of relugolix 40  mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate for up to 52 weeks on dysmenorrhea and NMPP, common  and burdensome 
symptoms of endometriosis .  The study will also evaluate safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily 
co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 52 weeks, among 
patients who previously completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the parent studies 
(MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102), including adverse events and change in bone mineral 
density. 
The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily.  Data from a phase 2 study in 
women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily (N = 101) suppressed 
estradiol levels to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in 
the group of women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg.  Women in both the 
relugolix 40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary 
endpoint of the study.  Finally, a phase 2 study of doses of relugolix 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily 
administered to women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids 

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855933] on the beneficial decrease in  dysmenorrhea and NMPP .  It 
is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen and low- doses of estrogen are 
sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [ Barbieri , 1992].  The 
combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long-term hormonal add-back 
therapy to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639794], which can occur with 
unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013].  A variety of add-
back hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_639795] 20 years [Archer , 2015; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein , 1998; 
Morris , 2008; Simpson, 2015; Wu, 2014; Zupi , 2004], and a combination of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate has been used as add- back therapy in prior clinical studies with  leuprolide 
(a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone 
mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease 
in menstrual blood loss [ Archer , 2017; Lee, 2016; Franke , 2000] or endometriosis- associated 
pain [ Wu, 2014 ].  The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in 
this phase 3 study is currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) as long -term hormone 
replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal 
women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013].  
A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix 40 mg on ce daily 
alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg 
norethindrone acetate demonstrated that this dose of add- back therapy maintains serum estradiol 
in the 25 to 50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density 
[Barbieri , 1992].  Serum N- and C- telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near 
baseline levels with the addition of the add-back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption 
compared to the group receiving relugolix alone.  Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced 
with the addition of add-back therapy.  The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, 
ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all pharmacokinetic samples 
collected, and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study.  These data also confirm that 
lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg/0. 1 mg combination tablet 
[Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855934] the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the 
hypoestrogenic state induced by [CONTACT_639868] 40 mg.  
The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1.0 mg and 0.5 mg, 
respectively) were used in the parent studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) and represent 
less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_639796] [ADDRESS_855935] on efficacy, while mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and 
vasomotor symptoms. 
In summary, relugolix at a d ose of 40 mg once daily resulted in a significant decrease in 
endometriosis- associated pain in a well -designed large phase 2 study.  However, its 
administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral density loss unacceptable for long-
term treatment.   This phase 3 study extension study will assess long- term efficacy and safety of 
relugolix 40 mg co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate to decrease 
dysmenorrhea and NMPP and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorat e some of 
the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes. 
This open- label extension study will allow for a description of long -term efficacy data and safety 
for an additional 28 weeks of treatment, providing approximately 1 year of efficacy and safety 
data from the women originally randomized to relugolix in studies (MVT-601-3101 and 
MVT -601-3102).  This study design will allow eligible patients with  endometriosis -associated 
pain, who were randomized to placebo in the parent study, to receive relugolix co -administered 
with low -dose hormonal add-back therapy during the extension. 
4.3. Selection of Study Population

Myovant Sciences GmbH  33 CONFIDENTIAL  study, and thus all eligible patients are assigned to the same treatmen t group of relugolix 40 mg 
co-administered with low-dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate (see Section  5.1 for 
treatment details).  
4.5. Removal of Patients from Therapy 
Completion of the Week 52 visit defines completion of the study.  Patients may withdraw 
consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason.  Investigators or the medical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below.  Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Early Termination visit (see the Week  52 
visit on the Schedule of A ctivities, Section  1.1) and will have a Follow- up visit to assess safety 
approximately 30 days after the end of study drug treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).  
The following safety and/or compliance events will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved: 
• Any adverse event that i s intolerable to the patient and that cannot be ameliorated by [CONTACT_201449], or that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_639797]; 
• If it is discovered after enrollment that a patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria and 
continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the patient’s health; 
• If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be discontinued immediately with appropriate  clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a 
patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status): 
o ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855940]; or  
o ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855941] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
o ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855942] in conjunction w ith elevated total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_855943] or 
international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5; or 
o ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855944] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%);  
• QT interval by [CONTACT_639869] (QTcF) prolongation of more than [ADDRESS_855945]; 
• Evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma on endometrial biopsy; 
• If the patient has a ≥ 7% loss of bone mineral density at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or 
femoral neck compared with the parent study Baseline; 
• If the patient, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_624356], is grossly noncompliant with the protocol’s requirements.  Gross noncompliance includes < 75% 
compliance with the study drug over > 2 consecutive months; missing multiple study visits; and persistent (>  2 consecutive months) with < 50% of the required number of 
days of eDiary completion.  Investigators will follow  up with the patient and encourage 
compliance with study drug or eDiary prior to discontinuing her from the study; 
• If the patient becomes pregnant at any time after providing a signed informed consent form, the patient must be withdrawn immediately (see Section  7.8 for information on 
pregnancy reporting).  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855946] the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible.  The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous noncompliance.  In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970].  The site should attempt at least three documented telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they  can 
appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 
4.6. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance 
In this study, medications and devices containing hormones for contraception are excluded, and patients must agree to use nonhormonal contraception throughout the study unless any of the following apply: 
•Has a sexual partner(s) who was vasectomized at least 6 months prior to theWeek  24/Baseline visit;
•Had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as
Essure™ ) at least 6  months prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit (patients with Essure
must have prior confirmation of tubal occlusion by [CONTACT_31084][INVESTIGATOR_8913]) and there must
be no evidence of post-Essure syndrome;
•Has a nonhormonal intrauterine device (eg, Paragard®) placed in the uterus;
•Is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use
of nonhormonal contraception as described below;
•Practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as her preferred lifestyle; peri odic
abstinence is not acceptable.
The only acceptable methods of contraception for those for whom one of the above methods do 
not apply are: 
•Condom (male or female condom) with or without spermicide (cream, spray, foam, gel,
suppository, or polymer film);
•Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used);
•Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); or
•Vaginal sponge impregnated with spermicide used with a condom.
Patients will be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
informed consent process and will confirm with signing of the consent form that they understand the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study.  Patients may not donate ova during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_855947] study dose of study drug 
provided her menstrual cycle has returned. 
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at monthly intervals during the study (including just 
prior to receiving the first dose of study drug), and patients will receive continued guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedures.  Patients who become

stratified upon enrollment in this study.  
5.4. Directions for Administration 
All study patients will tak e a study treatment of one tablet and one capsule once daily.  
The study treatment should be taken in the fasted state (other than water, tea, or coffee) in the 
morning, at least [ADDRESS_855950] 1 hour befor e or 
2 hours after eating a meal.   The study treatment should be taken as close as possible to the same 
time of morning each day. 
On Week  24/Baseline and Week 52 clinic visit days, study drug will be administered  in the clinic 
rather than at home (see Schedule of Activities in Section  1.1). 
5.5. Dose Reduction/Dose Administration 
No toxicity -related dose reducti ons of study drug are permitted.  Patients who experience a 
grade  [ADDRESS_855951] their treatment interrupted until the toxicity improves to a grade 2 or lower severit y.  
Patients may subsequently be re-started on study drug with the written approval of the sponsor 
(or designee).  
5.6. Storage, Packaging, and Labeling 
Study drug should be stored in an appropriate, limited- access, secure location within a 
temperature range of 20°C to 25°C with excursion to 15°C to 30°C permitted until it is used or

5.8. Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance 
Patients should complete their eDiary each day on study and should bring all unused and used study drug to each study visit. 
Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded.  If a patient is 
persistently noncompliant with the study treatment, it may be appropriate to withdraw the patient from the study (see Section 4.5) .  All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing 
requirement during study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re- educatio n 
must document the process in the patient’s source records. 
Because of the importance to both safety and efficacy evaluation, patients who are grossly 
noncompliant with eDiary completion must undergo an Unscheduled visit to evaluate reasons for 
noncomplia nce and to develop a plan to improve compliance.  Failure to impro ve compliance 
may result in the sponsor withdrawing the patient from further study treatment (including study 
analgesics) and/or discontinuation from the study (see Section  4.5 for details) .

6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
The timing of each study assessment  and procedure is provided in the Schedule of Activities (see 
Section 1.1).  Study procedures are briefly described within Section  6.5.  Further details of the 
procedures are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 
6.1. Schedule of Observations and Procedures 
Assessments should be completed at the designated visit/time points as described in the Schedule 
of Activitie s (see Section 1.1).  The study is divided into 2 periods:  Open- Label Treatment 
Period  and Safety Follow- Up Period .  Unscheduled visits may occur as needed to evaluate 
patients.  
6.2. Open-Label Treatment Period (Week 24/Baseline to Week 52) 
As denoted in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.1) , certain Week 24 visit procedures of 
MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601- 3102 will serve as the Week  24/Baseline procedures for patients 
who are interested in participating in this extension study, and these Week 24 procedures will be performed under the informed consent for the parent study. 
Patients will be required to sign an informed consent form for the extension study, and will be 
eligible if they meet all of the eligibility criteria.  
Once eligibility is determined, all additional Week 24/Baseline visit procedures described in the 
Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) that were not performed as part of the Week 24 visit of 
the parent study will be completed.  These include the following: 
• Informed consent (unless signed previously); 
• Record concomitant medications;  
• Dispense study treatment;  
• Dispense or prescribe protocol- specified analgesic drugs ; 
• Transition the patient within her eDiary from the parent study to MVT -601-3103 
• Take study drug dose in clinic; and 
• Record adverse events, if any.  
The Week [ADDRESS_855953] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit, and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  42 CONFIDENTIAL  Patients will continue recor ding data in their eDiary daily  and taking protocol- specified 
analgesics as needed .  Following the Week  24/Baseline visit, on- treatment study visits will occur 
at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52. 
Accountability for study drug will be performed at each visit.  Instructions for analgesic 
medication usage will be reinforced at each visit.  
Questionnaires are administered on the electronic tablet and on paper at each visit.  These procedures should occur before any other types of study procedures are perfor med.  
Patients will bring their eDiary, analgesic medications, and study drug to each visit.  The site 
must document the start and stop dates of the patient’s menses. 
An endometrial biopsy will have been performed at the parent study Week 24 visit for all 
patients who participated in MVT -601-3101 (see MVT-601-3101 protocol for details).  Safety 
monitoring for this study includes physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy tests, and adve rse event collection at each visit.   Clinical chemistries  will be collected at each 
visit.  A complete blood count will be collected at Week 24/Baseline, Week 28, Week 36, and 
Week 52.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit and Week 52 visit, additional tests include fasting (at least 8 hours, other than water) glucose, lipid profile, and hemoglobin A1c. 
ECGs will be done at the Week 24/Baseline and at the Week 52/Early Termination visits.  Bone 
densitometry will occur at the Week 24/Baseline, Week  36, and Week 52/Early Termination 
visits. Week  52/Early Termination.  Bone densitometry and ECGs will be submitted for central 
reading.  
Study drug compliance will be reviewed at each visit.   Fasting (other than water) for at least 
8 hours is required prior to blood sampling on Week 24/Baseline and Week 52/Early Termination v isits and for [ADDRESS_855954] indicate whether or not the patient was not fasted for their chemistry and lipid testing.  
Refer to the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) for information about study procedures 
during the Open- Label Treatment Period . 
6.3. Early Termination Visit and Follow-up Visit 
All patients withdrawing from the study prior to Week 52 will complete an Early Termination visit.  The Early Termination visit procedures are identical to those of Week 52; however, for patients whose last dose of study drug is during Week 32 or earlier, the bone densitometry does 
not need to be performed.  This procedure may be performed, however, at the investigator’s discretion, if it aid s in follow-up of an ongoing adverse event(s) . 
Patients (including those who complete the Week 52 visit and those who withdraw early from this study) will have a Follow -up visit approximately [ADDRESS_855955].  However, for patients who enroll directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week 52 visit, the Follow- up visit may be 
waived.

including adverse events, clinical safety laboratories, and return of menstruation.  Refer to the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) for individual study visit procedures during the Follow-
up visit. 
6.4. Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time during the study whenever necessary to assess for or follow -up on adverse events, at the pati ent’s request, or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  The date and reason for the Unscheduled visit should be recorded in the source documentation.  The following activities should be completed at Unscheduled visits:  recording 
of reason for the visit, concomitant medication review, and evaluation of adverse events.  In 
addition, procedures such as vital signs, weight, symptom- directed brief physical examination, 
central safety laboratory assessment, urine pregnancy testing, pharmacodynamic sampling, 12-lead ECG, study drug compliance and dispensation, eDiary review, dispensation or 
prescription of protocol- specified analgesics, etc, may be conducted as needed.  See the Schedule 
of Activities ( Section  1.1) for tests that may be performed, as indicated at an Unscheduled visit.  
The investigator should consult with the medical monitor, if needed, to discuss Unscheduled visit testing.  The investigator should obtain approval from the sponsor to perform an unscheduled endometrial biopsy or DXA, unless urgently indicated.

chorionic gonadotropin)  
 
The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for chemistry, hematology, urinalysis,  and 
serum hormone levels.  Each study site will conduct urine pregnancy tests locally . 
All laboratory tests with values that are considered abnormal and clinically significant during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_855959] stabilized.  Abnormal values, determined to 
be clinically significant, should be reported as adverse events. 
The investigator will maintain a copy of the reference ranges (with the record of the reference 
ranges) for the laboratory or laboratories used. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Electrocardiograms  
ECGs (12 -lead) will be obtained at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section 1.1).  ECGs will be measured using standardized equipment provided by [CONTACT_639875] a semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_639803] [ADDRESS_855960].  The 
ECGs will be assessed by [CONTACT_401129] a report provided to the site.  The investigator or sub-investigator (or a qualified individual at the investigational site) will interpret the ECG 
report provided by [CONTACT_624466]:  normal or abnormal.  The investigator or sub- investigator will judge if any of the findings are clinically 
significant.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Bone Mineral Density  
Bone mineral density is determined using DXA scanning and will be assessed at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1, L2, L3 and L4), total hip, and femoral neck (same leg within each patient) at the time 
points described in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.1).  The scans will be read by [CONTACT_639876] .  Training, quality review, and 
readings will be done by a central radiology laboratory as described in the central radiology charter for bone miner al density.  
Throughout the study, the same DXA apparatus will used at each site and operated in the same scan mode for all scans for an individual patient and should be the same as used for the patient during the parent study (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102).  The central core imaging  
laboratory will collect and evaluate all DXA scans for acceptability .  Bone mineral density 
changes for individual patients  will be monitored by [CONTACT_639877]. 
Patients with a bone mineral density loss of > 3% at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_639804]  52/Early Termination visit relative to parent study Baseline measurement will undergo 
another bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months and will be contact[CONTACT_639878]:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017

the time of the follow -up bone densitometry.  The follow-up bone densitometry will be 
submitted for central reading. 
Patients who experience a b one mineral density loss from the parent study Baseline of ≥ 7% at 
any of the anatomical sites assessed will be discontinued from the extension study  and will 
undergo another bone densitometry scan as described above.  Patients should be assessed for 
secon dary causes of bone loss and followed up further if not improving on the 6-month follow-
up scan, unless an alternative etiology has been identified. 
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the 
Week  52 visit, then the follow-up bone densitometry scan at 6 (±1) months conducted under this 
protocol may be waived. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Status of Menstruation Recovery  
If the first menstruation after the end of study treatment administration is observed  before the 
Follow-up visit, the date of onset of the first menstruation is recorded in the eCRF.  Patients whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+0.5) months after the Follow- Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will 
be asked about factors that may affect resumption of menses.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week  52 visit, follow-up under this protocol to determine the status of menstruation recovery 
may not be required. 
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 
Study assessments of safety include adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and bone mineral density assessments . 
7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
Adverse event:   An adverse event  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
Events meeting the definition of an adverse event  include : 
• A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration 
of a pre -existing condition ; 
• Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; 
• Development of symptoms that may or may not be  related to the use of a concomitant 
medication or investigational product; 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  48 CONFIDENTIAL  • Injury or accidents:  If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical 
events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be 
recorded separately) ; and  
• An investigational abnormality (eg,  laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the 
abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_639879]: 
o Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; 
o Requires active intervention; 
o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Events that do not  meet the definition of an adverse event  include: 
• Medical or su rgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration that do not wors en; 
• Situations where an untoward medi cal event has not occurred (eg,  planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639805], with elective defined as known or planned at the time of 
signing of the informed consent); 
• Endometriosis- associated pain is not considered an adverse event in this study because it 
is being quantitatively measured as the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by [CONTACT_639880] 
(CTCAE).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_329886], such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a 
period of consecutive days  are “intermittent”.  All other events are “continuous”.  Additional 
information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death ; 
b. Is life -threatening ; 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  For example, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
NOTE:  In general, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_624417] t has been detained at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_624418]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out- patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639806]:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  49 CONFIDENTIAL  are adverse event s.  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40030], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the adverse event  should be considered serious.  Hosp italization for elective 
treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . 
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
f. Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting 
The reporting of serious adverse events by [CONTACT_456] (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory 
authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria.  Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious 
adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events.  Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  Appropriate questions include: 
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you had any (othe r) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”  
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your 
last visit/contact?  
The patient’s eDiary entries , including bleeding and answers to the other patient-reported 
outcom e measures , will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_639881].  Should the investigator 
or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the info rmation collected with 
these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken.  Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. 
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic.  At the conclusion of the study, the 
investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if 
additional follow-up is  warranted .

completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source 
documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents.  Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing 
the individual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. 
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as descr ibed in Section  7.[ADDRESS_855962], as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.1).  Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the 
safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment.  
Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section  7.6. 
7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug 
The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event .  The 
following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: 
•Probably related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrentdisease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response onreadministration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).
•Possibly related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explainedby [CONTACT_9153].  Information on drug withdrawal maybe lacking or unclear.
•Not related :  A clinical event, including laboratory tes t abnormality, with a temporal
relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or inwhich other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation.
All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record .  In the 
event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  51 CONFIDENTIAL  7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events 
Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial 
infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache.  This is  not the same as “serious ,” which is based on patient/event outcome or 
action taken . 
The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute CTCAE.  For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 
should be used to determine the grade severity. 
Table 7-1 Criteria for Determining  the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified 
by [CONTACT_624550]  
1/Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic 
observations o nly; intervention not indicated 
2/Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living  
3/Severe or medically significant  Not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77081]; dis abling; limiting self -care activities 
of daily living  
4/Life -threatening  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5/Death  Death related to adverse event  
Adverse 
event severity should be recorded  in the appropriate section of the adverse event case 
report form and in the patient’s source documents. 
7.5. Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting 
Adverse events of clinical interest  in this study are defined as any increase in  ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_855963]  elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the Open -Label Treatment 
Period  or the Follow- Up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event 
Form  within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the  event  (see Section  7.6), 
even if the event does not meet SAE criteria .  Additional instructions for evaluating patients 
with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_855964] Abnormalities  
Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA , 2009].  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855965]  abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld  immediately with 
appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory 
profile has retur ned to normal/baseline status) , and the event reported as a serious adverse event : 
•ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855966]; or
•ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855967] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or
•ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_855968] and total bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_855969] or the INR > 1.5; or
•ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_855970] with appearance of fatigue,  nausea, vomiting, right upper
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalitie s resolve to normal or baseline 
values.  The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree wi th any decision to rechallenge.  
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalit ies is considered 
possibly drug induced. 
7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in Association w ith 
Liver Test Abnormalities  
Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the fo llowing 4  criteria are 
met (ie, potential severe drug-induc ed liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
1.AST or A LT increases to ≥  [ADDRESS_855971]; AND
2.Total bilirubin increases to >  [ADDRESS_855972] or INR >  1.5; AND
3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach [ADDRESS_855973] ; AND
4. No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities;
important alternative causes  include, but are not limited to the following:
•Hepatobiliary tract disease ;
•Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus);
•Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary
supplements, plants, and mushrooms;
•Alcoholic hepatitis ;
•Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;
•Autoimmune hepatitis.
If an alternative cause f or hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the 
severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) whether study drug treatment should be withheld or 
permanently discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the patient.  
7.6. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Using a Safety Reporting Form, all serious adverse events must be reported within 24  hours of 
the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event , regardless of the investigator assessment of 
the relationship of the event to study drug. 
The contact [CONTACT_624551], adverse events of clinical 
interest  (defined in Section  7.5), and events of overdose is available on the Serious Adverse

Myovant Sciences GmbH  54 CONFIDENTIAL  In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_624474] y; 
• Closely monitor the patien t for adverse events  and laboratory abnormalities ; 
• All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_3452], 
using a serious adverse event form according to Section  7.6, whether or not the overdose 
is associated with an adverse event ; 
• If possible, obtain a plasma sample for pharmacokinetic analysis within [ADDRESS_855974] dose of study drug if requested by [CONTACT_7195] (determined on a 
case- by-case basis) ; 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF.  
The medical monitor, in consultation with the investigator, will make decisions regarding patien t 
status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patien t. 
7.8. Pregnancy Reporting 
If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patient from the 
study treatment immediately and have her return for an Early Termination  visit.  
If the patient agrees, the investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the 
pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment. 
A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_855975] menstruation, 
estimated concep tion date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this 
form , as available.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report 
the outcome to the sponsor. 
7.9. Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tests, 
Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures 
Section  6.5.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs,  and bone mineral density. 
7.10. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated with relugolix in women include nonserious 
events of hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density .  In this protocol, 
relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on  endometriosis -associated pain .  Low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy with estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of 
bone mineral density during treatment with relugolix . 
Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment in women, based on nonclinical 
data and data available for similar compounds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects

Myovant Sciences GmbH  55 CONFIDENTIAL  (corrected QT [ QTc] prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) , 
reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovasc ular changes (insulin resistance, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increased weight) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, there are potential risks associated with 
the addition of estradiol/norethin drone acetate.  Summaries of findings from both nonclinical and 
clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure . 
The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-2. 
Table 7-[ADDRESS_855976] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Bone Mineral Density  
Reversible loss of bone mineral density is 
a risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced 
by [CONTACT_624438].  This risk is mitigated  by [CONTACT_42020]-administration of low -dose estradiol 
and norethindrone acetate hormonal add-back therapy. Exclusion criteria for a 
history of osteoporosis, 
metabolic bone disease, 
and prior medical therapy 
for low bone mineral density was included in 
the parent studies.  Bone mineral density will be 
monitored at the 
Week  24/Baseline, Week 36, 
and Week 52/Early Termination visits with specified discontinuation and 
follow-up criteria and all 
fractures will be reported as 
adverse events.

8.1. Clinical Procedures 
Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site if necessary prior to  initiation of the 
study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring 
requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the Study Reference Manual  with the site personnel. 
8.2. Monitoring 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) in accordance with current Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  By [CONTACT_12570], the investigator grants permission 
to Myovant Sciences GmbH (or designee) and appropriate regula tory a uthorities to conduct on-
site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the  eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have 
access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports).  During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentialit y.  A study monitor will contact [CONTACT_329957], on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of the study.  It will be the s tudy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF  at regular 
interval s throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, 
correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries , and to meet with the investigator to discuss study 
progress and compliance with the protocol and GCP.  The s tudy monitor should have access to 
laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  For this study, patient data will be 
entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other 
sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). 
Adverse events and concomitant me dications terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced  (WHO -DDE) , respectively.  
The investigator will retain original source documents and the sponsor will re ceive eCRF -
required data as electronic datasets.  Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to the sponsor.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  58 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANAL YSES 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for 
this study.  
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of both the parent and extension studies will be 
presented by [CONTACT_639882].  No formal treatment 
comparisons will be performed for this extension study.  Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.  Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. 
9.1. Randomization Methods  
This is a single -arm, open- label  extension study; patients are not randomized.  All patients who 
have entered the extension study will be treated with open-label relugolix and low-dose hormonal add-back therapy for 28 weeks. 
9.2. Analysis Populations 
Efficacy data analyses will be performed on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population, defined as all 
patients who were randomized in a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102) and who 
have received any amount of randomized study drug. 
Safety data analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who were 
randomized in a parent study and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. The analysis methods for safety and efficacy endpoints are the same as those used for the parent 
studies, unless otherwise specified in the SAP. 
9.3. Sample Size Justification 
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639857] a parent study and who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension study .  It is estimated  that approximately 800 patients (67% of the total of 1200 
patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.  
9.4. Efficacy Analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be conducted using the ITT Population.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_639883].  
The point estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS score s and  use of rescue analgesic 
medications,  proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medications) will be calculated.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  59 CONFIDENTIAL  A responder at a given time point and for a specific type of pain (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) is 
defined as a p atient who had a reduction in that type of pain from Baseline greater than or equal 
to a pre-determined threshold and who did not have an increase in the use of rescue analgesic 
medications for endometriosis- associated pain compared with the use at Baselin e. Patients who 
had a pain reduction less than the pre -determined threshold or who had an increase in the use of 
analgesics for endometriosis -associated pain will be considered non-responders.  The pain 
reduction thresholds will be determined for NMPP and dysmenorrhea separately (see the SAP for details) for the parent studies and these same thresholds will be applied to this study.  
Baseline values are calculated using the Baseline pain assessment period, which is defined as the period from the date of the first dose of placebo in the parent study Run-In Period through the day prior to the date of randomization.  Patients’ average NRS pain scores and use of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis- associated pain  (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) will be 
compared  between a given visit -specific pain assessment period (eg, Week 28, Week 32, etc.) 
and the Baseline pain assessment period.  The visit- specific pain assessment period is defined as 
the last [ADDRESS_855982] dose of study drug treatment received prior to the visit date.  
For any pain assessment period (Baseline or visit -specific), the average NRS scores will be 
calculated for dysmenorrhea and NMPP separately.  An average NRS score for dysmenorrhea is calculated as the average NRS score over the days with menses during a given pain assessment 
period.  An average NRS score for NMPP is calculated as the average NRS score over the days without menses during a given pain assessment period.  The analgesic use for a given pain assessment period is summarized by [CONTACT_639884] 35.  Additional details on calculating dose counts and on the precise definition of an increase in analgesic us e will be 
provided in the SAP. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficacy endpoints (listed below) similar to those used 
for the parent studies. 
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52 in the EHP-30 Pain Domain scores; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in the mean dysmenorrhea NRS 
score;  
• Proportion of patients who are better or much better on the PGIC for dysmenorrhea at Week 52/EOT; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in the mean NMPP NRS score;  
• Proportion of patients who are better or much better on t he PGIC for NMPP at 
Week  52/EOT;  
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in the mean dyspareunia NRS scores;  
• Proportion of patients who are better or much better on the PGIC for d yspareunia at 
Week 52/EOT; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in the mean dyspareunia functional impairment on the sB&B scale;  
• Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in severity scores on the PGA for pain; 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Original, Version :  25-OCT -2017 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  60 CONFIDENTIAL  •Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in function impairment on the
PGA for function;
•Change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52/EOT in each of the non-pain EHP-30domains (Control and Powerlessness, Social Support, Emotional Well -Being, and Self-
Image) ;
•Change from the parent study Baseline pain assessment period to Week  52/E OT in
dysmenorrhea- related functional effects (sB&B);
•Change from the parent study Baseline pain assessment period to Week  52/E OT in
NMPP -related functional effects (sB&B).
For binary endpoints, the point estimate and 2 -sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided 
by [CONTACT_177318]. 
Details on the endpoint analyses including derivations, handling of missing data, and statistical 
methods will be provided in the SAP. 
9.5. Safety Analyses 
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight , 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, [ADDRESS_855983] -baseline toxicity 
grade.  For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by [CONTACT_12397], a shift table based upon the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summarize the parent study Baseline versus post- baseline results.  All data will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_765].  The change from parent study Baseline to each post- baseline study visit will be presented 
by [CONTACT_639885]. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855984]- baseline 
study visit will be presented by [CONTACT_624480].  
The incidence of vasomotor symptoms as assessed through adverse event reporting will be summarized by [CONTACT_639886].  
Bone mineral density data will be collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_639887] (g), bone area (area, cm
2), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) each 
for L1, L2, L3, L4, total hip, and femoral neck, and average bone mineral density of L1- L4 
(lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), Z-score for bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4), total hip, and femoral neck.  
For the relugolix add- back treatment Gr oup A, the lower bound of the 95% CI for (arithmetic) 
mean percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) will be compared with a pre- specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to 
evaluate magni tude of bone mineral density loss after 52 weeks of treatment.  If the lower bound 
is > -2.2%, the bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add- back treatment will be considered 
insignificant.  As supportive analysis, least square means and 95% CI for percent  change at 
Week  52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density will be provided based on mixed 
effects model (assumed missing at random) for each parent study treatment group. 
All data will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_765].  The absolute change and  percent change from 
parent study Baseline to Weeks 36 and 52 and associated 95% CIs will be presented by [CONTACT_639888].  The number and percentage of patients meeting a bone mineral density decline of at least 4%, 5%, 6%, or 7% by 
[CONTACT_266002] (lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or femoral neck) will be estimated with 95% CIs by [CONTACT_639889]. 
Additional analyses will be performed to examine the correlation between bone mineral density 
loss with demographic and baseline characteristics and with treatment exposure.  Details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.6. Pharmacodynamics Analyses 
The change from the parent study Baseline to Week 52 in pre-dose concentrations of serum 
estradiol will be summarized.  Percentage of patients with concentrations of serum estradiol levels < 10 pg/mL and < 20 pg/mL will be provided.

10. RESPONSIBILITIES 
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities 
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted  in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the study participant.  For studies conducted under a US  investigational new drug 
application, the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as 
outlin ed in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors 
and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community D irective 
2001/20/EC. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied.  This 
documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855985]/Independe nt Ethics Committee Approval  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as 
advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_624485].  Approval from the IRB or IEC 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the c ommittee met and granted the approval.  
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 
10.1.3. Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and 
potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures.  The 
investigator must utilize an IRB- or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting 
written informed consent that contains all elements required by [CONTACT_30104], state, local , and 
institutional regulations or requirements .  Each informed consent form will be appropriately 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_11581] t or the patien t’s legally authorized representative and the person 
obtaining consent. 
10.1.4. Confidentiality  
The investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  Only patient  number, date of birth, and an 
identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample 
submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or labor atory.  The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screened and for all patien ts enrolled in the 
study.  
The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited 
to the Investigator Brochure, protocol, e CRFs  and other study forms, the investigational drug, 
and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from the sponsor.  The i nvestigator further agrees to take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_250249]. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855986] the following two categories: 
1) Investigator’s study file.  The investigator’s study file will contain the  Investigator 
Brochure , protocol/amen dments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with 
correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
2) Patient clinical source documents.  The required source data should include the following for each patien t: 
• Patient  identification (name, date of birth, gender); 
• Documentation that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical 
examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria);  
• Participation in the study (including study number); 
• Study discussed and date of informed consent; 
• Dates of all visits; 
• Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed;  
• Results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760]; 
• Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study drug  (drug dispensing, return , 
and accountability should be documented as well); 
• Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and 
causality and intensity  as assigned by [CONTACT_093] ); 
• Concomitant medication (including start and end date) and indication; and  
• Date of study completion and reason for early termination , if applicable.  
All clinical study documentation  must be retained by [CONTACT_639890] [ADDRESS_855987] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, [LOCATION_002], Europe, or 
Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until [ADDRESS_855988] and study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and 
signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory authorities as applicable, decoding procedures for blinded studies, curriculum vitae and all training records of study site personnel, and all correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855989] be completed as specified in the Study Reference 
Manual.   The eCRF casebook for each study patient will be signed by [CONTACT_177012]-investigator (as appropriate)  listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate local health 
authority documents.  This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the 
study (even during a pre-randomization screening period  if an eCRF was initiated).  If a patien t 
withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF.  If a patien t is withdrawn from 
the study because of a treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to 
clearly document the outcome.  
10.1.7. Investigational Product Accountability  
The investigator or investigator’s designee ( eg, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  (including dates and kit numbers) of all used and unused study drug  (active and 
placebos).  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, accountability , and returned or destroyed study 
product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including kit number, date dispensed, P atient ID number, and the initials of 
the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the 
sponsor requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed once the study monitor has reviewed and returned used and unused study drug for accountability purposes.  If the site cannot meet the 
sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor (or designee)  for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_5276]. 
10.1.8. Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or 
IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 
10.1.9. Protocol Complian ce 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855990], then 
notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of 
emergency and the course of action taken.  The investigator must notify the sponsor (or 
designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. 
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden 
to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_4186], and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 
10.2.2. Study Report  
A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies).  The 
sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3).  An abbreviated report may be prepared in 
certain cases.  
10.2.3. Posting of Information on Publicly  Available Clinical Trial Registers  
Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers before enrollment of patien ts begins.  Results will be posted as required. 
10.3. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities 
10.3.1. Access to Information Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH G CP guidelines, the s tudy monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the e CRFs for 
consistency. 
The study monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to 
ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Original, Version :  25-OCT -[ADDRESS_855991] inspections or audits of 
the clinical study.  If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory authority, the 
investigator agrees to notify the sponsor ’s medical monitor immediately.  The investigator agrees 
to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or the s ponsor access to records, facilities, 
and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit. 
10.3.3. Study Discontinuation  
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time.  Shou ld this be necessary, the 
sponsor will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies) and IRBs/IECs.  In terminating the study, the sponsor and the i nvestigator will 
assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the study participant s’ interests.  
10.3.4. Publications  
After conclusion of the study and without prior written approval from the sponsor, investigators 
in this study may communicate, orally present, or publish in scientific journals or other schol arly 
media only after the following conditions have been met: 
• The results of the study in their entirety have been publicly disclosed by [CONTACT_624556], manuscript, or presentation form; or 
• The study has been completed at  all study sites for at least 5  years. 
No such communication, presentation, or publication will include Myovant Sciences GmbH  
confidential information (see Section  10.1) . 
All publications (eg, manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, book chapters) based on this 
study must be submitted to Myovant for corporate review.  The Clinical Study Agreement among the institution, principal investigator, and Myovant will detail the procedures for, and timing of, Myovant’s review of publications.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  18 CONFIDENTIAL  Statistical Methods  
Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_639852].  There will be no between-treatment group comparisons for the extension study data. 
Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_639853] (ie, Parent Study Groups A, B, and C) for the mITT Populatio n.  The analyses methods for 
efficacy endpoints are similar to those used for the parent studies, unless otherwise specified in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The point estimate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic medications,  
proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue a nalgesic medications) will be 
calculated.  
The methods for analyzing the additional efficacy endpoints are described in the SAP . 
Safety  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinica l laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and bone mineral density with DXA.  Safety data 
analyses will use data from all patients from the parent studies who receive any amount of study drug (ie, from parent study Baseline to Week 52).  
Drug exposure will be summar ized by [CONTACT_9086].  Severity of all treatment- emergent adverse 
events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_639854] (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, high  level 
term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_99130], relationship to study drug, a nd severity.  Laboratory values will be classified 
by [CONTACT_639892].  Laboratory shift tables of the parent 
study Baseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced. 
Bone mineral density will be  evaluated in all patients at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), femoral neck, and 
total hip at the Week 24/Baseline, Week 36, and Week 52/Early Termination visits.  The absolute 
change and percent change from parent study Baseline and Z- scores will be summarized b y visit and 
parent study treatment group. 
The mean percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density and 
corresponding 95% CI will be provided for each treatment group.  For patients who were randomized 
to 24 weeks of treatment with relugolix and add-back in the parent studies (Group A in MVT-601-3101 
or MVT -601-3102) and enrolled in the extension study, the lower bound of the 95% CI for mean 
percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(L1-L4) will be compared with a pre- specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to evaluate 
magnitude of bone mineral density loss after 52 weeks of treatment.  If the lower bound is > -2.2%, 
bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add-ba ck treatment will be considered insignificant. 
Sample Size Estimation  
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639893] a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102) and who are eligible and willing to 
participate in the extension study .  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients (67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856005] common gynecologic disorders, evident in 70 to 90% of women with pelvic 
pain symptoms [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown but estimates range from 2 to 10% of women 
of reproductive age [ Dunselman , 2014] .  Symptoms range from minimal to severely debilitating.  
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the 
uterine cavity.  Although the ectopic endometriotic lesions are most commonly found in the 
pelvis, they may also be located in the bowel, in the pleural cavity, and elsewhere.  Women with 
endometriosis have an increased risk of abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia 
compared with controls without endometriosis [ Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  In  a study of [ADDRESS_856006] common 
symptom leading to diagnosis was dysmenorrhea in approximately 90%, pelvic pain in 
approximately 80%, and dyspareunia in approximately 45%, with 34% of women diagnosed on 
the basis of all three symp toms [Sinaii , 2008] .  Presenting symptoms of infertility (25%) and 
endometrioma (ovarian mass) (20%) were also common [ Sinaii, 2008].  
The mechanisms of pain in endometriosis are generally postulated to involve production of 
substances such as growth factors and cytokines, the direct and indirect effects of active bleeding 
from endometriotic implants, and irritation of pelvic floor nerves or direct invasion of those 
nerves by [CONTACT_639859] [Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
According to the American Soc iety for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee, 
“Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan with  the goal of 
maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgical procedures” [Practice 
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
Although hysterectomy with bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oopherectomy is a definitive treatment of 
endometriosis, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that this option be 
reserved as a last resort for women with debilitating endometriosis symptoms who have 
completed childbearing and have failed to respond to alternative treatments [ Practice Committee 
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014] .  Other surgical options for treatment 
of endometriosis include uterosacral nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic 
resection.  Rates of recurrent dysmenorrhea 1  and 3 years after laparoscopic surgery with 
uterosacral nerve ablation were not better than with laparoscopic surgery without nerve ablation 
in a large randomized trial.  Presacral neurectomy, which involves interrupting the sympathetic 
innervation to the uterus, improves pain but is a technically challenging procedure associated 
with significant risk of bleeding from the adjacent venous plexus.  Patients may also experience 
constipation and/or urinary retention postoperatively.  Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis 
was f ound to be more effective at reducing pain than diagnostic laparoscopy in a meta- analysis 
of 5 randomized controlled studies.  While laparoscopic treatment is effective, pain can recur, 
and the option of performing multiple surgeries is limited by [CONTACT_639894]:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  24 CONFIDENTIAL  of pelvic pain from adhesions and decreased ovarian reserve, resulting in reduced fertility.  In 
one retrospective study, subsequent surgery was performed after laparoscopic treatment in 21%, 
47%, and 45% of women after 2, 5, and 7 years, respectively  [Practice Committee of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014] . 
Medical management of endometriosis inclu des analgesics and treatments aimed at 
decidualization followed by [CONTACT_639861].  Compared to normal endometrium, 
endometriotic implants are characterized by o verproduction of prostaglandins and local 
production of estrogens and cytokines, which synergize the activities of each other and promote 
implantation of ectopic endometrium.  In addition, the implants have upregulated estrogen 
synthesis pathways [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 
2014] .  Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synerg istic process, 
thereby [CONTACT_639863]- associated  pain. 
Medical hormonal options include hormonal contraceptives, progestins, gonadotropin- releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists, danazol, and aromatase inhibitors.  Because of lack of data 
supporting use of one treatment over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom 
severity, patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability 
[Dunselman , 2014] .  The main adverse effects of GnRH agonists relate to induction of a 
hypoestrogenic state (eg, bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms) whereas danazol 
produces androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism, weight gain, and deepening of the voice.  
Some patients treated with GnRH agonists also experience an initial “flare effect” (increased 
pain and bleeding), and this can result in premature discontinuation of treatment.  Side effects of 
progestin treatment can include irregular uterine bleeding, weight gain, mood changes such as 
depression, and bone mineral density loss with long- term use of certain agents.  
The goal of the relugolix phase 3 development plan is to demonstrate that relugolix can decrease 
dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain  (NMPP ) in women with endometriosis safely 
through 12 months of therapy and to evaluate effects on pain-related quality of life and function.  
By [CONTACT_639864] -administration of 
low-dose hormonal add- back therapy, the program ultimately aims to bring to women suffering 
endometriosis- associated pain a long -term oral medical therapy that significantly reduces pain 
and improves quality of life and provides an alternative to invasive procedures. 
2.2. Relugolix 
Summaries of nonclinical toxicology and previous human experience with relugolix, including 
results of phase 1 and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and in men with prostate cancer, are pro vided in the current relugolix Investigator Brochure, along with 
a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix. 
2.2.1. Indication 
Relugolix  co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed 
as a once- daily oral medication for the treatment of  endometriosis- associated pain .  The proposed 
dose of relugolix is 40 mg  administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate are 1 .0 mg  and 0.5 mg  once daily, respectively .

extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the 
Week  24/Baseline visit.  No MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856007] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week  24/Baseline visit, and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in 
the clinic after the patient is determined  to be eligible for this extension study and has provided 
informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601- 3103 will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take 
the open- label study treatment (relugolix 40  mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and 
norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once daily for 28 weeks.  
During t he 28 -week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~[ADDRESS_856008] study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic use, and the functional effects of endometriosis -associated pain (sB& B) in the 
electronic diary (eDiary).  Only study -specific rescue analgesic medications should be used 
starting with the Week  24/Baseline visit and through the Follow-Up visit and these medications 
will be taken for control of pain and not prophylactically.  Health -related quality of life 
questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet or on paper, according to the Schedule of Activities (Section 1.1). 
At the Week 36 visit and Week 52/Early Termination visit, each patient will have an assessment of bone mineral density via DXA. 
Safety will be assess ed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and 
weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG s, and bone mineral density 
with DXA.  
Patients with a bone mineral density loss of > 3% at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or total hip at their 
Week  52/Early Termination visit (or most recent scan, if the Week 52/ET scan was not done) 
relative to the parent study Baseline measurement will undergo another bone densitometry scan 
at 6 (± 1) months after the last dose of study medication. 
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow-up visit.  Patients whose 
menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) w ill be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 
(+ 0.5) months after the Follow-Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked 
about factors that may affect resumption of menses. 
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the 
Week  52 visit, then the Follow-up visit and the follow-up procedures performed under this 
protocol, including the follow-up bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months and status of menstruation recover, may be waived.

4.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing 
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639793] (MVT -601-3103) is an extensio n of 2 replicate, 24- week 
phase 3 studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) designed to establish the efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40  mg once daily in women with endometriosis- associated pain .  This 
28-week extension study provides additional eff icacy and safety data up to 52  weeks to 
demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol (1  mg) 
and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg).  The primary objectives of the study are to assess long -term 
efficacy of relugolix 40  mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate for up to 52 weeks on dysmenorrhea and NMPP, common  and burdensome 
symptoms of endometriosis .  The study will also evaluate safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily 
co-administere d with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 52 weeks, among 
patients who previously completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the parent studies 
(MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102), including adverse events and change in bone mineral 
density. 
The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily.  Data from a phase 2 study in 
women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily (N = 101) suppressed 
estradiol levels to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results w ere similar to those in 
the group of women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg.  Women in both the 
relugolix 40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary 
endpoint of the study.  Finally, a phase 2 study of doses of relugolix 10, 20, or 40 mg once daily 
administered to women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids

is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen and low- doses of estrogen are 
sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [Barbieri , 1992] .  The 
combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long-term hormonal add-back 
therapy to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639794], which can occur with 
unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013] .  A variety of add-
back hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_639795] 20 years [Archer , 2015; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein , 1998; 
Morris , 2008; Simpson, 2015; Wu, 2014; Zupi , 2004] , and a combination of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate has been used as add-back therapy in prior clinical studies with leuprolide 
(a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone 
mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease 
in menstru al blood loss [ Archer , 2017; Lee, 2016; Franke , 2000]  or endometriosis- associated 
pain [ Wu, 2014 ].  The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in 
this phase 3 study is currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) as long -term hormone 
replacement therapy to pr event bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal 
women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013].  
A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix 40 mg once daily 
alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg 
norethindrone acetate demonstrated that this dose of add- back therapy maintains serum estradiol 
in the 25 to 50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density 
[Barbieri , 1992].  Serum N- and C- telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near 
baseline levels with the addition of the add-back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption 
compared to the group receiving relugolix alone.  Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced 
with the addition of add- back therapy.  The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, 
ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all pharmacokinetic samples 
collected, and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study.  These data also confirm that 
lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg/0.1 mg combination tablet 
[Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013])  would not provide sufficient serum estradiol

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856010] Characteristics  
Relugolix has no chiral centers.  The compound is slightly to partially soluble in acidic solutions 
but essentially insoluble at neutral pH (pH 7) and above.  It is partially soluble in polar organic solvents.  The compound is provided as an immediate-release pi[INVESTIGATOR_624394].  
The fixed -dose combination tablet of estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg is 
encapsulated in a gelatin capsule with sufficient common back -fill material.  
5.3. Randomization and Stratification 
This extension study is a single -arm, open-label study, and thus, patients are not randomized or 
stratified upon enrollment in this study.  
5.4. Directions for Administration 
All study patients will take a study treatment of one tablet and one capsule once daily.  
The study treatment should be taken in the fasted state (other than water, tea, or coffee) in the morning, at least [ADDRESS_856011] 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating a meal.   The study treatment should be taken as close as possible to the same 
time of morning each day. 
On Week  24/Baseline and Week 52 clinic visit days, study drug will be administered in the clinic 
rather than at home (see Schedule of Activities in Section 1.1).  
5.5. Dose Reduction/Dose Administration 
No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted.  Patients who experience a 
grade  [ADDRESS_856012] their treatment interrupted until the toxicity improves to a grade 2 or lower severity.  
Patients may subsequently be re-started on study drug with the written approval of the sponsor (or designee).  
5.6. Storage, Packaging, and Labeling 
Study drug should be stored in an appropriate, limited- access, secure location at room 
temperature.  Follow storage conditions described on the drug labeling.  Study drug should be 
stored protected from light.  A daily temperature log of the drug storage area must be maintained every working day.  Study drug must be stored under the conditions specified on the label, and remain in the original container until dispensed.  Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study drug, and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study drug.  Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study drug are provided in the Study Reference Manual  and Pharmacy Manual.  The investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856013] maintenance, including receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition 
records and their secure storage.  
Study drug will be labeled with the study protocol number, medication or lot/batch number, contents, directions for use, storage directions, clinical study statement, and any other labeling required by [CONTACT_624537].  Patients will be instructed to store study drug at room temperature out of the reach of children. 
All labels for relugolix  and the estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination to be distributed will 
meet all applicable requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Annex 13 
of Good Manufacturing Practices:  Manu facture of investigational medicinal products (July 
2010) and/or other local regulations as applicable. Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_856014] of protocol- specified analgesics.  Further d etails on analgesic 
medication are provided in the Study Reference Manual . 
5.7. Rescue Analgesic Medications 
Management of endometriosis- associated pain often requires treatment with analgesics and some 
patients require treatme nt with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2631]. Two tiers of pain medications are specified for this 
trial. The study- specified pain medications for each patient will be the same as for the parent 
study. Only study- specific Tier 1 and Tier 2  analgesic medications  (see Appendix 1)  should be 
taken  starting with the Baseline/Week [ADDRESS_856015] the 
medical monitor.  
Short- term use of non-study specified analgesics for the treatment of an intercurrent event  (eg, 
injury or surgery) is allowed, if required. Such events should be reported as adverse events.
 
Investigators must instruct the patient on the use of ibuprofen 200 mg tablets (ie,  number of 
tablets per dose, dosing frequency, maximum number of tablets per day). For patients who may 
need  the Tier [ADDRESS_856016] of the study. 
Quantities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_639809]’s expected usage until the next 
study visit. Prescriptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 rescue analgesic medications should be in accordance with their f ull prescribing information (ie , the local product labeling) and 
prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_639810]. Patients should be counseled on the safe use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Patients who are not prescribed the Tier 2 medication at  the time of enrollment in this study, for 
example,  because requirement for analgesics beyond the Tier 1 medication is not expected (eg, 
based on pain level and/or recent analgesic requirements) should be advised to contact [CONTACT_639895] 1 medication alone. To avoid 
experiencing extended periods of uncontrolled pain, patients who require the Tier 2 medication 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856017] be recorded by [CONTACT_324541] e- Diary.   
5.8. Blinding 
Blinding is not applicable for this open- label extension study.  
5.9. Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance 
Patients should complete their eDiary each day on study and should bring all unused and used 
study drug to each study visit.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit and Week 52/ET visit, all used and 
unused study drug kits should be retained at the site.  New study drug should be dispensed as described in Section  1.1 (Schedule of Activities).  At all other visits, onl y used study drug kits 
should be retained at the site. 
Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded.  If a patient is 
persistently noncompliant with the study treatment, it may be appropriate to withdraw the patient from the stu dy (see Section 4.5) .  All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing 
requirement during study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re- education 
must document the process in the patient ’s source records.  
Because of the importance to both safety and efficacy evaluation, patients who are grossly noncompliant with eDiary completion must undergo an Unscheduled visit to evaluate reasons for 
noncompliance and to develop a plan to improve compl iance.  Failure to impro ve compliance 
may result in the sponsor withdrawing the patient from further study treatment (including study 
analgesics) and/or discontinuation from the study (see Section 4.5 for details) . 
All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement and eDiary  compliance during 
study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the pa tient’s source records.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  52 CONFIDENTIAL  •Situations where an untoward medi cal event has not occurred (eg,  planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639814], with elective defined as known or planned at the time of
signing of the informed consent);
•Endometriosis-associated pain is not considered an adverse event in this study because it
is being quantitatively measured as the primary efficacy endpoin t.
Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by [CONTACT_639900] 
(CTCAE).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_329886], such as vomiting, or those that oc cur repeatedly over a 
period of consecutive days  are “intermittent”.  All other events are “continuous”.  Additional 
information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a.Results in death;
b.Is life-t hreatening ;
NOTE:  The
 term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which  
the study participant was at risk of death  at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  F or example, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without 
evidence of hepatic failure would 
not be 
conside red life-threatening even though drug-i nduced hepatitis can b e fatal.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76260];
NOTE:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639815] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
independent of the duration of that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222228].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1085], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639816] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an adverse event.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct
 
normal life functions.  
This definition is not intended to inclu de experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substan tial disruption.
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
f. Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 Examples
 of such events are 
invasive or 
malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  53 CONFIDENTIAL  allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting 
The reporting of serious adverse events by [CONTACT_456] (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory 
authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria.  Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious 
adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse 
events.  Open- ended and non- leading verbal questio ning of the patient is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  Appropriate questions include: 
•“How are you feeling?”
•“Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”
•“Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since yourlast visit/contact?
The patient’s eDiary entries , including bleeding and answers to the other patient-reported 
outcome measures , will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_639881].  Should the investigator 
or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information coll ected with 
these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken.  Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. 
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until 
the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic.  At the conclusion of the study, the 
investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if 
additional follow-up is  warranted . 
All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents.  Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing 
the individual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. 
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as described in  Section 7.[ADDRESS_856025] dose of study drug or the date of initiation of another

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856028] her return for an Early Termination  visit.  
If the patient agrees, the investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the 
pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment.  
A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_856029] menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this 
form , as available.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report 
the outcome to the sponsor. 
7.9. Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tests, 
Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures 
Section 6.5.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs,  and bone mineral density. 
7.10. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated with relugolix in women include nonserious 
events of hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density .  In this protocol, 
relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on  endometriosis -associated pain .  Low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy with estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of 
bone mineral density during treatment with relugolix . 
Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment in women, based on nonclinical 
data and dat a available for similar compounds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects 
(corrected QT [ QTc] prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) , 
reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovascular changes (insulin resistance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increased weight) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, there are potential risks associated with 
the addition of estradiol/norethindrone acetate .  Summaries of findin gs from both nonclinical and 
clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure . 
The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-2
. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856030] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Bone Mineral Density  
Reversible loss of bone mineral density is 
a risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced 
by [CONTACT_624438].  This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_42020]-administration of low -dose estradiol 
and norethindrone acetate hormonal add-back therapy. Exclusion criteria for a 
history of osteoporosis, metabolic bone disease, 
and prior medical therapy 
for low bone mineral 
density was included in 
the parent studies.  Bone mineral density will be 
monitored at the 
Week  24/Baseline, Week 36, 
and Week 52/Early Termination visits with 
specified discontinuation and 
follow-up criteria and all fractures will be reported as 
adverse events.  
Drug Interactions  Exclusion of co -
administration 
P-glycoprotein 
inhibitors/inducers.  Collection of adverse events.  
QTc Prolongation  
Negative Thorough QT/QTc clinical study. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_624371] > 470 msec in the parent 
studies.  12-lead ECG at the 
Week  24/Baseline and 
Week  52/Early Termination 
visits, and as clinically applicable; withdrawal for 
QTcF >  [ADDRESS_856031] and ALT > [ADDRESS_856032]; total bilirubin 
values > 1.[ADDRESS_856033] results 
(AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_856034]) 
that develop during the 
Open -Label Treatment 
Period  will be reported 
within 24 hours of study personnel awareness.  
Phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_639817] 
(PLD ).  PLD by [CONTACT_639901].  No 
clinical evidence of relugolix- related PLD -
associated toxicity has been observed nor 
was there a clinically meaningful increase 
in a biomarker of PLD assessed in phase 2 
clinical studies.  Patients with significant 
underlying medical condi tions are excluded.  Routine safety monitoring 
including laboratory assessments, ECGs, and 
assessment of adverse 
events, including any 
ophthalmologic adverse events, will be monitored 
during this study.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856035] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Metabolic Changes  
Metabolic changes (insulin resistan ce, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and increased weight) with 
increased risk of diabetes are a potential 
risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by 
[CONTACT_624438]. Exclusion criteria for 
current medical history of 
cardiovascular disease in 
the parent studies.  Fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_624373]. 
Reproductive Toxicity  Premenopausal 
compliance with specified acceptable non-
hormonal contraception; 
exclusion of pregnant and 
lactating women.  Pregnancy testing at each 
study visit; immediate 
withdrawal for  pregnancy.  
Risk of Estradiol (1.0  mg)/Norethindrone 
Acetate (0.5  mg) 
Low-dose estradiol and norethindrone 
acetate are approved for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and the 
treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms.  It is contraindi cated for 
women with a history of breast cancer or estrogen -dependent neoplasia, history of 
(or active) deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolic disease (myocardial infarction or stroke 
within the past year), liver dysfunction, 
prior hypers ensitivity, and pregnancy. Women with breast 
cancer or other estrogen -
dependent malignances, a history of deep vein 
thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, thromboembolic disease, 
liver dysfunction, prior 
hypersensitivity, migraine 
with aura, porphyria, and 
pregna ncy excluded from 
the parent studies.  
Physical examination, 
clinical chemistries, and 
12-lead ECG will be 
performed at the 
Week  24/Baseline visit.  Clinical chemistries 
assessing liver tests, fasting 
glucose and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and urine 
pregnancy tests will be 
performed throughout the 
study.  Adverse events will 
be recorded at each visit.  
 
8. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
8.1. Clinical Procedures 
Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site if necessary prior to initiation of the 
study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the Study Reference Manual  with the site personnel. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  61 CONFIDENTIAL  8.2. Monitoring 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) in accordance with current Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  By [CONTACT_12570], the investigator grants permission 
to Myovant Sciences GmbH (or designee) and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-
site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the  eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have 
access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports).  During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  A study monitor will contact [CONTACT_329957], on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of the study.  It will be the s tudy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF  at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries , and to meet with the investigator to discuss study 
progress and compliance with the protocol and GCP.  The s tudy monitor should have access to 
laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  For this study, patient data will be 
entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other 
sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). 
Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the W orld Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced  (WHO -DDE) , respectively.  
The investigator will retain original source documents and the s ponsor will receive eCRF -
required data as electronic datasets.  Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to the sponsor. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANAL YSES 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical meth ods and analyses for 
this study.  
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of both the parent and extension studies will be presented by [CONTACT_639882].  No formal treatment 
comparisons will be performed for this extension study.  Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.  Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  62 CONFIDENTIAL  9.1. Randomization Methods  
This is a single -arm, open -label extension study; patients are not randomized.  All patients who 
have entered the extension study will be treated with open-label relugolix and low-dose 
hormonal add-back therapy for 28 weeks. 
9.2. Analysis Populations 
Efficacy data analyses will be per formed on the modified  Intent- to-Treat ( mITT) Population, 
defined as all patients who were randomized in a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-
3102) and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. 
Safety data analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who were 
randomized in a parent study and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. The analysis methods for safety and efficacy endpoints are the same as those used for the parent 
studies, unless otherwise specified in the SAP.  
9.3. Sample Size Justification 
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639857] a parent study and who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension study .  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients ( 67% of the total of 1200 
patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.  
9.4. Efficacy Analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT Population.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_639902].  
The point estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dys menorrhea NRS scores and  use of rescue analgesic 
medications,  proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medications) will be calculated.  
A responder at a given time point and for a specific type of pain (dysmenorrhea or NMPP ) is 
defined as a patient who had a reduction in that type of pain from Baseline greater than or equal to a pre-determined threshold and who did not have an increase in the use of rescue analgesic 
medications for endometriosis- associated pain compared with  the use at Baseline. Patients who 
had a pain reduction less than the pre -determined threshold or who had an increase in the use of 
analgesics for endometriosis -associated pain will be considered non-responders.  The pain 
reduction thresholds will be deter mined for NMPP and dysmenorrhea separately (see the SAP 
for details) for the parent studies and these same thresholds will be applied to this study.  
Baseline values are calculated using the Baseline pain assessment period, which is defined as the period from the date of the first dose of placebo in the parent study Run-In Period through the day prior to the first dose  of randomized study drug .  Patients’ average NRS pain scores and use

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  66 CONFIDENTIAL  9.8. Interim Analyses 
There are no planned interim efficacy analyses.  
9.9. Steering  Committee 
The study will be overseen by a Steering Comm ittee consisting of experts in the field of 
women’s health and staff members of Myovant Sciences GmbH.  The Steering Committee will 
participate in the design, conduct, analyses, and publication of the study. 
10. RESPONSIBILITIES 
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities 
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant.  For studies conducted under a US  investigational new drug 
application , the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as 
outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, ar e adhered to.  These 
standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied.  This 
documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator.  The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in 
reportable interests during the study and for [ADDRESS_856037]/Independent Ethics Committee Approval  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_624485].  Approval from the IRB or IEC 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  20 -MAR -2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  69 CONFIDENTIAL  study (even during a pre-randomization screening period  if an eCRF was initiated).  If a patien t 
withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF.  If a patien t is withdrawn from 
the study because of a treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to 
clearly document the outcome.  
10.1.7. Investigational Product Accountability  
The investigator or investigator’s designee ( eg, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug  (active and 
placebos).  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity 
and condition), patien t dispensing records, accountability , and returned or destroyed study 
product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, P atient ID number, and the initials of 
the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the 
sponsor requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed once the study monitor has reviewed and returned used and unused study drug for accountability purposes.  If the site cannot meet the 
sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor 
(or designee)  for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_5276]. 
10.1.8. Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or 
IECs,  or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 
10.1.9. Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 
10.2. Sponsor Responsibilities 
10.2.1. Safety Reporting  
The sponsor will comply with safety reporting requirements consistent with US FDA, EU National competent authority, and Health Canada Guidance 2.8.4, Health Canada Food and Drugs Act and Regulations, Division 5, Part C.05.014, and applicable ICH and regional regulatory safety reporting requirements. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Effective:  [ADDRESS_856038] be submitted to the appropriate IRB or IEC 
for information and approval in accordance with local requirements and to the appropriate Health Authority (eg, FDA, Health Canada, EU National competent authority), if required.
  All protocol 
modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirements.  
Approval must be obtained before changes can be implemented.  The investigator must not 
deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, 
if required.   In medical eme rgencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will remove 
the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC 
immediately regarding the type of emergency and the course of action taken.  The investigator 
must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their 
discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. 
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden 
to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_4186], and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 
10.2.3. Study Report  
A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies).  The 
sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3).  An abbreviated report may be prepared in 
certain cases.  
10.2.4. Posting of Information on Publicly  Available Cl inical Trial Registers  
Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers before enrollment of patien ts begins.  Results will be posted as required. 
10.3. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities 
10.3.1. Access to Information Monitoring 
In accordance with ICH G CP guidelines, the s tudy monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the e CRFs for 
consistency. 
The study monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout 
the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them.  The monitor should have access to any patien t records needed to 
verify the entries on the eCRFs.  The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to 
ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

Study Design  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639789] [ADDRESS_856060] completed their participation in one of the 
phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102).  All patients will receive open- label oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered 
with low-dose- estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for up to 80 weeks.  Approximately 
800 women with endomet riosis-associated pain will be enrolled.  The objectives of the study are to

the parent study.  The Week 24/Baseline visit will include vital sign s, physical examination, laboratory 
assessments, a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), bone densitometry, patient-reported outcome 
assessments, and endometrial biopsy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_856062] 
been completed, the investigator will assess patient eligibility for participation in the open -label 
extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the Week  24/Baseline 
visit.  No MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856063] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the 
clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior 
to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-3103 
will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take the open- label study treatment 
(relugolix 40 mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg  and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once 
daily for 80 weeks.   If necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on 
site, others), and with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for 
MVT -601-3103 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week 24/Baseline visit.   
If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow-up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, electronic diary [eDiary ] completion, etc.). 
During the 80- week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~30-day Follow- Up Period, patients will 
continue to record study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic 
use, and t he functional effects of endometriosis- associated pain (sB&B) in the eDiary.  Only study -
specific rescue analgesic medications should be used starting with the Week  24/Baseline visit and 
through the Follow-Up visit and these medications will be taken for control of pain and not 
prophylactically.  Health -related quality of life questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and 
dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet 
or on paper, according to the S chedule of Activities ( Section  1.1). 
At the Week 36 , Week 52, and Week 104/Early Termination visits, each patient will have an 
assessment of bone mineral density via dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA).    
Safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12- lead ECG s, and bone mineral density with 
DXA.  
Determination of b one mineral density by [CONTACT_639905] -up of findings will 
proceed according to the following rules: 
• For Early Termination occurring between Week 24 and Week 52:  
− For Early Termination occurring before Week 36 , DXA is n ot required at Early Termination 
visit unless it will aid in the assessment of an adverse event.  
Follow-up DXA required at 6 months (± 1 month) if most recent DXA bone mineral density 
loss at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 2% relative to the parent study baseline. 
− For Early Termination occurring after Week 36 , DXA is required  at Early Termination  unless a 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  13 CONFIDENTIAL  DXA result is available from within six weeks prior to Early Termination . 
Follow- up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if the most recent DXA scan was at Week 
24 and bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 2% , relative to 
the parent study baseline. 
Follow- up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, bone mineral 
density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or total hip was > 3% , relative to the parent study 
baseline.  
• For Early Termination occurring between Week 52 and Week 104 : 
− DXA is required at Early Termi nation unless a DXA result is available from within six weeks 
prior to Early Termination. 
− Follow-up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, bone mineral 
density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or total hip was > 7% , relative to parent study 
baseline.  
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow -up visit.  Patients whose menses has 
not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption 
(eg, medical procedure or medicat ions) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+0.5) months after the 
Follow- Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked about factors that may affect 
resumption of menses. 
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix  clinical study upon completion of the Week 104 
visit, then the Follow -up visit and the follow -up procedures performed under this protocol, including 
the follow -up bone densitometry scan at 6 (±1) months and status of menstruation recovery, may be 
waived.

Statistical Methods  
Efficacy and safety data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_639908].  There will be no between-treatment group comparisons for the extension study data. 
There will be two analyses: one at Week 52 and one at Week 104.  A clinical study report will be 
generated from each analysis.  
Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_639853] (ie, Parent Study Groups A, B, and C) for the modified Intent- to-Treat  Populatio n.  The analyses 
methods for efficacy endpoints are similar to those used for the parent studies, unless otherwise 
specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The point estimate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic medications,  
proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic medications) will be 
calculated.  
The methods for analyzing the additional effic acy endpoints are described in the SAP. 
Safety  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead ECG, and bone mineral density with DXA.  Safety data 
analyses will use data from all patients from the parent studies who receive any amount of study drug 
(ie, from parent study Baseline to Week 52  or Week 104 ). 
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086].  Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse 
events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_639854] (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, high  level 
term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The 
number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_99130], relationship to study drug, and severity.  Laboratory values will be classified 
by [CONTACT_639909] o n the National Cancer Institute  CTCAE.  Laboratory shift tables of the parent 
study Baseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced. 
Bone mineral density will be evaluated in all patients at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), femoral neck, and 
total hip at the Week 24/Baseline, Week 36, Week 52, and Week 104/Early Termination visits.  The 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  18 CONFIDENTIAL  absolute change  and percent change from parent study Baseline and Z -scores will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_639910]. 
The mean percentage change from parent study Baseline to  Week 52  in bone mineral density and 
correspo nding 95% CI will be provided for each treatment group.  For patients who were randomized 
to 24 weeks of treatment with relugolix and add-back in the parent studies (Group A in MVT-601-3101 
or MVT -601-3102) and enrolled in the extension study, the lower bound of the 95%  CI for mean 
percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) will be compared with a pre- specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to e valuate 
magnitude of bone mineral density los s after 52  weeks of treatment .  If the lower bound is >  -2.2%, 
bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add- back treatment will be considered insignificant .  The 
95% CI for mean percentage change at Week 104 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral de nsity 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) will be provided along with descriptive statistics for bone mineral density  loss at 
Week [ADDRESS_856068] completed a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102) and who are eligible and willing to 
participate in the extension study .  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients (67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.

n Samples should be obtained in a fasted state (at least 8 hours).  Water is allowed during the fasting period.  
o For Week 24/Baseline samples, see the parent protocol (MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102).  At Week 104/Early Termination, collect a sample for analy sis of 
estradiol concentrations only.  On days when pharmacodynamics samples are collected, administer the study treatment after the pharmacodynamics sample 
collections are collected . 
p All women enrolled in the study will continue to use the patient eDiar y dispensed in the parent study .  Patients will complete daily eDiary entries, including 
NRS pain scores, menstruation information, analgesic drug use, date and time of study drug administration, and sB&B scale scores until Week 52.  After 
Week  52, eDiary scores will be entered over four eDiary collection cycles on the following schedule:  Week 57 to the Week 65 visit, Week 71 to the Week 78 
visit, Week 85 to the Week 91 visit, and Week 98 to the Week 104 visit.  
q Bone densitometry (L1 -L4, total hip, femora l neck) will be submitted for central reading.  
r This procedure is not required at the Early Termination visit in patients whose last dose of study drug was taken during Week 32 or earlier or within 4 weeks 
after completion of the Wek 36 or Week 52 scan. However, the procedure may be done if it will aid in the evaluation of an ongoing adverse event.  
s Determination of bone mineral density by [CONTACT_639905] -up of findings will proceed based on the timing of the Early Termination visit.  
For Early Termination occurring after Week 24 and before Week 36, DXA is not required at Early Termination visit unless it will aid in the assessment of an 
adverse event , and f ollow -up DXA required at 6 months (± 1 month) if most recent DXA bone mineral d ensity loss at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was 
> 2% relative to the parent study baseline.   For Early Termination occurring after Week 36  and before Week 52 , DXA is required at Early Termination unless a 
DXA result is available from within six weeks prior to Early Termination , and f ollow -up DXA is required at 6  months (± 1 month) if the most recent DXA scan 
was at Week 24 and bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 2%  or most recent DXA result was after Week 24 and bone 
mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was >  3%, relative to the parent study baseline.   For Early Termination occurring between Week 
52 and Week 104, DXA is required at Early Termination unless a DXA result is available from within six weeks prior to Early Termination , and f ollow -up 
DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 7%, relative to 
parent study baseline. 
t Endometrial biopsies are to be done per instructions in the parent study.  Procedures for h andling and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_639820] s to the central laboratory for 
analysis  are described in the Investigator Site File .  An endometrial biopsy will have been performed at the parent stud y Week 24 visit for all patients who 
participated in MVT -601-3101 only (see MVT -601-3101 protocol for details), at Week 52 for all patients .  All patients are eligible for a biopsy at Week 104; 
however, patients will have the option to opt out.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856075] dose of the study drug for this study once daily starting with the Week 24/Baseline visit (taken  at the visit).  If necessary for logistical 
reasons (eg, delayed availability of stu dy drug supply on site, others), and with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for 
MVT -601-3103 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week  24/Baseline visit.   If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up 
to 10- day interval, the parent study follow -up procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, eDiary completion, etc.).   The first dose of study drug 
for this extension study must not be taken until all parent study Week [ADDRESS_856076] been completed.  Therefore, results of testing 
required for eligibility (eg, DXA) must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The last dose of study drug will be taken in the clinic during the 
Week 10 4/Early Termination visit.  
x Patients may only take their study -specified analgesics for pain.  Analgesics should not be taken prophylactically (ie, in anticipation of pain).  
y The patient will enter her response(s) into an electronic tablet device at the site. On visits when both tablet and paper questionnaires are being performed at the 
site, the patient should complete the tablet questionnaires before the paper questionnaires.  
z The patient will enter her response onto a paper questionnaire at the site.  Paper questionnaires should be done in the following order:  PGA for function, EHP 
Work Domain.  
aa Collect adverse events from the time that the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856077] dose of 
study drug for MVT -601-3103 should be reported as an adverse event in the parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102).  If events originating in the 
parent study are ongoing at the time of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-3103, please see the Case Report Form Completion Guidelines for instructions 
for recording the follow -up status.  
bb Patients whose menses have not resumed as of the Follow -up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or 
medications)  will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+0.5) months after the Follow -Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and questioned about factors 
that may affect resumption of menses.  
cc A telephone call will be performed at Weeks 57, 71, 85, and 98.  The following activities should be completed: a concomitant medication review, evaluation of 
adverse events, a reminder of compliance with non -hormonal contraception requirements and the need  to call the investigator if pregnancy is suspected, and a 
review of eDiary and study medication compliance.  
 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856078] common gynecologic disorders, evident in 70 to 90% of women with pelvic 
pain symptoms [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown but estimates range from 2 to 10% of women 
of reproductive age [ Dunselman , 2014].  Symptoms range from minimal to severely debilitating.  
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the 
uterine cavity.  Although the ectopic endometriotic lesions are most commonly found in the 
pelvis, they may also be located in the bowel, in the pleural cavity, and elsewhere.  Women with 
endometriosis have an increased risk of abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia 
compared with controls without endometriosis [ Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  In a study of [ADDRESS_856079] common 
symptom leading to diagnosis was dysmenorrhea in approximately 90%, pelvic pain in 
approximately 80%, and dyspareunia in approximately 45%, with 34% of women diagnosed on 
the basis of all three symptoms [ Sinaii, 2008].  Presenting symptoms of infertility (25%) and 
endometrioma (ovarian mass) (20%) were also common [ Sinaii, 2008].  
The mechanisms of pain in endometriosis are generally postulated to involve production of 
substances such as growth factors and cytokines, the direct and indirect effects of active bleeding 
from endometriotic implants, and irritation of pelvic floor nerves or direct invasion of those 
nerves by [CONTACT_639912] [ Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  
According to the American Soc iety for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee, 
“Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan with the goal of 
maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgical procedures” [ Practice 
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
Although hysterectomy with bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy is a definitive treatment of 
endometriosis, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that this option be 
reserved as a last resort for women with debilitating endometriosis symptoms who have 
completed childbearing and have failed to respond to alternative treatments [ Practice Committee 
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  Other surgical options for treatment 
of endometriosis include uterosacra l nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic 
resection.  Rates of recurrent dysmenorrhea 1  and 3 years after laparoscopic surgery with 
uterosacral nerve ablation were not better than with laparoscopic surgery without nerve ablation 
in a large r andomized trial.  Presacral neurectomy, which involves interrupting the sympathetic 
innervation to the uterus, improves pain but is a technically challenging procedure associated 
with significant risk of bleeding from the adjacent venous plexus.  Patients may also experience 
constipation and/or urinary retention postoperatively.  Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis 
was found to be more effective at reducing pain than diagnostic laparoscopy in a meta- analysis 
of 5 randomized controlled studies.  While la paroscopic treatment is effective, pain can recur, 
and the option of performing multiple surgeries is limited by [CONTACT_639860]:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  25 CONFIDENTIAL  of pelvic pain from adhesions and decreased ovarian reserve, resulting in reduced fertility.  In 
one retrospective study, subsequent surgery was performed after laparoscopic treatment in 21%, 
47%, and 45% of women after 2, 5, and 7 years, respectively [ Practice Committee of the 
American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014]. 
Medical management of endometriosis includes analgesics and treatments aimed at 
decidualization followed by [CONTACT_639861].  Compared to normal endometrium, 
endometriotic implants are characterized by [CONTACT_639862], which synergize the activities of each other and promote 
implantation of ectopic endometrium.  In addition, the implants have upregulated estrogen 
synthesis pathways [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 
2014].  Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synergistic process, 
thereby [CONTACT_639863]- associated  pain. 
Medical hormonal options include hormonal contraceptives, progestins, gonadotropin- releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists, danazol, and aromatase inhibitors.  Because of lack of data 
supporting use of one treatment over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom 
severity, patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability 
[Dunselman , 2014].  The main adverse effects of GnRH agonists relate to i nduction of a 
hypoestrogenic state (eg, bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms) whereas danazol 
produces androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism, weight gain, and deepening of the voice.  
Some patients treated with GnRH agonists also experie nce an initial “flare effect” (increased 
pain and bleeding), and this can result in premature discontinuation of treatment.  Side effects of 
progestin treatment can include irregular uterine bleeding, weight gain, mood changes such as 
depression, and bone mineral density loss with long -term use of certain agents.  
The goal of the relugolix phase 3 development plan is to demonstrate that relugolix can decrease 
dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain  (NMPP ) in women with endometriosis safely 
through 12 months of therapy and to evaluate effects on pain-related quality of life and function.  
By [CONTACT_639864] -administration of 
low-dose hormonal add- back therapy, the program ultimately aims to bring to women suffering 
endometriosis- associated pain a long -term oral medical therapy that significantly reduces pain 
and improves quality of life and provides an alternative to invasive procedures. 
2.2. Relugolix 
Summaries of nonclinical toxicology and previous human experience with relugolix, including 
results of phase 1 and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and in men with prostate cancer, are pro vided in the current relugolix Inves tigator B rochure, along with 
a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix. 
2.2.1. Indication 
Relugolix  co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed 
as a once- daily oral medication for the treatment of  endometriosis- associated pain .  The proposed 
dose of relugolix is 40 mg  administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate are 1 .0 mg  and 0.5 mg  once daily, respectively . 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856080] for the human GnRH receptor.  The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the pr esence of protein 
(40% fetal bovine serum).  Transgenic knock-in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively.  Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_639792] 1 mg/kg and higher.

in one of the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parent studies 
(MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102).  All patients will receive open -label oral re lugolix 40 mg 
once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for 
up to 80 weeks.  Approximately 800 women with endometriosis- associated pain will be enrolled.  
The objectives of the study are to evaluate long -term efficacy and safety through up to 
104 weeks of treatment (including treatment during the parent study) of relugolix co-administered with low -dose estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  Eligible patients will have 
completed participation in one of the parent studies and consented to participate in this extension study.  Baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension study (referred to as the “Week 24/Baseline visit” in this study)  that coincides with the Week  [ADDRESS_856082] Week 24 procedure in the parent study.  The Week  24/Baseline visit will include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory 
assessments, a 1 2-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), bone densitometry, patient-reported outcome 
assessments, and endometrial biopsy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_856083] been completed, the investigator will assess patient eligibility for participation in the open- label extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the 
Week  24/Baseline visit.  No MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856084] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in 
the clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided 
informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be 
available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-3103 will de fine enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take 
the open- label study treatment (relugolix 40  mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and 
norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once daily for 80 weeks.  If necessary for logistical reasons  
(eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on site, others), and with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open-label study drug for MVT-601-3103 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week 24/Baseline visit.  If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow-up procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, electronic diary [eDiary ] completion, etc.). 
During the 80- week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~30-day Follow -Up Period, patients 
will continue to record study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic use, and the functional effects of endometriosis -associated pain (sB&B) in the eDiary.  
Only study- specific rescue analgesic medications should be used starting with the 
Week  24/Baseline visit and through the Follow-Up visit and these medications will be taken for 
control of pain and not prophylactically.  Health-related quality of life questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed

Safety will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG s, and bone mineral density 
with DXA.  
At the Week 36, Week 52, and Week 104/Early Termination  visits, each patient will have an 
assessment of bone mineral density via DXA.  Follow-up of bone densitometry findings will proceed according to the rules described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow-up visit.  Patients whose 
menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+ 0.5) months after the Follow-Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked 
about factors that may affect resumption of menses.

4.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing 
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639793] (MVT -601-3103) is an extension of 2 replicate, 24- week 
phase 3 studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) designed to establ ish the efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40  mg once daily in women with endometriosis- associated pain .  This 
80-week extension study provides additional efficacy and safety data up to 104 weeks to 
demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co -administered with low- dose estradiol (1  mg) 
and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg).  The primary objectives of the study are to assess long -term 
efficacy of relugolix 40  mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate for up to 104 week s on dysmenorrhea and NMPP, common and 
burdensome symptoms of endometriosis.  The study will also evaluate safety  of relugolix 40 mg 
once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 
104 weeks, among patients who previously completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the 
parent studies (MVT-601-3101 or MVT -601-3102), including adverse events and change in bone 
mineral density.  
The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily.  Data from a phase 2 s tudy in 
women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily suppressed estradiol levels 
to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of 
women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg .  Women in both the relugolix 
40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of 

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856085] on the beneficial decrease in  dysmenorrhea and NMPP .  It 
is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen and low- doses of estrogen are 
sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [ Barbieri , 1992].  The 
combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long-term hormonal add-back 
therapy to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639794], which can occur with 
unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013].  A variety of add-
back hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_639795] 20 years [ Archer , 2015; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke, 2000; Horn stein , 1998; 
Morris , 2008; Simpson, 2015; Wu, 2014; Zupi, 2004], and a combination of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate has been used as add-back therapy in prior clinical studies with leuprolide 
(a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonis t elagolix, in each case reducing bone 
mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease 
in menstrual blood loss [ Archer , 2017; Lee, 2016; Franke , 2000] or endom etriosis -associated 
pain [ Wu, 2014].  The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in 
this phase 3 study is currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) as long -term hormone 
replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausa l 
women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. 
A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix 40 mg on ce daily 
alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg 
norethindrone acetate demonstrated that this dose of add- back therapy maintains serum estradiol 
in the 25 to 50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density 
[Barbieri , 1992].  Serum N- and C- telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near 
baseline levels with the addition of the add-back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption 
compared to the group receiving relugolix alone.  Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced 
with the addition of add-back therapy.  The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, 
ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all pharmacokinetic samples 
collected, and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study.  These data also confirm that 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  35 CONFIDENTIAL  lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg/0. 1 mg combination tablet 
[Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol 
concentrations to protect against the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the 
hypoestrogenic state induced by [CONTACT_639868] 40 mg.  
The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1.0 mg and 0.5 mg, 
respectively) were used i n the parent studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) and represent 
less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_639796] [ADDRESS_856086] on efficacy, while mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and 
vasomotor symptoms. 
In summary, relugolix at a dose of 40 mg once daily resulted in a significant decrease in 
endometriosis- associated pain in a well -designed large phase 2 study.  However, its 
administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral density loss unacceptable for 
long- term treatment.  This phase 3 study extension study will assess long -term efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40  mg co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate to 
decrease dysmenorrhea a nd NMPP and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorate 
some of the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes.  
This open- label extension study will allow for a description of long -term efficacy data and safety 
for an addi tional 80 weeks of treatment, providing approximately 1 year of efficacy and safety 
data from the women originally randomized to relugolix in studies (MVT-601-3101 and 
MVT -601-3102).  This study design will allow eligible patients with  endometriosis -associated 
pain, including those randomized to placebo in the parent study, to receive relugolix 
co-administered with low -dose hormonal add-back therapy during the extension. 
4.3. Selection of Study Population 
The study population will include approximately 800 premenopausal women aged 18 to 51 years 
with endometriosis- associated pain .

4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient 
Identification Number  
Eligible patients who sign consent will be identified with the same Patient Identification  (ID)  
Number assigned to the patient during the parent study.  This extension study is a single- arm, 
open- label  study, and thus all eligible patients are assigned to the same treatment group of 
relugolix 40 mg co- administered with low-dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate (see 
Section  5.1 for treatment details).  
4.5. Removal of Patients from Therapy 
Completion of the Week 104 visit defines completion of the study.  Patients may withdraw 
consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason.  Investigators or the medical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below.  Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessmen ts for the Early Termination visit (see the Week  104 
visit on the Schedule of Activities, Section  1.1) and will have a Follow- up visit to assess safety 
approximately 30 days after the end of study drug treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).   When patients complete the study or early terminate from the study, they 
must be deactivated from the study in the interactive voice response system/interactive web response system ( IVRS/IWRS ), eDiary, and tablet device.  
The following safety and/or compliance events will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved: 
• Any adverse event that is intolerable to the patient and that cannot be ameliorated by [CONTACT_624458], or that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_639821]; 
• If it is discovered after enrollment that a patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the patient’s health; 
• If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a 
patient’s  laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status): 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856091]; or  
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856092] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856093] in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_856094] or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5; or 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856095] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%);

Myovant Sciences GmbH  39 CONFIDENTIAL  • QT interval by [CONTACT_639869] (QTcF) prolongation of more than [ADDRESS_856096]; 
• Evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma on endometrial biopsy; 
• If the patient has a ≥ 7% loss of bone mineral density at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or femoral neck compared with the parent study Baseline; 
• If the patient, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_624356], is grossly noncompliant with the protocol’s requirements.  Gross noncompliance includes < 75% 
compliance with the study drug over > 2 consecutive months; missing multiple study visits; 
and persisten t (> 2 consecutive months) noncompliance ( < 50% of the required number of 
days) with eDiary completion  up to Week 52 or persistent (≥ 2 eDiary collection cycles) 
noncompliance (< 50% of the required number of days ) with eDiary completion  from 
Week  52 to Week 104.  Investigators will follow  up with the patient and encourage 
compliance with study drug or eDiary prior to discontinuing her from the study; 
• If the patient becomes pregnant at any time after providing a signed informed consent form, the patient mus t be withdrawn immediately (see Section  7.8 for information on pregnancy 
reporting).  
Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol-defined 
window, the site should attempt to contact [CONTACT_118823].  The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous noncompliance.  In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970].  The site should attempt at least three documented te lephone calls and if 
necessary a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 
4.6. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance 
In this study, medications and devices containing hormones for contraception are excluded, and patients must agree to use non-hormonal contraception throughout the study including through [ADDRESS_856097] dose of study drug, unless any of the following apply: 
• Has a sex ual partner(s) who was vasectomized at least 6 months prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit; 
• Had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as Essure ) at 
least 6  months prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit (patients with Essure must have prior 
confirmation of tubal occlusion by [CONTACT_31084][INVESTIGATOR_8913]) and there must be no evidence of 
post-Essure syndrome; 
• Has a non -hormonal intrauterine device (eg, Paragard) placed in the uterus; 
• Is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual rela tionship(s) with men requires the use of 
non-hormonal contraception as described below; 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  40 CONFIDENTIAL  • Practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as her preferred lifestyle; periodic 
abstinence is not acceptable.  
The only acceptable methods of contraception for those for whom one of the above methods do 
not apply are: 
• Condom (male or female condom) with or without spermicide (cream, spray, foam, gel, 
suppository, or polymer film); 
• Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); 
• Cervical cap with spermi cide (condom may or may not be used); or 
• Vaginal sponge impregnated with spermicide used with a condom. 
Patients will be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
informed consent process and will confirm with signing of the consent form that they understand the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study.  Patients may not donate ova during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_856098] study dose of study drug 
provided her menstrual cycle has returned. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed according to the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1; 
including just prior to receiving the first dose of study drug), and patients will receive continued 
guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedures.  Patients should call the investigator immediately if the y suspect they may be pregnant. Patients who 
become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study and followed for pregnancy outcome ( see Section 7.8).

5.7. Rescue Analgesic Medications  
Management of endometriosis- associated pain often requires treatment with analgesics and some 
patients require treatment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2631]. Two tiers of pain medications are specified for this 
trial.  The study-specified pain medications for each patient w ill be the same as for the parent 
study.  Only study- specific Tier 1 and Tier 2 analgesic medications  (see Appendix 1) should be 
taken  starting with the Baseline/Week [ADDRESS_856104] the 
medical monitor.  
Short-term use of non- study specified analgesics for the treatment of an intercurrent event  (eg, 
injury or surgery) is allowed, if required.  Such events should be reported as adverse events  when  
appropriate.  
Investigators must instruct the patient on the use of ibuprofen 200 mg tablets (ie, number of 
tablets per dose, dosing frequency, maximum number of tablets per day) .  For patients who may 
need  the Tier [ADDRESS_856105] of the study. 
Quantities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_639809]’s expected usage until the next 
study visit.  Prescriptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 rescue analgesic medications should be in 
accordance with their f ull prescribing information (ie , the local product labeling) and 
prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_639810].  Patients should be counseled on the safe use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Patients who are not prescribed the Tier 2 medication at the time of enrollment in this study, for 
example,  because requirement for analgesics beyond t he Tier 1 medication is not expected (eg,

5.9. Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance 
Patients should complete their  eDiary each day on study and should bring all unused and used 
(including partially used) stud y drug  kits to each study visit.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit and 
Week 104/Early Termination visit, all used, partially used , and unused study drug kits should be 
retained at the site.   At all other visits, only fully used study drug kits should be retained at the 
site.  New study drug should be dispensed as described in Section  1.1 (Schedule of Activities ). 
Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded.  If a patient is 
persistently noncompliant with the study treatment, it may be appropriate to withdraw the pa tient 
from the study (see Section  4.5).  All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing 
requirement during study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re- education 
must document the process in the patient ’s source records.  
Because of the importance to both safety and efficacy evaluation, patients who are grossly noncompliant with eDiary completion must undergo an Unscheduled visit to evaluate reasons for 
noncompliance and to develop a plan to improve compl iance.  Failure to impro ve compliance 
may result in the sponsor withdrawing the patient from further study treatment (including study 
analgesics) and/or discontinuation from the study ( see Section 4.5 for details) . 
All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement and eDiary  compliance during 
study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the pa tient’s source records.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  49 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
The timing of each study assessment  and procedure is provided in the Schedule of Activities (see 
Section  1.1).  Study procedures are briefly described within Section  6.5.  Further details of the 
procedures are provided in the I nvestigator Site File . 
6.1. Schedule of Observations and Procedures 
Assessments should be completed at the designated visit/time points as described in the Schedule 
of Activities (see Section  1.1).  The study is divided into 2 periods:  Open- Label Treatment 
Period  and Safety Follow- Up Period .  Unscheduled visits may occur as needed to evaluate 
patients.  
6.2. Open -Label Treatment Period (Week 24/Baseline to Week 104) 
As denoted in the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1), certain Week 24 visit procedures of 
MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601- 3102 will serve as the Week  24/Baseline procedures for patients 
who are interested in participating in this extension study, and these Week 24 procedures will be performed under the informed consent for the parent study. 
Patients will be required to sign an informed consent form for the extension study and will be 
eligible if they meet all of the eligibility criteria.  
Once eligibility is determined, all additional Week 24/Baseline visit procedures described in the 
Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) that were not performe d as part of the Week 24 visit of 
the parent study will be completed.  These include the following: 
• Informed consent (unless signed previously); 
• Record concomitant medications;  
• Update the patient’s status in the IVRS/IWRS as being in the MVT -601-3103 and r eceive the 
lot numbers for study drug allocation; 
• Dispense study treatment;  
• Dispense or prescribe protocol- specified analgesic drugs ; 
• Transition the patient within her eDiary from the parent study to MVT -601-3103 
• Take study drug dose in clinic; and 
• Record adverse events, if any.  
The Week [ADDRESS_856107] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the clinic after the patient is determined to be eligib le for 
this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.   If 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  50 CONFIDENTIAL  necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availabilit y of study drug supply on site, others), and 
with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for MVT-601-3103 may 
be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week 24/Baseline visit.   If the first 
dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow-up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, eDiary completion, etc.). 
Patients will continue recording data in their eDiary daily  and taking protocol- specified 
analgesics as needed  until Week 52.  After Week 52, the eDiary will be collected  on the 
following schedule:  Week 57 to the Week 65 visit, Week 71 to the Week 78 visit, Week 85 to 
the Week 91 visit, and Week 98 to the Week 104 visit.  Following the Week 24/Baseline visit, on-treatment study visits will occur at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 65, 78, 91, and 104.  Sites will monitor diary completion using the Trial  Manager web portal throughout the study. 
A telephone call will be performe d at Weeks 57, 71, 85 and 98.  The following activities should 
be completed : a concomitant medication review, an evaluation of adverse events, a review of 
study medication c ompliance, a reminder of compliance with non-hormonal contraception 
requirements and the need to call the investigator if pregnancy is suspected, and a reminder to the patient to start recording in the eDiary daily . 
Accountability for study drug will be performed at each visit.  Instructions for analgesic medication usage will be reinforced at each visit.  
Questionnaires are administered on the electronic tablet and on paper at each visit.  These 
procedures should occur before any other types of study procedures are performed.  When both electronic tablet and paper questionnaires are required at a visit, the electronic questionnaires 
should be done first.  The order in which the electronic tablet and paper questionnaires should be 
administered are as follows:  
• Electronic tablet questionnaires (in the order they appear in the tablet)  
• Paper questionnaires 
− PGA fo r function 
− EHP Work Domain [Week24/Baseline, Week 52 , Week 78, and Week 104 only] 
Patients will bring their eDiary, analgesic medications, and study drug to each visit.  The site 
must document the start and stop dates of the patient’s menses. 
An endometrial biopsy will have been performed at the parent study Week 24 visit for all 
patients who participated in MVT -601-3101 (see MVT-601-3101 protocol for details), at 
Week  52 for all subjects .  All patients will be eligible for the Week 104 biopsy ; however, 
patients will have the option to opt out.  Safety monitoring for this study includes physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy tests, and adve rse event collection at each visit.   
Clinical chemistries will be collected at each visit.  A complete blood count will be collected at Week 24/Baseline, Week 28, Week 36, Week 52, Week 65, Week 78 and Week 104.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit , Week 52 visit, and Week 104 visit , additional tests include fasting (at 
least 8 hours, other than water) glucose, lipid profile, and hemoglobin A1c. 
Electrocardiograms  will be performed  at the Week 24/Baseline and the Week 52  visits.

mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 7% , relative to parent 
study baseline.  
The follow-up bone densitometry will be submitted for central reading. 
 
Patients who experience a bone mineral density loss from the parent study Baseline of ≥ 7% at 
any of the anatomical sites assessed will be discontinued from the extension study and will 
undergo another bone densitometry scan as described above.  Patients should be assessed for secondary causes of bone loss and followed up further if not improving on the 6-month 
follow- up scan , unless an alternative etiology has been identified.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week  104 visit, then the follow-up bone densitometry scan at 6 (±1) months conducted under 
this protocol may be waived. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Endometrial Biopsy 
For patients in parent study MVT-601-3101, an endometrial biopsy is performed at the Week [ADDRESS_856115] endometrial hyperplasia or 
endom etrial carcinoma will be withdrawn from study drug treatment and followed per 
instructions in the parent study protocol. 
Additional assessment of the effects of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate on the endometrium will be performed at Week 52 for all patients .  At 
Week 104, all patients will be eligible for an additional endometrial biopsy; however, patients 
will have the option to opt out.  Patient participation in the Week 104 endometrial biopsy is 
voluntary and r efusal to participate will not preclude entry into the study  or indicate withdrawal 
from the study. 
The Week 52 and Week 104 endometrial biopsy samples will be submitted to the central 
laboratory.  If the Week 52  or Week 104 biopsy specimen is inadequate, a transvaginal 
ultrasound for endometrial thickness should be obtained and read locally.  The transvaginal ultrasound findings will be used to determine if further action is required: 
• Endometrial thickness ≤ 5 mm – no further action required. 
• Endometrial thickness > 5 mm at any location or any other endometrial abnormality – 
repeat endometrial sampling.  Contact [CONTACT_639918]. 
Unscheduled endometrial biopsies may also be performed when medically indicated and as 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator should obtain approval from the sponsor 
to perform an unscheduled endometrial biopsy, unless urgently indicated.  Additional consent is not required in this circumstance.

If the first menstruation after the end of study treatment administration is observed before the 
Follow-up visit, the date of onset of the first menstruation is recorded in the eCRF.  Patients whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom there is no explanation for 
the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639851] 3 (+0.5) months after the Follow- Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will 
be asked about facto rs that may affect resumption of menses.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week  104 visit, follow -up under this protocol to determine the status of menstruation recovery 
may not be required. 
7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
Study assessments of safety include adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and bone mineral density assessments . 
7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
Adverse event:   An adverse event is  any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
Events meeting the de finition of an adverse event  include : 
• A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of 
a pre- existing condition ; 
• Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; 
• Development of symptoms that may or may n ot be related to the use of a concomitant 
medication or investigational product; 
• Injury or accidents:  If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical ev ents (eg,  
for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately) ; 
and 
• An investigational abnormality (eg,  laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the 
abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_639919]:  
− Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; 
− Requires active intervention; 
− Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  58 CONFIDENTIAL  Events that do not  meet the definition of an adverse event  include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration tha t do not worsen; 
• Situations where an untoward medi cal event has not occurred (eg,  planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639826], with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the 
informed consent); 
• Endometriosis- associated pain is  not considered an adverse event in this study because it is 
being quantitatively measured as the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by [CONTACT_639920] 
(CTCAE).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_329886], such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a 
period of consecutive days  are “intermittent”.  All other events are “continuous”.  Additional 
information on de tecting, documenting , and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events 
are provided below. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death ; 
b. Is life -threatening ; 
NOTE:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  For ex ample, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
NOTE:   In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639815] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
independent of the duration of that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222228].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not int ended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not consti tute a substantial disruption . 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  59 CONFIDENTIAL  e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
f. Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting 
The reporting of serious adverse events by [CONTACT_456] (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory 
authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria.  Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investig ator to report serious 
adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events.  Open- ended and non- leading v erbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  Appropriate questions include: 
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”  
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last 
visit/contact?  
The patient’s eDiary entries , including bleeding and answers to the other patient-reported 
outcome measures , will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_639881].  Should the investigator 
or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information coll ected with 
these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken.  Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. 
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until 
the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic.  At the conclusion of the study, the 
investigator and m edical monitor will assess unres olved adverse events and determine if 
additional follow-up is  warranted . 
All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents.  Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as availab le, in preference to listing 
the individual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. 
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as described in Sect ion 7.7 and 
Section  7.8, respectively.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856116], as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities (Section  1.1).  Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the 
safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment.  
Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section  7.6. 
7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug 
The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event.  The following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: 
• Probably related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abn ormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re- administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge) . 
• Possibly related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Not related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. 
All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely 
documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record .  In the 
event a patient is withdrawn from the stu dy because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on 
the eCRF as such.  
7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events 
Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, m ay be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a 
severe headache.  This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on patient/event outcome or 
action taken . 
The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute CTCAE.  For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 
should be used to determine the grade severity. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  61 CONFIDENTIAL  Table 7-1 Criteria for Determining  the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified 
by [CONTACT_624550]  
1/Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic 
observations o nly; intervention not indicated 
2/Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living  
3/Severe or medically significant  Not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77081]; dis abling; limiting self -care activities 
of daily living  
4/Life -threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5/Death  Death related to adverse event  
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  
Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case 
report form and in the patient’s source documents. 
7.5. Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting 
Adverse events of clinical interest  in this study are defined as any increase in  ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_856117]  elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the Open -Label Treatment 
Period  or the Follow- Up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event 
Form  within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event  (see Section  7.6), 
even if the event does not meet serious adverse event  criteria .  Additional instructions for 
evaluating patients with an increa se in ALT or AST ≥ [ADDRESS_856118] Abnormalities  
Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA , 2009].  
If the following  liver test  abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld  immediately with 
appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory 
profile has retur ned to normal/baseline status) , and the event reported as a serious adverse event : 
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856119]; or  
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856120] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
• ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_856121] and total bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_856122] or the INR > 1.5; or 
• ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856123] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  62 CONFIDENTIAL  Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values.  The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree wi th any decision to rechallenge.  
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalit ies is considered 
possibly drug induced. 
7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in Assoc iation w ith Liver 
Test Abnormalities  
Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the fo llowing 4  criteria are 
met (ie, potential severe drug-induc ed liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ [ADDRESS_856124]; AND  
2. Total bilirubin increases to > [ADDRESS_856125] or INR >  1.5; AND 
3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach [ADDRESS_856126] ; AND  
4. No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; 
important alternative causes include, but are not limited to the following: 
− Hepatobiliary tract disease ; 
− Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus); 
− Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms; 
− Alcoholic hepatitis ; 
− Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis;  
− Autoimmune hepatitis.  
If an alternative cause f or hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the 
severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) whether study drug treatment should be withheld or 
permanently discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the patient.  
7.6. Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
Using a Safety Reporting Form, all serious adverse events must be reported within 24  hours of 
the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event , regardless of the investigator assessment of 
the relationship of the event to study drug. 
The contact [CONTACT_624551], adverse events of clinical 
interest  (defined in Section 7.5), and events of overdose is available on the Serious Adverse 
Event report form and is as follows:

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  64 CONFIDENTIAL  For this study, any dose of relugolix > 80  mg within a 24-hour window is an overdose and any 
dose of estradiol/norethindrone acetate > 2 x the protocol dose is an overdose (ie, more than 
2 capsules taken within a 24-hour window).  There is no known antidote for an overdose. 
In the ev ent of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_624474] y; 
• Closely monitor the patien t for adverse events  and laboratory abnormalities ; 
• All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_3452] , using a 
serious adverse event form  according to Section 7.6, whether or not the overdose is 
associated with an adverse event ; 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the 
eCRF.  
The medical monitor, in consultation with the investigator, will make decisions regarding patien t 
status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patien t. 
7.8. Pregnancy Reporting 
If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patient from the 
study treatment immediately and have her return for an Early Termination  visit.  
If the patient agrees, the investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the 
pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment. 
A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_856127] menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this form , as available.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report 
the outcome to the sponsor. 
7.9. Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tests, 
Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures 
Section 6.5.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs,  and bone mineral density. 
7.10. Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated with relugolix in women include nonserious 
events of hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density .  In this protocol, 
relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on  endometriosis -associated pain .  Low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy with estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of 
bone mineral density during treatment with relugolix . 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  65 CONFIDENTIAL  Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment in women, based on nonclinical 
data and data available for similar compounds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects 
(corrected QT [ QTc] prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) , 
reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovascular changes (insulin resistance, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increased weight) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, there are potential risks associated with 
the addition of estradiol/norethindrone acetate .  Summaries of findings from both nonclinical and 
clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in th e current version of the Investigator 
Brochure . 
The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-2. 
Table 7-[ADDRESS_856128] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Bone Mineral Density  
Reversible loss of bone mineral density is 
a risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by [CONTACT_624438].  This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_42020]-administration of low -dose estradiol 
and norethindrone acetate hormonal add-
back therapy. Exclusion criteria for a 
history of osteoporosis, 
metabolic bone disease, and prior medical therapy 
for low bone mineral 
density was included in 
the parent studies.  Bone mineral density will be 
monitored at the 
Week  24/Baseline, Week 36, 
Week 52 , and 
Week  104/Early Termination 
visits with specified 
discontinuation and follow-
up criteria and all fractures will be reported as adverse 
events.  
Drug Interactions  Exclusion of co -
administration 
P-glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers. Collection of adverse events.  
QTc Prolongation  
Negative Thorough QT/QTc clinical study. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_624371] > 470 msec in the parent studies.  12-lead ECG at the 
Week  24/Baseline  and

(AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_856132]) that develop during the 
Open-Label Treatment 
Period  will be reported 
within 24 hours of study 
personnel awareness.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856133] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_624420].  PLD by 
[CONTACT_624448].  No clinical evidence 
of relugolix- related PLD -associated 
toxicity has been observed nor was there a clinically meaningful increase in a biomarker of PLD assessed in phase 2 
clinical studies.  Patients with significant 
underlying medical conditions are excluded.  Routine safety monitoring 
including laboratory 
assessments, ECGs, and 
assessment of adverse 
events, including any 
ophthalmologic adverse 
events, will be monitored during this study.  
Metabolic Changes  
Metabolic changes (insulin resistance, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and increased weight) with 
increased risk of diabetes are a potential 
risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by 
[CONTACT_624438]. Exclusion criteria for 
current medical history of 
cardiovascular disease in 
the parent studies.  Fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_624373]. 
Reproductive Toxicity  Premenopausal 
compliance with 
specified acceptable non-
hormonal contraception; 
exclusion of pregnant and 
lactating women.  Pregnancy testing at each 
study visit; immediate 
withdrawal for pregnancy.  
Risk of Estradiol (1.0  mg)/Norethindrone 
Acetate (0.5  mg) 
Low-dose estradiol and norethindrone 
acetate are approved for the prevention of 
postmenopausal osteoporosis and the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor 
symptoms.  It is contraindicated for women with a history of breast cancer or 
estrogen -dependent neoplasia, history of 
(or active) deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, thromboembolic 
disease (myocardial infarction or stroke within the past year), liver dysfunction, 
prior hypersensitivity, and pregnancy. Women with breast 
cancer or other estrogen -
dependent malignances, a 
history of deep vein 
thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, 
thromboembolic disease, liver dysfunction, prior 
hypersensitivity, migraine 
with aura, porphyria, and 
pregnancy excluded from 
the parent studies.  Physical examination, 
clinical chemistries, and 
12-lead ECG will be 
performed at the 
Week  24/Basel ine visit.  Clinical chemistries 
assessing liver tests, fasting 
glucose and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and urine 
pregnancy tests will be 
performed throughout the 
study.  Adverse events will be recorded at each visit.  
ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; ECG = electrocardiogram; QTc = corrected QT 
interval; QTcF = QT interval by [CONTACT_639869]; PLD = phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215]; ULN = upper limit of normal.

8.1. Clinical Procedures 
Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site , if necessary , prior to initiation of the 
study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring 
requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the Investigat or Site File  with the site personnel. 
8.2. Monitoring 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) in accordance with current Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  By [CONTACT_12570], the investigator grants permission 
to Myovant Science s GmbH (or designee) and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-
site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the  eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or design ee) have 
access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports).  During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  A study monitor will contact [CONTACT_329957], on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of the study.  It will be the s tudy monitor’s responsibility to inspect t he eCRF  at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries , and to meet with the investigator to discuss study 
progress and compliance with the protocol and GCP .  The s tudy monitor should have access to 
laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  For this study, patient data will be 
entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other 
sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). 
Adverse events an d concomitant medications terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced  (WHO -DDE) , respectively.  
The investigator will retain original source documents and the s ponsor will receive 
eCRF -required data as electronic datasets.  Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to 
the sponsor. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  68 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANAL YSES 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical me thods and analyses for 
this study.  
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of both the parent and extension studies will be 
presented by [CONTACT_639882].  No formal treatment 
comparisons will be performed for this extension study.  Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.  Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. 
There will be two analyses : one at Week 52  and one at Week 104.  A clinical study report will be 
generated from each analysis.  
9.1. Randomization Methods  
This is a single -arm, open-label extension study; patients are not randomized.  All patients who 
have entered the extension study will be treated with open-label relugolix and low-dose 
hormonal add-back therapy for 80 weeks.  
9.2. Analysis Populations 
Efficacy data analyses will be performed on the modified  Intent- to-Treat ( mITT) Population, 
defined as all patients who were randomized in a par ent study (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102) and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. 
Safety data analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who were 
randomized in a parent study and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. 
The analysis methods for safety and efficacy endpoints are the same as those used for the parent 
studies, unless otherwise specified in the SAP. 
9.3. Sample Size Justification 
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639857] a parent study and who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension study .  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients ( 67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized i nto the parent studies) will participate in this study.  
9.4. Efficacy Analyses 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT Population.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_639921].  
The point estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  69 CONFIDENTIAL  medications,  proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medications) will be calculated.  
A responder at a given time point and for a specific type of pain (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) is 
defined as a patient who had a reduction in that type of pain from Baseline in the parent study 
greater than or equal to a pre-determined threshold and who did not have an increase in the use 
of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis -associated pain compared with the use at 
Baseline. Patients who had a pain reduction less than the pre -determined threshold or who had an 
increase in the use of analgesics for endometriosis -associated pain will be considered non-
responders.  The pain reduction thresholds will be determined for NMPP and dysmenorrhea separately (see the SAP for details) for the parent studies and these same thresholds will be 
applied to this study. 
Baseline values are calculated using the Baseline pain assessment period, which is defined as the 
period from the date of the first dose of placebo in the parent study Run-In Period through the day prior to the first dose  of randomized study drug .  Patients’ average NRS pain scores and use 
of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis -associated pain  (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) will 
be compared between a given visit-specific pain assessment period (eg, Week 28, Week 32, etc.) and the Baseline pain assessment period.  The visit- specific pain assessment period is defined as 
the last [ADDRESS_856134] dose of study drug treatment received prior to the visit date.  
For any pain assessment period (Baseline or visit -specific), the average NRS scores will be 
calculated for dysmenorrhea and NMPP separately.  An average NRS score for dysmenorrhea is 
calculated as the average NRS score over the days with menses during a given pain assessment period.  An average NRS score for NMPP is calculated as the average NRS score over the days without menses during a given pain assessment period.  The analgesic use for a given pain assessment period is summarized by [CONTACT_639884] 35.  Additional details on calculating dose counts and on the precise definition of an increase in analgesic us e will be 
provided in the SAP. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficacy endpoints (listed below) similar to those used 
for the parent studies at Week 52 and Week 104. 
• Change from the parent study Baseline in the EHP-30 Pain Domain scores; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline to in the mean dysmenorrhea NRS score; 
• Proportion of patients who are better or much better on the PGIC for dysmenorrhea; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline in the mean NMPP NRS score;

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  73 CONFIDENTIAL  10. RESPONSI BILITIES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities 
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South 
Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant.  For studies conducted under a US  investigatio nal new drug 
application, the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as 
outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied.  This 
documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigato r.  The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in 
reportable interests during the study and for [ADDRESS_856137]/Independent Ethics Committee Approval  
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as 
advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_624485].  Approval f rom the IRB or IEC 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the 
investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be 
submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 
10.1.3. Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and 
potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures.  The 
investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  74 CONFIDENTIAL  written informed consent that contains all elements required by [CONTACT_30104], state, local , and 
institutional regulations or requirements .  Each informed consent form will be appropriately 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_11581] t or the pa tient’s legally authorized representative and the person 
obtaining consent. 
10.1.4. Confidentiality  
The investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  Only patient  number, date of birth, and an 
identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample 
submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory.  The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screened and for all patien ts enrolled in the 
study.  
The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited 
to the Investigator Brochure, protocol, e CRFs  and other study forms, the investigational drug, 
and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from the sponsor.  The i nvestigator further agrees to take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_250249]. 
10.1.5. Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should be classified into at least the following two categories: 
1. Investigator’s study file.  The investigator’s study file will contain the  Investigator 
Brochure , protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with 
correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, 
authorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
2. Patien t clinical source documents.  The required source data should include the following 
for each patien t: 
− Patient  identification (name, date of birth, gender); 
− Documentation that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical 
examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria);  
− Participation in the study (inc luding study number); 
− Study discussed and date of informed consent; 
− Dates of all visits; 
− Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed;  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103 Amendment 2, 11 Dec 2018 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  75 CONFIDENTIAL  − Results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760];  
− Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study drug  (drug dispensing, return , 
and accountability should be documented as well); 
− Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and 
causality and intensity  as assigned by [CONTACT_093] ); 
− Concomitant medication ( including start and end date) and indication; and  
− Date of study completion and reason for early termination , if applicable.  
All clinical study documentation  must be retained by [CONTACT_12415] [ADDRESS_856138] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, US , Europe, or Japan) and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until [ADDRESS_856139] and study- related materials, documentation of financ ial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and 
signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory authorities as applicable, decoding procedures for blinded studies, curriculum vitae and all tra ining records of study site personnel, and all correspondence 
pertaining to the conduct of the study. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. 
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they ca n be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786]. 
10.1.6. Electronic Case Report Forms  
For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed as specified in the Investigator Site File .  
The eCRF casebook for each study patient will be signed by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator 
(as appropriate)  listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate local health authority documents.  
This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-
randomization screening period  if an eCRF was initiated).  If a patien t withdr aws from the study, 
the reason must be noted on the eCRF.  If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856140] Accountability  
The investigator or investigator’s designee ( eg, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug  (active and 
placebos).  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity 
and condition), patien t dispensing records, accountability , and returned or destroyed study 
product.  Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, P atient ID number, and the initials of 
the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the 
sponsor requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed once the study monitor has reviewed and returned used and unused study drug for accountability purposes.  If the site cannot meet the 
sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor (or designee)  for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_5276].

Study Design  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639789] [ADDRESS_856199] completed their participa tion in one of the 
phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102).  All patients will receive open-label oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered 
with low -dose- estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 m g for up to 80 weeks.  Approximately 
Clinic al Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  12 CONFIDENTIAL  800 women with endometriosis -associated pain will be enrolled.  The objectives of the study are to 
evaluate long -term efficacy and safety through up to 104 weeks of treat ment (including treatment 
during the parent study) of  relugolix co- administered with low -dose estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  
Eligible patients will have completed participation in one of the parent studies and consented to 
participate in this extension study.  Baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for this extension 
study (referred to as the “Week 24/Baseline visit” in this study)  that coincides with the Week  [ADDRESS_856200] Week  24 procedure in 
the parent  study.   The Week 24/Baseline visit will include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory 
assessments, a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), b one densitometry, patient -reported outcome 
assessments, and endometrial bio psy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_856201] 
been completed, the investigator  will assess patient eligibility for participation in the open -label 
extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the Week  24/Baseline 
visit.  No MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856202] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the Week  24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the 
clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided inf ormed 
consent to participate.   Therefore, results of t esting required for eligibility must be available on or prior 
to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-3103 
will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take the open- label study treatment 
(relugolix 40 mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and  norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once 
daily f or 80 weeks.   If necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of stu dy drug supply on 
site, others), and with s ponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for  
MVT -601-310 3 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study  Week  24/Baseline visit.  
If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow -up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, electronic diary [ eDiary ] completion, etc.). 
During the 80-week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~[ADDRESS_856203] study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic 
use, and the func tional effects of endometriosis-associated pain (sB&B) in  the eDiary.  Only study-
specific rescue analgesic medications should be used starting with the Week  24/Baseline visit and 
through the Follow -Up visit and these medications will be taken for control of pain and not 
prophylactically.  Health -related quality of life questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and 
dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet or on paper, according to the Schedule  of Activities (Section 1.1). 
At the Week 36, Week 52,  and Week 104/Early Termination visits , each patient will have an 
assessment of bone mineral density via dual-energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA).    
Safety wi ll be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and 
weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECGs , mammograms (for women 
≥ 40 years of age), endometrial biopsies, and bone mineral density with D XA. 
Determination of b one mineral density by [CONTACT_639905]-up of findings will 
proceed according to the following rules:  
• For Early Termination occurring between Week 24 and Week 52: 
−  For Early Termination occurring before Week 36, DXA is n ot required at Early Termination 
visit unless it will aid in the assessment of an adverse event.  
−  Follow -up DXA required at 6 months (± 1 month) if most recent DXA bone mineral density 
loss at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 2% relative to the parent study baseline.  
−  For Early Termination occurring after Week 36 , DXA is required  at Early Termination  unless a 
Clinic al Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  13 CONFIDENTIAL  DXA result is available from within six weeks prior to Early Termination . 
−  Follow -up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if the most recent DXA scan was at Week 
24 and bone mineral density  loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was  > 2% , relative to 
the parent study baseline.  
−  Follow -up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, bone mineral 
density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) or total hip was > 3%, relative to the parent study 
baseline.  
• For Early Termination occurring between Week 52 and Week 104: 
−  DXA is required at Early Termination  unless a DXA result is available from within six weeks 
prior to Early Term ination. 
−  Follow -up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, bone mineral 
density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 7% , relativ e to parent study 
baseline.  
• If patients have [ADDRESS_856204] -treatment follow -up scans th at show bone loss of >  1.5% at the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or > 2.5% at total hip compared with parent study baseline, patients are strongly 
encouraged to come back to the clinic for an additional post -treatment follow -up scan [ADDRESS_856205] dose of the study drug.  
• If patients have [ADDRESS_856206] -treatment follow -up scans that show bone loss of ≥  3% at the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or total hip compared with parent study baseline, patients are referred to and strongly encouraged to see a bone specialist for further evaluation of the bone loss . 
Note:  When a patient is referred to a bone specialist for evaluation and management, 
Myovant will provide a Bone Consultation Letter to the investigator for this additional 
bone consult and will request the site to provide a summary of the evaluation and management plan once the consultation is complete . 
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow -up visit.  Patients whose menses has 
not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack o f resumption 
(eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 3 (+ 0.5) months after the 
Follow -Up visit to determine if  menses has resumed and will be asked about factors that may affect 
resumption of menses.   If a patient is lost to follow -up, three documented attempts should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_66079] .  If unable to contact [CONTACT_66079], a certified letter  must be 
sent to the patient.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study u pon completion of the Week 104 
visit, then the Follow -up visit and the follow -up procedures performed under this protocol, including 
the follow -up bone densitometry scan at 6 (± 1) months and status of menstruation recover y, may be 
waived.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  18 CONFIDENTIAL  Safety  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, and bone mineral density with DXA.  Safety data 
analyses will use data from all patients from the parent studies who receive any amount of study drug 
(ie, from parent study Baseline to Week 52 or Week 104). 
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_190652].  Severity of all treatment-emergent adverse 
events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator based on the National Cancer Institute  Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, high level 
term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The 
number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_99130], relationship to study drug, and severit y.  Laboratory values will be classified 
by [CONTACT_639892] .  Laboratory shift tables of the parent 
study Baseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced.  
Bone mineral density will be evaluated  in all patients at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), femoral neck, and 
total hip at the Week 24/Baseline, Week  36, Week 52, and Week 104/Early Termination visits.  The 
absolute change  and percent change from parent study Baseline and Z -scores will be summarized b y 
visit and parent study treatment group.  
The mean percentage change from parent study Baseline to Week 52 in bone mineral density and 
correspo nding 95% CI will be provided for  each treatment group.  For patients who were randomized 
to 24 weeks of treatmen t with relugolix and add-back in the parent studies (Group A in MVT -601-3101 
or MVT -601- 3102) and enrolled in the extension study, the lower bound of the 95%  CI for mean 
percen tage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bo ne mineral density lumbar  spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(L1-L4) will b e compared with a pre-specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to e valuate 
magnitude of bone mineral density los s after 52  weeks of treatment.   If the lower bound is > -2.2%, 
bone mineral density loss  for the relugolix add-ba ck treatment will be considered insignificant .  The 
95% CI for mean percentage change at Week 104 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral de nsity 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) will be provided along with descriptive statistics for bone mineral density loss at 
Week [ADDRESS_856211] completed a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102) and who are eligible and willing to 
participate in the extension study.  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients ( 67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.

participated in MVT -601-3101 only (see MVT -601-3101 protocol for detai ls) and at Week [ADDRESS_856219] dose of study drug was taken during Week 32 or earlier or within four weeks after completion 
of the Week 52 endometrial biopsy.  However, the procedure may be done if it will aid in the evaluation of an ongoing adverse event.   An endometrial biopsy 
at Week 104 is recommended for a ll patients who complete the open- label extension; however, patients wi ll have the option to opt out.  
u Please see Appendix [ADDRESS_856220] dose of the study drug for this study once daily starting with the Week 24/Baseline visit (taken at  the visit).  If necessary , for 
logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on site, others), and wi th sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for 
MVT -601-3103 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week  24/Baseline visit.   If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up 
to 10- day interval, the  parent s tudy follow -up procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, eDiary completion, etc.).   The first dose of study drug 
for this extension study must not be taken until all parent study Week [ADDRESS_856221] eted.  Therefore, results of testing 
required for eligibility (eg, DXA) must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The last dose of study drug will be taken in the clinic during the 
Week 104/Early Termination visit.  
x Patients may only take their study -specified analgesics for pain.  Analgesics should not be taken prophylactically (ie, in anticipation of pain).  
y The p atient will enter her response(s) into an electronic tablet device at the site.  On visits when both tablet and paper questio nnaires are being performed at the 
site, the patient should complete the tablet questionnaires before the paper ques tionnaires.  
z The patient will enter her response onto a paper questionnaire at the site.  Paper questionnaires should be done in the following order:  PGA for function, EHP 
Work Domain.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856223] common gynecologic disorders, evident in 70 to 90% of women with pelvic 
pain symptoms [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown but estimates range from 2 to 10% of women of reproductive age [ Dunselman , 2014].  Symptoms range from minimal to severely debilitating.  
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is the presence  of endometrial glands and stroma outside the 
uterine cavity.  Although the ectopic endometriotic lesions are most commonly found in the pelvis, they may also be located in the bowel, in the pleural cavity, and elsewhere.  Women with endometriosis have an increased risk of abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia 
compared with controls without endometriosis [ Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  In a study of [ADDRESS_856224] common 
symptom leading to diagnosis was dysmenorrhea in approximately 90%, pelvic pain in approximately 80%, and dyspareunia in approximately 45%, with 34% of women diagnosed on 
the basis of all three symptoms [Sinaii , 2008 ].  Presenting symptoms of infertility (25%) and 
endometrioma (ovarian mass) (20%) were also common [Sinaii, 2008 ]. 
The mechanisms of pain in endometriosis are generally postulated to involve production of substances such as growth factors and cytokines, the direct and indirect effects of active bleeding from endometriotic implants, and irritation of pelvic floor nerves or direct invasion of those 
nerves by [CONTACT_639859] [Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
According to the American Soc iety for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee, 
“Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifel ong management plan with the goal of 
maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated s urgical procedures” [ Practice 
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 2014].  
Although hysterectomy with bilateral salpin go-oopherectomy is a definitive treatment of 
endometriosis, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that this option be 
reserved as a last resort for women with debilitating endometriosis symptoms who have completed childbearing and have f ailed to respond to alternative treatments [Practice Committee 
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
, 2014].  Other surgical options for treatment 
of endometriosis i nclude uterosacral nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic 
resection.  Rates of recurrent dysmenorrhea 1  and 3  years after laparoscopic surgery with 
uterosacral nerve ablation were not better than with lapa roscopic surgery without nerve ablation 
in a large randomized trial.  Presacral neurectomy, which involves interrupting the sympathetic innervation to the uterus, improves pain but is a technically challenging procedure associated 
with significant risk of bleeding from the adjacent venous plexus.  Patients may also experience 
constipation and/or urinary retention postoperatively.  Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis 
was found to be more effective at reducing pain than diagnostic laparoscopy in a meta- analysis 
of 5 randomized controlled studies.  While laparoscopic treatment is effective, pain can recur, 
and the option of perform ing multiple surgeries is limited by [CONTACT_639934], resulting in reduced fertility.  In 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  25 CONFIDENTIAL  one retrospective study, subsequent surgery was performed after laparoscopic treatment in 21%, 
47%, and 45% of women after 2, 5, and 7 years, respectively [Practice Committee of the 
American Society for R eproductive Medicine , 2014]. 
Medical management of endometriosis includes analgesics and treatments aimed at decidualization followed by [CONTACT_639861].  Compared to normal endometrium, 
endometriotic implants are characterized by [CONTACT_639935], which synergize the activities of each other and promote 
implantation of ectopic endometrium.  In addition, the implants have upr egulated estrogen 
synthesis pathways [ Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine , 
2014].  Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synergistic process, thereby [CONTACT_639863]- associated  pain. 
Medical hormonal options include hormonal contraceptives, progestins, gonadotropin- releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists, danazol, and a romatase inhibitors.  Because of lack of data 
supporting use of one treatment over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom 
severity, patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability [Dunselman , 2014].  The main adverse effects of GnRH agonists relate to induction of a 
hypoestrogenic state (eg, bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms) wherea s danazol 
produces androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism, weight gain, and deepening of the voice.  Some patients treated with GnRH agonists also experience an initial “flare effect” (increased 
pain and bleeding), and this can result in premature di scontinuation of treatment.  Side effects of 
progestin treatment can include irregular uterine bleeding, weight gain, mood changes such as 
depression, and bone mineral density loss with long- term use of certain agents.  
The goal of the relugolix phase 3 development plan is to demonstrate that relugolix can decrease dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain ( NMP P) in women with endometriosis safely 
through 12 months of therapy and to evaluate effects on pain- related quality of life and function.  
By [CONTACT_639864] -administration of 
low-dose hormonal add- back therapy, the program ultimately aims to bring to women suffering 
endometriosis- associated pain a long -term oral medical therapy that significantly reduces pain 
and improves quality of life and provides an alternative to invasive procedures. 
2.2. Relugol ix 
Summaries of nonclinical toxicology and previous human experience with relugolix, including 
results of phase 1  and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and in 
men with prostate cancer, are pro vided in the current relugolix Investigator B rochure, along with 
a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix.  
2.2.1. Indication  
Relugolix co -admi nistered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed 
as a once- daily oral medication for the treatment of endometriosis- associated pain .  The proposed 
dose of relugolix is 40  mg administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate are 1 .0 mg  and 0.5 mg  once daily, respectively . 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856225] for the human GnRH rece ptor.  The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH 
receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein 
(40% fetal bovine serum).  Transgenic knock- in mice expressing th e human GnRH receptor 
treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, 
respectively.  Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic- pi[INVESTIGATOR_639792] 1  mg/kg and higher.

once daily co- administered with low -dose estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for 
up to 80 weeks.  Approximately 800 women with endometriosis-associated pain will be enrolled.  
The objectives of the study are to evaluate long- term efficacy  and safety through up to 
104 weeks of treatment (including treatment during the parent study) of relugolix 
co-administered with low -dose estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  Eligible patients will have

4.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639793] (MVT-601-3103) is an extension of 2 replicate, 24- week 
phase 3 studi es (MVT -601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) designed to establish the efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily in women with endometriosis- associated pain .  This 
80-week extension study provides additional efficacy and safety data up to 104 weeks to 
demons trate the benefit and safety of relugolix co- administered with low -dose estradiol (1  mg) 
and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg).  The primary objectives of the study are  to assess long -term 
efficacy of relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetat e for up to 104 weeks on  dysmenorrhea and NMPP, common and 
burdensome symptoms of endometriosis.  The study will also evaluate safety  of relugolix 40 mg 
once daily co- administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 
104 weeks, among patients who previously completed a 24-week treatment period in one of the 
parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102), including adverse events and change in bone 
mineral density.  
The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily.  Data from a phase 2 study in women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily suppressed estradiol levels 
to below 20 pg/m L in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of 
women treate d with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg.  Women in both the relugolix 
40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of 

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856232] on the beneficial decrease in  dysmenorrhea and NMPP .  It 
is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive t o estrogen and low -doses of estrogen are 
sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [ Barbieri , 1992].  The 
combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long- term hormonal add -back 
therapy to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639794], which can occur with unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013 ].  A variety of add -
back hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_639830] 20  years [Archer , 2015 ; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein , 1998 ; 
Morris , 2008; Simpson, 2015; Wu, 2014; Zupi , 2004], and a combination of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate has been used as add -back therapy in prior clinical studies with leuprolide 
(a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone 
mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on  the decrease 
in menstrual blood loss [Archer , 2017; Lee, 2016 ; Franke , 2000] or endometriosis -associated 
pain [ Wu, 2014].  The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in 
this phase 3 study is currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) as long- term hormone 
replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal 
women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013].  
A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix [ADDRESS_856233] rated that this dose of add- back therapy maintains serum estradiol 
in the 25 to 50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density [Barbieri
, 1992].  Serum N - and C- telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near 
baseline levels with the addition of the add-back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption 
compared to the group receiving relugolix alone.  Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced 
with the addition of add -back therapy.  The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, 
ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all pharmacokinetic samples collected, and therefore,  will not be assessed in this phase 3 study.  These data also confirm that

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  38 CONFIDENTIAL  12. Is inappropriate for participation in this study because of conditions that may interfere 
with interpretation of study results or prevent the patient from complying with study 
requirements, as determined by [CONTACT_093], sub- investigator, or medical monitor; 
13. Met a withdrawal criterion in the  parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102). 
4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient Identification Number 
Eligible patients who sign consent will be identified with the same Patient Identification  (ID) 
Number assigned to the patient during the parent study.  This extension study is a single- arm, 
open- label  study, and thus all eligible patients are assigned to the same treatment group of 
relugolix 40 mg co- administered with low-dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate (see 
Section  5.1 for treatment details).  
4.5. Removal of Patients from Therapy 
Completion of the Week 104 visit defines completion of the study.  Patients may withdraw 
consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason.  
Investigators or the medical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for 
reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below.  Patients removed from therapy 
for an y reason will undergo the assess ments for the Early Termination visit (see the Week  104 
visit on the Schedule of Activities, Section  1.1) and will have a Follow- up visit to assess safety 
approximately 30 days after the end of study drug treat ment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of 
study medication).   When patients complete the study or early terminate from the study, they 
must be deactivated from the study in the interactive voice response system /interactive web 
response system ( IVRS/IWRS ), eDiary, and tablet device. 
The following safety and/or compliance events will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the et iology of the problem has been identified and resolved: 
• Any adverse event that is intolerable to  the patient and that cannot be ameliorated by [CONTACT_624458], or that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_639797]; 
• If it is discovered after enrollment that a patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the patient’s health; 
• If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be discontinued 
immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a 
patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status):  
−  ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856238]; or  
−  ALT or AST >  [ADDRESS_856239] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
−  ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856240] in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_856241] or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5; or  
−  ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856242] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%);  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  39 CONFIDENTIAL  • QT interval by [CONTACT_639937] (QTcF) prolongation of more than [ADDRESS_856243];  
• Evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma on endometrial biopsy; 
• If the patient has a ≥ 7% loss of bone mineral density at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or femoral 
neck compared with the parent study Baseline; 
• If the patient, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_624356], is grossly noncompliant with the protocol ’s requirements.  Gross noncompliance includes < 75% 
compliance with the study drug over > 2 consecutive months; missing multiple study visits; 
and persistent (> 2 consecutive months) noncompliance ( < 50% of the required number of 
days) with eDiary comple tion up to Week 52 or persistent (≥ 2 eDiary collection cycles) 
noncompliance (< 50% of the required number of days ) with eDiary completion  from 
Week  52 to Week 104.  Investigators will follow  up with the patient and encourage 
compliance with study drug or eDiary prior to discontinuing her from the study;  
• If the patient becomes pregnant at any time after providing a signed informed consent form, the patient must be withdrawn immediately (see Secti on 7.8 for information on pregnancy 
reporting); 
• Evidence of malignant breast lesion (s) or breast ca rcinoma  on Week 52 or Week  104/ Early 
Termination  or most recent  mammogram or additional breast imaging  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
for more information on mammogram at We ek 52 or Week  104/Early Termination ); 
Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol-defined window, the site should attempt to contact [CONTACT_231350].  The site sh ould also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based 
on previous noncompliance.  In cases where the patient does not return for the resche duled visit 
or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain 
contact [CONTACT_10970].  The site should attempt at least three documented telephone calls and if 
necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing addres s so that they can 
appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 
4.6. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance  
All p atients should be counseled at every visit to adhere to the use of protocol allowed 
contraceptive methods.  In this study, medications and devices containing hormones for 
contraception are excluded, and patients must agree to use non- hormonal contraception 
throughout the study including through [ADDRESS_856244] dose of study drug, unless any of the following apply: 
• Has a sexual partner(s) who was vasectomized at least 6 months prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit;  
• Had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and  blockage methods such as Essure) at 
least 6  months prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit (patients with Essure must have prior 
confirmation of tubal occlusion by [CONTACT_31084][INVESTIGATOR_8913]) and there must be no evidence of 
post- Essure syndrome;  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  40 CONFIDENTIAL  • Has a non -hormonal intrauterine device (eg, Paragard) placed in the uterus;  
• Is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of 
non-hormonal contraception as described below;  
• Practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as her  preferred lifestyle; periodic 
abstinence is not acceptable.  
The only acceptable methods of contraception for those for whom one of the above methods do 
not apply are: 
• Condom (male or female condom) with or without spermicide (cream, spray, foam, gel, 
suppository, or polymer film);  
• Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); 
• Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); or 
• Vaginal sponge impregnated with spermicide used with a condom. 
Patients  will be provided with information  on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
informed consent process and will confirm with signing of the consent form that they understand the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study.  Patients may not 
donate ova during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_856245] study dose of study drug 
provided her menstrual cycle has returned. 
Urine pregnancy tests will be performed according to the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1; 
including just prior to receiving the first dose of study drug), and patients will receive continued 
guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedures.  Patients 
who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study and followed for pregnancy outcome (see Section  7.8). 
4.7. Novel Coronavirus 2019 Guidance  
Guidance for  conducting clinical trials during  the novel coronavirus 2019 (C OVID-19) pandemic

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  42 CONFIDENTIAL  5.3. Randomization and Stratification  
This extension study is a single- arm, open-label study, and thus, patients are not randomized or 
stratified upon enrollment in this study.  
5.4. Directions for Administration 
All study patients will take a study treatment of one tablet and on e capsule once daily. 
The study treatment should be taken in the fasted state (other than water, tea, or coffee) in the 
morning, at least [ADDRESS_856246] 1 hour before or 
2 hours after eating a meal.   The study treatment should be taken as close as possible to the same 
time of morning each day. 
On Week  24/Baseline 1, Week 52 , and Week 104 clinic visit days, study  drug will be 
administered in the clinic rather than at home (see Schedule of Activities in Section 1.1 ). 
5.5. Dose Reduction/Dose Administration  
No toxicity-related dose reductions of study drug are permitted.  Pat ients who experience a 
grade [ADDRESS_856247] their treatment interrupted until the toxicity improves to a grade 2 or lower severity.  
Patients may subsequently be re-started on study drug with the written approval of the sponsor 
(or designee). 
5.6. Storage,  Packaging, and Labeling  
Study drug should be stored in an appropriate, limited- access, secure location at room 
temperature.  Follow storage conditions described on the dr ug labeling.  Study drug should be

5.7. Rescue Analgesic Medications  
Management of endometriosis- associated pain often requires treatment with analgesics and some 
patients require trea tment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2631]. Two tiers of pain medications are specified for this 
trial.  The study- specified pain medications for each patient will be the same as for the paren t 
study.  Only study- specific Tier 1 and Tier 2  analgesic medications (see Appendix 1)  should be 
taken  starting with the Baseline/Week [ADDRESS_856249] the 
medical monitor.  
Short-term use of non- study specified analgesics for the treatment of an intercurrent even t (eg, 
injury or surgery) is allowed, if required.  Such events should be repor ted as adverse events when  
appropriate. Investigators must instruct the patient on the use of ibuprofen 200 mg tablets (ie, number of 
tablets per dose, dosing frequency, maximum number of tablets per day) .  For patients who may 
need  the Tier [ADDRESS_856250] of the study. 
Quantities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_639809]’s expected usage until the next 
study visit.  Prescriptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 rescue analgesic medications should be in 
accordance with their f ull prescribing information (ie , the local product labeling) and 
prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_639831].  Patients should be counseled on the 
safe use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Patients who are not prescribed the Tier 2 medication at the time of enrollment in this study, for 
example,  because requirement for analgesics beyond the Tier 1 medication is not expected (eg, 
based on pain level and/or recent analgesic requirements) should be advised to contact [CONTACT_639939] [ADDRESS_856251] be recorded by [CONTACT_394197] . 
5.8. Blinding  
Blinding is not applicable for this open- label extension study.  
5.9. Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Compli ance  
Patients should complete their eDiary each day on study and should bring all unused and used 
(including partially used) study drug kits to each study visit.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit and 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  44 CONFIDENTIAL  Week 104/Early Termination visit, all used, partially used, and unused study drug kits should be 
retained at the site.   At all other visits, only fully used study drug kits should be retained at the 
site.  New study drug should be dispensed as described in Section  1.1 (Schedule of Acti vities).  
Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded.  If a patient is 
persistently noncompliant with the study treatment, it may be appropriate to withdraw the patient 
from the study  (see Section  4.5).  All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing 
requirement during study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the patient’s source records.  
Because of the importance t o both safety and efficacy evaluation, patients who are grossly 
noncompliant with eDiary completion must undergo an Unscheduled visit to evaluate reasons for 
noncompliance and to develop a plan to improve compliance.  Failure to impro ve compliance 
may resu lt in the sponsor withdrawing the patient from further study treatment (including study 
analgesics) and/or discontinuation from the study  (see Section  4.5 for details). 
All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing requi rement and eDiary  compliance during 
study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the patient’s source records.

The timing of each study assessment  and procedur e is provided in the Schedule of Activities (see 
Section  1.1).  Study procedures are briefly described within Section  6.5.  F urther details of the 
procedures are provided in the I nvestigator Site File .  Guidelines to address the COVID -19 
pandemic are included in Appendix 9. 
6.1. Schedule of Observations and Procedures  
Assessments should be completed at the designated visit/time poi nts as described in the Schedule 
of Activities (see  Section 1.1).  The study is divided into 2 periods:  Open- Label Treatment 
Period  and Safety Follow- Up Period .  Unscheduled visits may occur as needed to evaluate 
patients.  
6.2. Open-Label Treatment Period (Week 24/Baseline to Week 104) 
As denoted in the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1), certain Week 24 visit procedures of 
MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601- 3102 will serve as the Week  24/Baseline procedures for patients 
who are interested in participating in this extension study, and these Week 24 procedures will be 
performed under the informed consent for the parent study. 
Patients will be required to sign an informed consent form for the extension study and will be 
eligible if they meet all of the eligibility criteria.  
Once eligibility is determined, all additional Week 24/Baseline visit procedures described in the 
Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) that were not performed as part of the Week 24 visit of 
the parent study will be completed.  These include the following: 
• Informed consent (unless signed previously); 
• Record concomitant medications; 
• Update the patient’s status in the IVRS/IWRS as b eing in the MVT -601-3103 and receive the 
lot numbers for study drug allocation; 
• Dispense study treatment;  
• Dispense or prescribe protocol -specified analgesic drugs; 
• Transition the patient within her eDiary from the parent study to MVT -601-3103 
• Take study dr ug dose in clinic; and 
• Record adverse events, if any.  
The Week [ADDRESS_856254] dose of study drug in the 
parent study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension st udy in the clinic after the patient is determined  to be eligible for 
this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of 
testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.   If 
necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on site, others), and 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  49 CONFIDENTIAL  with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for MVT-601-3103 may 
be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week  24/Baseline visit.   If the first 
dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow-up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, eDiary completion, etc.). 
Patients will continue recording data  in their eDiary daily  and taking protocol- specif ied 
analgesics as needed  until Week 52.  After Week 52, the eDiary will be collected  on the 
following schedule:  Week 57 to the Week 65 visit, Week 71 to the Week 78 visit, Week 85 to 
the Week 91 visit, and Week 98 to the Week 104 visit.  Following the Wee k 24/Baseline visit, 
on-treatment study visits will occur at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 65, 78, 91, and 104.  Sites will monitor diary completion using the Trial Manager web portal throughout the study. 
A telephone call will be performe d at Weeks 57, 71, 85 and 98.  The following activities should 
be completed: a concomitant medication review, an evaluation of adverse events, a review of 
study medication c ompliance , and a reminder to the patient to start recording in the eDiary daily . 
Accountability for study drug will be performed at each visit.  Instructions for analgesic 
medication usage wil l be reinforced at each visit.  
Questionnaires are administered on the electronic tablet and on paper at each visit.  These 
procedures should occur before any other types of study procedures are performed.  When both electronic tablet and paper questionnaires are required at a visit, the electronic questionnaires 
should be done first.  The order in which the electronic tablet and paper questionnaires should be administered are as follows:  
• Electronic tablet questionnaires (in the order they appear in the tablet)  
• Paper questionnaires

−  EHP Work Domain [Week24/Baseline, Week 52 , Week 78, and Week 104 only] 
Patients will bring their eDiary, analgesic med ications, and study drug to each visit.  The site 
must document the start and stop dates of the patient’s menses. 
An endometrial biopsy will have been performed at the parent study Week 24 visit for all 
patients who participated in MVT -601- 3101 (see MVT -601-3101 protocol for details).  An 
endometrial biopsy is required at Week  [ADDRESS_856255] dose of study drug 
was taken during Week 32 or earlier or within four weeks after completion of the Week 52 endometrial biopsy.  However, the procedure may be done if it will aid in the evaluation of an 
ongoing adverse event.   An endometrial biopsy at Week 104 is recommended for all patients 
who complete the open- label extension  ; however, patients will have the option to opt out.  
Safety monitoring  for this study includes physical examination, clinical laboratory tests,  
pregnancy tests, and adve rse event collection at each visit.   Clinical chemistri es will be collected 
at each visit.  A complete blood count will be collected at Week 24/Baseline, Week 28, Week 36, 
Week 52 , Week 65, Week 78, Week 91, and Week 104.  At the Week 24/Baseline visit , Week 52

points described in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.1).  The scan will be read by [CONTACT_639876].  Training, quality review, and readings will be done by a central radiology laboratory ad de scribed in the central radiology 
charter for bone mineral density . 
Throughout the study, the same DXA apparatus will be used at each site and operated in the 
same scan mode for all scans for an individual patient and should be the same as used for the patient during the parent study (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102).  The central core imaging 
laboratory will collect and evaluate all DXA scan for acceptability.  Bone mineral density  
changes for individual patients will be  monitored by [CONTACT_639944]. 
Determination of bone mineral density by [CONTACT_639945] -up of findings 
will proceed according to the following rules:  
• For early termination occurring between We ek 24 and Week 52: 
−  For early terminatio n occurring before Week 36, DXA is not required at the Early 
Termination visit unless it will aid in the assessment of an adverse event;  
Follow- up DXA required at 6 months (± 1 month) if most recent DXA  bone 
mineral density loss at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 2% relative to the 
parent study baseline; 
−  For early termination occurring after Week 36, DXA is required at early termination 
unless a DXA result is available from within six weeks prior to early termination; 
Follow- up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if the most recent DXA scan 
was at Week  24 and bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total 
hip was > 2%, relative to the parent study baseline; 
−  Follow- up DXA is req uired at 6 mont hs (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA scan , 
bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) or total hip was > 3%, relative to 
the parent study baseline; 
• For early termination occurring between Week 52 and Week 104: 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  55 CONFIDENTIAL  −  DXA is required at early termin ation unless a DXA result is available from within six 
weeks prior to early termination;  
Follow- up DXA is required at 6 months (± 1 month) if on the most recent DXA, 
bone mineral density loss at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) or total hip was > 7%, 
relative to the parent study baseline; 
• If patients have [ADDRESS_856264]- treatment follow -up scans that show bone loss of > 1.5% at the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or > 2.5% at total hip compared with  parent study baseline, patients are 
strongly  encouraged to come back to the clinic for an additional post- treatment follow -up 
scan [ADDRESS_856265] the following clinical laboratory evaluations 
(vitamin D, thyroid- stimulating  hormone, parathyroid hormone, creatinine, calcium, and 
phosphorous). 
• If patients have 12-month post- treatment follow -up scans that show bone loss of ≥ 3 % at the 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or total hip compared with  parent study baseline, patients are referred to 
and strongly encouraged to see a bone specialist for further evaluation or the bone loss.  
Patients undergoing 12-month post- treatment follow -up should also have the following 
clinical laboratory evaluations (vitamin D, thyroid-stimulating hormone, parathyroid 
hormone, creatinine, calcium, and phosphorous). 
Note:  When a patient is referred to a bone specialist for evaluation and management, Myovant will provide a Bone Consultation Letter to the investigator for this 
additional bone consult and will request the site to provide a summary of the 
evaluation and management plan once the consultation is complete . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Endometrial Biopsy  
For patients in parent study MVT -601-3101, an endometrial biopsy is performed at the Week  [ADDRESS_856266] dose of study drug was taken during Week 32 or earlier or 
within four weeks after completion of the Week 52 endometrial biopsy.  However, the endometrial biopsy may be obtained if it will aid in the evaluation of an ongoing adverse event.  
An endometrial biopsy at Week 104 is recommended for all patients who complete the open-label extension; however, patients will have the option to opt out.  Patient participation in the Week 104 endometrial biopsy is voluntary and refusal to participate will not preclude entry into 
the study or indicate withdrawal from the study.  
The Week 52 , Week 104, and Early Termination  visit endometrial biopsy samples w ill be 
submitted to the central laborato ry.  If the Week 52,Week 104 , or Early Termination  visit biopsy 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  56 CONFIDENTIAL  specimen is inadequate, a transvaginal ultrasound for endometrial thickness should be obtained 
and read locally.  The transvaginal ultrasound findings w ill be used to determine if further action 
is required:  
• Endometrial thickness ≤ 5 mm – no further action required. 
• Endometrial thickness > 5 mm at any location or any other endometrial abnormality – repeat 
endometrial sampling.  Contact [CONTACT_639946].  
Investigators should contact [CONTACT_941] m edical monitor if a patient refuse s to have an endometrial 
biopsy at Week  52 or the Early Termination  visit .Unscheduled endometrial biopsies may also be 
performed when medically indicated and as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator should obtain approval from the sponsor to perform an unscheduled endometrial 
biopsy, unless urgently indicated.  Additional consent is not required in this circumstance. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Status of Menstruation Recovery  
If the first menstruation after the  end of study treatment administration is observed before the 
Follow- up visit, the date of onset of the first menstruation is recorded in the  eCRF.  Patients 
whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom the re is no explanation for 
the la ck of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 3 
(+0.5) months after the Follow -Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and will be asked 
about factors that may affect resumption of menses.   If a patient is lost to follow -up, three 
documented attempts should be made to contact [CONTACT_66079].  If unable to contact 
[CONTACT_66079], a certified letter must be sent to the patient.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical stud y upon completion of the 
Week  104 visit, follow -up under this protocol to determine the status of menstruation recovery 
may not be required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mammogram 
A mammogram will be performed at Week 52 or Week 104/Early Termination  visit (see the 
Schedule of Activit ies in  Section  1.1) for patients ≥ [ADDRESS_856267] Imaging Reporting and Da ta System category 1 or 2 or equivalent or had benign 
findings, as determined by [CONTACT_10982] , a mammogram is not required at 
Week 52 but should be completed by [CONTACT_10585] 104/Early Termination .  If a patient turns 40  years 
old after the W eek 52 visit has occurred, a mammogram should be performed no later than the 
Week  104/Early Termination  visit.  
All mammogram results will be read locally  using Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 
categories or equivalent (see Appendix 8)  and recorded in the eCRF .  The following actions  will 
be taken depending on the reading: 
• Category 1 or 2 or equivalent:  normal mammogram; no further action is required unless 
determined by [CONTACT_10982];  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  57 CONFIDENTIAL  • Category 0 or 3 or equivalent :  adjunctive breast imaging or follow -up mammogram  will be  
required, and the investigator should contact [CONTACT_639947];  
• Category 4 to 6 or equivalent:  the investigator should c ontact the medical monitor within 24 
hours. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  58 CONFIDENTIAL  7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
Study assessments of safety include adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and bone mineral density assessments. 
7.1. Adverse Event  Definitions  
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
Adverse event:  An adverse event  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product . 
Events meeting the definition of an adverse event  include : 
• A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre-existing condition; 
• Development of an intercurrent illness during th e study; 
• Development of symptoms that may or may not be  related to the use of a concomitant 
medication or investigational product; 
• Injury or accidents:  If a  medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, 
the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, 
for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately) ; 
and 
• An investigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormalit y is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_639948]:  
−  Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; 
−  Requires active intervention ; 
−  Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Events that do not  meet th e definition of an adverse event  include: 
• Medical or su rgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the 
condition th at leads to the procedure is an adverse event; 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration that do not wors en; 
• Situations where an untoward medi cal event has not occurred (eg,  planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639826], with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent) ; 
• Endometriosis- associated pain is not considered an adverse event in this study because it is 
being quantitatively measured as the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and gr aded 
according to the National Cancer Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  59 CONFIDENTIAL  (CTCAE).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_329886], such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a 
period of consecutive  days are “intermittent ”.  All other events are “continuous”.  Add itional 
information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events 
are provided below. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a.  Results in death ; 
b. Is life -threatening; 
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.   It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe .  For example, 
drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal . 
c.  Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; NOTE:   In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639815] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
independent of the duration of that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222228].  If a complicati on prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1085], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event sho uld be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639816] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
NOTE:  The term disability mean s a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life  functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and a ccidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e.  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
f.  Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abus e. 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of serious adverse events by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory 
authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based 
upon established criteria.  Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious 
adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC).  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events.  Open-ended and non- leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  Appropriate questions include:  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  60 CONFIDENTIAL  • “How are you feeling?” 
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last vis it/contact?” 
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last 
visit/contact? 
The patient’s eDiary entries, including bleeding and answers to the other patient- reported 
outcome measures, will not be used as a prima ry means to collect adverse events, however they 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_639881].  Should the i nvestigator 
or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with 
these instrument s, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be 
undertaken.  Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously 
reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. 
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until 
the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic.  At the conclusion of the study, the 
investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if 
additional follow -up is  warranted . 
All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and 
completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source 
documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment di scontinuation must 
be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source 
documents.  Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listin g 
the individual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event.  
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as described in  Section  7.[ADDRESS_856268], as also specified in the study 
Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.1).  Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the 
safety reportin g period should be reported to the sponsor regar dless of causal relationship to 
study drug treatment. 
Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section  7.6. 
7.3. Assigning Causal  Relationship to Study Drug 
The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be 
assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event.  The 
following definitions are to be used for the relatio nship of the adverse event to study drug: 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  61 CONFIDENTIAL  • Probably related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).  
• Possibly related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_64716].  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
• Not related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administratio n that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in 
which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. 
All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record .  In the 
event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on 
the eCRF as such.  
7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events  
Severity describes the intensi ty of a specifi c event (as in mild, moderate , or severe myocardial 
infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a 
severe headache.  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outco me or 
action taken. 
The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute CTCAE.  For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 
should be used to determine the grade severity.  
Table 7-5 Criteria for Determining  the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not 
Specified by [CONTACT_624550]  
1/Mild  Asymptomatic or m ild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
2/Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living  
3/Severe or medically significant  Not im mediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77081]; dis abling; limiting self -care activities 
of daily living  
4/Life -threatening  Life-threatening cons equences; urgent intervention indicated  
5/Death  Death related to ad verse event  
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  
Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case 
report form and in t he patient’s source documents.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856269] ≥ 3 × 
ULN. 
Any ALT or AST elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the Open -Label Treatment 
Period  or the Follow- Up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the Safety Report  Form  
within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event  (see Section  7.6), even if 
the event does not meet serious adverse event  criteria .  Additional instructions for evaluating 
patients with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN may be found in Appendix 7.  
7.5.1. Criteria for Temporary Withhol ding of Study Drug in Association with Liver 
Test Abnormalities  
Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA, 2009 ]. 
If the following liver test  abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with 
appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory 
profile has returned to normal/b aseline status), and the event reported as a serious adverse event : 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN; or  
• ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN and total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or the INR > 1.5; or 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN wi th appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin) is discovered and the labora tory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline 
values.  The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree wi th any decision to rechallenge. 
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalit ies is considered 
possibly drug induc ed. 
7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in Association w ith Liver 
Test Abnormalities  
Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the fo llowing 4 criteria are 
met (ie, potential severe drug -induc ed liver injury/Hy’s la w case):  
1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 × ULN; AND  
2. Total bilirubin increases to >  2 × ULN or INR >  1.5; AND  
3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 × ULN ; AND  
4. No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; 
important a lternative causes include, but are not limited to the following:  
−  Hepatobiliary tract disease ; 
−  Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus);

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  64 CONFIDENTIAL  If the patient died, the report should include the cause of death as the event term (with death as 
outcome) and whether or not the event leading to death was related to study drug treatment, as 
well as the autopsy findings if available. 
Do not delay reporting a suspected serious adverse event in order to obtain additional 
information.  Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow -up to the 
initial report.  All serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, until the event has stabilized, and/or reached a new baseline.  All serious adverse events continuing at the completion of the study must be assessed or followed to determine outcome.  
7.7. Study Drug  Overdose Management  
The medical monitor must be contact[CONTACT_624552]. 
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by 
a study patien t, at a dose above that assigned to that individual patien t according to the study 
protocol. 
For this study, any dose of relugolix > 80 mg  withi n a 24-hour window is an overdose and any 
dose of estradiol/norethindrone  acetate > 2 x the protocol dose is an overdose (ie, more than 
2 capsules taken within a 24-hour window).  There is no known antidote for an overdose.  In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_22840] 24 hours ; 
• Closely monitor the patien t for adverse events and laboratory abnormalities ; 
• All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_3452], using a 
safety report  form according to Section  7.6, whether or not the overdose is associated with 
an adverse event; 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing  in the 
eCRF.  
The medical monitor, in consultation with the investigator, will make decisions regarding patien t 
status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patien t. 
7.8. Pregnancy Reporting  
If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patient from the 
study treatment immed iately and have her return for an Early Termination  visit.  
If the patient agrees, the investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the 
pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment. 
A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_856271] menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this 
form, as available.   Document the pregnancy in the eCRF as well.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report 
the outcome to the sponsor. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  65 CONFIDENTIAL  7.9. Vital Signs,  Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tests, 
Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures  
Section  6.5.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs,  and bone mineral density. 
7.10. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated wi th relugolix in women include nonserious 
events of hot flush, headach e, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density .  In this protocol, 
relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on  endometriosis -associated pain .  Low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy wi th estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of 
bone mineral density during treatment with relugolix . 
Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment in women, based on nonclinical 
data and data available for sim ilar compo unds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects 
(corrected QT [ QTc] prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) , 
reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovascular changes (insulin resistance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increa sed weight ) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, there are potential risks associated with 
the addition of estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  Summaries of findings from both noncli nical and 
clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator 
Brochure. 
The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-2. 
Table 7-[ADDRESS_856272] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Bone Mineral Density

8.1. Clinical Procedures  
Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site, if necessary , prior to initiation of the 
study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring 
requirements,  reporting of serious adverse events , and to ensure a full understanding of the 
Investigator Site File  with the site personnel. 
8.2. Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_941] s ponsor (or designee) in accordance with current Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  By [CONTACT_12570], the i nvestigator grants permission 
to Myovant Sciences GmbH  (or designee) and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-
site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  In order to assure the accuracy of data 
collected in the  eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have 
access to original source do cuments (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports).  
During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  A study m onitor will contact a nd visit the 
site regularly and will be allowed, on request at a mutua lly acceptable time, to inspect the various 
records of the study.  It will be the study m onitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF  at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, 
correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries, and to meet with the investigator to discuss study progress and compliance with the protocol and GCP.  The study monitor should have access to 
laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the en tries on the 
eCRF.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  For this study, patient data will be entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other 
sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). 
Management of clinical data will be performed  in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). 
Adverse events and concomitant me dications terms will be coded using the Medic al Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary 
Enhanced (WHO -DDE) , respectively. 
The investigator will retain original source documents and the sponsor will re ceive 
eCRF -required data as electronic datasets.  Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to 
the sponsor.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  69 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for 
this study. 
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of both the parent and extension studies will be 
presented by [CONTACT_639882].  No formal treatment 
comparisons will be performed for this ext ension study.  Continuous data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.  Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. 
There will be two analyses: one at Week 52 and one at Week 1 04.  A clinical study report will be 
generate d from each analysis.  
9.1. Randomization Methods  
This is a single -arm, open-label extension study; patients are not randomized.  All patients who 
have entered the extension study will be treated with open- label relug olix and low -dose 
hormonal add-back therapy for 80 weeks.  
9.2. Analysis Populations 
Efficacy data analyses will be performed on the Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population, 
defined as all patients who were randomized in a parent study  (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102) and who have received any amount of r andomized study drug. 
Safety data analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, defined as all patients who were 
randomized in a parent study and who have received any amount of randomized study drug. The analysis methods for safety and efficacy endpoints are the same as those used for the parent 
studies, unless otherwise specified in the SAP.  
9.3. Sample Size Justification  
Because this is an extension study, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639857] a parent study and who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension study.  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients (67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will p articipate in this study.  
9.4. Efficacy Analyses 
Unle ss otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be conducted using the mITT Population.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_639883]. 
The point estimates  and 2- sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic medications,  proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medi cations ) will be calculated.  
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  70 CONFIDENTIAL  A responder at a gi ven time point and for a specific type of pain (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) is 
defined as a patient who had a reduction in that type of pain from Baseline in the parent study 
greater than or equal to a pre- determin ed threshold and who did not have an increase in the use 
of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis- associated pain compared with the use at 
Baseline. Patients who had a pain reduction less than the pre -determined threshold or who had an 
increase in  the use of analgesics for endometriosis- associa ted pain will be considered non-
responders.  The pain reduction thresholds will be determined for NMPP and dysmenorrhea 
separately (see the SAP for details) for the parent studies and these same thresholds will be 
applied to this study. 
Baseline values are calculated using the Baseline pain assessment period, which is defined as the 
period from the date of the first dose of placebo in the parent study Run-In Period through the 
day prior to the first dose  of randomized study drug.  Patients’ average NRS pain  scores and use 
of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis- associated pain  (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) will 
be compared between a given visit- specific pain assessment period (eg, Week 28, Week 32, etc.) 
and the Baseline pain assessment  period.  The visit- specific pain assessment period is defined as 
the last [ADDRESS_856279] dose of study drug treatment 
received prior to the visit date.  
For any pain assessment period (Baseline or visit- specific), the average NRS  scores will be 
calculated for dysmenorrhea and NMPP separately.  An average NRS score for dysmenorrhea is calculated as the average NRS score over the days with menses during a given pain assessment 
period.  An average NRS score for NMPP is calculated as the average NRS score over the days 
without menses during a given pain assessment period.  The analgesic use for a given pain assessment period is summarized by [CONTACT_639949] 35.  Additional details on 
calculating dose counts and on the precise definition of an increase in analgesic use will be 
provided in the SAP. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficacy endpoints (listed below) similar to tho se used 
for the parent studies  at Week 52 and Week 104. 
• Change from the parent study Baseline in the EHP- 30 Pain Domain scores;  
• Change from the parent study Baseline to in the mean dysmenorrhea NRS score;

Myovant Sciences GmbH  71 CONFIDENTIAL  • Change from the parent study Baseline in the mean dyspareunia functional impairment on the 
sB&B scale;  
• Change from the parent study Baseline in severity scores on the PGA for pain; 
• Proportion of responders based on EHP -30 Pain Domain scores; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline in function impairment on the PGA for function; 
• Change from the parent study Baseline in each of the non- pain EHP -30 domains (Control and 
Powerlessness, Social Support, Emotional Well -Being, and Self- Image);  
• Change from the parent study Baseline pain ass essment period in d ysmenorrhea- related 
functional effects (sB&B);  
• Change from the parent study Baseline pain assessment period in NMPP -related functional 
effects (sB&B).  
For binary endpoints, the point estimate and 2-sided 95% CI for the proportion will be provided by [CONTACT_177318]. 
For endpoint of proportion of responders based on EHP-30 Pain Domain scores, a responder is 
defined using the same within -patient score change threshold determined from the parent studies.  
Detai ls on the endpoint analyses including derivations, handling of missing data, and statistical 
methods will be provided in the SAP. 
9.5. Safety Analyses  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, 
physical examinatio ns, clinical laboratory tests, 12- lead ECG, bone mineral density with DXA, 
mammograms (women ≥ 40 years of age), and endometrial biopsy.  Safety summaries by

The treatment- emergent period will be defined as the period of time from the first dose date  and 
time of randomized study drug in the parent study through [ADDRESS_856280] of chemistry, hematology, and hormonal tests.  Only data collected by 
[CONTACT_639951].  The National Cancer Institute CTCAE will 
be used to categorize toxicity grade for the laboratory parameters.  Shift tables will be provided 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856281] -baseline tox icity 
grade.  For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by [CONTACT_12397], a shift table based upon 
the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summarize the 
parent study Baseline versus post -baseline results.  All data will be listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_765].  The change from parent study Baseline to each post- baseline study visit will be presented 
by [CONTACT_639885]. 
For vital signs parameters, including temperature, all data will b e listed and summarized by [CONTACT_765].  
The change from parent study Baseline to each post -baseline study visit will be presented by 
[CONTACT_639903].  
Clinical laboratory data consist of chemistry, hematology, and hormonal tests.  Only data 
collected by [CONTACT_624479].  Electrocardiograms  will also 
be read centrally.  The distributions of QTc interval will be summarized at each visit.  All data 
will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_765].  The change from parent study Baseline to each post-baseline study visit will be presented by [CONTACT_624480].  
The in cidence of vasomotor symptoms as assessed through adverse event reporting will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_639952] a rm. 
Bone mineral density data will be collected and analyzed by [CONTACT_624481] (g), bone area (area, cm
2), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) each 
for L1, L2, L3, L4, total hip, and femoral neck, and average bone mineral density of L1- L4 
(lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), Z -score for bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), total hip, and femoral 
neck. 
For the relugolix add-back treatment Group A, the lower bound of the 95% CI for (arithmetic) 
mean percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) will be compared with a pre -specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to 
evaluate magnitude of bone mineral density loss after 52 weeks of treatment.  If the lower bound 
is > -2.2%, the bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add-back treatment will be considered 
insignificant.  As supportive analysis, least square means and 95% CI for percent  change at 
Week  52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density will be prov ided based on mixed 
effects model (assumed missing at random) for each parent study treatment group.   The 95% CI 
for mean percentage change at Week 104 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) will be  provided along with descriptive s tatistics for bone mineral density  
loss at Week 104 as supportive analyses. 
All data will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_765].  The absolute change and  percent change from 
parent study Baseline to Weeks 36 , 52, and 104 and associated 95% CIs will be presented by [CONTACT_639953] r.  The number and 
percentage of patients meeting a bone mineral density decline of at least 4%, 5%, 6%, or 7% by 
[CONTACT_266002] (lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, or femoral neck) will be estimated with 95% CIs by [CONTACT_639889]. 
Additional analyses w ill be performed to examine the correlation between bone mineral density 
loss with demographic and baseline characteristics and with treatment exposure.  Details will be provided in the SAP.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  74 CONFIDENTIAL  10. RESPONSIBILITIES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South 
Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant.  For studies conducted under a US  investigational new drug 
application, the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as 
outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 
2001/20/EC. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical study , the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical study  is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (inclu ding studies that show equivalence to an 
effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This 
requires that investigators and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arran gements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied.  This 
documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator .  The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in 
reportable interests during the study and for [ADDRESS_856282]/Independent Ethics Committee Approval 
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patien t (such as 
advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator to an IRB or IEC.  Approval from the IRB or IE C 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents 
reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be 
submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation.  
10.1.3. Informed Consent  
The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual 
participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures.  The 
investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting 
written informed consent  that contains all elements required by [CONTACT_30104], state, local, and 
institutional regulations or requirements .  Each informed conse nt form will be appropriately

obtaining consent. 
10.1.4. Confidentiality  
The investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  Only patient number, date of bi rth, and an 
identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample 
submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory.  The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screen ed and for all patien ts enrolled in the 
study. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited 
to the Investigator Bro chure , protocol, e CRFs  and other study forms , the investigational drug, 
and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This information is not to be disclosed to any t hird party 
(except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) 
without prior written consent from the sponsor.  The i nvestigator further agrees to take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_639954]. 
10.1.5. Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should be classified into at least the following two categories:  
1. Investigator’s study file.  The investigator’s study file will contain the  Investigator 
Brochure, protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae , 
authorization and training  forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
2. Patien t clinical source documents.  The required source data should include the following 
for each patien t: 
−  Patient  identification (name, date of birth,  gender); 
−  Documentation that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical 
examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); 
−  Participation in the study (including study number); 
−  Study discussed and date of informed consent; 
−  Dates of all visits;  
−  Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed;  
−  Results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760];  
−  Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study drug (drug dispensing, return , and 
accountability  should be documented as well); 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  76 CONFIDENTIAL  −  Record of all adverse events and other safety param eters (star t and end date, and causality 
and intensity as assigned by [CONTACT_093] ); 
−  Concomitant medication (including start and end date) and indication; and  
−  Date of study  completion and reason for early termination , if applicable.  
All clinical study document ation must be retained by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator until at least [ADDRESS_856283] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, US , Europe, or Japan) and until 
there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no 
application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until [ADDRESS_856284] and 
study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and 
signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, 
approval of regulator y authorities as applicable, decoding procedures for blinded studie s, 
curriculum vitae and all training record s of study site personnel, and all correspondence 
pertaining to the conduct of the study. 
Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another 
location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. 
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  When source documents are required for the continued 
care of the patient , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786]. 
10.1.6. Electronic Case Report Forms  
For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed as specified in the Investigator Site File .  
The eCRF casebook  for each study patient will be signed by [CONTACT_9940]- investigator 
(as appropriate)  listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate local health authority documents.  
This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-
randomization screening period  if an eC RF was initiated).  If a patien t withdraws from the study, 
the reason must be noted on the eCRF.  If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment-limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 
10.1.7. Investigational Product Accountability  
The investigator or investigator’s designee ( eg, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug (active and 
placebos).  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity 
and condition), patien t dispensing records, accountability , and returned or destroyed study 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856285].  Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities 
dispensed to patien ts, including lot  number, date dispensed, P atient ID  number, and t he initials of 
the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the 
sponsor requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed  once the study monitor has reviewed 
and returned used and unused study drug for accountability purposes.  If the site cann ot meet the 
sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor 
(or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_69878]. 
10.1.8. Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made 
available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or 
IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 
10.1.9. Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol.

Category Assessment  Follow- Up 
0 Need additional imaging evaluation:  means 
that more studies are necessary to gather more 
information.  Additional imaging needed before a category can 
be assigned.  
1 Negative:  means that there is no significant or 
noticeable abnormality to report.  Continue annual screening mammography (for 
women over age 40).  
2 Benign (noncancerous) finding: means that 
there has been a finding, such as benign 
calcifications or fibroadenoma, which is not 
cancerous.  Continue annual screening mammography (for 
women over age 40).  
3 Probably benign:  means that there is a finding 
that is most likely benign, but should be 
followed in a shorter period of time to see if the area of concern changes.  Receive a 6 -month follo w-up mammogram.  
4 Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_112724]:  means th at there are 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_624375].  May require biopsy.  
5 Highly suggestive of malignancy (cancer):  
means that there are findings that look like and probably are cancer.  Requires biopsy.  
6 Known biopsy -proven malignancy (c ancer):  
means that any findings on the mammogram 
have already proven to be cancer through a 
biopsy.  Biopsy confirms presence of cancer before 
treatment begins.  
 
 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856294] during the COVID -19 
Pandemic 
The novel coronavirus 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the conduct of clinical trials 
globally.  Regional quarantine laws, travel restric tions, and site closures present challenges to 
normal study conduct and may  lead to  missed study visits or procedures or an inter ruption to  a 
patient ’s study drug supply. 
Myovant Sciences has thoroughly reviewed guidance documents from various country and 
regional r egulatory agencies and has put mitigation plans in place to ensure the safety of patients 
is maintained, the study continues to be conducted in  compliance with good clinical prac tice 
(GCP), and risks to the integrity of the study are minimized .  These plans will remain in place 
through the duration of the COVID-[ADDRESS_856295] with the study protocol 
and this guidance.  Deviations from the protocol will be documented, but those resulting 
specifically from the COVID -19 pandemic will be marked as su ch.  All deviations resulting from 
the COVID- 19 pandemic will be summarized in the clinical study r eport.  
Visit Sched ules and Study Procedures  
Local policies, institutional restrictions, and/or patient ability/willingness to make site visits may curtail th e ability to adhere to the in -person, on-site visit schedule required by [CONTACT_760].  
Investigators at clinical sites should evaluate the appropriateness of an on -site study visit during 
the COVID-[ADDRESS_856296] allowable portion of the visit  window, 
taking all measures to prevent contracting COVID -19. 
• All protocol required  study procedures should be performed  whenever possible.  
• Safety assessments should be prioritized if only limited assessments are performed.  
• If assessments are limited, Investigator s should document whether  the assessments 
performed are  adequate to ensure it is safe for the patient to continue in the study. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-3103  Amendment 3, 01 Jul  2020  
Myovant Sciences GmbH  119 CONFIDENTIAL  • Investigators should use all  available information to determine whether in -person 
visits are necessary to fully assure the safety of study patients (for example to carry 
out procedures necessary to assess safety or the safe use of the study drug 
appropriately) or whether alternative means of assessment are adequate to assure the 
safety of conti nuing patients in the study.  Such decisions should be documented.  
Investigators can contact [CONTACT_639956] m edical monitor for consultation as necessary.  
If the clinical study site is closed  or the patient is unable/unwilling to attend on -site study 
visits  due to the COVID -19 pandemic , alternative methods for completing assessments (eg, 
phone contact [CONTACT_521540]) should be implemented.  
• Investigators must assess and evaluate the patient’s continued participation and dosing with limited safety assessment . 
• At a minimum, investigational site staff should make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_639957], document 
concomitant medications, and study drug dosing since the last study visi t. 
• If the safety blood draws cannot be performed through the central laboratory per protocol, the investigator may advise the patient to have blood drawn at a local laboratory if there is a safety concern.  If two consecutive study visits ar e missed  and th e patient is unable to return 
to the site , the investigator should advise the patient to have protocol specified safety labs 
completed at a local laboratory to assess for any safety concerns. In both cases, the local laboratory  results should be documented in the eCRF.  
• Investigational sites should report all serious adverse events, adverse events of clinical interest, overdose, and pregnancy that the patient reports during these calls within 24 hours of awareness.  
• Patients  should be reminded of the importance of taking study treatment daily, adhering to 
protocol- specified analgesics,  and taking non-hormonal contraception. 
• Study patients should continue to complete their daily eDiary, even if they run out of study 
drug, and site staff  should motivate them  to do so. 
Patients  should have the contact [CONTACT_639958], including adverse events  they may experience in real time.  
As soon as the study patients are able to return to the investigational site  for an on- site visit, they 
should return either for their next scheduled visit (if still within protocol window) or for an 
unscheduled visit (if outside of expected protocol visit window).  
Study Participant Study Drug Supply  
If a regional lockdown, travel restrictions, or site closure is imminent due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_856297] the site to report any medical issues they may experience and site staff should 
communicate with the patients to determine if it is appropriate for the p atient to continue dosing 
with study drug if/when in-person study visits are not possible. 
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT-601-[ADDRESS_856298]- to-patient (DTP)  delivery  of study drug by [CONTACT_639959].  Consent authorizing DTP supply will be obtained.  Sites should defer to national guidance on how this will occur.  Where permitted by [CONTACT_639960], verbal consent will be taken via telephone or video call and noted in the patient’s source file. Where required, 
by [CONTACT_639960], this will be followed up with written consent during the next clinic visit.  
Every effort will be made to obtain the patient’s written consent for DTP prior to delivery or 
shipment, where this is required by [CONTACT_639960]. 
In the event that none of the above are possible for participants to continue taking study medication, a patient may need to be discontinued per the study protocol.  Such decisions will be made on a case-by- case basis in discussion with the Investigator  and m edical monitor . 
Onsite Study Monitoring Restrictions  
In the event study monitors/ clinical research associates are not allowed to travel and/or return to 
a clinical site to monitor and source document verify study data, Myovant has developed plans to ensure monitors: 
• Remotely verify source documentation  as much data as reasonably possible without 
burdening sites, if allowed by [CONTACT_639961], focusing on pages key 
to the interpre tability of the study and the safety of participants . 
• Remotely monitor study data through cross checking of various systems housing patient data against what is captured in the eCRFs.  
Additional guidance on conducting clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic may be found 
in the following documents released by [CONTACT_639962] , which may be updated 
(updates supersede the versions listed here) : 
• FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Pandemic Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional Review Boards (March

Study Design  
The SPI[INVESTIGATOR_639789] [ADDRESS_856333] completed their participation in one of the phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled parent studies (MVT -601-3101 or 
MVT -601-3102).  All patients will receive open- label oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered 
with low -dose- estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg for up to 80 weeks.  Approximately 
800 women with endometriosis -associated pain will be enrolled.  The objectives of the study are to 
evaluate long -term efficacy and safety through up to 104 weeks of treatment (including treatment

Myovant Sciences GmbH  12 CONFIDENTIAL  during the parent study) of relugolix co-administered with low -dose estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  
Eligible patients will have completed participation in one of the parent studies and consented to 
participate in this extension study.  Baseline procedures will be done at the same visit for t his extension 
study (referred to as the “Week 24/Baseline visit” in this study)  that coincides with the Week  [ADDRESS_856334] Week 24 procedure in 
the parent study.   The Week 24/Baseli ne visit will include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory 
assessments, a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG), bone densitometry, patient -reported outcome 
assessments, and endometrial biopsy (if required).  When Week [ADDRESS_856335] 
been completed, the investigator will assess patient eligibility for participation in the open -label 
extension study.  The eligibility assessment will be based on data available at the Week  24/Baseline 
visit.  No MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856336] dose of study drug in the parent study on the day prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit  and will receive their first dose of study drug for this extension study in the 
clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for this extension study and has provided informed 
consent to participate.   Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior 
to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  The administration of the first dose of study drug for MVT -601-3103 
will define enrollment into this study.  Study participants will then take the open -label study treatment 
(relugolix 40  mg co -administered with estradiol 1.0 mg and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) orally once 
daily for 80 weeks.   If necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on 
site, others), and with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for 
MVT -601-3103 may be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week 24/Baseline visit.   
If the first dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10- day interval, the parent study follow -up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, electronic diary [ eDiary ] completion, etc.).  
During the 80-week Open -Label Treatment Period and the ~30- day Follow -Up Period, patients will 
continue to record study treatment, assessment of pain using the NRS, menstrual bleeding, analgesic 
use, and the functional effects of endometriosis- associated pain (sB&B) in the  eDiary.  Only study-
specific rescue analgesic medications should be used starting with the Week  24/Baseline visit and 
through the Follow -Up visit and these medications will be taken for cont rol of pain and not 
prophylactically.  Health -related quality of life questionnaires; PGIC for dysmenorrhea, NMPP, and 
dyspareunia; and PGA for pain and function will be completed during the visits on an electronic tablet or on paper, according to the Sche dule of Activities (Section  1.1). 
At the Week 36, Week 52,  and Week 104/Early Termination visits , each patient will have an 
assessment of bone mineral density via dual -energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA).    
Safety will be ass essed throughout the study by [CONTACT_639850], vital signs and 
weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG s, mammograms (for patients 
required to have this procedure ; see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), endometrial biopsies, and bone mineral density

Determination of bone mineral density by [CONTACT_639974] 104 visit and follow -
up of findings will proceed according to the following rules:

• If patients have [ADDRESS_856339] -treatment follow -up sca ns that show bone loss of >  1.5% at 
the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or > 2.5% at total hip compared with the parent study baseline, 
patients are strongly encouraged to come back to the clinic for an additional post -treatment 
follow -up scan [ADDRESS_856340] -treatment follow -up scans that show bone loss of ≥  3% at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_321712]/or total hip compared with the parent study baseline, patients are recommended to be 
referred to and strongly encouraged to see a bone specialist for further evaluation of the 
bone loss . 
Note:  When a patient is referred to a bone specialist for evaluation and management, 
Myovant will provide a Bone Consultation Letter to the investigator for this additional bone consult and will request the site to provide a summary of the evaluation and management plan once the consultation is complete . 
Status of menstruation recovery will be documented at the Follow -Up visit.  Patients whose menses has 
not resumed as of the Follow -Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption 
(eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 3 months (+ 0.5 months ) after 
the Follow -Up visit to  determine if  menses has resumed and will be asked about factors that may affect 
resumption of menses.   If a patient is lost to follow -up, three  documented attempts should be made to 
contact [CONTACT_66079].  If unable to contact [CONTACT_639975], a certified letter must be 
sent to the patient.   A mammogram will be performed at Week 52 or at Week 104/Early Termination 
for women who are or become ≥  40 years old during the study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).

Myovant Sciences GmbH  16 CONFIDENTIAL  Duration of 
Treatment  Study treatment will be self -administered for 80 weeks (Open -Label Treatment 
Period ). 
Concomitant Medicinal Products Systematically Prescribed for All Study 
Patients  
Two protocol -specified analgesics include a first -line non- steroidal anti -
inflammatory drug and a second- line opi[INVESTIGATOR_289355]/acetaminophen or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/paracetamol  combination for endometriosis -related pain relief as 
required.  The specific analgesic drugs offered may differ for different countries 
or regions.   The analgesics for each patient will be the same as those prescribed 
for her during the parent study.  
Criteria for 
Evaluation  Descriptive assessments of long -term efficacy and safety will be made between 
the parent study Baseline  and Week 52,  and between  the parent study Baseline 
and the end of the extension study (Week  104) for the following parent study 
treatment groups:  
• Parent Study Group A:  Randomized to 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg 
once daily co -administered with 1.0  mg estradiol and 0.5  mg nore thindrone 
acetate in the parent study;

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  18 CONFIDENTIAL  Efficacy  
Efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_639853] (ie, Parent Study Groups A, B, and C) for the Extension Study Population .  The analyses 
methods for efficacy endpoints are similar to those used for the parent studies, unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
The point estimate and 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue  analgesic medications,  
proportion of responders based on NMPP scores  and use of rescue analgesic medications) will be 
calculated.  
The methods for analyzing the additional efficacy endpoints are described in the SAP. 
Safety  
Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, bone mineral density with DXA  scan, 
mammograms (for patients required to have this procedure, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and endometrial 
biopsy .  Safety data analyses will use data from all patients from the parent studies who receive any 
amount of study drug (ie, from parent study Baseline to Week 52  or Week 104).  
Drug exposure will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086].  Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse 
events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_639977] (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, high level 
term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by [CONTACT_99130], relationship to study drug, and severity.  Laboratory values will be classified by [CONTACT_639892] .  Laboratory shift tables of the parent 
study Baseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced.  
Bone mineral density will be evaluated in all patients at the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4), femoral neck, and 
total hip at the Week 24/Baseline, Week  36, Week 52, and Week 104/Early Termination visits.  The 
absolute change  and percent change from parent study Baseline and Z -scores will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_639910].  
The mean percentage change from parent study Baseline to Week 52 in bone mineral density and 
correspo nding 95% CI will be provided for  each treatment group.  For patients who were randomize d 
to 24 weeks of treatment with relugolix and add- back in the parent studies (Group A in MVT -601-3101 
or MVT -601-3102) and enrolled in the extension study, the lower bo und of the 95%  CI for mean 
percen tage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(L1-L4) will be compared with a pre -specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to e valuate 
magnitude of bone mineral density los s after 52  weeks of treatment .  If the lower bound  is > -2.2%, 
bone mineral density loss  for the relugolix add- back treatment will be considered insignificant.  The 
95% CI for mean percentage change at Week 104 /Early Termination  from parent study Baseline in 
bone mineral de nsity lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1- L4) will b e provided along with descriptive statistics for bone 
mineral density  loss at Week 104 /Early Termination  as supportive analyses.  
Sample Size Estimation  
Because this is an extension st udy, the sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_639893] a parent study (MVT -601-3101 or MVT -601-3102) and who are eligible and willing to 
participate in the extension study.  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients ( 67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856357] common gynecologic disorders, evident in 70 to 90% of women with pelvic pain symptoms [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown but estimates range from 2 to 10% of women of reproductive age [Dunselman , 2014].  Symptoms range from minimal to severely debilitating.  
The pathogenesis of endometriosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity.  Although the ectopic endometriotic lesions are most commonly found in  the 
pelvis, they may also be located in the bowel, in the pleural cavity, and elsewhere.  Women with endometriosis have an increased risk of abdominopelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia compared with controls without endometriosis [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  In a study of [ADDRESS_856358] common symptom leading to diagnosis was dysmenorrhea in approximately 90%, pelvic pain in approximately 80%, and dyspareunia in approximately 45%, with 34% of women diagnosed on the basis of all three symptoms [Sinaii , 2008].  Presenting symptoms of infertility (25%) and 
endometrioma (ovarian mass) (20%) were also common [Sinaii , 2008]. 
The mechanisms of pain in endometriosis are generally postulated to involve production of substances such as growth factors and cytokines, the direct and indirect effects of active bleeding from endometriotic implants, and irritation of pelvic floor nerves or direct invasion of those nerves by [CONTACT_639859] [Practice Committee of the American Society for 
Reproductive Medicine, 2014]. 
According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee, 
“Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan with the goal of maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgical procedures” [Practice 
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014]. 
Although hysterectomy with bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy is a definitive treatment of 
endometriosis, the American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends that this option be 
reserved as a last resort for women with debilitating endometriosis symptoms who have completed childbearing and have failed to respond to alternative treatments [Practice Committee 
of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  Other surgical options for treatment of endometriosis include uterosacral nerve ablation, presacral neurectomy, and laparoscopic resection.  Rates of recurrent dysmenorrhea 1 and 3 years after laparoscopic surgery with uterosacral nerve ablation were n ot better than with laparoscopic surgery without nerve ablation 
in a large randomized trial.  Presacral neurectomy, which involves interrupting the sympathetic innervation to the uterus, improves pain but is a technically challenging procedure associated with significant risk of bleeding from the adjacent venous plexus.  Patients may also experience 
constipation and/or urinary retention postoperatively .  Laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis 
was found to be more effective at reducing pain than diagnostic laparoscopy in a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled studies.  While laparoscopic treatment is effective, pain can recur, and the option of performing multiple surgeries is limited by [CONTACT_639978], resulting in reduced fertility .  In

Myovant Sciences GmbH  25 CONFIDENTIAL  one retrospective study, subsequent surgery was performed after laparoscopic treatment in 21%, 
47%, and 45% of women after 2, 5, and 7 years, respectively [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014]. 
Medical management of endometriosis includes analgesics and treatments aimed at 
decidualization fol lowed by [CONTACT_639861].  Compared to normal endometrium, endometriotic implants are characterized by [CONTACT_639979], which synergize the activities of each other and promote 
implantation of ectopic endometrium.  In addition, the implants have upregulated estrogen synthesis pathways [Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 2014].  Interventions that reduce ovarian estrogen production reduce this synergistic process, thereby [CONTACT_639980]-associated  pain. 
Medical hormonal options include hormonal contraceptives, progestins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, danazol, and aromatase inhibitors.  Because of lack of data supporting use of one treatment over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom severity, patient preferences, side effects, efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability [Dunselman , 2014].  The main adverse effects of GnRH agonists relate to induction of a 
hypoestrogenic state (eg, bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms) whereas danazol produces androgenic adverse effects such as hirsutism, weight gain, and deepening of the voice.  Some patients treated with GnRH agonists also experience an initial “flare effect” (increased pain and bleeding), and this can result in premature discontinuation of treatment.  Side effects of 
progestin treatment can include irregular uterine bleeding, weight gain, mood changes such as depression, and bone mineral density loss with long-term use of certain agents.  
The goal of the relugolix phase 3 development plan is to demonstrate that relugolix can decrease dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain  (NMPP) in women with endometriosis safely 
through 12 months of therapy and to evaluate effects on pain-related quality of life and function.  By [CONTACT_639864] -administration of 
low-dose hormonal add -back therapy, the program ultimately aims to bring to women suffering 
endometriosis -associated pain a long -term oral medical therapy that significantly reduces pain 
and improves quality of life and provides an alternative to invasive procedures. 
2.2. Relugolix  
Summaries of nonclinical toxicology and previous human experience with relugolix, including results of phase 1 and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and in men with prostate cancer, are provided in the current relugolix Investigator Brochure, along with 
a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix. 
2.2.1. Indication 
Relugolix co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate  is being developed 
as a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of  endometriosis- associated pain .  The proposed 
dose of relugolix is 40  mg administered orally once daily  and the proposed doses of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate are 1 .0 mg  and 0.5 mg once daily, respectively .

The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50-fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum).  Transgenic knock -in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor 
treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively.

phase 3 studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) designed to establish the efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily in women with  endometriosis -associated pain .  This 
80-week extension study provides additional efficacy and safety data up to 104 weeks to 
demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol (1 mg) 
and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg).  The primary objectives of the study are to assess long -term 
efficacy of relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate for up to 104 weeks on dysmenorrhea and NMPP, common  and 
burdensome symptoms of endometriosis.  The study will also evaluate safety  of relugolix 40 mg 
once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate for up to 
104 weeks, among patients who previously completed a 24 -week treatment period in one o f the 
parent studies (MVT-601-3101 or MVT-601-3102), including adverse events and change in bone mineral density.  
The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily.  Data from a phase 2 study in women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily suppressed estradiol levels 
to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75  mg.  Women in both the relugolix 
40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856365] on the beneficial decrease in  dysmenorrhea and NMPP.  It 
is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen and low -doses of estrogen are 
sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a h ypoestrogenic state [Barbieri, 1992].  The 
combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long- term hormonal add-back 
therapy to reduce the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_639794], which can occur with unopposed estrogen therapy [Activella US Prescribing Information, 2013].  A variety of add-back hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_624404] 20  years [Archer, 2015;  Chwalisz, 2012; Franke, 2000;  Hornstein , 1998; 
Morris, 2008;  Simpson , 2015;  Wu, 2014;  Zupi, 2004], and a combination of estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate has been used as add-back therapy in prior clinical studies with leuprolide (a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease in menstrual blood loss [Archer, 2017;  Lee, 2016;  Franke, 2000] or endometriosis -associated 
pain [Wu , 2014].  The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combinatio n proposed for evaluation in 
this phase 3 study is currently approved in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) as long-term hormone 
replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women [Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. 
A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix 40 mg once daily 
alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1  mg estradiol and 0.5 mg 
norethindrone acetate demonstrated that this dose of add-back therapy maintains serum estradiol in the 25 to 50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density [Barbieri, 1992].  Serum N- and C-telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near baseline levels with the addition of the add -back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption 
compared to the group receiving relugolix alone.  Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced with the addition of add -back therapy.  The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, 
ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all pharmacokinetic samples collected, and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study.  These data also confirm that

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  35 CONFIDENTIAL  lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg/0.1 mg combination tablet 
[Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol 
concentrations to protect against the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the hypoestrogenic state induced by [CONTACT_639868] 40 mg. 
The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1.0 mg and 0.5 mg, 
respectively) were used in the parent studies (MVT-601-3101 and MVT-601-3102) and represent less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_639796] [ADDRESS_856366] on efficacy, while mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms. 
In summary, relugolix at a dose of 40 mg once daily  resulted in a significant decrease in 
endometriosis -associated pain in a well-designed large phase 2 study.  However, its 
administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral density loss unacceptable for 
long-term treatment.  This phase 3 study extension study will assess long -term efficacy and 
safety of relugolix 40 mg co -administered with low -dose estra diol and norethindrone acetate to 
decrease dysmenorrhea and NMPP and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorate 
some of the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes. 
This open-label extension study will allow for a description of long- term efficacy data and safety 
for an additional 80 weeks of treatment, providing approximately 1 year of efficacy and safety 
data from the women originally randomized to relugolix in studies (MVT-601-3101 and 
MVT -601-3102).  This study desi gn will allow eligible patients with  endometriosis -associated 
pain, including those randomized to placebo in the parent study, to receive relugolix 
co-administered with low -dose hormonal add-back therapy during the extension. 
4.3. Selection of Study Population  
The study population will include approximately 800 premenopausal women aged 18 to 51 year s 
with endometriosis-associated pain .

4.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient 
Identification  Number  
Eligible patients who sign consent will be identified with the same Patient Identification  (ID) 
Number assigned to the patient during the parent study.  This extension study is a single-arm, 
open-label  study, and thus all eligible patients are assigned to the same treatment group of 
relugolix 40 mg co-administered with low-dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate (see 
Section  5.1 for treatment details).  
4.5. Removal of Patients from Therapy 
Completion of the Week 104 visit defines completion of the study.  Patients may withdraw consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason.  Investigators or the medical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below.  Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Early Termination visit (see the Week  104 
visit on the Schedule of Activities, Section  1.1) and will have a Follow -up visit to assess safety 
approximately 30 days after the end of study drug treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).  When patients complete the study or early terminate from the study, they 
must be deactivated from the study in the interactive voice response system/interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS), eDiary, and tablet device.  
The following safety and/or compliance events will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved: 
• Any adverse event that is intolerable to the patient and that cannot be ameliorated by 
[CONTACT_639981], or that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_639838] k to the patient if dosing continued;  
• If it is discovered after enrollment that a patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the patient’s health;  
• If the following liver test abnormalities devel op, study drug should be discontinued 
immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, 
until a patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status):  
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856371]; or 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856372] and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856373] in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_856374] or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5; or 
− ALT or AST > [ADDRESS_856375] with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper

• If the patient, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_624356], is grossly 
noncompliant with the protocol’s requirements.  Gross noncompliance includes < 75% compliance with the study drug over > 2 consecutive months; missing multiple study visits; and persistent (> 2 consecutive months) noncompliance ( < 50% of the 
required number of days) with eDiary completion  up to Week 52 or persistent 
(≥ 2 eDiary collection cycles) noncompliance (< 50% of the required number of days) 
with eDiary completion  from Week  52 to Week 104.  Investigators will follow up 
with the patient and encourage compliance with study drug or eDiary prior to discontinuing her from the study; 
• If the patient becomes pregnant at any time after providing a signed informed consent 
form, the patient must be withdrawn  immediately (see Section  7.8 for information on 
pregnancy reporting); 
• Evidence of malignant breast lesion (s) or breast carcinoma on Week 52 or 
Week  104/ Early Termination  or most recent mammogram  or additional breast 
imag ing (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for more information on m ammogram at Week 52 or 
Week  104/ Early Termination ). 
Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol -defined 
window, the site should attempt to contact [CONTACT_231350].  The site should also counsel the patient on the i mportance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous noncompliance.  In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to re schedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain 
contact [CONTACT_10970].  The site should attempt at least three documented telephone calls and if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they can 
appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 
4.6. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance  
All patients should be counseled at every visit to adhere to the use of protocol allowed contraceptive methods.  In this study, medications and devices containing hormones for 
contraception are excluded, and patients must agree to use non -hormonal contraception 
throughout the study including through [ADDRESS_856377] dose of study drug, unless any of the following apply: 
• Has a sexual partner(s) who was vasectomized at least 6 months prior to the 
Week  24/Baseline visit;  
• Had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as Essure ) at least 6  months prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit (patients with  Essure

must be no evidence of post-Essure syndrome; 
• Has a non-hormonal intrauterine device (eg, Paragard) placed in the uterus;  
• Is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the 
use of non-hormonal contraception as described below; 
• Practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as her preferred lifestyle; periodic 
abstinence is not acceptable.  
The only acceptable methods of contracept ion for those for whom one of the above methods do 
not apply are: 
• Condom (male or female condom) with or without spermicide (cream, spray, foam, gel, suppository, or polymer film); 
• Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); 
• Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); or 
• Vaginal sponge impregnated with spermicide used with a condom. 
Patients  will be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the 
informed consent process and will confirm with signing of the consent form that they understand 
the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study.  Patients may not donate ova during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_856379] study dose of study drug 
provided her menstrual cycle has returned. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed according to the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1 -1; 
including just prior to receiving the first dose of study drug), and patients will receive continued 
guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedures.  Patients should call the investigator immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant.  Patients who 
become pregn ant during the study will be withdrawn from the study and followed for pregnancy 
outcome (see Section  7.8).

5.7. Rescue Analgesic Medications  
Management of endometriosis -asso ciated pain often requires treatment with analgesics and some 
patients require treatment with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2631]. Two tiers of pain medications are specified for this 
trial.  The study-specified pain medications for each patient will be the same as for the parent 
study.  Only study-specific Tier 1 and Tier 2  analgesic medications  (see Appendix 1) should be 
taken  starting with the Baseline/Week [ADDRESS_856385] the 
medical monitor.  
Short-term use of non-study specified analgesics for the treatment of an intercurrent event (eg, 
injury or surgery) is allowed, if required.  Such events should be repor ted as adverse events  when  
appropriate. 
Investigators must instruct the patient on the use of ibuprofen 200 mg tablets (ie, number of 
tablets per dose, dosing frequency, maximum number of tablets per day).  For patients who may  
need  the Tier [ADDRESS_856386] of the study. 
Quantities of opi[INVESTIGATOR_639839]’s expected usage until the next 
study visit.  Prescriptions for Tier 1 and Tier 2 rescue analgesic medications should be in 
accordance with their full prescribing information (ie, the local product labeling) and 
prescriptions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_639810].  Patients should be counseled on the 
safe use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Patients who are not prescribed the Tier 2 medication at  the time of enrollment in this study, for 
example,  because requirement for analgesics beyond the Tier 1 medication is not expected (eg , 
based on pain level and/or recent analgesic requirements) should be advised to contact [CONTACT_639939] [ADDRESS_856387]  be recorded by [CONTACT_394197] .

Myovant Sciences GmbH  44 CONFIDENTIAL  Week 104/Early Termination visit, all used, partially used , and unused study drug kits should be 
retained at the site.   At all other visits, only fully used study drug kits should be retained at the 
site.  New study drug should be dispensed as described in Section  1.1 (Schedule of Activities ). 
Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded.  If a patient is 
persistently noncompliant with the study treatment, it may be appropriate to withdraw the patient from the study (see Section  4.5).  All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing 
requirement during study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re -education 
must document the process in the patient’s source records.  
Because of the importance to both safety and efficacy evaluation, patients who are grossly 
noncompliant with eDiary completion must undergo an Unscheduled visit to evaluate reasons for 
noncompliance and to develop a plan to improve compliance.  Failure to impro ve compliance 
may result in the sponsor withdrawing the patient from further study treatment (including study 
analgesics) and/or discontinuation fro m the study  (see Section  4.5 for details). 
All patients should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement and eDiary  compliance during 
study contacts.  The authorized study personnel conducting the re- education must document the 
process in the patient’s source records.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  48 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
The timing of each study assessment  and procedure is provided in the Schedule of Activities (see 
Section  1.1).  Study procedures are briefly described within Section  6.5.  F urther details of the 
procedures are provided in the Investigator Site File.  Guidelines to address the COVID-19 
pandemic are included in Appendix 9. 
6.1. Schedule of Observations and Procedures  
Assessments should be completed at the designated visit/time points as described in the Schedule 
of Activities (see Section 1.1).  The study is divided into 2 periods:  Open- Label Treatment 
Period and Safety Follow-Up Period.  Unscheduled visits may occur as needed to evaluate 
patients.  
6.2. Open -Label Treatment Period (Week 24/Baseline to Week 104) 
As denoted in the Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1), certain Week 24 visit procedu res of 
MVT -601-3101 or MVT-601-3102 will serve as the Week  24/Baseline procedures for patients 
who are interested in participating in this extension study, and these Week 24 procedures will be performed under the informed consent for the parent study. 
Patients will be required to sign an informed consent form for the extension study and will be 
eligible if they meet all of the eligibility criteria.  
Once eligibility is determined, all additional Week 24/Baseline visit procedures described in the 
Schedule of Activities (see Section  1.1) that were not performed as part of the Week 24 visit of 
the parent study will be completed.  These include the followi ng: 
• Informed consent (unless signed previously); 
• Record concomitant medications;  
• Update the patient’s status in the IVRS/IWRS as being in the MVT-601-3103 and receive the lot numbers for study drug allocation; 
• Dispense study treatment;  
• Dispense or prescribe protocol-specified analgesic drugs; 
• Transition the patient within her eDiary fr om the parent study to MVT-601-3103; 
• Take study drug dose in clinic; and  
• Record adverse events, if any. 
The Week [ADDRESS_856390] dose of study drug in the 
parent study on the day prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit and will receive their first dose of 
study drug for this extension s tudy in the clinic after the patient is determined to be eligible for 
this extension study and has provided informed consent to participate.  Therefore, results of testing required for eligibility must be available on or prior to the Week 24/Baseline visit.  If necessary for logistical reasons (eg, delayed availability of study drug supply on site, others), and

Myovant Sciences GmbH  49 CONFIDENTIAL  with sponsor/designee approval, the first dose of open label study drug for MVT-601-3103 may 
be administered up to 10 days following the parent study Week  24/Baseline visit.   If the first 
dose of study drug is not given during this up to 10-day interval, the parent study follow-up 
procedures should be followed (ie, adverse event reporting, eDiary completion, etc.). 
Patients will continue recording data in their eDiary daily  and taking protocol-specified 
analgesics as needed  until Week 52.  After Week 52, the eDiary will be collected  on the 
following schedule:  Week 57 to the Week 65 visit, Week 71 to the Week 78 visit, Week 85 to 
the Week 91 visit, and  Week 98 to the Week 104 visit.  Following the Week  24/Baseline visit, 
on-treatment study visits will occur at Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 65, 78, 91, and 104.  Sites will monitor diary completion using the Trial  Manager web portal throughout the study. 
A telephone call will be performed at Weeks 57, 71, 85 and 98.  The following activities should 
be completed : a concomitant medication review, an  evaluation of adverse events , a review of 
study medication compliance, a reminder of compliance with non-hormonal contraception requirements and the need to call the investigator if pregnancy is suspected , and a reminder to 
the patient to start recording in the eDiary daily . 
Accountability for study drug will be performed at each visit.  Inst ructions for analgesic 
medication usage will be reinforced at each visit.  
Questionnaires are administered on the electronic tablet and on paper at each visit.  These 
procedures should occur before any other types of study procedures are performed.  When both electronic tablet and paper questionnaires are required at a visit, the electronic questionnaires should be done first.  The order in which the electronic tablet and paper questionnaires should be administered are as follows:  
• Electronic tablet questionnaires (in the order they appear in the tablet)  
• Paper questionnaires 
− PGA for function 
− EHP Work Domain [Week24/Baseline, Week 52, Week 78, and Week 104 only] 
Patients will bring their eDiary, analgesic medications, and study drug to each visit.  The site 
must document the start and stop dates of the patient’s menses . 
An endometrial biopsy will have been performed at the parent study Week 24 visit for all 
patient s who participated in MVT-601-3101 (see MVT-601-3101 protocol for details).  An 
endometrial biopsy is required at  Week  52 and the Early Termination visit for all patients .  This 
procedure is not required at the Early Termination visit in patients whose las t dose of study drug 
was taken during Week 32 or earlier or within four weeks after completion of the Week 52 endometrial biopsy.  However, the procedure may be done if it will aid in the evaluation of an ongoing adverse event.  An endometrial biopsy at Week 104 is recommended for all patients who complete the open -label extension ; however, patients will have the option to opt out.   Safety 
monitoring for this study includes physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy tests, and adve rse event collection at each visit.   Clinical chemistries will be collected at each 
visit.  A complete blood count will be collected at Week 24/Baseline, Week 28, Week 36, Week 
52, Week 65, Week 78, Week 91, and Week 104/ Early Termination.  At the Week 24/Baseline

[IP_ADDRESS]. Endometrial Biopsy 
For patients in parent study MVT-601-3101, an endometrial biopsy is performed at the Week [ADDRESS_856407] endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial carcinoma will be withdrawn from study drug treatment and followed per instructions in the parent and/or extension study protocol. 
Additional assessment of the effects of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol and 
norethindrone acetate on the endometrium will be performed at the Week [ADDRESS_856408] dose of study drug was taken during Week 32 or 
earlier or within four weeks after completion of the Week 52 endometrial biopsy.  However, the endometrial biopsy may be obtained if it will aid in the evaluation of an ongoing adverse event.   
An endometrial biopsy at Week 104 is recommended for all patients who complete the open-label extension; however , patients will have the option to opt out.  Patient participation in 
the Week 104 endome trial biopsy  is voluntary and refusal to participate will not indicate 
withdrawal from the study. 
The Week 52 , Week 104, and Early Termination  endometrial biopsy samples will be submitted 
to the central laboratory.  If the Week 52, Week 104, or Early Termi nation biopsy specimen is 
inadequate, a transvaginal ultrasound for endometrial thickness should be obtained and read 
locally.  The transvaginal ultrasound findings will be used to determine if further action is 
required: 
• Endometrial thickness ≤ 5 mm :  no further action required; 
• Endometrial thickness > 5 mm at any location or any other endometrial abnormality :  
repeat endometrial sampling.  Contact [CONTACT_639918]. 
Investigators should contact [CONTACT_639984] a patient refuses to have an  endometrial 
biopsy at Week  52 or the Early Termination  visit .  Unscheduled endometrial biopsies may also 
be performed when medically indicated and as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].  The investigator should obtain approval from the sponsor to perform an unscheduled endometrial biopsy, unless urgently indicated.  Additional consent is not required in this circumstance.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Status of Menstruation Recovery 
If the first menstruation after the end of study treatment administration is observed before the Follow-Up visit, the date of onset of the first menstruation is recorded in the eCRF.  Patients 
whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medic al procedure or medications) will be contact[CONTACT_639985]: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F

be asked about factors that may affect resumption of menses.   If a patient is lost to follow -up, 
three documented attempts should be made to contact [CONTACT_66079].  If unable to 
contact [CONTACT_66079], a certified letter must be sent to the patient.  
If the patient enrolls directly into another relugolix clinical study upon completion of the Week  104 visit, follow-up under this protocol to determine the status of menstruation recovery 
may not be required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Mammogram 
A mammogram will be performed at  the Week 52 or Week 104 /Early Termination  visit (see the 
Schedule of Activities  in Section  1.1) for patients ≥ [ADDRESS_856409] Imaging Reporting and Data System category 1 or 2 or equivalent or had benign 
findings, as determined by [CONTACT_10982] , a mammogram is not required at 
Week 52 but should be completed by [CONTACT_10585] 104/Early Termination .  If a patient turns 40 years 
old after the Week  52 visit has occurred, a mammogram should be performed no later than the 
Week  104/Early Termination  visit.  
All mammogram results will be read locally  using Breast Imaging Reporting and Dat a System  
categories or equivalent (see Appendix 8) and recorded in the eCRF.  T he following actions  will 
be taken depending on the reading: 
• Category 1 or 2 or equivalent:  normal mammogram; no further action is required 
unless determined by [CONTACT_10982];  
• Category 0 or 3 or equivalent :  adjunctive breast imaging or follow-up mammogram 
will be required, and the investigator should contact [CONTACT_639986];  
• Category 4 to 6 or equivalent:  the investigator should contact [CONTACT_22840] 24 hours. 
• Patients who have malignant breast lesion(s) or breast carcinoma will be withdrawn from study drug treatment (see Section  4.5).

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  58 CONFIDENTIAL  7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS  
Study assessments of safety include adverse events, vital signs and weight, physical 
examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and bone mineral density assessments . 
7.1. Adverse Event  Definitions  
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
Adverse event:  An adverse event  is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : 
• A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or 
duration of a pre-existing condition ; 
• Development of an intercurrent illness during the study ; 
• Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant 
medication or investigational product ; 
• Injury or accidents:  If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate 
medical events (eg,  for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” 
should be recorded separately) ; and  
• An investigational abnormality (eg,  laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the 
abnormality is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_624548]: 
− Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; 
− Requires active intervention ; 
− Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Events that do not  meet the definition of an adverse ev ent include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug 
administration that do not worsen ; 
• Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096], with elective defined as known or planned 
at the time of signing of the informed consent) ; 
• Endometriosis -assoc iated pain is not considered an adverse event in this study 
because it is being quantitatively measured as the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Adverse events that occur during the study  should be evaluated by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator and graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
DocuSign Envelope ID: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  59 CONFIDENTIAL  (CTCAE).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_329886], such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a 
period of consecutive days are “intermittent” .  All other events are “continuous”.  Additional 
information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. 
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death ; 
b. Is life-thre atening ; 
NOTE:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233003] ; 
NOTE:   In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_639815] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
independent of the duration of that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222228].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  T his definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption . 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; 
f. Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of such events are 
invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at h ome for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
7.2. Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of serious adverse events by [CONTACT_456] (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory 
authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria.  Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious 
adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse 
events.  Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence.  Appropriate questions include: 
DocuSign Envelope ID: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  60 CONFIDENTIAL  • “How are you feeling?” 
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”  
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since 
your last visit/contact?” 
The patient’s eDiary entries , including bleeding and answers to the other patient-reported 
outcome measures , will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_639881].  Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow-up with t he patient for medical evaluation should be 
undertaken.  Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. 
All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until 
the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic.  At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if 
additional foll ow-up is  warranted. 
All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents.  In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents.  Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the indiv idual signs and symptoms.  If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record 
each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event.  
Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as described in  Section  7.[ADDRESS_856410], as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities (Section  1.1).  Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the 
safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor regardless of causal relationship to study drug treatment. 
Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section  7.6. 
7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug  
The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be 
assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event.  The following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: 
DocuSign Envelope ID: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  61 CONFIDENTIAL  • Probably related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re-administration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).  
• Possibly related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
• Not related :  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. 
All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record.  In the 
event a patient is withdrawn  from the study because of an adverse event, it must b e recorded on 
the eCRF as such. 
7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events  
Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache.  This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on patient/event outcome or 
action taken . 
The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event accordin g to the National 
Cancer Institute CTCAE.  For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 
should be used to determine the grade severity.  
Table 7-1 Criteria for Determining  the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not 
Specified by [CONTACT_941] N ational Cancer Institute CTCAE 
Grade Criteria  
1/Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
2/Moderate  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrume ntal activities of daily living  
3/Severe or medically significant  Not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77081]; dis abling; limiting self -care activities 
of daily living  
4/Life -threatening  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5/Death  Death related to adverse event  
CTCAE = Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.  
Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case report form and in t he patient’s source documents.  
DocuSign Envelope ID: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856411] ≥ 3 × 
ULN. 
Any ALT or AST  elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the Open -Label Treatment 
Period or the Follow-Up  visit  should be reported to the sponsor using the Safety Report Form 
within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event  (see Section  7.6), even if 
the event does not meet serious adverse event  criteria .  Additional instructions for evaluating 
patients with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN may be found in Appendix 7.  
7.5.1. Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug in Association with Liver 
Test Abnormalities 
Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines 
[FDA , 2009]. 
If the following liver test  abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld  immediately with 
appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory 
profile has returned to normal/baseline status), and the event reported as a serious adverse event : 
• ALT or AST > 8 × ULN; or  
• ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or 
• ALT or AST >  3 × ULN and total bilirubin  > 2 × ULN or the INR > 1.5; or 
• ALT or AST > 3 × ULN wi th appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, 
total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values.  The investigator and sponsor must  discuss and agree wi th any decision to rechallenge.  
Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalit ies is considered 
possibly drug induced. 
7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in Association w ith Liver 
Test Abnormalities 
Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all  of the following 4 criteria are 
met (ie, potential sev ere drug-induc ed liver injury/Hy’s law case):  
1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 × ULN; AND 
2. Total bilirubin increases to >  2 × ULN or INR > 1.5; AND  
3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 × ULN; AND  
4. No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; 
important alternative causes include, but are not limited to the following:  
− Hepatobiliary tract disease ; 
− Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus);

Myovant Sciences GmbH  64 CONFIDENTIAL  If the patient died, the report shoul d include the cause of death as the event term (with death as 
outcome) and whether or not the event leading to death was related to study drug treatment, as 
well as the autopsy findings if available.  
Do not delay reporting a suspected serious adverse event in order to obtain additional information.  Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow-up to the initial report.  All serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, until the event has stabilized, and/or reached a new  baseline.  All serious adverse events continuing at the 
completion of the study must be assessed or followed to determine outcome.  
7.7. Study Drug  Overdose Management 
The medical monitor must be contact[CONTACT_624552]. 
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by 
a study patient, at a dose above that assigned to that individual patien t according to the study 
protocol. 
For this study, any dose of relugolix > 80 mg within a 24 -hour window is an overdose and any 
dose of estradiol/norethindrone acetate > 2 × the protocol dose is an overdose (ie, more than 
2 capsules taken within a 24 -hour window).  There is no known antidote for an overdose.  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: 
• Contact [CONTACT_22840] 24 hours; 
• Closely monitor the patien t for adverse events  and laboratory abnormalities ; 
• All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_639987], 
using a S afety Report Form according to Section  7.6, whether or not the overdose is 
associated with an adverse event; 
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing  in 
the eCRF. 
The medical monitor, in consultation with the investigator, will make decisions regarding patient 
status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation o f the patient.  
7.8. Pregnancy Reporting  
If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patient from the 
study treatment immediately and have her return for an Early Termination  visit.  
If the patient agrees, the investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the 
pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment. 
A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_856413] menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this form , as available.   Document the pregnancy in the eCRF as well.  
The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report 
the outcome to the sponsor.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  65 CONFIDENTIAL  7.9. Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tes ts, 
Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures  
Section  6.5.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital 
signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs,  and bone mineral density. 
7.10. Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated with relugolix in women include nonserious 
events of hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density .  In this protocol, 
relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on  endometriosis -associated pain .  Low-dose hormonal 
add-back therapy with estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of 
bone mineral density during treatment  with relugolix. 
Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment  in women, based on nonclinical 
data and data available for similar compounds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects (corrected QT [ QTc] prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_16215] (PLD) , 
reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovascular changes (insulin resistance, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], increased  weight) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, there are potential risks associated with 
the addition of estradiol/norethindrone acetate.  Summaries of findings from both nonclinic al and 
clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure. 
The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol  are outlined in Table 7-2. 
Table 7-[ADDRESS_856414] on Eligibility  Monitoring and 
Withdrawal Criteria  
Bone Mineral Density  
Reversible loss of bone mineral density is 
a risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced 
by [CONTACT_624438].  This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_42020]-administration of low -dose estradiol 
and norethindrone acetate hormonal add-
back therapy.  Exclusion criteria for a 
history of osteoporosis, metabolic bone disease, and prior medical therapy 
for low bo ne mineral 
density was included in 
the parent studies.  Bone mineral density will be 
monitored at the Week  24/Baseline, Week 36, 
Week 52 , and 
Week  104/Early Termination 
visits with specified discontinuation and follow -
up criteria and all fractures 
will be r eported as adverse 
events.

8.1. Clinical Procedures  
Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site, if necessary , prior to initiation of the 
study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring 
requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the Investigator Site File with the site personnel.  
8.2. Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) in accordance with current Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) regulations.  By [CONTACT_12570], the i nvestigator grants permission 
to Myovant Sciences GmbH  (or designee) and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on-
site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation.  In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have 
access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports).  During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality.  A study m onitor will contact [CONTACT_329957], on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of t he study.  It will be the study m onitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF  at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries, and to meet with the investi gator to discuss study 
progress and compliance with the protocol and GCP.  The study monitor should have access to laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF.  The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  For this study, patient data will be 
entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other 
sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg , removing errors 
and inconsistencies in the data).  
Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced  (WHO -DDE) , respectively.  
The investigator will retain original source documents and the sponsor will receive 
eCRF-required data as electronic datasets.  Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to the sponsor.

Myovant Sciences GmbH  69 CONFIDENTIAL  9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for 
this study. 
All efficacy and safety measures over the course of both the parent and extension studies will be 
presented by [CONTACT_639882].  No formal treatment comparisons will be performed for this extension study.  Continuous data will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.  Categorical data will be summar ized by [CONTACT_33335]. 
There will be two analyses :  one at Week [ADDRESS_856418] patient’s Week 104/Early Termination or Follow -Up visit.  After the study is closed, any pending 
required follow-up testing of bone mineral density and endometrial biopsies or for menstruation recovery beyond the Follow-Up visit will be captured and reported. 
9.1. Randomization Methods  
This is a single-arm, open- label extension study; patients are not randomized.  All patients who 
have entered the extension study will be treated with open -label relugolix and low-dose 
hormonal add-back therapy for [ADDRESS_856419] completed a parent study and who are eligible and willing to participate in the extension study.  It is estimated that approximately 800 patients ( 67% of the total of 
1200 patients who will be randomized into the parent studies) will participate in this study.  
9.4. Efficacy Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will be con ducted using the Extension Study 
Population.  
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_639883].

Myovant Sciences GmbH  70 CONFIDENTIAL  The point estimates and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the primary efficacy endpoints 
(proportion of responders based on dysmenorrhea NRS scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medications,  proportion of responders based on NMPP scores and use of rescue analgesic 
medications) will be calculated.  
A responder at a given time point and for a specific type of pain (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) is defined as a patient who had a reduction in that type of pain from Baseline in the parent study 
greater than or equal to a pre-determined threshold and who did not have an increase in the use 
of rescue analgesic medications f or endometriosis-associated pain compared with the use at 
Baseline. Patients who had a pain reduction less than the pre-determined threshold or who had an 
increase in the use of analgesics for endometriosis -associated pain will be considered non -
responders.  The pain reduction thresholds will be determined for NMPP and dysmenorrhea separately (see the SAP for details) for the parent studies and these same thresholds will be applied to this study. 
Baseline values are calculated using the Baseline pain assessment period, which is defined as the 
period from the date of the first dose of placebo in the parent study Run-In Period through the day prior to the first dose of randomized study drug.  Patients’ average NRS pain scores and use of rescue analgesic medica tions for endometriosis-associated pain  (dysmenorrhea or NMPP) will 
be compared between a given visit-specific pain assessment period (eg, Week 28, Week 32, etc.) and the Baseline pain assessment period.  The visit -specific pain assessment period is defined as 
the last [ADDRESS_856420] dose of study drug treatment received prior to the visit date.  
For any pain assessment period (Baseline or visit-specific), the average NRS scores will be calculated for dysmenorrhea and NMPP separately.  An average NRS score for dysmenorrhea is calculated as the average NRS score over the days with menses during a given pain assessment period.  An average NRS score for NMPP is calculated as the average NRS score over the days without menses during a given pain assessment period.  The analgesic use for a given pain assessment period is summarized by [CONTACT_639884] 35.  Additional details on calculating dose counts and on the precise definition of an increase in analgesic us e will be 
provided in the SAP. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for efficacy endpoints (listed below) similar to those used 
for the parent studies at Week 52 and Week 104.

mean percentage change at Week 52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1-L4) will be compared with a pre -specified clinically acceptable threshold of -2.2% to 
evaluate magnitude of bone mineral density loss after 52 weeks of treatment.  If the lower bound 
is > -2.2%, the bone mineral density loss for the relugolix add-back treatment will be considered 
insignificant.  As supportive analysis, least square means and 95% CI for percent  change at 
Week  52 from parent study Baseline in bone mineral density w ill be provided based on mixed

Myovant Sciences GmbH  74 CONFIDENTIAL  10. RESPONSIBILITIES  
10.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South 
Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant.  For studies conducted under a US  investigational new drug 
application , the investigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as 
outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.”  This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied.  This 
documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator.  The i nvestigator and sub-investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in 
reportable interests during the study and for [ADDRESS_856423]/Independent Ethics Committee Approval 
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patien t (such as 
advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed 
consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_624485].  Approval from the IRB or IEC 
must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval.  
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for a pproval before implementation.

identities are protected from unauthorized parties.  Only patient number, date of birth, and an 
identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory.  The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patients screened and for all patients enrolled in the study. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited 
to the Investigator Brochure, protocol, e CRFs  and other study forms, the investigational drug, 
and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter.  This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from the sponsor.  The i nvestigator further agrees to take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_250249]. 
10.1.5. Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be classified into at least the following two categories:  
1. Investigator’s study file.  The i nvestigator’s study file will contain the Invest igator 
Brochure, protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization  and training  forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
2. Patien t clin ical source documents.  The required source data should include the following

Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. 
If the i nvestigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of 
the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to 
store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can  be returned sealed to the 
investigator in case of a regulatory audit.  When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_69786]. 
10.1.6. Electronic Case Report Forms  
For each patient enrolled, an eCRF must be completed as specified in the Investigator Site File.  The eCRF casebook for each study patient will be signed by [CONTACT_9940]-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate l ocal health authority documents .  
This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-
randomization screening period  if an eCRF was initiated).  If a patien t withdraws from the study, 
the reason must be noted o n the eCRF.  If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome.  
10.1.7. Investigational Product Accountability  
The investigator or investigator’s designee (eg , pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate 
accountability  (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug (active and 
placebos).  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), pa tient dispensing records, accountability , and returned or destroyed study

dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, P atient ID number, and the initials of 
the person dispensing the medication.  
At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements.  Drug may be returned or destroyed once the study monitor has reviewed 
and returned used and unused study drug for accountability purposes.  If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor 
(or designee)  for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. 
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_5276].

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856433] Ima ging Reporting and Data System  
Category  Assessment  Follow -Up 
0 Need additional imaging evaluation:  means 
that more studies are necessary to gather more 
information.  Additional imaging needed before a category can 
be assigned.  
1 Negative:  means that there is no significant or 
noticeable abnormality to report.  Continue annual screening mammography (for 
women over age 40).  
2 Benign (noncancerous) finding:  means that 
there has been a finding, such as benign 
calcifications or fibroadenoma, which is not 
cancerous.  Continue annual screening mammography (for 
women over age 40).  
3 Probably benign:  means that there is a finding 
that is most likely benign,  but should be 
followed in a shorter period of time to see if the 
area of concern changes.  Receive a 6 -month follow -up mammogram.  
4 Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_112724]:  means that there are 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_624375].  May require biopsy.  
5 Highly suggestive of malignancy (cancer):  
means that there are findings that look like and 
probably are cancer.  Requires biopsy.  
6 Known biopsy -proven malignancy (cancer):  
means that any findings on the mammogram 
have already proven to be cancer through a biopsy.  Biopsy confirms presence of cancer before 
treatment begins.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856434] during the COVID -19 
Pandemic  
The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the conduct of clinical trials 
globally.  Regional quarantine laws, travel restrictions, and site closures  present challenges to 
normal study conduct and may lead to  missed study visits or procedures or an interruption to  a 
patient ’s study drug supply. 
Myovant Sciences has thoroughly reviewed guidance documents from various country and 
regional regulatory a gencies and has put mitigation plans in place to ensure the safety  of patients  
is maintained, the study continues to be conducted in  compliance with good clinical practice 
(GCP), and risks to the integrity of the study  are minimized .  These plans will remain in place 
through the duration of the COVID-[ADDRESS_856435] with the study protocol 
and this guidance.  Deviations from the protocol will be documented, but those resulting specifically from the COVID -19 pandemic will be marked as su ch.  All deviations resulting from 
the COVID-19 pandemic will be summarized in the clinical study report. 
Visit Schedules and Study Procedures 
Local policies, institutional restrictions, and/or patient ability/willingness to make site visits may 
curtail the ability to adhere to the in -person, on-site visit schedule required by [CONTACT_760].  
Investigators at clinical sites should evaluate the appropriateness of an on -site study visit during 
the COVID-[ADDRESS_856436] allowable portion of the visit window, 
taking all measures to prevent contracting COVID -19. 
• All protocol required  study procedures should be performed whenever possible. 
• Safety assessments should be prioritized if only limited assessments are performed.  
• If assessments are limited, investigator s should document whether  the assessments  
performed are  adequate to ensure it is safe for the patient to continue in the study.

Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-3103  Amendment 3.1, 25 Aug 2020 
Myovant Sciences GmbH  119 CONFIDENTIAL  • Investigators should use all  available information to determine whether 
in-person visits are necessary to fully assure the safety of study patients (for 
example to carry out procedures necessary to assess safety or the safe use of 
the study drug appropriately) or whether alternative means of assessment are adequate to assure the safety of continuing patients in the study.  Such 
decisions should be documented.  Investigators can contact [CONTACT_639991]. 
If the clinical study site is closed  or the patient is unable/unwilling to attend on- site study 
visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic , alternative methods for completing assessments (eg, 
phone contact [CONTACT_521540]) should be implemented. 
• Investigators must assess and evaluate the patient’s continued participation and 
dosing with limited safety assessment . 
• At a minimum, investigational site staff should make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_639992], document concomitant medications, and study drug dosing since the last stu dy 
visit.  
• If the safety blood draws cannot be performed through the central laboratory per protocol, the investigator may advise the patient to have blood drawn at a local laboratory if there is a safety concern.  If two consecutive study visits are missed  and 
the patient is unable to return to the site, the investigator  should advise the patient to 
have protocol specified safety labs completed at a local laboratory to assess for any safety concerns. In both cases, the local laboratory  results should be documented in 
the eCRF. 
• Investigational sites should report all serious adverse events, adverse events of 
clinical interest, overdose, and pregnancy that the patient reports during these calls 
within 24 hours of awareness. 
• Patients  shoul d be reminded of the importance of taking study treatment daily, 
adhering to protocol-specified analgesics,  and taking non-hormonal contraception . 
• Study patients should continue to complete their daily eDiary, even if they run out of study drug, and site s taff should motivate them  to do so. 
Patients  should have the contact [CONTACT_639958], including adverse events they may experience in real time.  
As soon as the study patients are able to return  to the investigational site for an on -site visit, they 
should return either for their next scheduled visit (if still within protocol window) or for an unscheduled visit (if outside of expected protocol visit window). 
Study Participant Study Drug Supply  
If a regional lockdown, travel restrictions, or site closure is imminent due to the COVID -[ADDRESS_856437] sufficient supply until their next upcoming visit .  Patients should be instructed to  
DocuSign Envelope ID: B602C976-C6CA-4AA2-8F62-33169BA9B06F
Clinical Study Protocol:  MVT -601-[ADDRESS_856438] the site to report any medical issues they may experience and site staff  should 
communicate with the patients to determine if  it is appropriate for the patient to continue dosing 
with study drug if/when in-person study visits are not possible. 
For cases where study patients are unable to visit the investigational site to pi[INVESTIGATOR_639843], a 
direct -to-patient (DTP)  delivery  of study drug by [CONTACT_639959].  Consent authorizing DTP supply will be obtained.  Sites should  defer to 
national guidance on how this will occur.  Where permitted by [CONTACT_639960], verbal consent 
will be taken via telephone or video call and noted in the patient’s source file. Where required, by [CONTACT_639960], this will be followed up with written consent during the next clinic visit.  Every effort will be made to obtain the patient’s written consent for DTP prior to delivery or 
shipment, where this is required by [CONTACT_639960].  
In the event that none of the above are possible for participants to continue taking study medication, a patient may need to be discontinued per the study protocol.  Such d ecisions will be 
made on a case-by- case basis in discussion with the investigator  and m edical monitor. 
Onsite Study Monitoring Restrictions  
In the event study monitors/ clinical research associates  are not allowed to travel and/or return to 
a clinical site to monitor and source document verify study data, Myovant has developed plans to 
ensure monitors: 
• Remotely verify source documentation as much data as reasonably possible without 
burdening sites, if allowed by [CONTACT_639961], focusing on pages key to the interpretability of the study and the safety of participants . 
• Remotely monitor study data through cross checking of various systems housing 
patient data against what is captured in the eCRFs.  
Additional guidance on conducting clinica l trials during the COVID-19 pandemic may be found 
in the following documents released by [CONTACT_639962] , which may be updated 
(updates supersede the versions listed here): 
• FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during the COVID-
19 Public Health Emergency Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Institutional 
Review Boards (March 2020 – updated July 2 , 2020); 
• European Medicines Agency  Guidance on the Management of Clinical Trials during 
the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) P andemic ( Version 3, 28 April 2020).

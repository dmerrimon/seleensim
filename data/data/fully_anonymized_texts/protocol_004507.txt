4 SUMMARY 
 
This Phase I trial will establish the recommended phase II dose of eribulin  in combination with 
fixed doses of oral irinotecan in adolescents a nd young adults with relapsed or refractory solid 
tumors.  Eribulin will be administered intrav enously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, while 
irinotecan will be administered orally on days 1-5.  The oral antibiotic cefixime will be used to 
reduce irinotecan-associated dia rrhea, starting two days prior to each cycle and continuing 
through day 8. Patients will be assign ed an eribulin dose level at th e time of enrollment using a 3 
+ 3 Phase I design, and there will  be no intrapatient dose escala tion. Once the RP2D is defined, 
there will be 10 patients enrolled in a dose expansion cohort.

2. BACKGROUND 
 2.[ADDRESS_921794] and generally non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_680942]. This study will 
provide necessary information for the design of a Phase II trial to better estimate the activity of 
this combination in specific tumor types.  
2.2 Eribulin 
 
Eribulin (Halaven; Eisai Inc.) is a syntheti c analogue of halichondrin B, a potent compound 
found in the marine sponge, Halichondria okadai .  Eribulin is a microtubule inhibitor which 
inhibits polymerization of tubulin subunits and prevents microtubule growth. This mechanism of 
action is distinct both from taxanes and epothilones, which disrupts microtubule dynamics by [CONTACT_680980] [1] as well as vincristine, which shortens microtubules [2].  This 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
8 dysregulation of microtubule dynami cs caused by [CONTACT_680981], creating a G2-M blockade  [3] that leads to apoptosis of treated cells 
[2, 4, 5]. 
 Preclinical activity:  Studies using both adult and pediatri c cell lines have demonstrated that 
eribulin has activity against a wide variety of cancers at subnanomolar levels [4, 6].  
Additionally, growth of taxane-resistant  human tumor cell lines harboring known β-tubulin 
mutations was also inhibited by [CONTACT_36920] [7], pr esumably due to its uni que mechanism and unique 
binding site.  Eribulin has broad in vivo  activity as demonstrated by [CONTACT_680982], colon, melanoma and ova rian cancers [4].  In particular, compelling in 
vivo activity was seen in  mouse xenograft experiments conduc ted by [CONTACT_680983] (PPTP), a NCI funded system used by [CONTACT_680984] c cancer with the purpose of deciding which drugs 
move forward in NCI-sponsored na tional clinical trials. For exampl e, treatment with single-agent 
eribulin resulted in complete re sponses of established xenografts in four different tumor types, 
including some responses which were mainta ined throughout the entire 12-week observation 
period. Particularly encouraging fi ndings include the fact that sy stemic drug exposures in these 
experiments were similar to those seen in in pa tients receiving the recommended Phase II dose of 
eribulin, and that in many models, eribulin was mo re active than vincristin e, which is used for a 
broad variety of pediatric cancers [6].    Clinical Activity:  In addition to the robust preclinical data describing eribulin’s activity against 
a wide variety of tumor cell lines and xenograf ts, there has also been extensive clinical 
evaluation of this drug, with 21 tr ials actively recruiting patients with a wide  variety of cancers 
as of September 2013 (clinicaltria ls.gov).  Results have been publis hed from thirteen phase II or 
phase III clinical trials evaluati ng eribulin in patients with a wi de variety of cancers [8-18].  In 
these studies, eribulin was considered by [CONTACT_680985]-small cell lung 
cancer [13], breast [8, 10, 11, 18], leiomyosarcoma [16], adipocytic sarcom a [16], ovarian [14] 
and prostate cancers [12].    The greatest clinical benefit of eribulin to date has been in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, leading to eribulin being approved by [CONTACT_664272] (FDA) in 
[ADDRESS_921795] received two or 
more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_680943] e and a taxane [19]. F DA approval was based on 
the encouraging results of a Phase III (EMBRACE ) trial comparing eribu lin monotherapy versus 
physician’s choice [10].   Pharmacokinetic Data:  Eribulin demonstrates linear kinetics, with a rapid distribution phase 
and slow elimination phase, resulting in a prolon ged plasma half-life of 34 -73 hours in phase I 
studies of patients with solid tumors [20, 21].  The primary route of elimina tion of eribulin is in 
feces (82%), with only a small fraction eliminated  in the urine (9%). Importantly, approximately 
90% of eribulin is excreted una ltered [22], and so does not unde rgo significant metabolism. In 
fact, the in vivo  metabolism of eribulin is quite minimal, with metabolites accounting for <0.6% 
of unchanged eribulin in  the plasma [22].   
  
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
9 Since only a small percentage of the drug is meta bolized, the potential for drug-drug interactions 
with eribulin is negligible.  No clinically significant change  in exposure, measured by [CONTACT_12265] 0-∞ 
and C max, of eribulin when given in combinati on with ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inhibitor [23].  Additionally, the exposure of eribulin was not c linically significantly altered 
when given in combination with rifampin, an inducer of CPY3A4 [24]. 
 Toxicity:   In the Phase III EMBRACE trial, the mo st common grade 3 and 4 toxicities that 
occurred more frequently in the eribulin tr eatment when compared with the Treatment of 
Physician’s Choice (TPC) arm were neutrope nia, leukopenia and peripheral neuropathy.  
Neutropenia occurred in 52% of patients, w ith 24% experiencing grade 4.  Neutropenia was 
easily managed with dose-reductions, delays or granulocyte colony s timulating factor, and 
resulted in low incidence of fe brile neutropenia (5%). The incide nce of grade 3 or 4 peripheral 
neuropathy was <9% similar to patients treate d with taxanes on the TPC arm (5%) [10].  In 
several other phase I and II tria ls in patients with advanced solid tumors, prostate cancer, 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and breast cancer, the only gr ade 3 or 4 toxicities 
reported with an incidence of greater than 10%  were leucopenia, lymphopenia and neutropenia 
[8, 9, 12, 20].   Importantly, the toxicity profile of eribulin is  distinct from protra cted administration of 
irinotecan, in which the most co mmon toxicities are di arrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss and 
electrolyte disturbances.  Less than 10% of patients treated with eribulin in the EMBRACE trial developed either abdominal pain or hypokale mia of any grade, and no other electrolyte 
abnormalities were reported.  While 18% of patients treated with eribulin developed diarrhea, this percentage was equal to t hose patients on the control arm, a nd so may relate more to the 
specific patient population. Of note, no patient  receiving eribulin on the EMBRACE trial 
developed grade 3 or higher diarrhea.  Mild to moderate weight loss was slightly more common 
in the eribulin-treated arm, occurring in 21% of  the patients treated with eribulin while on 14% 
of patients in the control arm were noted to have decreased weight.  Only 1% of patients treated 
with eribulin developed grade 3 or higher weight loss [10].  
 
2.[ADDRESS_921796] of the cell 
cycle and cellular death [25].  Preclinical activity:  Several preclinical studies  have confirmed the activ ity of irinotecan in a 
variety of pediatric tumors including xenogr afts models of ne uroblastoma [26, 27], 
rhabdomyosarcoma [28], Ewing’s sarc oma [26], and CNS tumors [29, 30]. 
 Clinical Activity:  Irinotecan has been extensively studied in adults both alone in combination 
with various agents, and is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the colon 
or rectum. In children, irinotecan has demonstrat ed activity in wide variety of solid tumors 
including Ewing sarcoma [31, 32 ], rhabdomyosarcoma [33-35], hepatoblastoma [36-38] and 
neuroblastoma [39, 40]. Although si ngle-agent activity of irinotecan  has been modest [41], the 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
10 lack of significant myelosuppression when given on a protracted schedule makes it an attractive 
partner for combination studies . Currently, irinotecan is be ing studied by [CONTACT_2005]’s 
Oncology Group (COG) in Phase II or III trials in combination with either vincristine or 
temozolomide in six different tumor types. Im portantly, the combinati on of vincristine and 
protracted irinotecan will be pa rt of the standard treatment arm in the next national COG Phase 
III trial for patients with newly-diagnosed rhabdomyosarcoma. 
 Rationale for oral administration of irinotecan:  When irinotecan is used  to treat adults with 
colorectal cancer, the drug is typi[INVESTIGATOR_680944] 1-[ADDRESS_921797] activity in pediatric tumo r types has been observed with more protracted 
scheduling in which smaller dosages are given daily  for 5 consecutive days for either one or two 
weeks [42]. This protracted dosi ng schedule allows for greater e xposure of this S-phase-specific 
agent over a three-week cycle, and also cha nges the toxicity profile. For example, while 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may be dose-li miting when irinotecan is given on the adult 
schedule, protracted administrati on of irinotecan results in on ly modest myelosuppression, with 
grade 4 neutropenia occurring in only 6% of trea tment cycles on a large national Phase II trial, 
and grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia occurring in only 2% [41]. However, protracted administration 
does increase the likelihood of diarrhea, which is  the dose-limiting toxicity when irinotecan is 
given in a protracted fashion [42].  Although protracted intravenous administration app ears to be more efficacious against pediatric 
tumors compared to less frequent  dosing, it is more costly and in convenient. To circumvent these 
issues, several investigators have studied the administration of irinot ecan given orally on a 
protracted schedule in both chil dren and adults [40, 43-45]. Oral  administration of irinotecan 
provides a convenient and cost-effective method for the protracted administration schedules which have shown greatest activity against pediatric tumors [46].  Due to irinotecan poor oral 
bioavailability, higher doses are required to reach  similar levels of systemic exposure compared 
with intravenous administration.  Combining oral irinotecan with prophyl actic cephalosporins as 
described below has allowed for escalation of the MTD by 50% to 90 mg/m
2/dose x 5 days [44, 
47] translating into similar levels of the active metabolite SN-[ADDRESS_921798] savings and convenience of administration 
make oral irinotecan an appropria te and attractive agent for use in the relapsed and refractory 
setting. 
 
Pharmacokinetic data: Irinotecan is converted into its act ive metabolite SN-38 in the liver by 
[CONTACT_231121] [48].  SN-38 is subsequently conver ted to SN-38 glucuronide by 
[CONTACT_680986] (UDG).  Although the majority of irinotecan is 
metabolized into SN-[ADDRESS_921799] been shown to lead to  increased clearance of irinotecan and reduced 
levels of SN-38 [49, 50].  Use of CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided due to concerns for decreased efficacy of irinotecan. 
 
Toxicity data:  The dose limiting toxicities of irinotecan administered intravenously on adult 
schedules of once every 1-3 weeks are myelosuppr ession and diarrhea.  When irinotecan is 
administered on a protracted schedule as done in  pediatrics, myelosuppre ssion is substantially

Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
11 reduced while diarrhea remains the dose-limiting t oxicity [51-53].  The a ddition of cephalosporin 
prophylaxis to various treatment regimens of irinotecan has increased  the tolerability of 
protracted irinotecan by [CONTACT_680987], allowing for the 
escalation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) [44, 45, 54].  The active metabolite SN-[ADDRESS_921800], di rectly injuring the intestinal mucosa and 
leading to a secretory diarrhea  [55]. Cephalosporins ameliorate  irinotecan-associate diarrhea by 
[CONTACT_680988]-[ADDRESS_921801] th e fifth chemotherapy day. [44, 45, 54] 
 
2.4 Rationale for Combining Eribulin and Irinotecan 
 
While the planned testing of eri bulin as a single agent in the pediatric population is necessary, 
nearly all pediatric cancers are treated with drug combinations, and searching for a suitable 
therapeutic partner for eri bulin is the next logical step in de velopment of this drug.   We propose 
testing the combination of eribulin and oral irinotecan in a phase I trial designed to determine the 
recommended phase II dose of eribulin when combined with a previously established, well-
tolerated regimen of oral irinotecan in adolescent and young adult cancer patients 13-30 years 
old.  This age range was chosen b ecause the likely clinical application for this drug pair will be 
in the treatment of pe diatric-type sarcomas (e.g., Ewing sa rcoma, osteosarcoma), which more 
often occur in adolescents and young adults. Furt her, the age and size of  these patients will 
preclude the need for additional dose-finding studies for eribulin, as would be necessary if small children were included.  In adults, combination trials using eribulin w ith agents like carbopl atin and cyclophosphamide 
are underway in non-small cell l ung cancer, ovarian carcinoma, a nd breast cancer.  These drug 
partners all are myelosuppressive.  A more attractive partner ma y be one with non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_680945]-limiting toxicities like irinotecan.  When given on a protracted 5-day schedule, irinotecan 
does not cause severe myelosuppression, making it attractive for combination with eribulin.  Oral administration of irinotecan used alone and in co mbination therapy has been extensively tested in 
pediatrics in [ADDRESS_921802] in these patients. Notably, the 
pharmacokinetics of eribulin has not been determined in younger pa tients and may potentially be 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
12 different than in adults. Such differences ha ve been observed with other anticancer drugs 
including topotecan, which is metabolized mini mally and irinotecan, wh ich is extensively 
metabolized [40, 56-61]. Comparatively, pedi atric patients had similar irinotecan 
pharmacokinetics as adults but grea ter interpatient variability, whic h could be attributed to age. 
Such clearance differences would lead to higher exposure in pedi atric populations and thus an 
overall lower dosage required for treatment. As the proposed population is likely to include 
patients with potentially high and low clearance characteristics, it is important to obtain 
pharmacokinetic evidence that may potentially  provide evidence for differential dosing 
requirements based on age. 
 
3. PATIENT SELECTION

3.1.5 Prior Therapy:  No limit is placed on the number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Prior treatment with 
irinotecan or eribulin is allowed, although patients must not have received co-administration of eribulin and irinotecan a nd must not have had disease progression while 
receiving either eri bulin or irinotecan. 
Patients must have fully recovered from the acu te toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, or radiotherapy pr ior to entering this study.

Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
18 5.2.1 Administration of Eribulin 
 
Aseptically withdraw th e required amount of eribulin mesylate from the single-use vial and 
administer undiluted or diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP intravenously over 2 to 
5 minutes.  
5.2.2 Administration of Oral Irinotecan 
 For oral use, the appropriate vol ume of irinotecan solution (20 mg /ml) is drawn up undiluted into 
a plastic oral syringe. Each dose is to be mixed with juice (cra ngrape, cranapple, cranberry, or 
other “cran” juice) immediately before admini stration. The oral syringes containing undiluted 
irinotecan are stable for 21days when stored in a refrigerator. Irinotecan has a very unpleasant 
flavor, and so the juice will be used to mask the drug taste (Appendix D). See protocol for premedication and supportive care measures.   If emesis occurs within [ADDRESS_921820] is recommended 30 minutes prior to daily irinotecan 
doses. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_366866]/or steroids should not be used as antiemetics on this study due to effects 
on CYP3A4 and potential interference with irinotecan metabolism.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_921821] of medications that prolong QTc is provided in Appendix C. 
 
5.3.4 Supportive Care 
 Appropriate antibiotics, blood produ cts, antiemetics, fluids, and ge neral supportive ca se are to be 
used as necessary.     
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
19 5.3.5 Prophylaxis for Irinotecan- Associated Diarrhea 
 
Cefixime or an available equivalent antibiotic will be used to redu ce irinotecan-associated 
diarrhea as previously mentioned [44, 45]. Antib iotic treatment should start at least two days 
prior to the start of irinotecan. Th is antibiotic therapy should conti nue until [ADDRESS_921822] 4 hours after oral 
administration of irinotecan should receive at ropi[INVESTIGATOR_680951] a dose of 0.01 mg/kg 
(maximum 0.4 mg). This so-ca lled “early onset diarrhea” is often presaged by [CONTACT_680991][INVESTIGATOR_007]. Because patients are treated with 
irinotecan over multiple days, it may be difficult to distinguish immediate from delayed diarrhea. Patients with presumed immediate diarrhea who do not improve with atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or patients who 
develop diarrhea more than 4 hours after receiving irinotecan, should be given treatment with oral loperamide for late onse t diarrhea as outlined below. 
 
All patients will receive a copy of instructions for the use of loperamide if/when diarrhea occurs 
(Appendix D). Each family will be provided with th is antidiarrheal medicine with instructions to 
start at the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_680952], or at the earliest onset of bowel 
movements more frequent than norm ally expected for the patient. 
 
Loperamide (1 mg/5 ml or 1 caplet = 2 mg) dosing guidelines for diarrhea: 
Weight ≥ 43 kg (≥  95 pounds): Take [ADDRESS_921823] loose stool, 
followed by [CONTACT_680992]. 
Weight 20 kg to 43 kg (<94 pounds): Take [ADDRESS_921824] loose stool, 
followed by [CONTACT_680993]-half caplet every 2 hours as needed. 
 
Because patients will be receiv ing prolonged exposure to antibiotics (i.e., cefixime), patients 
having significant diarrhea should have stool samples evaluated for C difficile toxin, as this is a 
potentially treatable cause of diarrhea. If patie nts have fever with diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea, 
evaluation of stools for bacterial cu lture should also be performed.  
 If there is failure of loperamide to control di arrhea after 24 hours of use, patients may receive 
octreotide (Sandostatin™) at th e dose of 10 micrograms/kg/dose subcutaneously every 12 hours 
x 3 days.  
5.4 Criteria for Starting Subs equent Cycles of Therapy 
 
A cycle may be repeated if: 
 The patient has no evidence of disease progre ssion as assessed clinically and/or with 
imaging studies 
 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
20  The patient meets eligibility criteria for hematopoietic, renal, and liver function (Section 
3.1) 
 The patient has not met any criteria for rem oval from protocol therapy as described in 
Section 5.[ADDRESS_921825] evidence of progressive disease 
may be eligible for additional protocol  therapy as described in Section 6.0. 
 
5.5 Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
 
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any of the following events, detailed in Sections 
5.5.[ADDRESS_921826] cycle of 
therapy. 
 
5.5.1 Grading of Adverse Events 
 Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded acco rding to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events v4.02 (CTCAE) http://ctep.cancer.gov /reporting/ctc.html . 
 Any suspected or confirmed dose-limiting toxicity  should be reported within 24 hours to the 
coordinating center and Principal Investigators at both centers.  
 
5.5.2 Non-Hematological Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
 Non-hematological dose-limiting toxicity is  defined as any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-
hematological toxicity that is pos sibly, probably or defini tely attributable to the investigational 
drugs with the specific exclusion of:  
 Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or dehydration 
 Grade 3 diarrhea < 3 days 
 Grade 3 diarrhea regardless of duration if pa tient did not receive appropriate supportive 
care (cefixime, loperamide, or atropi[INVESTIGATOR_680953] 5.3) 
 Grade 3 transaminase (AST/ALT) elevation that returns to grade ≤ 1 or baseline prior to 
the time for the next treatment cycle 
 Grade 3 GGT 
 Grade 3 fatigue < 3 days 
 Grade 3 fever, febrile neutropenia, or infection 
 Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities (Na, K, Cl , CO2, Ca, Mg, Phosphate) that improve to ≤ 
grade 2 within 7 days, with  or without supplements 
 Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of the study drugs will not be considered a 
dose-limiting toxicity.  
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
21 Patients who develop > Grade 3 QTc prolongation (> 501 msec) at any time must be removed 
from protocol therapy. 
 
5.5.3 Hematological Dose-Limiting Toxicity 
 Hematologic DLT will be defined as any of the following: 
 Greater than 7 days duration of either grad e 4 neutropenia or gr ade 4 thrombocytopenia 
of > 7 days duration 
 Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that requires platelet transfusions on greater than 2 
occasions during a cycle. 
 Failure to recover blood counts to eligibility criteria that cause a delay of ≥ 14 days 
between treatment cycles.  
 
5.6 Dose Escalating Criteria 
 
A 3 + 3 design will be used to determine dose assignment for patients, as described in Section 13.2. Specifically, the following rules will apply for dose escalation: 
 
A.   Evaluate 3 patients at dose
k: 
1. If [ADDRESS_921827] cohort, increase dose to dose k+[ADDRESS_921828] dose, then go to C.  
ii. Otherwise, decrease dose to dose k-1 and go to A. 
B.   Evaluate 3 additional patients at dose k : 
1. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients has DLT, then increase dose to dose k+[ADDRESS_921829] dose, then go to C. 
ii. Otherwise, decrease dose to dose k-1 and go to A. 
C.   Discontinue dose escalation/de-escalation. 
 
 
Accrual will continue until the recommended phase II dose for a Phase II study (RP2D) is 
established and at least [ADDRESS_921830]-cycle DLT.  Doses higher than dose 
level 2 will not be studied in this trial. Once th e RP2D is identified, an additional 10 patients will 
be enrolled at this dose level.   
5.7 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adve rse event(s), treatment may continue for up to 17 
cycles until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Disease progression 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
22  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
 Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
 Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
 General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
 
5.8 Duration of Follow-Up 
 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable advers e event(s) will be fo llowed until resolution 
or stabilization of the adverse event. All pati ents will be followed for at least [ADDRESS_921831].    
5.9 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy 
 
a. Clinical or radiograp hic progressive diseas e (See Section 11). 
b. Adverse events requiring removal from study (See Sections 6.1 and 6.2). 
c. Refusal of further protocol th erapy by [CONTACT_4676]/parent/guardian. 
d. Non-compliance that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8598] e investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation. 
e. Completion of 17 cycl es of therapy.   
f. Determination that it is not in the patient’s  best interest by [CONTACT_1963]. 
 
Patients who are off protocol ther apy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off Study 
(see below). Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events that emerge  after the patient is removed 
from protocol therapy, but within [ADDRESS_921832] be 
followed and reported. Follow-up data will be  required unless consent is withdrawn. 
 
5.10 Off-Study Criteria 
 
Patients will be considered off-study if any of the following events occur:  
a. Thirty days has expi[INVESTIGATOR_680954]. 
b. Death 
c. Lost to follow-up 
d. Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission. 
e. Entry onto another antineopl astic therapeutic study. 
f. Onset of new treatment regimen 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
 
Dose modifications will involve eribulin but no t irinotecan, given that the study question is to 
identify the recommended phase II dose of eribulin  that can be safely ad ministered with fixed-
dose irinotecan.   Doses which have been reduced for 
toxicity will not be re-escalated . 
 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_921833] evidence 
of disease progression may continue to receiv e therapy modified as described below.  
 
Patients who experience Grade 3 febrile neutropeni a may receive additional cycles of therapy at 
the same eribulin dose with the optional use of filgrastim/pegfilgrastim support.  
 
Patients who experience DLT at dose level [ADDRESS_921834] dose-limiting neutropeni a (Grade 4 neutropenia of > [ADDRESS_921835] art of the next cycle for ≥ 14 days due to neutropenia) 
with no other dose-limiting toxi city should receive the same dose in the next cycle 
with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim support at standard doses. [Note: Patients MUST 
NOT receive prophylactic filgrastim or pegfilg rastim in the first cycle of therapy.] 
If dose-limiting neutropenia recurs after gr owth factor is added, then the eribulin 
dose should be decreased to th e next lowest dose level and 
filgrastim/pegfilgras tim support used again.   
6.1.3 Patients who experience Grade 4 febril e neutropenia may receive additional 
cycles of therapy at the same eribulin dos e with the use of filgrastim/pegfilgrastim 
support. 
 
6.2 Dose Modifications for Non-Hematological Toxicity 
 
Patients who experience Grade 3 prolonged QTc (> 501 msec) will be removed from 
protocol therapy. 
 Patients who experience dose-limiting toxicity at  dose levels [ADDRESS_921836] any dose-limiting non-he matological toxicity (as defined in 
section 5.5.2) that returns to eligibility cr iteria within [ADDRESS_921837] be removed from protocol therapy.

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 7.1 Definitions 
 
Adverse Event:  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding abnormal la boratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with  the use of a medical treatment or procedure, 
regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of 
unrelated, unlikely, possible,  probable or definite). 
 Serious Adverse Event:  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” 
if, in the view of the investigator, it results  in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-
threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159070], a 
persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of th e ability to conduct normal life 
functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Im portant medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or re quire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204216] y be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
 Unanticipated Problems:  Include adverse events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_680955] d to the intervention / drug or 
device, any unforeseen development that potenti ally increases the likelihood of harm to 
participants or others in the fu ture, information that indicates a change to the risks or potential 
benefits of the research or an actual unforeseen harmful or unfavor able occurrence to participants 
or others that relates to the research protocol (injuries, ps ychological events, drug errors). 
 Other Reportable Adverse Events:  Include death unrelated to  study treatment if occurring 
within [ADDRESS_921838] possibly related to  study treatment at any 
time point, secondary malignancy, pregna ncy, fetal death, an d neonatal death. 
  Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.2) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.3) will determine whether the event requires e xpedited reporting (via Medwatch Forms) in addition  to 
routine reporting.

7.3 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  Adverse events that occur while the patient 
is on study will need to be recorded.  Please see below for specific reporting 
requirements.  Each investigative site will be  responsible for maintaining an AE log that 
captures all AEs and SAEs.  All Adverse Events  will be recorded as “related” or “not 
related” in the AE log.  Each site will also need to report all SAEs that occur at that 
institution to their respective IRB as per th eir IRB policy in addi tion to the protocol 
requirements. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site http://ctep.cancer .gov/protocolDevelopment/elect ronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
 
 Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.

27 7.5 Routine Adverse Event Reporting 
 
All Adverse Events (Grades 1-5) must  be recorded on case report forms and reported to the 
overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_680957].  AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., 
reported to the IRB, FDA, etc.) must also be  reported in routine study data submissions. 
All Adverse Events will be recorded as “related” or “not rela ted” in the AE log.  Depending on 
the grade of each AE, it will need to be reported to CHCO within [ADDRESS_921843] of the adverse events and potential risks asso ciated with the investigational or commercial 
agents administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  8.1 Eribulin mesylate  [11,15:18,21:24,28-Triepoxy-7,9- ethano-12,15-methano-9H,15H-

 8.1.1 Dosage and Route of Delivery: Since this a Phase I study, dosage will be defined 
by [CONTACT_680994].  To admini ster the drug, it will be aseptically 
withdrawn from the single-use vial and administer undiluted or diluted in 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes.  
8.1.2 Adjustment of Dosing: This is define d in section 6.1 and 6.2 of the protocol 
8.1.3 Source and pharmacology: Eribulin mesylate is a non-taxane microtubule 
dynamics inhibitor.  Eribulin mesylate is a synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a 
product isolated from the marine sponge Halichondria okadai.  Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the 
shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin 
exerts its effects via a tubulin-based an timitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-
cycle block, disruption of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_680958], and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death 
after prolonged mitotic blockage.

The pharmacokinetics (PK) of eribulin is linear with a mean elimination half-life 
of approximately 40 hours, a mean volume of distribution of 43 L/m2 to 114 L/m2 
and mean clearance of 1.16 L/hr/m2 to 2.42 L/hr/m2 over the dose range of 0.25 
mg/m2 to 4.0 mg/m2. The human plasma protein binding of eribulin at 
concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 1,000 ng/mL  ranges from 49% to 65%. Eribulin 
exposure after multiple dosing is comparable to that following a single dose. No accumulation of eribulin is observe d with weekly administration.  
 Unchanged eribulin was the major circ ulating species in plasma following 
administration of 14C-eribulin to patients.  Metabolite concentrations represented 
< 0.6% of parent compound, confirmi ng that there are no major human 
metabolites of eribulin. Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) negligibly metabolizes 
eribulin in vitro.  Eribulin is eliminated primarily in f eces unchanged. After administration of 14C-
eribulin to patients, approximately 82% of the dose was eliminated in feces and 9% in urine. Unchanged eribulin acc ounted for approximately 88% and 91% of 
the dose in feces and urine, respectively. 
 
8.1.4 Formulation & Stability: Eribulin mesylate  injection, 1 mg/2 mL, in a single-use 
vial. One vial per carton. Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°-30°C (59°-86°F). Do not freeze. Store th e vials in their original cartons. 
 
8.1.5 Guidelines for Administration: See Treatme nt and Dose Modifications sections of 
the protocol. The FDA-approved dose of Eribu lin as a single agent in adults is 1.4 
mg/m2 administered intravenously over 2 to 5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-
day cycle. 
 8.1.6 Toxicity: In Phase [ADDRESS_921844] common treatment-emergent adverse events 
noted are described. Over half of patients  experienced neutrope nia or leukopenia, 
and 20% had anemia. One third of patients complained of asthenia or fatigue. Nausea was observed in 22% and diarrh ea in only 14%. Peri pheral neuropathy 
was observed in 27%.  One third of patient s experienced alopecia. Of the almost 
[ADDRESS_921845] frequent treatment-related SAEs 
were febrile neutropenia (3.3%), neutr openia (1.9%), and pyr exia (1.2%).   
  8.1.7 Supplier: Eribulin is commercially availabl e by [CONTACT_101382]. See package insert or IB for

Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_921846] 15 minutes after the eribulin.  For oral use, the appropriate 
volume of irinotecan solution (20 mg/ml) is drawn up undiluted into a plastic oral 
syringe. Each dose is to be mixed with ju ice (crangrape, cranapple, cranberry, or 
other “cran” juice) immediately befo re administration. The oral syringes 
containing undiluted irinotecan are stable fo r 21days when stored in a refrigerator. 
Irinotecan has a very unpleasant flavor, and so the juice will be used to mask the 
drug taste (Appendix D). See protocol for premedication and supportive care 
measures.  If emesis occurs within 20 minutes of taking a dose of irinotecan, then the dose 
may be repeated once. If emesis occurs  after 20 minutes, the dose should not be 
repeated. Instructions for administrati on of oral irinotecan are included in 
Appendix D and a copy of Appendix B, outlin ing potential drug interactions with 
irinotecan, should be given to the patient.  
8.2.2 Adjustment of Dosing: This is define d in section 6.1 and 6.2 of the protocol 
 
8.2.3 Source and pharmacology: Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water-soluble analog of 
camptothecin (a plant alkaloid isolated from Camptotheca acuminata). Irinotecan 
is a prodrug that requires conversion, by [CONTACT_680995]-I inhibitor, SN -[ADDRESS_921847] with the ternary complex 
formed by [CONTACT_99231] I, DNA, and eith er irinotecan or SN-38. Renal excretion 
is a minor route of elimination of ir inotecan. The majority of the drug is 
metabolized in the liver. SN- 38 is conj ugated to glucuronic acid and this 
metabolite has no anti-tumor activity. The extent of conversion of SN-38 to its glucuronide has been inversely correlated w ith the risk of severe diarrhea, because 
the other major route of SN-38 excreti on is biliary excretion by [CONTACT_680996] (cMOAT) which presumably leads to mucosal injury. In addition, APC and NPC are oxidative metabolites of irinotecan dependent on the CYP3A4 isoenzyme. Afte r intravenous infusion of irinotecan in 
humans, irinotecan plasma concentrati ons decline in a multiexponential manner, 
with a mean terminal elimination half- life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean 
terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 to 20 
hours. Irinotecan is 30% to 68% bound to albumin and SN-38 is approximately 95% bound to albumin.  
8.2.4 Formulation & Stability: Each mL of  irinotecan injection contains 20 mg 
irinotecan (on the basis of the trihydrate salt); 45 mg sorbitol; and 0.9 mg lactic 
acid. When necessary, pH has been adjusted  to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium

30 hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Irinotecan is  available in single-dose amber glass 
vials in 40mg (2ml) and 100mg (5ml). Stor e at controlled room temperature 15° 
to 30°C (59° to 86°F). Protect from light . It is recommended that the vial (and 
backing/plastic blister) should remain in the carton until the time of use. 
 
8.2.5 Guidelines for Administration: See Treatme nt and Dose Modifications sections of 
the protocol.  For oral use, the appropriate volume of irinotecan so lution (20 mg/ml) is drawn 
up undiluted into a plastic oral syringe. Each dose is to be mixed with juice 
(crangrape, cranapple, cranberry, or other “cran” juice) immediately before administration. The oral sy ringes containing undiluted ir inotecan are stable for 
21days when stored in a refrigerator. Iri notecan has a very unpleasant flavor, and 
so the juice will be used to mask the drug taste (Appendix D). See protocol for premedication and supportive care measures.  Cefixime or an available equivalent antibiotic will be used as diarrheal 
prophylaxis. Initiation of antibiotic treatment at least two da ys prior to the start of 
irinotecan is recommended. This antibiotic therapy should continue until [ADDRESS_921848], like ondansetron is recommended 30 
minutes prior to daily irinotecan doses. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_458295], a moderate inhibitor, and substrate of CYP3A4 and should not be used as an anti-emetic. 
 If emesis occurs within 20 minutes of taking a dose of irinotecan, then the dose 
may be repeated once. If emesis occurs  after 20 minutes, the dose should not be 
repeated. Instructions for administrati on of oral irinotecan are included in 
Appendix C.  
8.2.6 Supplier: Irinotecan is commercially available. See package insert for more 
detailed information. 
 
8.3 Cefixime [Suprax®]   
 8.3.1 Source and pharmacology: Cefixime is a th ird generation cephalo sporin antibiotic 
for oral administration that inhibits bact erial cell wall synthesi s by [CONTACT_680997]-binding prot eins and interfering with the final 
transpeptidation step of pep tidoglycan synthesis. Its spec trum of activity is similar 
to other third generation agents, including Enterobacteriaceae, and β-lactamase 
producing H. influenzae and N. gonorreae, and Staph. aureus. It is excreted 
primarily by [CONTACT_10521]. It has a serum half-life of approximately 3-4 hours.  
8.3.2 Formulation & Stability: Cefixime is av ailable in scored 200 mg and 400 mg film 
coated tablets, and in a powder for or al suspension, which when reconstituted, 
provides 100mg/5ml. The powder for oral suspension is strawberry flavored and

Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_921852] – Solid Tumors 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_182655]  (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [65].  Changes in th e largest diameter (uni-dimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of  malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST 
criteria.    
11.1.[ADDRESS_921853] 
their response classified according to the defi nitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who 
exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered 
evaluable).

 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in  a previously irradiated area may only be 
considered measurable if there is documentation of residual viable disease after irradiation, or if there is unequivocal progression at that  site following irradiation. 
 Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_921857] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Evaluable Disease (also termed “non-measurab le” or “non-target” disease).  All other 
lesions (or sites of disease) , including smaller pathologi c lymph nodes are considered 
evaluable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, infl ammatory breast disease, and abdominal

34 masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are also considered as evaluable (non-measurable). 
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteri a for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor evaluable (non-
measurable)) since they are,  by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repr esent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of m easurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, represen tative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions shoul d be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves  to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest le sion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) fo r all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum di ameters.  If lymph nodes are to  be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the su m.  The baseline sum diameters will be used 
as reference to further characterize any obj ective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or si tes of disease) including any evaluable (non-
measurable) and measurable lesions over a nd above the [ADDRESS_921858] ed in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evalua tions should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at ba seline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_453674](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will onl y be considered measurable when they are 
superficial ( e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers ( e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estima te the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_921859] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is al so acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body 
scans).    Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI ha s excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image ac quisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_182579], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is vari able globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Fu rthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type  of scanner should be used and the image 
acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 PET-CT  At present, the low dose or atte nuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal dia gnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if it can be documented that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnos tic quality to a diagnostic CT (w ith IV and oral contrast), 
then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be 
used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which 
may bias an investigator if it is no t routinely or seri ally performed.   
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not usef ul in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound exam inations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique  and measurements will be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_680999], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is conc ern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used inst ead of CT in selected instances. 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such t echniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
 Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must  normalize for a patient to be considered 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
36 in complete clinical response.  Specific gui delines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurren t prostate cancer) have been published [66-
68]. In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_921860]-line 
trials in ovarian cancer [69].  Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be  used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete re sponses (CR) in rare cases ( e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic  origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurab le tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentia te between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of th e treatment) and progressive disease. 
 FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessmen ts need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-P ET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a pos itive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654] , this is PD.  If 
the positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not c onfirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to  determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressi ng on the basis of the anatomic images, this 
is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to  a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.   Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surroundi ng tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of  all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decreas e in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
37 Progressive Disease (PD):  At  least a 20% increase in th e sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) .  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolu te increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesi ons is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as refe rence the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions  and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  Note:  If tumor markers ar e initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be consider ed in complete clinical response. 
 Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or  more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status .  It must be repr esentative of overall 
disease status change, not a si ngle lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progre ssion of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_182580] d prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal 
Investigator). 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response  The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

this category when no lesions can be measured is not advised. 
 
11.1.5 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (w hichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is  objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
A phase I, dose-escalation trial is proposed to  determine the recommen ded phase II dose (RP2D) 
of escalating doses of eribulin in combination with standard-dos e oral irinotecan. Cohorts of 3 
patients per dose level are propos ed using a 3+3 design [70, 71].  The following rules will be 
incorporated for dose escalation/de-escalati on and establishing the recommended Phase II dose 
using the occurrence of DLT during the first cycle of therapy that is  possibly, probably, or 
definitely attributab le to study therapy. 
 
A.   Evaluate 3 patients at dose
k: 
1. If [ADDRESS_921865] cohort, increase dose to dose k+1 and go to A. 
ii. Otherwise, go to B. 
2. If 1 of 3 patients has DLT, then go to B. 
3. If more than 1 patient has DLT  
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, [ADDRESS_921866] dose, then go to C.  
ii. Otherwise, decrease dose to dose k-1 and go to A. 
B.   Evaluate 3 additional patients at dose k: 
1. If 0 or 1 of 6 patients has DLT, then increase dose to dose k+[ADDRESS_921867] dose, then go to C. 
ii. Otherwise, decrease dose to dose k-1 and go to A. 
C.   Discontinue dose escalation/de-escalation. 
 
 The RP2D is defined as the hi ghest dose level in which there is no more than 1 DLT in 6 
patients. Ten additional patients will be enrolled at  the RP2D level. Similar dose modifications as 
specified in Section 6 would be applied to thes e patients. Doses higher than dose level 2 will not 
be studied in this trial.  
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
 
The primary goal of this Phase I trial is to determine the RP2D and assess safety of the 
combination regimen.  A total of [ADDRESS_921868] one epi[INVESTIGATOR_181600], incidence of adverse events causing withdrawal 
and incidence of serious adverse events. The total number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_174562] 
(Frequency Table), and the severity and attribu tion to study therapy of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_174563] 
(Severity Table and Attribution Tabl e) will also be displayed.    
 Listings of adverse events by [CONTACT_681004], the duration of each event, 
the severity of each event, and the relationshi p of the event to study therapy, whether it was a 
serious event, and whether it caused withdrawal. Safety data will be summarized for the overall patient group and by [CONTACT_28805].  Toxicities will be graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) v4.02.    Estimates of antitumor effect based on RECIST 1.1 criteria will be estimated.  Furthermore, 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
43 specific PD parameters will be assessed including SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide.  Descriptive 
statistics will be employed to summarize quantitativ e levels of PD parameters at each time point 
of follow-up while changes in PD from baseline will be calculated and compared using paired 
statistical tests.  Pharmacokinetic modeling (two-compartment or non-compartmental models) 
will be employed to estimate several PK parameters (area under the concentration versus time curve, AUC, half-life, clearance, Cmax, etc).  Th ese analyses will be considered exploratory in 
this Phase I trial.   
 
13.5 Data Management 
 
The study statistician and staff fr om the Biostatistics Shared Re source Facility (BSRF) of the 
Markey Cancer Center worked closely with the study investigators and the Clinical Research and 
Data Management (CRDM SRF) at Markey in  the development of eCRFs for the study.  
Specifically, the statisticians atte nded several meetings including the Protocol Initiation Meeting 
(PIM) to address all statistical considerations for this protocol  including incorporation of dose-
escalation plans for this Phase I trial, appr opriate and accurate collection of primary and 
secondary study endpoints and inclusion of valid va lues and range checks for data fields.  Red 
Cap, managed by [CONTACT_681005], will be the primary database repository of clinical data from all 
patients enrolled into this trial.  Data will be accessed by [CONTACT_210573] a regularly-
scheduled basis to perform statistical programmi ng for conduct of data quality control, data 
management, generation of interim reports and sta tistical analysis.  The BSRF has developed an 
automated mechanism for generating a trigger for assessment of dose limiting toxicities based on 
the dose escalation rules in sections section 5.0 above.  In coll aboration with the study team, 
procedures will be developed for timelines for da ta quality control, resolution of data queries, 
interim reporting and final data analysis.

45 APPENDIX B INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 
Information on Possible Interactions with Ot her Agents for Patients and Their Caregivers 
and Non-Study Healthcare Team 
 
Irinotecan interacts with many drugs that are proce ssed by [CONTACT_6813].  Because of this, it is very 
important to tell your study doctors about all of your medicine before  you start this study.  It is 
also very important to tell them if you stop ta king any regular medicine, or if you start taking a 
new medicine while you take part in this study.  When you talk about your medicine with your 
study doctor, include medicine you buy without a prescription at the drug store (over-the-counter 
remedy), or herbal supplements such as St. John’s wort.   Many health care prescribers can write prescripti ons.  You must also te ll your other prescribers 
(doctors, physicians’ assistants or nurse practitione rs) that you are taking part in a clinical trial. 
Bring this paper with you and keep the attached information card in your wallet .  These are 
the things that you and they need to know:   Irinotecan  interacts with (a) certain speci fic enzyme(s) in  your liver.  
 The enzyme(s) in question is  CYP isoenzyme 3A4 .  Irinotecan  is broken down by [CONTACT_681006]. 
 Irinotecan  must be used very carefully with othe r medicines that need these liver enzymes 
to be effective or to be cleared from your system.   
 Other medicines may also affect the activity of the enzyme.   
o Substances that increase the enzyme’s activity (“inducers” ) could reduce the 
effectiveness of the drug, while substan ces that decrease the enzyme’s activity 
(“inhibitors”) could result in high levels  of the active drug, increasing the chance 
of harmful side effects. 
o You should notify your study doctor if you are prescribed: phenytoin , 
phenobarbital , carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_680965]. 
 You and healthcare providers w ho prescribe drugs for you must be careful about adding or 
removing any drug in this category.  
 Before you start the study, your study doctor wi ll work with your regular prescriber to 
switch any medicines that are c onsidered “strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of CYP 
3A4.” 
 Your prescribers should look at this web site 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx  or consult a medical reference to see 
if any medicine they want to prescr ibe is on a list of drugs to avoid.   
 Please be very careful!  Over-the-counter drugs have a brand na me on the label—it’s 
usually big and catches your eye.  They also  have a generic name—it’s usually small and 
located above or below the brand name, and printed in the ingredient list.  Find the 
generic name [CONTACT_159965], with the pharm acist’s help, whether there could be an 
adverse interaction.   
 Be careful:  
o If you take acetaminophen regularly:  You should not take more than 4 grams a 
day if you are an adult.  Read labels carefully!  Acetaminophen is an ingredient in 
Protocol # 15-0659 
Version Date: March 22, 2017 
 
46 
many medicines for pain, flu, and cold. 
o If you drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit:  Avoid th ese until the study is over.  
o If you take herbal medicine regularly:  You should not take St. John’s wort while 
you are taking Irinotecan. 
 
Other medicines can be a problem with your study drugs.   
 You should check with your doctor or  pharmacist whenever you need to 
use an over-the-counter medicine  or herbal supplement.  
 
 Your regular prescriber should check a medical reference or call your 
study doctor before prescribing any new medicine for you.  Your study

  APPENDIX D ORAL IRINOTECAN ADMINISTRATION GUIDELINES 
 
 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_527298] 5 doses of irinotecan, each in an oral syringe. 
Because irinotecan has an unpleasant taste, it is usually mixed with a small amount of 
juice IMMEDIATELY BEFORE giving the medicine to your child. 
 
 The best juice to use is CranGrape Juice, alt hough CranApple or cranberry juice is fine as 
well. 
 
 DO NOT mix the irinotecan in orange juice, apple juice, milk or soda. 
 
 Use a disposable cup to mix the irinotecan with  juice. The amount of juice used is up to 
you. The more juice used, the more the flavor of the irinotecan will be masked. However, it is critical that  your child drink ALL of the juice mixed with irinotecan. Most parents 
start by [CONTACT_681007] (5 ml) of juice. Discard the cup when 
empty after the irinotecan + juice has been taken.  
 Irinotecan should be mixed with juice only on the day the dose is given. The other doses should be stored in a REFRIGERATOR . Irinotecan will last for 21 days at a time, 
provided it has not been mixed with juice.  
 Use of nausea medicines (Zofran, Kytril, or  Anzemet) may be helpful, and these 
medicines are best given about  30-60 minutes before the irin otecan. Please discuss this 
with your doctor. 
 If you are unable to take the medicine, or vom its within 30 minutes of taking the medicine, 
please call your doctor fo r further instructions.

49 APPENDIX E PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR TREATING DIARRHEA 
 
Dear Patient or Parent:  You are receiving irinotecan. This drug can cause severe diarrhea. Before your FIRST 
chemotherapy treatment please be sure to:  1. BUY IMODIUM A-D. Make sure you have th is medication at home before your first 
chemotherapy treatment. Imodium A-D is also called LOPERAMIDE and comes in 2 mg caplets 
and in liquid form at a concentration of 0.2mg/ml.  2. AFTER your chemotherapy has started, at the FIRST SIGN of diarrhea  be sure to START 
taking Imodium A-D. DO NOT DELAY starting I mmodium A-D if you notice your stools to be 
more loose, soft, or watery than usual. Do not skip doses. Give Immodium A-D as follows: 
• > 43 kg (95 pounds) and more: [ADDRESS_921871] loose stool followed by 2 
teaspoonfuls or 1 caplet ever y two hours as needed. 
• 20-43 kg (44-94 pounds): take [ADDRESS_921872] any questions.    5. Your diarrhea can also get a little better if you take the following steps IN ADDITION TO 
taking Imodium A-D: 
- Drink plenty of water or Gatorade 
- Drink broth or clear soup to replace salt - Stay away from milk, dairy produ cts, alcohol, hot or cold bevera ges, coffee, tea and drinks with 
Caffeine  6. Do not take medicines such as Mira lax, Mylanta, Maalox, Senokot, or Colace 
 7. Eat foods that are easy to tolerate such as bananas, rice, apple sauce, chicken (white meat), white toast, and canned fruits  8. Please fill out the Irinotecan Administration Di ary below during this treatment and give to

Protocol Version Date: March 22,  2017Study Title: A Phase  I/Ib Study of Eribulin in Combination with Oral Irinotecan for 
Adolescent and Young Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory 
Solid Tumors
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_680968],  MD, Tom Badgett, MD, PhD, Theodore Laetsch, MD
COMIRB No: 15-0659
Version Date: March 22,  2017
You are being asked to be in a research study.  This form provides you with information about the 
study. 
A member of the research team will describe this study to you and answer all of your 
questions. Please read the information below and ask questions about anything you don’t 
understand before deciding whether or not to take part. 
The word “you” refers to you or your child if the patient is under age 18.  “We” means the doctors 
and other people on the research team.  
Why is this study being done?
Currently 
there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  You are being asked to take 
part in this study because you have a solid tumor for which there is no known curative therapy.  Your 
cancer is recurrent or refractory.  Recurrent means that the cancer has come back after treatment.  
Refractory means that the cancer has not responded to standard treatment.  Standard treatment 
may have included chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high-dose chemotherapy with a 
stem cell transplant.
This study is designed  to test the experimental combination of eribulin and oral irinotecan in the hope 
of finding a drug combination that is safe and effective against solid tumors that have come back or 
not responded to standard therapy. Both drugs have been approved to treat different types of 
cancer, although the drugs have not been studied together in combination. This is called a Phase I 
study because the main purpose is to evaluate the safety of the drug combination, and what dose of 
eribulin may be best to use for further studies.  The purposes of this study are to find out what effects 
the combination of the investigational drug, eribulin and oral irinotecan has on your type of cancer 
and whether both drugs can be given safely together. 
There are two parts to this study:  the dose-escalation part, and the dose expansion part.
The first part of  this study is called dose-escalation.  This part of the study will determine the 
recommended dose 
of eribulin.  The dose of oral Irinotecan will not change.  The main goal of this 
part of the study will be to measure the safety and side effects of the combination.  The dose of 
eribulin you receive is determined when you are enrolled in the study.  Participants enrolled early in 
the study will receive a lower dose.  Participants enrolled later in the study period may receive a

Protocol Version Date: March 22,  2017higher dose.  The  dose of oral irinotecan is not increased during this study.  The irinotecan dose is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_680969].  For each dose group, called a cohort, a number of 
scientists and doctors will carefully look at labs and other tests to make sure it is safe to enroll 
adolescents and young adults in the next higher dose group.  The dose of eribulin will not be 
increased higher than the dose that has been proven safe in adults. During the study, blood samples 
will be taken to measure how much of the chemotherapy are in your blood at certain times. 
The second part  of this study is called the dose expansion phase.   This phase will plan to enroll 
more adolescents
 and young adults with a fixed dose of study drug that has been determined from 
the dose-escalation part of the study.   You will be given the same amount of eribulin and Irinotecan 
as the other patients that join during the dose expansion part of this study. 
The goals of this study are:
To determine the best dose of eribulin that can be safely given together with oral  irinotecan 
to 
treat adolescents and young adults with relapsed or refractory solid tumors;
To learn about the side effects (good and/or bad) of giving eribulin with oral irinotecan;
To determine if tumors get smaller after treatment with eribulin and oral irinotecan;

people in this study
Between 6-22 patients will be enrolled on this study at Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161], the University of 
Kentucky, or the University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center. 
What happens if I join this study?
Before you begin the study:
If you decide to participate in this study, you will sign this consent document and you will be given a 
copy of
 your signed consent before any of the procedures listed below are performed.  Please refer 
to the Calendar of Events located at the back of this consent form for guidance while reviewing the 
procedures that will take place at the screening and at various times during participation in this 
study. 
You will need to have the following exams, tests, or procedures to find out if you can be in the study.  
These 
tests will also be done at various times throughout the study and at the end of the study.  The 
purpose of these tests is to see how well the treatment works and to measure the status of your 
cancer.  If you had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your 
study doctor.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done 
even if you do not join the study.
Your medical history will be reviewed;
You will have a physical exam including a measurement of your height and weight;
Your vital signs will be recorded (blood pressure, heart rate and temperature);
Your ability to perform daily tasks will be assessed;
You will be asked about any medications that you are taking or have taken recently;

During the study:
Treatment Plan
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you are eligible to participate in this study, eribulin will 
be given 
as a 5-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each cycle.  Irinotecan will be given 
orally on Days 1 through 5 of each cycle.  A cycle lasts 3 weeks (21 days).  
You can receive up to 17 cycles of therapy (approximately 12 months or about 1 year) as long as 
you are 
benefitting from treatment, not having bad side effects and continue to meet the criteria to 
continue safely on this study.  Although other participating subjects may receive a different dose of 
eribulin, your assigned dose will not change during your participation in this study unless you 
develop certain side effects that require lowering your dose of eribulin. 
Eribulin is given in the clinic and does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], although treatment can be given in 
the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_213976].  Oral irinotecan can be started in the clinic on the Day [ADDRESS_921875] dose of eribulin and Irinotecan and taken for 10 days with each cycle of 
chemotherapy.  The study treatment plan is summarized in the table below:
Treatment Schema:

Eribulin ● ●
Oral Irinotecan ●●●●●
Cefixime (antibiotic) ●●●●●●●●●● ●●
Because eribulin is given intravenously, your physician may recommend that you have a “port” or 
some type of central venous line placed, if this has not already been done. These are special types 
of intravenous lines that are placed into a large vein in the chest by a surgeon during a short 
operation. The “port” or central line is used to administer chemotherapy drugs and also to withdraw 
small amounts of blood for testing during treatment. The risks associated with placement of these 
devices will be explained to you and you will be given a separate informed consent document to 
review and sign if placement of this device is necessary. If you do not have a central line, you will 
need to have a peripheral IV placed. There is a small amount of pain from the IV and a very small 
risk of minimal bleeding.

Protocol Version Date: March 22,  2017After you stop treatment, you will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much 
tumor 
is left.  Your study doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done.  Researchers will 
continue to collect information about you for [ADDRESS_921878] dose of study drug.  
What are the possible discomforts or risks?
While 
receiving treatment  with this drug combination, you may be at risk of side effects.  
This is a Phase I study.  A Phase I study looks at how common and serious side effects can be for 
each patient
 at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase I study, some patients may have very serious 
side effects and could die as a result of these side effects.
Everyone taking part  in the study will be monitored carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors 
don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious.  Your 
health care team may give you medications to help lessen side effects.  Many side effects go away 
soon after you stop taking the combination of eribulin and Irinotecan.  In some cases, side effects 
can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  There is also a risk of death.  We will tell you if 
we learn of any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to stay in this study.
You should tell  your study doctor immediately if you think you are developi[INVESTIGATOR_680971]. Any delay in treating these side effects may prolong their 
course, make them more difficult to treat and in rare occasions may even be fatal. 
You should not take any other medications, including non-prescription treatments such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
without the approval of your study doctor.

Serious Side Effects:
Any of the side effects listed in the tables above can become serious. 
Imaging Studies:
You will have one or more of the following imaging studies, depending on which your doctor thinks is 
best 
to evaluate your tumor. You may have an MRI, CT, or FDG-PET scan. There are different risks 
associated with each of these scans and you doctor will discuss these risks with you. 
CT scans:  
As part of this study we will perform a CT scan of the area of your body where your tumor is and any 
additional 
areas that your doctor thinks are important to scan. CT is a way of taking detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_680972] X-rays.  X-rays are a type of radiation.
You get some radiation from your environment.  You get radiation from bricks and concrete, from 
some foods,
 and from radon gas, which is an invisible gas that seeps out of the ground.  The amount 
of radiation that this CT scan will deliver to your body (give you) is about the same as you would get 
from living in your environment for up to 5 years , depending on the area where the scan is focused.
This is an estimate.  The amount of radiation you get could be higher or lower, depending on the 
machine, 
the power setting, and your body weight. Exposure to radiation at high levels increases a 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876]. The risk of this procedure is not equal for everyone.  The risk is much 
higher for unborn babies if the mother has this procedure.  The risk is also much higher for young 
children and teenagers.  The risk is much lower for people over the age of 30. 
MRI:  
In this study we will take Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI’s) of your body. The MRI machine uses 
powerful 
magnetic waves to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_262706].  The waves themselves are not harmful, 
but they can cause metal to heat up and electronics to stop working.  You should NOT have an MRI 
if you have metal or electronic devices inside your body.   Heart pacemakers and insulin pumps are 
examples of
 electronic devices.
The MRI machine is a small round tube.  It might make you uncomfortable if you do not like tight 
spaces.  
The most common side effect of having an MRI is flashing lights in the eyes.  This is 
caused by [CONTACT_262794].  Some people also experience warmth and 
reddening of the skin.  This usually goes away after a few minutes. 
IV contrast:  
As part of a CT or MRI scan, you may be given an intravenous injection of dye in order to help see 
the 
organs on the radiology images .  You will feel a slight pin prick when the needle is inserted into 
your vein.  You may have a warm, flushed sensation during the injection of the contrast materials 
and a metallic taste in your mouth that lasts for a few minutes.  Some people may develop allergic 
symptoms (e.g., hives, itching, difficulty breathing), and in very rare cases, anaphylactic shock (low 
blood pressure, with loss of consciousness, severe loss of body fluid that can lead  to shock or 
death).  In addition, if you have low kidney function, this dye can temporarily or permanently 
decrease your kidney function.

COMIRB # 15-0659
Protocol Version Date: March 22,  2017Risks of an FDG-PET scan:  
The risks with a PET scan are very minimal.  The amount of radiation is low and the FDG degrades 
quickly so that no detectable radioactivity is present after several hours.  Any remaining FDG in your 
body is removed from the body through urine.  Family members are not at risk for exposure since 
greater than 90% of the radioactivity has left the body or decomposed before you have left the 
cancer clinic. 
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
For an ECG, someone (study staff or clinic staff) will attach special stickers to your chest, legs and 
arms.  
Wires will be connected to these stickers to read the electrical activity of your heart.  You will 
have to lie still for a few minutes.  Removing the stickers might be a little uncomfortable and you may 
experience mild irritation, slight redness, and itching in this area.
Reproductive Risks:
Patients who agree  to participate in this study should not become pregnant while on this study.  This 
study and the drugs used in this study may be hazardous to an unborn child.  Patients and their 
sexual partners should avoid sex and /or use an effective method(s) of contraception that is 
medically appropriate based on your study doctor’s recommendation at that time.
If you become pregnant,  you suspect pregnancy or if you have missed your period or it is late, or if 
you have a change in your usual menstrual cycle (e.g. heavy bleeding during your period or bleeding 
between periods), you should immediately contact [CONTACT_6814]. In case of pregnancy, you or 
your partner’s pregnancy and its outcome will be reported to the study sponsor.
If you become pregnant during this study, the study drug will be discontinued and you will be referred 
for 
obstetric care. The sponsor has not set aside any funds to pay for any aspects of obstetrics, child 
or related care and does not plan to pay for them.
What are the possible benefits of the study?
This 
study is designed for the researcher to learn more about the treatment combination of eribulin 
and oral 
irinotecan for adolescent and young adult patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors.   
However, there is no guarantee that your health will improve if you chose to participate in this study. 
Also, there could be risks to being in this study. If there are risks, these are listed above in the 
section describing the discomforts or risks. 
Are there alternative treatments? 
There 
may be other ways of treating your cancer. These other ways include:
Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study, such as other 
chemotherapy 
treatments;
Being in another study with a different experimental medicine;
Getting no treatment;
Getting palliative care. This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems, and 
other 
difficulties caused by [CONTACT_62565]. It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries 
to improve how you feel, and keep you as active and comfortable for as long as possible.
You should talk  to your doctor about your choices.  Make sure you understand all of your choices 
before you decide to take part in this study.  You may leave this study and still have these other 
choices available to you.

Study Periods  
The 26 patients may be enrolled separately. Each patient will progress through 3 study 
periods.  
Screening Period :  The Screening Period will begin with  the signature [CONTACT_564042] (I CF) at the Screening Visit (which can occur from Day -28 to Day -3) and will 
last 1 to 26  days. At the Screening Visit, patients will undergo preliminary screening 
procedures to determine their eligibility for the study. The end of the Screening Period will 
coincide with the beginning of the Clinic Period at Check -in. 
Clinic Period :  The Clinic Period will begin at Check -in on Day -2 (2 days before dosing) and 
will end at the time of Discharge on Day 15. During the 17-day Clinic Period, patients will be 
confined to the Study Center and will receive a standard diet  for diabetics . Patients who meet 
eligibility criteria based on Screening Visit assessments will be admitted to the Study Center 
on Day -2 for baseline procedures. On the morning of Day  1 (there is no Day  0), eligible 
patients (at least 11  male and 11 female) will be randomized in a 5:5:3 ratio to 1 of 3  masked 
treatment regimens: QD/QD, BID/QD, or PBO/PBO. On Days 1 to 14, patients will receive a 
morning  (AM) dose and an evening (PM) dose.  
Safety, PK, and PD assessments, including blood collections, will be performed at specified 
times throughout the Clinic Period (see Criteria for Evaluation  and Schedule of Events ). On 
Day 15, after assessments have been completed, patients will be discharged from the Study 
Center at the Investigator’s discretion.

Confidential  Page 6 of 78 Follow -up Period :  The Follow -up Period will begin immediately after Discharge fr om the 
Study Center on Day [ADDRESS_740916] for 27 (± 3) days. On Day 21 (±  2 days), 7 (± 2) days 
after the last dose of study drug, patients will return to the Study Center for the Follow -up 
Visit (see Schedul e of Events ). On Day 42 (± 3 days), 28 (± 3) days after the last dose of study 
drug, patients will return to the Study Center for the End of Trial Visit (see  Schedule of 
Events ). 
Study Drug Administration  
All patients will receive 2 orally administered doses per da y: an AM dose and a PM dose . 
Except for Day 13, p atients will receive the AM dose at ap proximately the same time 
(± 15 minutes) every day in the morning (8 to 10AM) following an overnight fast of  ≥ 8 hours. 
(Note: For each patient, the first dose on Day 1 may be administered between 8 and 10AM; 
thereafter, AM doses on Days [ADDRESS_740917] be administered within 15  minutes 
of the time of dosing on Da y 1.) On Day 13, if EndoPAT is planned, the first dose should  be 
administered in the morning between 7 and 10:30AM, after the EndoPAT assessment . 
Breakfast should begin within 30 minutes after dosing. Each patient will re ceive their PM dose 
12 hours (±  30 minutes) after their AM dose and at least [ADDRESS_740918] occurred : 
• Drug-related serious adverse event s (SAE s) in 2 or more patients on a given dosing 
regimen (per causality and SAE definitions in the protocol)  
• An overall pattern of clinic ally significant AEs or an overall pattern of patient tolerability 
issues , which may appear minor in terms of an individual event but, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_563989], collectively represents a safety concern.  
Planned Number of Patient s:   
Up to [ADDRESS_740919] dose. Total patient participation will be 
35 to 73  days, including the Screening, Clinic, and Follow -up Period s.

Pharmacodynamics  
Hemodynamics  
Cuff BP and pulse measurement s and ambulatory BP and pulse  monitoring will occur 
according to the Schedule of Events . BP effects will be assessed using the following 
parameters:  
• From supi[INVESTIGATOR_6358]:  change from baseline in pulse and systolic and diastolic BP 
measurements; proportion of patients with  supi[INVESTIGATOR_30991]  < 120 mm Hg and diastolic 
BP < 70 mm Hg  
• From orthostatic measurements:  change in systolic and diastolic BP and pulse 
measurements after patient has gone from the supi[INVESTIGATOR_563990]  
• From ambulatory monitoring :  change from baseline in 24 -hour, 4 -hour, daytime , and 
nighttime averages of systolic and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure, and pulse 
measurements  
Endothelial Function Assessment s  
If available at the Study Center, e ndothelial function  in the finger  will be measured  according  
to the Schedule of Events  using  the noninvasive Endo PAT  device . All measurements will be 
performed in a quiet, dimly lit, temperature -controlled ( 21–24°C ) room to reduce vascular 
tone fluctuation. The procedure will beg in after the patient has had the opportunity to void  and 
has been resting quietly for ≥ 15 minutes . Endothelial function will be assessed using the  
Reactive Hyperemia Index (RHI)  parameter.  
Platelet Function Testing  
Blood samples for platelet function assessment s will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Events . 
Fasting plasma  glucose and insulin  
Blood samples for determination of fasting plasma  glucose and insulin  levels will be collected 
according to the Schedule of Events . Values  will be used in the  Homeostatic Model 
Assessment to estimate insulin resistance (HOMA -IR).

1.1 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
The NO-sGC-cGMP ( nitric oxide – soluble guanylate cyclase – cyclic guanosine 3’,5’ -
monophosphate ) pathway plays a critical role in the cardio vascular  system. In the vascular 
endothelium,  sGC is stimulated by [CONTACT_564023] , which acts on downstream targets 
including cGMP -dependent protein kinases, phosphodiesterases, and ion channels . This leads t o 
relaxation of the vascular smooth muscle and  vasodilation. In addition, intracellular cGMP is 
involved in processes that affect vascular proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation . Impaired 
NO-sGC-cGMP signalin g, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of  cardiovascular diseases 
such as systemic and pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery  disease, congestive heart failure, 
peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis , and kidney disease . Agents that  stimulate sGC to 
increase cGMP production  (1,2) may be useful for treating and/or preventing a broad range of 
diseases that may ensue from dysfunction in the fundamental NO-sGC-cGMP pathway .(3,4) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This exploratory , proof -of-concept  study will evaluate  the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD  of 
2 dosing  regimens of  daily 40 mg IW-1973 administered orally for 2 weeks to patients wit h 
type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  This study is designed to  explore  the tolerability  
profile of the MAD MTD, 40 mg IW -1973 , in a patient population , and to explore whether  
tolerability can be improved with an initial week of BID dosing .  

IW-1973 Tablet   Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol : C1973 -202-P-03  16 March 2017  
Confidential  Page 29 of 78 In addition  to safety, tolerability , and PK,  this study will evaluate the PD effects (hemodynamics 
and endothelial function) of daily [ADDRESS_740935] . Type 2 
diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder in which the body does not use insulin effectively, 
leading to hyperglycemia an d glucose intolerance. The prevalence of diabetes in the United 
States (US) is 9.3%, or about 29.1 million people, and 95% of diagnosed cases are type 2. (5) 
This multifactorial disease is associated with numerous comorbidities, including hypertension, 
obesity, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. Nearly all diabetic 
patients have at least [ADDRESS_740936] 90% have at lea st 2.(6) Hypertension is the most 
common comorbid condition an d may affect over 80% of patients with type 2 diabetes. (6) 
Hypertension in diabetic patients increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and associated 
complications such as stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease. In 
addition, hypertension in diabetic patients also increases the risk of mic rovascular diseases 
including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. (7,8) Many  of the common comorbid 
disorders in di abetic patients are related to impairment in the  NO-sGC-cGMP  pathway; 
therefore , improving  dysfunction in the NO -cGMP -sGC pathway could be useful in treating 
multiple disorders in these patients.

3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUPS  
A double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized study design was chosen to investigate the 
safety PK, PD, and tolerability of 2 daily 40 -mg IW -1973 dosing regimens. Patients will be 
randomized to ensure that the treatment groups are comparable and to minimize the potential for 
selection bias . The study will be double  blind and treatments will be masked to ensure that the 
subjects and clinic staff are unaware of the dosing assignment and to minimize potential for bias 
in study assessments or in reporting of AEs. Placebo was chosen as the control so that the rate of 
spontaneously  occurring AEs can be determined and to reduce the potential for bias in the 
reporting of AEs. Randomization will occur so that, within a particular cohort, an optimal 
number of subjects can be exposed to a particular dose of IW -1973, while at the same tim e 
ensuring that a reasonable number of subjects across the cohorts receive placebo for AE and PD 
comparisons . This design is in accordance with the concepts in International Conference on 
Harmonisation ( ICH) E10, Choice of Control Groups and Related Issues in Clinical Trials 
(International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, 2001) .  
Patients  will be confined to the Study Center for the full duration of dosing through 24  hours  
after the final dose to allow monitoring of safety parameters and assessment of any PD effects of 
IW-1973.  In addition,  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121] ( Section  3.6) have been established to ensure that dosing 
will stop should a safety signal be detected. Patients  will have a Follow -up Visit 7 (± 2) days 
after the final dose  of study drug and an End of Trial Visit 28 (± 3) days a fter the final dose to 
determine if any AEs have developed and if any AEs that were ongoing at the time of Discharge 
have resolved .

All patient s will be monitored for AEs  throughout the study. All AEs will be recorded in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in this section.  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not nec essarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  
An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
An AE includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
• Any unfavorable changes in general condition  
• Any clinically  significant worsening of a pre existing condition  
• Any intercurrent diseases and accidents  
 
Note : A procedure is not an AE, but the reason for a procedure may be an AE . 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_740961] be recorded in the  patient’s source documentation and on the AE 
page of the subject’s eCRF. Causal relationship must be assessed according to the following:  
Related:    An event where there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship betwe en 
the event and the study drug 
Unrelated:   Any other event

Clinical Trial Protocol : C1973 -202-P-03  16 March 2017  
Confidential  Page 47 of 78 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Severity Assessment  
The Investigator will provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by [CONTACT_44745] a severity 
rating in the patient’s source documentation and on the AE page of the patien t’s eCRF. Severity,  
which is a description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness,  
which implies a patient outcome or AE -required treatment measure associated with a threat to 
life or functionality. Severity will be asses sed according to the following scale:  
Mild : A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.  
Moderate : A type of AE that  is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Severe : A type of AE th at interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening:  the patient was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred 
(ie, it does not include a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it had 
occurred in a more severe form)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:  a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal daily functions  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events:  events that may not result in dea th, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Such an event may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse even ts will be collected and recorded from the time the patient signs the ICF at the 
Screening Visit through  the End of Trial  Visit. All AEs, regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with study procedures or study medication, must be recorded in t he patient’s source 
documentation and subsequently on the appropriate AE page of the patient’s eCRF. This record 
includes AEs the patient reports spontaneously, those observed by [CONTACT_737], and those 
elicited by [CONTACT_139667] -ended questions during the study, such as “Have 
you had any health problems since your last visit?”  
For every AE, the Investigator must  
• Provide an assessment of the severity, causal relationship to the study medicatio n, and 
seriousness of the event  
• Documen t all actions taken with re gard to the study medication (ie , no action taken, 
treatment temporarily interrup ted, or treatment discontinued)   
• Detail any other treatment measures taken for the AE, including concomitan t medications 
and/or procedures  
 
Pretreat ment AEs will be collected from the time the patient signs the ICF until the patient 
receives study drug. Pretreatment AEs will be captured in the  patient’s source documentation  but 
will only be entered for patients who receive study drug on the AE page of  the patient’s eCRF.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs, physical examination findings, and 12 -lead 
ECG parameters should be considered AEs and reported on the AE page of the patient’s eCRF if 
the Investigator considers them clinically significant and/or they necessitate intervention.  
Any medical condition that is present when a patient is screened and does not worsen in severity 
and/or frequency should be reported as Medical History and not as an AE. However, if the 
condition does deteriorate in severity and/or frequency at any time during the study, it should be  
reported as an AE.

An AE that meets any of the serious criteria must be reported to Ironwood within [ADDRESS_740962]’s source documentation and on the AE page of the subject’s 
eCRF.  
The initial report should include at least the following information:  
• Patient identification number  
• Description and onset of the event  
• Serious criteria  
• Causality assessment to study drug  
 
Special Situation:  Exposure to Study Drug during Pregnancy  
In the event that a pregnancy occurs in a patient, the study drug must be stopped at once, and 
study personnel must report t he pregnancy as soon as possible (within 24 hours after notification) 
on the pregnancy notification form provided for this study. The study personnel must follow the 
pregnancy until the end and report the pregnancy outcome on the pregnancy outcome form 
provided for this study. If the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]), a separate SAE form must be completed.  
All relevant SAE or pregnancy information should be emailed to Ironwood Drug Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance.  
All SAE Report Forms should be emailed to:

relevant documents may also be requested.  
Appropriate remedial measures  should be taken by [CONTACT_144720]/her best medical 
judgment to treat the SAE. These measures and the subject’s response to these measures should 
be recorded. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug will be followed by [CONTACT_106078] r until satisfactory resolution, until the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or 
stable, or until the subject is lost to follow -up. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures 
should be employed by [CONTACT_564028].  
The Investigator will be responsible for reporting all SAEs to the IRB. Ironwood will be 
responsible for reporting to the regulatory authorities.  
3.7.4 Phar macodynam ic  Assessments  
Hemodynamic , endothelial function , and platelet  function  assessments will be used  to determine  
the PD parameters for PD analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hemodynamics  
Blood pressure and pulse measurements for PD analyses will include supi[INVESTIGATOR_564006] (for calculation of orthostatic pulse rate and BP) and ABPM assessed according to the 
Schedule of Events ; refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for detailed instructions .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Endothelial Function  
If available at the Study Center, e ndothelial function in the finger will be measured according to 
the Schedule of Events  using the noninvasive EndoPAT device. (Note : For each patient, the Day 
-1 and Day 13 assessments should occur at approximately the same time of day [±15 minutes] .) 
All measurements will precede all antihypertensive concomitant med ications and will be 
performed in a quiet, dimly lit, temperature -controlled (21 –24°C) room to reduce vascular tone 
fluctuation. The procedure will begin after the patient has had the opportunity to void  and has 
been resting quietly for at least  15 minutes . The right arm will be used for occlusion and finger

parameter.  
The EndoPAT procedure requires data entry of height, weight, and BP assessments in the 
EndoPAT software as follows. The Screening Visit height will be used for all EndoPAT 
assessments.  The weight  assessments obtained on Day -[ADDRESS_740963] 15 minutes 
prior to starting the EndoPAT recording.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Platelet F unction Assessment  
Blood samples for platelet function assessment (VerifyNow®, Accriva Diagnostics, San Diego, 
CA) and Evaluation of Platelet Function Markers (Center for Platelet Research Studies, [LOCATION_011], 
MA) will be collected  according to the Schedule of Events . Additional platelet function tests 
may be performed.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  HOMA -IR 
Blood samples for determination of fasting plasma  glucose and insulin  levels (Table  4) will be 
collected according to the Schedule of Events . Values will be used in the  Homeostatic Model 
Assessment to estimate insulin resistance (H OMA -IR).(10,11 )  
The HOMA -IR equation is  
HOMA -IR = (F SI × FPG)/22.5,  
where F SI is fasting serum insulin concentration ( µU/l) and FPG is fasting plasma glucose 
(mmol/l)

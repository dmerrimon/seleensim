Confidential Information; this Protocol is Confidential and Proprietary to EmitBio Inc  7 4 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
4.1 Executive Summary  
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral  
pneumonia cases of unknown origin.  Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_190249] 2  (SARS -
CoV -2) was shortly thereafter identified as the etiological agent for Coronavirus Disease  2019 
(COVID -19). Recent reports demonstrate that viral load strongly  correlates  with disease  severity,  
progression,  and mortality  in SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_313256] high levels of ACE2 expression,  highlighting the importance of the oral 
cavity in understanding both disease progression and oral -lung transmission via aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].4-5 
There are currently no FDA cleared or approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_257860] (i.e., within 3 
days of symptom appearance) mild to moderate COVID -[ADDRESS_313257]. These existing  limitations  
underscore  the need  for innovative  therapeutic  countermeasures  that can be made widely available 
in an equitable fashion and  directly address the  issue  of emerging variants.  
 
The Mechanisms of Action (MOA) of RD -X19 are through both direct and indirect antiviral  effects. 
RD-X19 inactivates cell -free SARS -CoV -2 by [CONTACT_45848] 99.99% and inhibits cell -associated 
replication of the virus by 99.9% when measured at 24 hours after a single treatment in vitro . Cell -
free SARS -CoV -2 is inactivated directly by 425nm visible blue light and indirectly, during and 
after light therapy through photobiomodulation of human tissue.  One of the putative antiviral 
mechanisms may involve upregulation  of nitric oxide (NO) in epi[INVESTIGATOR_257861] -X19-induced 
increased nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) and stimulation of the instantaneous release of the body’s 
bound store s of NO. It is hypothesized that photoimmunomodulation of the  respi[INVESTIGATOR_257862]. The innate immune effectors include 
natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, additional macrophages, and dendritic cells (professional 
antigen presenting cells) that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y proliferate and swarm the infecting virus. The innate immune 
response is our most ancient form of immunity and through pathogen -only protein pattern

utilized by [CONTACT_135569] -X19 has been repeatedly demonstrated to provide high -level viral inactivation in 
multiple, consistent, expert -laboratory in vitro  studies. The direct cell -free inactivation of virus by 
[CONTACT_257908] a transformational opportunity for therapy that is not antigen -directed or 
antigen -specific, unlike adaptive immunity induced or provided by [CONTACT_257909].  
Herein we report in vivo clinical proof of concept from our phase I/II Randomized, Sham -
controlled, Double -blind Safety, Tolerability and Bioeffect Study (RCT) - EB-P12-01 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  In summary, a total of 31 study subjects were 
randomized 2:[ADDRESS_313258] performed 
within 24 hours of enrollment with the presence of two or mor e COVID -19 signs and symptoms of 
≥ moderate severity (using guidance applied to severity grading of Treatment Emergent Adverse 
Events (TEAEs)) with initial symptoms no longer than 3 days prior to study enrollment. The listing 
of inclusion and exclusion cri teria can be found in the ClinicalTrials.gov reference above.  
 
Primary safety analyses returned the following results: no SAEs, no medically  attended or device -
related TEAEs (all TEAEs captured were the appearance or worsening of COVID -19 related signs 
or symptoms). All TEAEs were attributed to COVID -19, and, notably, there were no local site 
reactions including no changes within the oral cavity indicative of pathology reflecting clinically  
meaningful potential changes to the oral microbiome. The device was completely safe and 
exceptionally well -tolerated in this study . 
 
Bioeffects (efficacy) included evaluation of reductions in mean log 10 salivary viral load from 
baseline through study day 8 via RT -qPCR and time to sustained clearance of COVID -19 signs and 
symptoms, defined as all COVID -19 signs or symptoms graded as 0 (absent) or 1(mild) with no 
reoccurrence of any sign or symptom of seve rity score >[ADDRESS_313259] -X19 is safe, reduces salivary viral load 100 -fold after 4 days of treatment at study 
day 5 and 1000 -fold (99.9%) at study day 8 – a full [ADDRESS_313260]-X19 treated group than in the sham control group; a result that is both clinically 
meaningful and statistically s ignificant. No study volunteer required medical intervention other than 
self-medication with OTC remedies. There were no study subjects that discontinued participation.  
 
EmitBio will continue efforts to understand the detailed mechanisms of action that inactivate 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_313261] -X19. This  technology 
presents  an unprecedented  opportunity  for protection  that is NOT  antigen -directed  or  antigen -
specific,  with a high likelihood of  mitigating  the threat  posed  by [CONTACT_257910] -CoV -2 variants  as

 Study Goals  
This is a  randomized, sham controlled , dose finding  study of the EmitBio RD -X19 device in 
individuals with symptomatic COVID -[ADDRESS_313263] er 
treatment twice daily  for 7 days with a  one week  follow -up period  at Day 14 ( +/- 2 days) and will not 
be aware of which treatment group to which they have been randomized .  Clinical outcomes will be 
assessed via patient reported  outcomes ( disease assessment  and diary cards ) and virologic outcomes 
will be assessed post baseline on Days 3, 5, 8, and [ADDRESS_313264]-X19 dose compared to sham  in 
SARS -CoV -2 infected individuals with outpatient COVID -19.  The primary efficacy outcome s are:  
(i) time to sustained symptom resolution  in all patients (mild or moderate disease at baseline); and (ii) 
time to sustained symptom resolution in patients with mild disease at baseline . Other clinical and 
microbiological outcomes will also be assessed.   
Safety and tolerability (local reactogenicity) will be assessed actively and study subject diary card data 
recorded at each clinic visit by [CONTACT_257911] ( TEAEs) and 
targeted  oral and physical examination s. Volunteers will be instructed  to contact [CONTACT_257912] a medically -urgent nature as soon as is practically possible and to seek immediate 
medical care, if needed.   On study days [ADDRESS_313265] by [CONTACT_257913].  Study subjects who experience progression of 
disease to a grade 3 severity score ( e.g SpO2 ≤ 93%,or respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ≥30/ minute on room air)  will 
be instructed to urgently seek medical care  at their nearest Urgent Care or Emergency Department .  
Study subjects who progress to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_257863] l be referred directly by [CONTACT_257914][INVESTIGATOR_307]. All study sub jects who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257864] ; the time and date of these events will be captured as part of the trial data . 
Metabolic,  liver, kidney and hematological laboratory  evaluations will  be performed at baseline and 
at Day 14 or early termination (and potentially during unscheduled) clinic visits. Methemoglobin 
assessments will be performed at baseline and Day 14.

Subjects will provide  written  informed consent prior to initiating any screening procedures.  Subjects 
meeting all screening criteria will be eligible for enrollment and randomization into the study.  
Subjects with COVID -19 disease  with signs and symptoms reported > 72 hours from onset will be 
given instructions to see their primary care physician  or be advised to  seek potential treatment (if 
eligible) at  a local antibody infusion center .   
This Phase II , dose finding  portion of the  trial is targeting to enroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_313266] two dosing cohorts ( [ADDRESS_313267]-X19 and 10 assigned to sham  per cohort , 
2:1 randomization ).    
Cohort A will begin with 24 J/cm2 per treatment, administered 2X/Day for duration of 7 days.  Once 
80% of subjects (n=24) in Cohort A complete the Day 8 visit and no predefined safety signals as 
outlined in the study pausing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257865], Cohort B, 32 J/cm2 per treatment  
will start enrollment.   In the event device -related serious adverse events or patterns of device -related 
adverse events , including application site reactions,  are observed in Cohort A, and based on the 
review and recommendation of the  external safety monitoring committee  (SMC)  of unblinded data , 
the study may proceed with  enrollment and  dosing in Cohort C, 16 J/cm2 per treatment  in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_257866] .  An illustration  of the ascending (or descending) dose finding design 
is provided below.  
Cohort  A:  RD -X19 24 J/cm2 vs. Sham

Confidential Information; this Protocol is Confidential and Proprietary to EmitBio Inc  11 In the final Cohort to be investigated, once 80% of the  subjects complete the Day 8 visit without  
observation of safety signals meeting the definition of predefined  pausing/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] , a blinded 
review of available safety data for Cohort A and Cohort B will be  conducted along with a blinded 
assessment of the proportion of ‘success’ events on the first primary endpoint of sustained symptom 
resolution for the subjects within each Cohort.  A t the sponsors option the final cohort enrollment 
may be increased in sample size ( targeting up to an additional 150 subjects, 2:1 randomization).  This 
option  to increase overall enrollment is intended to  provide better resolution of the point estimate 
between a safe, well tolerated dose and sham treatment in a broader population, including subjects 
who are SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_313268] of Cohort B (32 J/cm2), based on the review and recommendation of the SMC , the sponsor 
may elect to proceed with the optional additional  enrollment and dosing in the initial Cohort A, 24 
J/cm2 per treatment.   As such, the Final Cohort is defined as the cohort including the final 
randomized subject . 
Subjects  meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized  in a 2:[ADDRESS_313269]-baseline (Day 1) on study days 3, 5, 8, and 14 (+/ -2, inclusive). 
Telephonic outreach by [CONTACT_257915] [ADDRESS_313270] safety will be monitored throughout the study by [CONTACT_257916], supported by

5.2 Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
 Known Potential  Risks  
The potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with having blood drawn and 
mild, transient,  local reactions as measured in EB-P10-01, a Phase I Open Label, Acute Safety 
Study of the EmitBio RD-X19 Device  in healthy adults . There  were no SA Es, TEAEs (including 
local reactions) attributed in EB -P12-01, a Phase I/II randomized, sham cont rolled, double -
blinded trial in indivuals with mild to moderate COVID -19. See the Clinical Investig ators 
Brochure for more detail.   
Drawing blood may cause transient discomfort and fainting. Fainting is usually transient and 
managed by [CONTACT_226295]/her legs. Bruising at the blood draw site 
may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_257922] a few 
minutes after the blood is taken.  
Extensive evaluation of the RD-X19 and similar energy -based devices  routinely used for oral and 
skin care purposes  resulted in the Sponsor, after careful consideration, making  the determination  
that RD-X19 ia a “Not Significant Risk” (NSR) device per FDA guidelines. This was affirmed 
twice by [CONTACT_257923] (IRBs).  
CAUTION  - The light  emitted  may be harmful  to the eyes.  Do not stare  at the light . 
Photobiological eye safety testing has classified this device as Risk Group [ADDRESS_313284] their or anyone else's  eyes.  
A summary of the known and potential risks of the RD -X19 are as follows:  
• Depth  of insertion  beyond  recommended  depth  has the potential  to result  in pharyngeal 
gag reflex for some study  subjects.  
  Page 20 of 59 
EmitBio Inc.  Version :  5.0 
EB-P20-01 17 January  2022  
 
Confidential Information; this Protocol is Confidential and Proprietary to EmitBio Inc  20 • Exposure to blue light may be harmful to the eyes when the device is used  incorrectly.  
• Overexposure of tissues to blue light can cause mild, transient pharyngeal discomfort 
and erythema.  
• Extended  blue light exposure  to eyes may result  in worsened headache  pain associated 
with chronic  migraines  and other  cerebral  vascular  disorders  associated  with headache.  
• Shining  the end of the RD-X19 illumination  device  directly  onto skin,  approximately  
[ADDRESS_313285] has the potential to induce mild  erythema.  
• Elimination  of oral microflora  with blue light has the potential  to lead to oral candidiasis 
and/or disruption of the oral  microbiome.  
 
Risks to Privacy  
Subjects will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI). All attempts will be made to 
keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law. However, there is a chance that 
unauthorized persons will see the subject’s PHI. All study records will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the participating clinical trial site(s). Electronic files 
will be password protected. Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitori ng, 
or auditing of this trial will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected. Any publications from 
this trial will not use information that will identify subjects by  [CONTACT_2300].  
Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating 
clinical trial site(s) for quality assurance (QA) and data analysis include groups such as the IRB 
and the FDA.  
A description of this clinical trial will be  posted on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov.  This web site 
does not include information that can identify subjects.  
There may be other risks, discomforts or side effects that are entirely unknown at this time.  
 Known Potential Benefits  
There is no guaranteed benefit to study participants; however, based on EB -P12-01, we expect to 
observe benefits including substantially decreased SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_313286] and quicker resolution of COVID -19 signs and symptoms.  Use of EmitBio ™ RD-X19 is 
intended to reduce SARS -CoV -2 viral load  and alleviate the clinical signs and symptoms 
associated with COVID -19. There is also the potential for benefit to society resulting from insights 
gained from participation  in this, and other si milar  studies

This is a randomized, adaptive dose -finding study .  The primary goal of the study is to evaluate  
multiple doses of the RD -X19 treatment device and establish  evidence for safety  and efficacy  for 
a single selected RD-X19 doses compared to sham  in SARS -CoV -2 infected individuals with 
outpatient COVID -19. 
The primary efficacy outcome s are: (i) time to sustained symptom resolution  in all patients (mild 
or moderate disease at baseline); and (ii) time to sustained symptom resolution in patients with 
mild disease at baseline . Other  clinical and microbiological outcomes will also be assessed.   
Since CMP and CBC results may not be available until study day 3, all volunteers who have 
significant clinical abnormalities will be immediately contact[CONTACT_257924], 
discontinued from active participation in the protocol and advised regarding appropriate medical 
follow -up outside the study. All such study subjects will be replaced with a new volunteer.    
Subjects who test positive for SARS -CoV -2 antibodies from blood draws at baseline  will continue 
treatment  for the duration of the study, undergo all assessments, and be excluded from  the 
modified full analysis set (mFAS) .  For each subject testing positive for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_313294] will be enrolled and randomized into the study  for each of 
Cohorts A and B  (*does not apply to optional enrollment period once  the dose has been selected

Reduction in cell -free virus of ≥1000 fold and inhibition of viral replication of ≥99% have been 
observed in repeated experiments conducted by [CONTACT_257929].  
Dose dependent e ffects are observed ranging from as little as a single 7.5 J/cm2 exposure up to 
complete antiviral activity at 30 J/cm2 measured 24 hours  and 48 hours  after exposure.  Multiple 
cell types including human respi[INVESTIGATOR_257883] 3D epi[INVESTIGATOR_255125]  (oral and 
tracheal/bronchial tissues)  in culture show high viability at single doses of visible blue light up to 
120 Joules/cm2 and after several days of repeat, twice daily dosing with 32 J/cm2.  These repeated 
experiments, conducted in multiple labs with multiple cell types, along with years of medical use 
of licen sed devices with comparable wavelengths and energy, support the doses proposed in this 
protocol for dose finding to achieve optimal efficacy and safety  for the doses tested .  
As in the Phase I  and Phase I/II  studies of RD -X19, a primary dose and schedule of two treatments 
per day  (separated by [CONTACT_257930] 6 hours) will be evaluated.  On Day 1, the subject will be 
instructed to complete two treatments regardless of time of enrollment.  
 
In light of extant  data, the current study begin ning with a  total energy per dose 50% increased 
over the previous study (EB-P12-01) will evaluate subjects over a 1 week treatment period with 
a follow up visit at day 14.  Based on the observed safety and tolerability of Cohort A, ascending 
to Cohort B has been designed to deliver  up to 100% increase  in daily dose  over the previous 
study  and evaluate subjects over a 1 week treatment period  with a follow up visit at day 14 , 
consistent with the recommendation made by [CONTACT_257931] -P12-01. Cohort C, if 
dictated based on the safety tolerability of Cohort A, would evalute the same daily dose delivered 
in EB -P12-01. The dosing schedule , duration  of treatment, and ascending/descending dose design  
has been selected to provide clinically meaningful  reduction s in viral load and symptomatic relief 
as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_257884] a  well tolerated  safety profile.  
Strict safety oversight will provide rapid detection of significant device -related adverse events 
warranting pausing or halting the trial.  See Section 8.5 for detailed description of study Pausing

While the study is paused, attribution will be determined and assigned and the SMC will be 
notified that a consultation is required.   Given the frequency of visits and the duration of the 
protocol, study device use may continue in unaffected subjects  within a cohort  until a 
recom mendation is provided to  unpause or terminate cohort enrollment  by [CONTACT_4484].  
The SMC , when convened  by [CONTACT_456] , will not only make a recom mendation to unpause 
enrollment or  discontinue dosing in a given cohort, but will also  make  a reccomendation to the 
sponsor for ascending, or descending from Cohort A  in the event safety/tolerability signals are 
observed with the first 24 J/cm2 RD-X19 device . 
A study volunteer may elect to discontinue participation in the trial at any time. Investigative staff 
will ask the volunteer to return for an early termination  evaluation , but they are under no 
obligation to do so. All study subjects must return the RD -X19 device at study termination  and 
study staff must verify that the device serial number matches the study subject to whom it was 
assigned .

 Investigator Decision to Discontinue Subject Use of  Device  
A subject may be removed from the study for the following reasons post initial device use ; 
however, whenever possible the subject should be followed for safety evaluations per protocol:  
• Study non -compliance to protocol requirements that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_257892] -investigator poses an increased risk (e.g., 
missing safety labs) or compromises the validity of the  data.  
• Lost to  follow -up. A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to 
appear for a follow -up assessment. Extensive effort (i.e., generally three documented 
contact [CONTACT_154413], e -mail, etc., made on separate occasions) will be 
made to locat e or recall the subject, followed by a couri ered delivery of study document s 
to the subjects home address  to determine the subject’s health status. These efforts will 
be documented in the subject’s study file.

o Review all pre-study medications , vitamins, supplements,  and 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_154371] [ADDRESS_313331] on the 
appropriate  source document .  The u se of any medications to treat 
some of the COVID -19-related symptoms (e.g., analgesics, 
antipyretics)  should be recorded and  the name [CONTACT_2100], dose, 
dosage form, and date and time(s) of administration should be 
reported.    Antibiotics are not indicated as a treatment for COVID -
19 and prior use of antibiotics  (e.g. tetracycline, azithromycin) 
should be documented accordingly.   Subjects  receiving antibiotics 
for treatme nt of COVID -[ADDRESS_313332] discontinue use prior to study 
enrollment and this information should be documented.  Subjects 
should be informed not to take antibiotics or other medications 
purported to treat COVID -19 (such as hydroxychloroquine or

physiologic parameter may also be repeated if there is a technical problem with the measurement 
caused by [CONTACT_257937], or an inappropriate measuring device  (i.e., inappropriate -sized BP 
cuff).  
A subject may be re -screened if a protocol eligibility criterion that is not met at the initial time of 
screening, will be met by [CONTACT_257938] [ADDRESS_313335] number , provided their number of day s since symptom onset remains ≤[ADDRESS_313336] with a morning baseline visit (before 12 pm), should 
target morning follow -up visits  and subject s with an afternoon baseline visit (after 12 pm) should 
target afternoon follow -up visits .   If a visit must switch from morning to afternoon or vice versa, 
the visit must occur within ± 1 hour of the noon timepoint, e.g, if the previous visit is at 8:00 am 
and the next visit is at 12:45 pm this would be acceptable; if the previous visit is at 11 am and the 
next visit is at 2:00 pm, then this would be co nsidered a deviation.   
Optionally, the sponsor may perform additional genetic sequencing on one or both baseline 
specimens  (saliva or nasopharyngeal)  to obtain prevalence of variants of interest  (VOI)  or variants 
of concern (VOC)  in the study population.   Specific variants to be identified include B.1.1.7 ([LOCATION_006]), 
B.1.351 (South Africa), B.1.427 (CA), B.1.429 (CA), P.1 (Brazil ), and B.1.617.2 (India) , and any 
others that are classified as VOI or VOC during the study.  
A second saliva sample (third biospecimen), will be collected at baseline and on days 8 and 14, 
and at Sponor’s option  shipped to a third party laboratory to evaluate the effects of RD -X19 on

 Definition of Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  (TEAE) 
TEAE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). An TEAE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal clinical laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
COVID -[ADDRESS_313341] 3 days will not be recorded as TEAEs .  
Worsening of disease will be recorded as a clinical outcome measure as outlined in Section 6. 4. 
Any worsening of the eight individual COVID -19 signs and symptoms from baseline (moderate 
or greater) or new signs and symptoms that first occur on or after study day 4  (moderate or 
greater) , as reported on  participant self -assessment daily diary cards  or during clinic visits , will 
be recorded as a TEAE   with attribut ion to COVID -19 disease pathogenesis or the investigational 
device at the discretion of site investigators.   Any COVID -19 related TEAEs will be asses sed 
daily  and considered resolved when the symptom is none (0) or mild (1) on the Diary Card.

All TEAEs will be 
documented regardless of relationship.  
TEAEs will be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
 Solicited Treatment Emergent Adverse  Events  - Reactogenicity  
Solicited TEAEs are anticipated TEAEs for which consistent collection of information is desired. 
Study clinicians will follow and collect resolution information for any reactogenicity symptoms 
that are not resolved during the active study period . 
Solicited TEAEs (i.e., reactogenicity) will be collected by [CONTACT_257946] e-CRF  during the entire course of the study.  
For this study, solicited AEs include : 
• Illumination  site Pain 
• Illumination  site Erythema  
• Illumination  site Edema/Induration  
• Any other pain, redness, swelling or lesion of the oral mucosa  
 Unsolicited Treatment Emergent Adverse  Events  
All TEAEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from 
study staff or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures must 
be recorded on the appropriate source document and e-CRF . 
Unsolicited TEAEs of all severities will be reported during the entire course of the study.

 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event Reporting  
Information on all TEAEs should be recorded on the appropriate source document and e -CRF. 
All clearly related signs, symptoms and results of diagnostic procedures performed because of an 
TEAE should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis. If the TEAE is a clinical 
laboratory abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as 
the syndrome or diagnosis and be described in terms of duration (start and stop date).  
 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined in 21 CFR 312.32 as follows: “An AE is considered serious if, in the view of 
either the participating clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -investigator or the sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening  AE, 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909],  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to  conduct 
normal life  functions,  
• Or a congenital anomaly/birth  defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not immediately  life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . An e xample of such a medical event  would 
be an  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  to 
prevent the development of one of the definitions above.  
“Life -threatening” refers to an TEAE that at occurrence represents an immediate risk of death to 
a subject. An event that may cause death if it occurs in a more severe form is not considered life -
threatening. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257900] E. 
All SAEs, as with any TEAE, will be assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention. 
All SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate AE e-CRF . 
All SAEs will be followed through resolution or stabilization by a study clinician, licensed to 
make medical diagnoses and listed as the participating clinical  site PI [INVESTIGATOR_29353] -
investigator.  
All SAEs will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_257947].  This 
report will include severity, association with the study device , action(s) taken, and outcome.

physician assistants and nurse practitioners.   
 Severity of Treatment Emergent Adverse  Events  
All TEAEs will be assessed for severity, according to the toxicity grading scales provided at 
Appendix 2. 
For TEAEs not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines will be 
used to describe severity.  
• Mild (Grade 1) : Events that are usually transient and may require only minimal or no 
treatment or therapeutic intervention and generally do not interfere with the subject’s 
usual activities of daily  living.  
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living,  causing discomfort 
but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research  subject.  
• Severe  (Grade  3): Events  interrupt  usual  activities  of daily  living,  or significantly  affects  
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Severe events are 
usually  incapacitating.  
 
TEAEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The TEAE is not counted as a separate or new TEAE if at the next clinic visit, the TEAE is 
persistent.  It shall only be recorded as a new TEAE if the adverse event worsens in severity.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of intensity.   The start and stop date of each reported TEAE will be recorded 
on the appropriate e-CRF .  All d evice -related grade 3 TEAEs will be reported to the medical 
monitor / Sponsor CMO within [ADDRESS_313345] assess 
the relationship of the event to the study device  using the following guidelines:  
• Related  – The TEAE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a close temporal  
relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that 
there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the  AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been  established.

 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and  Follow -Up 
For this study:  
Solicited and Unsolicited TEAEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_257949] , beginning after device administration and through day 14 (±2 days) or an early 
termination visit.  
 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event  Reporting  to Study Subjects  
All device -attributed  
TEAEs and SAEs will be reported to participants in the study to better inform them of the 
potential risks vs. benefits of participation.  
 Pregnancy Reporting  
All positive urine pregnancy tests will be reported during screening and at the end of the study. 
Women who screen positive for pregnancy will be encouraged to see their primary health care 
provider for a serological confirmatory test.  
At any study visit, if there is reason to believe that a female subject  of child -bearing potential  may 
have become pregnant, a urine pregnancy test must be performed.  If the result is positive, they 
will be followed per protocol for pregnancy and birth outcomes and referred to an appropriate 
obstetrician.

device will be compared with Sham  based on the Final Cohort . 
10.2  Power and Sample Size:  
The target number of subjects to be randomized initially  is 60 individuals seronegative for SARS -
CoV -2 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_257876]  ([ADDRESS_313351] -X19 treatment arms and 20 subjects 
for Sham control ).  At the sponsors option, the total number of subjects can be increased to enroll  
up to 150 additional  subjects to include all serostatuses  based on adequate safety/tolerability 
observed in the final dose cohort.  As described in Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_313352]  90% power in the modified full analysis  set (mFAS ) population  with the ability to 
detect meaningful changes in SARS -CoV -2 symptom resolution from baseline (Hazard ratio of 
0.[ADDRESS_313353] -X19 and Sham  observed in EB -P12-01). 
10.[ADDRESS_313354]  populations are defined for this study.  
• The Safety/ Full Analysis Set (FAS)  includes all randomized  study subject s who 
received at least one study treatment .  This population will be used for all safety 
analyses , and is also the primary analysis population for efficacy .  Subjects will be 
analyzed based on actual treatment received.  
• The Modified Full Analysis Set (mFAS)  includes all randomized subjects  who 
received treatment  and who test ed negative  for SARS -CoV -2 antibodies at bas eline. 
Subjects will be analyzed based on actual treatment  received.  
• The Per Protocol (PP) Population includes all randomized subjects  in the FAS 
population  who complete the study and did not have a  major  protocol deviation  
(MPD).  The PP population will be used as supportive analysis .  MPDs are those that 
could have interfered with the administration of treatment or the precise evaluation of 
treatment efficacy ( e.g., violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria ).  Subjects who do not 
complete certain key scheduled doses , 100%  (6 out of 6) of doses  in the first [ADDRESS_313355] 75% (11 out of 14) , regardless of the time of enrollment on Day 1,  are major 
protocol deviations .  All MPDs will be listed in the statistical analysis plan and 
identified before the database lock and study unblinding for analysis.

Time to event analyses will use the log-rank test , a Cox Proportional Hazards Regression model , 
and Kaplan -Meier methods.  
In general, missing data will not be imputed with the exception that for the missing viral load 
results post baseline will be imputed using multiple imputation .   
Additional details regarding statistical methods will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary analysis for each of the two primary endpoints will be via an unstratified log -rank 
test based on the Final Cohort in the FAS  population . This analysiswill be  supplemented  with a 
graph ical display and medians derived  by [CONTACT_257951]. Cox proportional hazards 
regression model s (with a single term for treatment)  will be employed to analyze the primary 
efficacy endpoints  to provide a hazard ratio in each case for  the RD-X19 treatment arm relative 
to the  sham  arm.  
In addition, to assess potential impact of subject baseline characteristics to the treatment effect 
estimation the Cox proportional hazards regression will be performed adjusting  for the  following 
set of  covariates:  
• the COVID -19 Composite Severity Score  at baseline defined as the sum of the eight 
individual COVID -19 signs and symptoms severity scores divided by [CONTACT_257952]  
(groupi[INVESTIGATOR_31081]  <1.25, ≥1.25)   
• baseline disease status of mild vs. moderate disease ( subjects meeting entry criteria 
are considered to be mild unless the physical /vital signs  exam ination documents 
clinical signs suggestive of  moderate illnes s) 
• gender  
• age (groupi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] < 50, ≥50) 
• baseline antibody status (positive, negative)  
For the second primary endpoint the term for baseline disease status of mild vs. moderate disease 
will not be included.  
Supportive analyses in each case for the two primary endpoints will be produced for the mFAS 
and the Per Protocol population.  For the mFAS population the Cox proportional hazards 
regression model will not include the covariate  related to baseline antibody status .

Additional details are provided for analysis of  each outcome assessment in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.     Additional details including  on multiplicity  adjustment for the two primary endpoints  will 
be provided  in the Statistical Analysis Plan .  
 
 Safety Analyses  
Summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_257954].  Adverse device effects 
will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  Treatment  Emergent Adverse Events (TE AE), vital signs, and methemoglobin  will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Other safety data including p rior and concomitant 
medications will be listed.  
TEAE s are  any event not present prior to the initiation of the treatments or any event already 
present that worsens in either intensity following exposure to the treatments.  Number and percent 
of subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  Summ aries will be presented 
by [CONTACT_6657], and further by [CONTACT_257955].  In the summaries of incidence rates (frequencies and percentages), severity and 
relationship to treatment, subjects who  report more than one event that are mapped to the same 
preferred term will be counted only once under the strongest severity and relationship, 
accordingly.

 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to an individual agreeing to participate in a 
trial and continuing throughout the individual’s trial participation. Investigators or designated 
research staff will obtain a subject’s informed consent in accordance with the requirements of [ADDRESS_313359]’s 
participation in the trial, and alt ernative treatments and procedures that may be available to the 
subject. The explanation will be organized and presented in lay terminology and language that 
facilitates understanding why one might or might not want to participate.  
Subjects will receive an explanation that they will be compensated for their participation on a per 
visit basis, and medical treatments are available if device -related injury occurs, and, if so, what 
that treatment is, or where further information may be o btained. Subjects will be informed of the 
anticipated financial expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial, as well as any 
anticipated prorated payments, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial. They will be 
informed of w hom to contact (e.g., the participating clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_75534]) for answers 
to any questions relating to the research project. Information will also include the foreseeable 
circumstances and/or reasons under which the subject’s participation in t he trial may be 
terminated. The subjects will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they are free to 
withdraw from the study for any reason at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which 
the subject is otherwise entitled.  
Subjects will be informed that records identifying the subject will be kept confidential, and, to the 
extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or regulations, will not be made publicly available. If

Confidential Information; this Protocol is Confidential and Proprietary to EmitBio Inc  [ADDRESS_313360]’s identity will remain confidential. Subjects will 
be informed, even if identifiers are removed, that information collected from this research and/or 
specimens may be used for secondary research, includin g the sharing of deidentified data.  
Subjects will be informed that the monitor(s), auditors(s), IRB, and Sponsor will be granted direct 
access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of clinical trial procedures and/or 
data without violating the confidentiality of the subj ect, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_122833], and that, by [CONTACT_2960] a written ICF, the subject is authorizing such access.  
ICFs will be IRB -approved, and subjects will be asked to read and review the consent form. 
Subjects must sign the ICF prior to starting any study procedures being done specifically for this 
trial. Once signed, a copy of the ICF will be given to the subject  for their records.  
New information will be communicated by [CONTACT_257956] [INVESTIGATOR_257901]. The informed consent 
document will be updated, and subjects will be re -consented per IRB re quirements, if necessary . 
 Confidentiality and  Privacy  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover clinical information relating 
to subjects, test results of biological specimens and all other information generated during 
participation in the study. No identifiable information concerning subjects in the study will be 
released to any unauthorized third party. Subject confidentiality will be maintained when study 
results are publis hed or discussed in conferences.  
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor  and r epresentatives of the IRB 
may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_257957], including, but not limited to, screening, medical and laboratory results  for the subjects in this 
study. The participating clinical  site will permit access to such records.  
All source records, including electronic data, will be stored in secured systems in accordance with 
institutional policies and federal regulations.  
All study data and research specimens that leave the site (including any electronic transmission 
of data) will be identified only by a coded number that is linked to a subject through a code key 
maintained at the clinical site. Names or readily identifying  information will not be released unless 
strictly required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 Clinical  Monitoring  
Monitoring will be conducted during the conduct of the trial , and will include, but is not limited 
to, source document verification, review of regulatory files, device accountability records, e -

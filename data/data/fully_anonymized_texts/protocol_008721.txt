This modificat ion is considered to be substant ial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council o f the European Unio n 
and in the EU Clinical Trial Regulat ion Article 2, 2 (13).
Overall Ration ale for the Modification:
The primary  rationale for the m odificat ions in this CSP is to increase the sample size, due to 
changes in statistical assumpt ions, to ensure that the study  is adequately  powered to assess the 
primary  and key  secondary  endpoints.

Sample Size 
DeterminationThe estimated study sample size was changed from 
approximately 480 to 677 screened participants. 
The estimated number of participants 
randomised/assigned to the study intervention was 
changed from approximately 288 to 406. 
The estimated number of evaluable participants was 
updated from approximately 288 to 406 (from 144 to 203 
in each arm). Due to changes in 
statistical assumptions, 
the sample size was 
modified to ensure 
adequate power to assess 
the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.

1.1 Synopsis
Protocol Title: A Phase IIa Rando mised, Double Blind, Pl acebo Controlled, Parallel Arm, 
Multi-Centre Study  to Eval uate the Efficacy and Safet y of Mitiperstat (AZD4831), for 
12-24 Weeks, in Patients with Moderate to Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmo nary Disease 
(COPD)
Brief Title: An Efficacy and Safet y Study  of Mitiperstat (AZD4831) (MPO Inhibitor) vs 
Placebo in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe COPD
Regulatory Agency Identifier  Number(s): 
Registry ID
EudraCT 2022-002441-18
IND 161799
Rationale: This study  will eval uate the efficacy  and saf ety of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) 
inhibitor, mit iperstat (AZD4831) in the treatment of moderate to severe COPD. Patients with 
COPD represent a huge unmet medical need: COPD exacerbat ions are associated with 
accelerated decline in lung function, high mortalit y, worsening qualit y of life and 
comorbidi ties, and high heal thcare costs. In addit ion, COPD i s also frequent ly associated with 
other m etabolic or cardiovascular comorbidit ies, which also contribute to impaire d qualit y of 
life and poorer survival. Furthermore, current COPD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which include combinat ions of 
inhaled lo ng-acting beta -adrenoceptor agonist (LABA), long -acting muscarinic agonist 
(LAMA), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and add- on anti -inflam matory  agents, do not 
eliminate symptoms, disabilit y, exacerbat ions, or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270921], and do not significant ly alter the course of COPD.
There i s evidence implicat ing MPO activit y in promot ing lung inflammat ion and inj ury in 
animals exposed to cigarette smoke, and high concentrations of (act ivated) MPO are 
associ ated wi th the progressi on of  COPD in humans. Therefore, this study  and the clinical 
development program for mit iperstat (AZD4831) will evaluate whether treating patients with 
COPD wi th mitiperstat (AZD4831) reduces exacerbat ions, and improves symptoms, qualit y of 
life, lung funct ion, and other clinically -relevant outcom es including co morbidities in pat ients 
with COPD.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 19of 187Objectives and Endpoints
Objectives Estimand Descriptiona
Primary
To evaluate the effect of mitiperstat (AZD4831) 
as compared to placebo on the time to first 
COPDCompEx event in patients with moderate 
to severe COPD.Population: all participants randomised to either 
active or placebo arm.
Endpoint: time to first COPDCompEx event.
Population level -summary m easure: hazard 
ratio.
Strategy for intercurrent events:
Primary estimand: while on treatment –if an 
intercurrent event occurs before first 
COPDCompEx event, the participant will be 
censor ed at the time of intercurrent event.
Supportive estimand: treatment policy (reflects 
ITT principle) –after intercurrent event 
participants remain in the study so that the 
endpoint can be observed. Treatment policy 
strategy used to estimate the efficacy of 
mitiper stat (AZD4831) in ‘real -world’ 
conditions.

bCOPD Exacerbation: a worsening in the participant’s usual COPD symptoms that is beyond normal 
day-to-day variation, is acute in on set, lasts 2 or more days (or less if the worsening is so rapid and 
profound that the treating physician judges that intensification of treatment cannot be delayed), may warrant 
a change in regular medication, and leads to any of the following:
• Use of syst emic corticosteroids for at least 3 days; a single depot injectable dose of corticosteroids will be 
considered equivalent to a 3 -day course of systemic corticosteroids.
• Use of antibiotics to treat COPD exacerbation for at least 3 days.
• An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270923] (defined as an inpatient admission ≥24 hours in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], an 
observation area, the emergency department, or other equivalent healthcare facility depending on the 
country and healthcare system).
• Admission in emergency depart ment o r emergency  room due to COPD for < 24hours requiring intensive 
treatment.
• An epi[INVESTIGATOR_270924].
• Results in death.
Moderate and severe COPD exacerbations are defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Intercurrent events are events occurring after treatment initiation (eg, discontinuation of treatment, switching 
treatment, terminal events such as death) that affect either the measurement or interpretation of the summary 
measure (eg, hazard ratio) associated with the clinical question of interest.

Brief Summary:
The purpose of this study  is to m easure benefit and safet y of orally administered mit iperstat 
(AZD4831) as co mpared to orally administered placebo inparticipants wi th COPD. It is 
hypothesised that mit iperstat (AZD4831) will reduce a irway inflammat ion and t issue damage, 
which coul d potenti ally lead to an improvement in lung funct ion and/or reduce rate of decline 
in lung function.
Study  details include:
The study  durati on will be up to 30 weeks.
The treatment duration will be up to 24 weeks.
Disclosur e Statem ent: This is a parallel -group treatm ent study with2arms that is parti cipant, 
investigator, and sponsor blinded .
Number of Participants: Approximately  677 parti cipants will be screened to achieve 
406randomised/assigned to study  intervent ion and 406 evaluable part icipants.
Parti cipants will be randomised 1:1 to mitiperstat (AZD4831) 5 mg QD or placebo QD.
Randomisat ion will be stratified by [CONTACT_1606] .
Enrolment will be stopped after at least [ADDRESS_330377] not y et com pleted SV5 shoul d 
continue in the study  to com plete 12 weeks of treatment. For these participants SV5 and 
SV7/EDV should be co mbined into one visit. Participants who have already c ompleted 
12weeks of treatment when study enro lment is stopped should attend SV7 /EDV as soon 
as possible, continuing treatment until they do. All participants should attend 
SV8 14 ± 3 days after SV7 /EDV .

Study Arms and Duration:
The ent ire study period is planned to take between 18 and 30 weeks for each individual 
participant : a 4-week screening period, minimum 12 weeks to a maximum 24 weeks of  
dosing, and 2 weeks of  follow-up. The part icipant will  be randomised into ei ther mi tiperstat

Data Monitoring/Other Committees: Yes
Unblinded Review Committee A URC will be set up to perform an administrative IA on 
the primary  efficacy endpoint (time to first COPDCompEx event).
Data Review Committee A DRC will  be set up to conduct periodic safety  moni toring, 
with a focus on skin reactions and pneum onia. The DRC will assess safet y and will have 
access to IAoutcom e data (including all adverse event data). 
Statistical Methods 
The study  is powered using COPDCo mpEx, a composite endpo int used to predict 
treatm ent effect on m oderate and severe exacerbat ions of COPD. COPDCompEx captures 
clinically relevant deteriorations (diary  events [eg, PEF], reliever use, symptoms, 
exacerbation events, and study  dropouts resul ting from  a lack of efficacy ) that fulfil 
specific criteria in terms o f changes fro m baseline and deteriora tion over [ADDRESS_330379] treatment effects on exacerbations at 6 to 12 months. 
A total o f [ADDRESS_330380] COPDCompEx events (estimated to require 203 participants per arm)
will provide 80% power at the two -sided 10% level o f statistical significance to detect a 
hazard ratio of 0.70 in the mit iperstat (AZD4831) [ADDRESS_330381] 
COPDCo mpEx event risk of 55% assumed in the placebo arm (constant over the cou rse 
of the study ).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 26of 187The primary  object ive is to evaluate the effect of mit iperstat (AZD4831) as compared to 
placebo on the time to first COPDCompEx event in participants with moderate to severe 
COPD. The primary  endpoint will be time to first COPDCo mpEx event. A logrank test 
and Cox’s proportional hazards model will be used to analyse the time to first 
COPDCo mpEx event data. 
A similar approach to that described for the primary efficacy endpo int will be applied to the 
secondary  endpoint: time to first exacerbat ion.
Other secon dary assessments of efficacy  include: time to fi rst COPD exacerbat ion event, 
post-BD FEV1 at Week 12 compared to Week 1, MPO l evel and activit y in sputum at 
Week 12 com pared to baseline, and symptom  scores.
Plasma concentrations will be summarised by  [CONTACT_271065]. 
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) data for those participants with addit ional PK sampling at Visit 
SV5 will be used to derive plasma PK parameters such as maximum concentration (C max) 
and time to reach maximum concentration (t max).
An administrative IA will be conducted by  [CONTACT_271062] 136 (70% of the required 194) 
first COPDCom pEx events have occurred. It will allow an early  assessment of efficacy 
for mitiperstat (AZD4831) used for fu rther develo pment of this drug programme, based 
on the predict ive probabilit y of success, according to the decisio n framework and safet y. 
No formal stati stical test will be conducted, and no alpha will be spent at the IA.

Mitiperstat (AZD4831) -D6582C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 42of 1872 INTRODUCTION
Mitiperstat (AZD4831) is a potent, selective, irreversible, and dose -dependent inhibitor of 
MPO that is being developed for once daily treatment of COPD.
2.1 Study Rationale
This study  will evaluate the efficacy and safet y of the MPO inhibitor mit iperstat (AZD4831) 
in the treatment of moderate to severe COPD. Patients with COPD represent a huge unmet 
medical need: COPD exacerbat ions are associated with accelerated decline in l ung f unction, 
high m ortali ty, worsening quality of life and co morbidities, and high heal thcare costs. In 
addition, COPD i s also frequent ly associ ated wi th other m etabo lic or cardiovascular 
comorbidi ties, which also contribute to impaired qualit y of life an d poorer survival. 
Furtherm ore, current COPD therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which include combinat ions of inhaled LABA, LAMA, 
and ICS, and add- on anti -inflammatory  agents, do not eliminate symptoms, disabilit y, 
exacerbations, or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270934] C OPD, and do not significant ly 
alter the course of COPD.
Preclinical smoke exposed animal models have shown that inhibit ion of MPO can halt the 
progression of emphysema and small airways remodelling (Churg et al 2012 ). In pati ents wi th 
COPD, higher sputum MPO is associated with increased risk of subsequent exacerbat ion of 
COPD, whilst a meta -analysis showed that sputum MPO levels are higher during 
exacerbation, compared to stable COPD. Persist ing elevat ion of MPO during an exacerbat ion 
is associated with reduced response to therapy  and m ore prol onged symptom s 
(Zhuet al 2014) . Therefore, this study  and the clinical development program for mit iperstat 
(AZD4831) will evaluate whether treating patients with COPD wit h mitiperstat (AZD4831) 
reduces exacerbat ions, and improves symptoms, qualit y of life, lung f unction, and other 
clinically relevant outcom es including comorbidities in patients with COPD.

pulmo nary disease is now the thi rd most commo n cause of death worldwide ( WHO 2021 ). It 
is also associated with high morbidit y and com orbidi ty and is current ly the fift h leading cause 
of DAL Ys worl dwide. Chron ic obstructive pulmo nary disease is also associated with an 
enorm ous economic burden, costing ~$[ADDRESS_330428] healt hcare costs in the 
[LOCATION_003]  alone (Adelo yeetal2015)
.
Chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease i s caused by  a com plex interact ion between genet ics, 
early  life, and ongoing environmental exposure. The major environmental risk factor is

response in the lung that is associated with increased lung levels o f oxidative stress and 
proteoly tic injury  leading to vari ous pathol ogic changes in the lung that are heterogeneously 
expressed by  [CONTACT_1962]. Patients with COP D can have varying combinat ions of destruction of 
the alveo lar walls (or emphysema), small airway remodelling, and/or changes in the large 
airway (which manifests clinically  as a f requent productive cough characterist ic of the chronic 
bronchit is phenoty pe)that vary  in severi ty between patients. The course of COPD can be 
punctuated by  [CONTACT_271067] a sustained worsening of the 
patient’s condi tion from the stable state, and bey ond norm al day -to-day variations, that is 
acute in onset and necessitates a change in regular medicat ion in a pat ient with underlying 
COPD. The init ial exacerbat ion leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270935] a pat ient with COPD is 
considered a seminal event for the patient as it heralds the onset of subsequent exac erbat ions 
that increase in frequency , and 50% of pat ients die within 3.6 y ears of thei r initial 
exacerbation ( Suissa et al 2012).
In addit ion, COPD i s also frequent ly associ ated with other metabolic or cardiovascular 
comorbidi ties, which also contribute to impaired qualit y of life and poorer survival. There is 
considerable overlap in the patterns of systemic vascular inflammat ion seen in COPD and that 
of advancing athero sclerotic disease and heart failure.
For these reasons, patients with COPD represent a huge unmet medical need.
Mitiperstat (AZD4831) is a potent, select ive, irreversible, and dose -dependent inhibitor of 
MPO. My eloperoxidase is a heme -contai ning enzyme tha t is stored wi thin the granules of 
neutrophils. Myeloperoxidase catalyses the oxidat ion of halide ions by [CONTACT_271068]. Under normal 
condi tions, MPO and the hypohalous acids that it generates within neutrophil granules make 
cruci al contribut ions to killing of phagocy tosed bacteri a. However, during excessive 
inflammat ion, neutrophil granule contents are extruded, and the extracellular hypohalous acids 
generated by  [CONTACT_271069] i nflammat ion and injure the lung. Delivering an MPO 
inhibitor to guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_270936] [ADDRESS_330429]  fibrosis in the animals (Churg et al 2012 ) indicat ing that MPO activit y 
contributes significant ly to the pathogenesis of COPD -like disease in animals. MPO has also 
been linked to human COPD as MPO levels in sputum are elevated in patients with COPD 
versus controls and increase further during exacerbations ( Zhuet al 2014). In addi tion, 
extracell ular MPO serum  levels are indirect ly related to rate of decline in FEV1 
(Park etal2013). Finally , preliminary results for mit iperstat (AZD4831) in related 
cardi ovascul ar studi es have shown an acceptable benefit/risk profile o f this compound and 
suggest potential benefits in co morbid condit ions commo nly associated wi th COPD. Thus, the 
clinical development program for mit iperstat (AZD4831) will evaluate whether treating

Identified risk
Maculopapular rash Generalised maculopapular rash has 
been observed in healthy volunteers in completed global SAD/MAD studies at single doses of [ADDRESS_330430] dose. In an MAD study 
in healthy Japanese and Chinese participants, maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1 has been reported in one  participant (of 6) on 5 mg mitiperstat (AZD4831); maculopapular rash Grade 2 in 3  participants (of 6) on 10 mg mitiperstat (AZD4831), and maculopapular rash Grade 2 in 1 
 participant (of 6) on 5 mg 
mitiperstat (AZD4831).
One of 27 patients in the HfpEF study 
had generalised maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 3 at 5 mg mitiperstat(AZD4831) occurring 5 days after up-titration from 2.5 to 5 mg.The DRC will evaluate all cases of 
skin reaction/rash.
The protocol clearly states the 
actions that have to be taken by [CONTACT_093], in case of maculopapular rash (see Appendix B, B 5) .

Potential risks
Host defence impairment —
infections (including 
pneumonia)The MPO in neutrophils generates ROS 
that kill microorganisms so there is a 
theoretical risk that treatment with an 
MPO inhibitor could impair 
host-defence mechanisms. 
Kutter et al [ADDRESS_330431] 
risk factor for development of 
pneumonia (Cavallazzi and Ramirez 
2020).
Humans with total or partial MPO 
deficiency generally do not have an 
increased susceptibility to infections but 
the incidence of Candida infections may 
be increased especially in patients with 
diabetes. Overall, invasive fungal 
infections such as candidaemia, 
disseminated infection, pneumonia, 
osteomyelitis, meningitis or liver abscess 
occur in fewer than 5% of 
MPO -deficient individuals 
(Antachopoulos 2010 ). 
An increased incidence of infection has 
not been seen with mitiperstat
(AZD4831) in healthy 
volunteers/clinical study participants.In order to adequately assess and 
characterise the risk of pneumonia 
in participants in a nonbiased 
manner, the DRC will review all 
AEs reported as pneumonia to 
ensure appropriate pre -defined an d 
clinically consistent pneumonia 
criteria are met. 
Serious i nfections, including 
pneumonia, to be considered 
AESI .
Thyroid peroxidase 
inhibition (hypothyroidism)In the preclinical safety studies in rats 
and dogs, inhibition of thyroid 
peroxidase caused reversible TSH 
increase, decreases in T4 and thyroid 
follicular cell hypertrophy. These effects 
have also been observed preclinically 
and clinically with other compounds of 
the same class and the magnitude of this 
effect is related to the degree of 
select ivity between MPO and TPO. 
Clinically relevant changes in thyroid 
parameters (TSH, T3, T4) have not been Monitoring thyroid
parameters (TSH, T3, free T4).

Blood pressure reduction 
and heart rate increaseIn secondary pharmacology studies, 
mitiperstat (AZD4831) was shown to be 
an inhibito r of α1A adrenoceptors. 
Inhibitio n of this receptor is known to 
decrease BP and cause reflex 
tachycardia. Clinically relevant changes 
in BP/HR have not been seen in clinical 
study participants on mitiperstat 
(AZD4831).Monitoring vital signs including 
orthostatic hypotension.
Anae mia and
inflammationOne high -dose (150 mg/kg/day) dog 
developed severe clinical symptoms on 
Day 15 of dosing and did not recover 
sufficiently to allow further dosing. The 
dog was euthanised on Day 22. 
Haematology showed anaemia and 
inflammation. The cause of these 
findings is unknown. No other dogs in 
any studies with mitiperstat (AZD4831) 
showed similar symptoms or 
haematological changes. Clinically 
relevant haematological changes have 
not been seen in healthy 
volunteers/clinical study participants 
with m itiperstat (AZD4831).Routine haematology

the mitiperstat (AZD4831) molecule and 
is known liability for antithyroid drugs

2.3.2 Benefit Assess ment
Potential reduced hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]
A reduced hospi [INVESTIGATOR_270937] a major potential benefit o f the mit iperstat 
(AZD4831) treatment. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270938] a major challenge for all pat ients and many  times 
patients suffer from life -threatening events, while being in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].
Potential de crease in rate of exacerbations
Acute exacerbat ions of COPD are responsible for much of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]-associ ated 
morbidity and m ortali ty from COPD ( Barne set al 2015). It has been suggested that the 
mortalit y increases with the frequency of severe exacerbat ions (Soler-Cataluña et al 2005).

impairment in qualit y of life. By  [CONTACT_271070] l ung f unction with mitiperstat (AZD48 31) 
treatm ent, pati ents are expected to obtain a beneficial effect in their qualit y of life. It will be 
assessed in the Phase IIa study  by [CONTACT_271071] T for patients wi th COPD. Life expectancy is 
significant ly limited in many  patients and increased qualit y of life has a m ajor rol e in potenti al 
benefits.
Potential impr oved symptom contr ol
Symptom  control  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_271072], EXACT , and cough frequency 
measurement. Improving BCSS and EXACT scores are considered to represent enhancement 
patients ’ daily life activi ties and will affect the qualit y of life.
Potential impr oved lung function
It is hypothesised that mit iperstat (AZD4831) will reduce airway  inflammat ion and t issue 
damage. This could potentially lead to an improvement in lung funct ion and/or reduce rate of 
decline in lung funct ion. It woul d be of great clinical importance to prevent further decrease of 
lung funct ion, especially  in pat ients with severe COPD.
2.3.3 Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion
COPD i s a debilitat ing disease with high mortalit y thathas a high unmet medical need. 
Therefore, it would be desirable to develop new anti -inflammatory  treatm ents that affect 
chronic symptoms and disease progression in COPD. Exacerbat ions are major contributors to 
the increased rates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270940] y in patients with COPD. T wo of the most 
important potential benefit s are therefore decreasing the rate of exacerbat ions and reducing 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913]. Further, it is envisaged that mit iperstat (AZD4831) will improve symptom 
control  and lung funct ion.As a result of these potent ial benefit s, pati ents’ qualit y of life will 
likely  be improved. The key  risks include m aculopapul ar rash and the potential risks host 
defence impairment -infect ions (including pneumo nia)and thyroid peroxidase inhibit ion 
(hypoth yroidism). Skin reactions (including maculopapular rash) and serious infections 
including pneumonia are AESIs; skin reactions and pneumo nia will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_271073]. Given the available data and taking into account both the severit y of COPD an d that 
the pati ents to be included in the planned Phase IIa study  have an advanced disease, it is 
considered that potential benefits outweigh the risks.

Clinical Stud y Protocol -5.0 [COMPANY_008]
Mitiperstat (AZD4831) -D6582C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 58of 1874.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
This Phase IIa study  has 2 treatm ent arm s (mi tiperstat [AZD4831] and pl acebo) to allow the 
efficacy and safet y of mitiperstat (AZD4831) to be assessed. Participants will remain on their 
SoC treatment (triple or dual therapy ) during the study .
A placebo controlled, double -blind design has been chosen to limit the occurrence of
conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of the clinical study  arising 
from the influence that the knowledge of treatment may  have on the recrui tment and 
allocat ion of participants. It is considered the optimal approach according t o ICH E9 
“Statistical principles in clinical studies ” (ICH 1998 ). The inclusio n of a placebo arm is also 
recommended by  [CONTACT_271080]/CHMP/483572/2012 “Clinical invest igation o f 
medicinal products in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease (COPD) ” (EMA 
2012) f or drugs to be used as add- on therapy , providing that all part icipants receive optimised 
background therapy; participants i n both groups will remain on SoC inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (triple 
inhaled therapy  [ICS + LABA + LAMA] or ICS + LABA  dual  therapy or LABA +LAMA  
dual therapy  for partici pants who are deem ed unsui table f or ICS).
The primary  endpoint, time to COPDCompEx event, is a novel , surrogate, com posite endpoint 
that captures clinically  relevant deteri orations (diary  events [eg, PEF], reliever use, symptoms, 
exacerbation events, and study  dropouts resul ting from  a lack of efficacy) that fulfil specific 
criteria in term s of chan ges f rom baseline and deteri oration over [ADDRESS_330444] 
treatm ent effects on exacerbat ions at 6 to 12 months (Vogelmeier et
al2020). 
The parti cipants ant icipated to be most likely to benefit from mit iperstat (AZD4831) treatment 
are those at high risk o f exacerbations. Therefore, participants will be at high risk of 
exacerbations a s defined by  [CONTACT_81677]
 4.1.
The study  is event -driven: once at l east [ADDRESS_330445] occurred, 
enrolment will stop (see Section 7.1.4 ).
The study  design includes several outcome assessments that will be performed remotely  by 
[CONTACT_4317]. The purpose of this is to enable more frequent measu rement and to minimise the 
burden of attending on- site visi ts. Several of these measurements will undergo further 
validat ion during the course of the study  to ensure equivalence with site -based assessments 
where appropriate.

Their input and advice will continue during the course of the study setup, providing further 
feedback and perspectives on protocol implementation.
In addition, a wider group of volunteer patients will be engaged to pi[INVESTIGATOR_270947] h devices prior to study initiation.
4.3 Justification for Dose
The dose selection is based on target engagement (MPO inhibition) data from the Phase I 
MAD study (D6580C00004), the Phase IIa study (D6580C00003), and data from the MAD study in Japanese and Chinese healthy pa rticipants (Study D6580C00008). One dose level is 
being proposed (5 mg) based on expected efficacy and safety. The 5 mg dose is predicted to be a clinically relevant dose in COPD, resulting in approximately 56% MPO inhibition, based on PK/PD data from the Phase I and Phase II studies.
Four Phase I clinical studies have been completed in which a total of [ADDRESS_330447] 
been exposed to mitiperstat (AZD4831) at doses 5 to 405 mg as single doses and 53 healthy subjects (including 24 Japanese and Chinese participants) at doses 2.5 to 45 mg as multiple doses. 
In these healthy subjects, mitiperstat (AZD4831) was generally well tolerated with the 
exception of generalised maculopapular rash seen around [ADDRESS_330448] dose. Maculopapular rash CTCAE Grade 1 was re ported in 1 of 6  participants on 5 mg 
mitiperstat (AZD4831); Grade 2 maculopapular rash was reported in 1 of 6  participants on 5 mg mitiperstat (AZD4831). 
A Phase IIa study in participants with HfpEF was prematurely terminated during the 
COVID-19 pandemic after meeting pre-defined target engagement, saf ety, and tolerability 
criteria (Study D6580C00003). One of 27 participants receiving 5 mg mitiperstat (AZD4831) was discontinued from study treatment due to CTCAE Grade 3 generalised maculopapular rash.
4.4 End-of-Study Definition
For the purpose of Clinical Trial Transparency (CTT)  the definition of the end of the study 
differs under FDA and EU regulatory requirements:
European Union requirements define study comple tion as the last visit of the last subject for 
any protocol related activity.
Food and Drug Administration requirements  defines two completion dates:[COMPANY_003]

whether the clinical study  concluded according to the pre -specified protocol or was 
terminated. In the case of clinical studies with more than one primary outcome measure with 
different complet ion dates, this term refers to the date on which data collect ion is completed 
for all of the primary outcomes.
Study  Com pletion Date –the date the final part icipant is examined or receives an intervent ion

6.2 Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Accountability
The invest igator or designee (eg, pharmacist or study coordinator) must confirm 
appropriate condit ions (eg, temperatu re) have been maintained during transit for all study  
intervent ion received at the site and throughout the entire study  until authorisat ion is 
provi ded for on -site destructi on or rem oval of the IMP, reflect ing complet ion of the study . 
In the event of a tem perature excursio n detected at any time during the study , sites will 
follow the reporting procedures for notifying [COMPANY_008] (or designated party ); release 
of IMP for clinical use can only  occur once the event has been reviewed and approval is 
provi ded b y [COMPANY_008] (or designated party ).
Only participants rando mised in the study may receive study intervent ion, and only  
authori sed site staff may supply  or administer study  intervent ion. All study  intervent ion 
must be stored in a secure, environmentally co ntrolled, and mo nitored (m anual  or

6.4 Blinding
The study  will be blinded to both parti cipants and investigators/site staff as well as to 
[COMPANY_008] staff. W ith the format ion of the URC and DRC (see Appendix A 5) the study  will 
beco me unblinded to the [COMPANY_008] staff assigned to these committees (including those with 
clinical, medical, statist ical, and programming expertise) who will form a firewalled URC for 
administrative purposes and wi ll all be independent from  the study  team  (see Appendix  A
5). 
The URC will be responsible for conducting the administrative IA  whereas the DRC will be 
responsible for safet y monitoring.
The rando misat ion list should be sent to the personnel analysing t he PK samples. 
Pharmacokinet ic samples will be analysed by [CONTACT_271094], as referenced in Sect ion 8.5.[ADDRESS_330465] been made and documented.
The IR T/RTSM will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an 
emergency , in which the knowl edge of the specific blinded study  interventi on will  affect the 
immediate management of the participant ’s condi tion (eg, antidote available), the invest igator 
has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a participant ’s intervent ion 
assignment is warranted. Participant safet y must always be the first considerat ion in making 
such a determination. If a participant ’s intervent ion assignment is unblinded, [COMPANY_008]
must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.

any AEs unless consent is withdrawn fro m further study  participati on, the parti cipant is l ost to 
follow-up, or the participant is enro lled in another clinical study .
Parti cipants discontinuing study  intervent ion before SV7 should attend the study  site for SV7 
assessments (as an early treatment discont inuat ion visit), then attend for SV8 assessments 
14 (± 3) days later . In the event a participant is permanent ly discont inued fro m further receipt 
of study  intervent ion, it should be recorded in the IR T/RTMS.
Note that discontinuation fro m study  intervent ion is notthe same thing as a discont inuation or 
withdrawal  from the study  (see Secti on7.2).
If study  intervent ion is permanently discont inued, the participant should, if at all possible, 
remain in the study . See the SoA  (Table1) for data to be collected at the time of

If the participant develops a rash or skin reaction that is not considered a maculopap ular rash, 
but is considered to be an SAE, the participant must be permanently discont inued fro m the 
study  interventi on and [COMPANY_008] medical staff should be informed.
If the participant develops a generalised rash or skin reaction that is not considered a 
maculopapular rash or SAE, the participant may continue dosing if the generalised rash/skin

In the event that a participant develops symptoms suggest ive of COVID -[ADDRESS_330472]/antigen test or 
molecular test. If the rapid screening test or PCR test confirms COVID -19 infection, the study  
intervent ion should be immediately discont inued on a temporary  basis, unless any  permanent 
discontinuat ion criteria are m et (Secti on 7.1). After discont inuat ion of study  intervent ion, any 
appropriate treatment is allowed if condit ions presented in Section 6.9are m et.
In the event that a participant develops symptoms suggest ive of pneumo nia, the participant 
shoul d undergo confirmatory  chest x -ray and appropri ate bl ood testing (eg, hsCRP , 
complete/full  blood coun t, procalcitonin as deemed appropriate by  [CONTACT_3170]) as soon as 
possible. If chest x- ray confi rms the presence of conso lidation and clinical markers are 
consistent with acute infection, the study  intervention should be immediately  discontinued on 
a tem porary  basis, unless any permanent discont inuation crite ria are m et (Secti on 7.1). After 
discontinuat ion of study  interventi on, any appropriate treatment is allowed if condit ions 
presented in Section 6.9are m et.
In cases of ‘unconfi rmed pneum onia’, if the participant is not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270964]/or does not 
have a chest x -ray confirming di agnosis of pneumoni a, thi s shoul d generally  beconsidered an

study  interventi on.
In case of serious infect ion, the study  intervent ion should be immediately discont inued on a

Breathl essness, Cough and Sputum Scale (B CSS)
The BCSS is a 3- item quest ionnaire rating breathlessness, sputum, and cough on a 5 -point 
Likert scale from  0 (no symptom s) to 4 (severe symptoms) ( Leidy etal2003) . Item scores can 
be reported as domains scores and are summed to yield a total score. The BCSS will be 
captured each evening via the e -Diary  over the period indicated in the SoA  (Table1). The 
recall period for the BCSS is “today ”. 
Cough Vi sual Analogue Scale (Cough VAS)
Parti cipants will be asked to complete a cough severit y VAS (100- point linear scale marked 
with a hori zontal  or verti cal line by [CONTACT_2299], with 0 representing ‘‘no cough ’’ and 
100represent ing “worst cough ”) measuring subjective assessment by  [CONTACT_271106] 24 hours for severit y of cough symptoms ( Smithet al 2006). The Cough V AS will be 
completed each morning in the e -Diary  over the peri od indicated in the SoA  (Table1). The 
Cough V AS is presented in Appendix I.
8.2.[ADDRESS_330482] 
The CA T is designed to measure how COPD impacts on a participant ’s daily  life and how this 
might change over time ( Jones et
al2009). It consists of [ADDRESS_330483] on qualit y of life (such as normal act ivity and 
sleep). Each que stion is perform ed on a 5 -point Likert scale fro m 0 (no symptoms/no impact) 
to 5 (severe symptoms/impact). The CA T will be completed by  [CONTACT_271107] -site visi ts

When evaluat ing orthostatic vital signs, any symptoms of dizziness or light headedness should 
be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF . At Visit SV3, if orthostatic hypotension is confirmed 
pre-dose and post -dose, the orthostatic hypotension AE should be reported twice (pre -dose and

≥ 20 mmHg systolic or 
≥ 10 mmHg diastolic Repeat the BP measurements (supi[INVESTIGATOR_135456]) up to 2 additional 
times, unless orthostatic hypotension is present in association with 
symptoms related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals: in such a case 
the test does not need to be repeated and the orthostatic hypotension AE 
and sy mptoms related to the measurement of orthostatic vitals AE should 
be reported based on a single sequence.
If either the 1 -minute or 3 -minute standing BP meets the orthostatic 
(postural) hypotension criteria, then the sequence is considered indicative 
of orthostatic hypotension. 
If 2 of 2 or 2 of 3 sequences are positive, then orthostatic hypotension is 
confirmed, and an AE of orthostatic hypotension will be reported. 
AE = adverse event; BP = blood pressure.
For parti cipants wi th orthostati c hypotensio n, individualised treatment should be prescribed at 
the invest igator ’s discretion fo llowing l ocal guidelines, including pharmacological (eg, down 
titration of  nitrates) or non -pharmaco logical (eg, hydrat ion) treatm ents.
8.3.3 Electrocardiograms
12-lead ECG will be performed in -clinic at timepoints as specified in the SoA  (Table1).
Single 12 -lead ECG (standard ECG with a paper speed of 25 to 50 mm/second covering at 
least 6 sequen tial beats) will be obtained after the participant has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_271008] l east 5 minutes, at the visit s outlined in the SoA  (Table1). An ECG machine 
that autom atically  calculates the heart rate and RR interval and measures PR, QRS, QT , and 
QTcF (Fridericia) intervals will be used. Interpretation of the clinical safet y ECG findings will 
be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_271114] .
Electrocardiogram assessments are to be collected using equipment supplied by [CONTACT_1275] .
8.3.4 Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples for determinat ion of clinical chemistry , haematol ogy, coagul ation,

If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, a naemia versus low haemoglo bin value). 
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE unless unequivocally 
related to the disease under study .
The results from the protocol mandated laboratory  tests and vital signs will be summarised in

The fo llowing events are defined as AESI for mit iperstat (AZD4831) in this study :
Skin reactions, including maculopapular rash
To ensure that data are collected sy stem atically , any  skin reacti on will  be recorded on a special 
eCRF page. All skin react ions should be recorded in the eCRF as an AE or SAE. If the rash is 
considered maculopapular, it will be evaluated using CTCAE Grades 1 to 3 for maculopapular 
rash; if not considered maculopapular, severit y will be captured as mild/moderate/severe, 
along wi th data el ement com ponents ge nerally used for CTCAE grading o f other skin 
reacti ons, given that CTCAE grading is specific to the particular ty pe of  skin lesi on. For all  
rashes, various aspects of the rash will be documented, including start/end date, morpho logy 
of lesions (maculopapul ar vs other m orphol ogies), BSA  impacted, anatomical site(s), 
symptoms, effect on participant (including ADL  impacted), concomitant medicat ions, 
medicat ion administered, and specific rash diagnosis, if available. Photos (overview and 
detailed) should be tak en. Pl ease refer to Appendix B, B [ADDRESS_330500] ion has developed at any  time point during the study . Parti cipants will be 
recommended to make an acceptable qualit y self-photo of skin affected with rash/skin 
reacti on.
Parti cipants who devel op skin react ions, including rash, will be asked to return to the clinic for 
an addit ional visit that will  include a full physical examinat ion and blood samples for safet y, 
hsCRP , and PK. If a parti cipant i s discont inued from invest igational product and proceeds to 
the EDV (SV7 /EDV ; see Table1
), an exploratory  biomarker sam ple and bl ood and urine 
samples for exploratory  metabo lite analysis will also be collected. It is suggested to start 
treatm ent for maculopapular rash, per l ocal standard treatm ent gui delines (which may include, 
but not be limited to, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_271009]/or oral ant ihistamine). The treatment should be 
individualised per participant and based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Upon PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], a clinical 
derm atologist can be consulted, and a skin biopsy considered. The participant can be provided 
with a treatm ent for the skin rash, according to clinical management standard. Blood samples 
shoul d be drawn pri or to treatm ent, if possible, and without delaying treatment.
Serious infect ions, includ ing pneumo nia
Local  laboratory  testing for microorganisms per local guidelines is requested for serious 
infect ions (those that meet SAE criteria) and result s docum ented. Any imaging reports and 
scans should be uploaded to the Medidata imaging portal and in cluded in source documents.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 118of 187Appendix BAdverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Reco rding, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
B [ADDRESS_330522] a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether consid ered rel ated to the 
medicinal product. 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervent ion has been administered.
B 2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is an AE occurring during any  study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, 
follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -patient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72916] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty. 
Is a congenital ano maly or bi rth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the participant or may require medical 
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events for malignant tumours reported during a study  shoul d generally be assessed 
as SAEs . If no other seri ousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medi cal Event ’ criterion shoul d 
be used. In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should 
be applied to clarify that the malignant tumour event should be assessed and reported as a 
non-SAE . For example, if the tumour is included as medical history  and progression occurs 
during the study , but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumour, the AE m ay not fulfil the attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumour as an AE is valid and should occur . Also, 
some ty pes of  malignant tum ours, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913], may be assessed as non -serious; examples in adult s include 
Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy .
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 [COMPANY_008]
Mitiperstat (AZD4831) -D6582C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 119of 187Life-threatening
‘Life-threatening ’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death fro m the AE as i t
occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the medicinal product would result in 
the participant ’s death. ‘Life-threatening ’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more 
severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepat ic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271011], although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the participant was enro lled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteriorate in an unexpected 
way during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientifi c judgement shoul d be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the participant or m ay 
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. 
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with 
N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913]
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
Intensity Rating Scale:
Mild (awareness of sign or symptom , but easily tolerated)
Moderate (di scomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)
Severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform  norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severi ty is a measure of

Mitiperstat (AZD4831) -D6582C00001
CONFIDENTIAL AND PRO PRIETARY 120of 187intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by [CONTACT_73010] B 2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be cons idered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Appendix
 B 2.
B3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When assessing causalit y consider the fo llowing factors when deciding if there is a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the 
suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_122570]?
No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_73011], other drugs, other host, or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE re occur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a 
rechallenge .

B 4 Medication Error, Drug Abuse, and Drug Misuse
Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or m istake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  intervent ion that either causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process r elated 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error: 
Occurred
Was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route or wrong site of administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IRT/RTSM errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTSM -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (w ill be captured as an overdose)

Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error .
Drug Abuse
For the purpose of this study , drug abuse is defined as the persistent or sporadic intent ional, 
non-therapeut ic excessive use of IMP or [COMPANY_008] NIMP for a perceived reward or desired 
non-therapeut ic effect.
Any events of drug abuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forward ed to 
the Data Entry  Site (DES) using the Drug Abuse Report Form . This form should be used both 
if the drug abuse happened in a study  parti cipant or if the drug abuse regards a person not 
enrolled in the study  (such as a relative of the study  parti cipant).
Examples of drug abuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent of getting a perceived reward (by [CONTACT_244988] 
a person not enrolled in the study )
The drug in the form o f a tabl et is crushed and injected or snorted with the intent of 
getting high
Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intent ional and inappropriate use (by  a study parti cipant) of IMP or 
[COMPANY_008] NIMP for medicinal purposes outside of the authorised product informat ion, or 
for unauthorised IMPs or AstraZen eca NIMPs , outsi de the intended use as specified in the 
protocol  and includes deliberate administration of the product by  [CONTACT_244972].
Events of drug misuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the DES using the Drug Mi suse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug 
misuse happened in a study  parti cipant or if the drug misuse regards a person not enrolled in 
the study  (such as a rel ative of the study part icipant).
Examples of drug misuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent ion to cause an effect in another person
The drug is so ld to other people for recreational purposes
The drug is used to facilitate assault in another person
The drug is deliberately administered by [CONTACT_271128] -5.0 [COMPANY_008]

reported as AEs or SAEs.
If the rash is consi dered m aculopapular, it will be evaluated using CTCAE Grades 1 to 3 for 
maculopapular rash; if not considered maculopapular, severit y will be captured as 
mild/moderate/severe, along wit h data element components generally used for CTCAE 
grading of other ski n reactions, given that CTCAE grading is specific to the particular ty pe of 
skin lesio n. For all rashes, various aspects of the rash will be documented, including start/end 
date, m orphol ogy of lesions (maculopapular vs other m orphol ogies), BSA  impacted, 
anatomical site(s), symptoms, effect on participant (including ADL  impacted), concomitant 
medicat ions, medicat ion administered, and specific rash diagnosis, if available. 
If maculopapular rash Grade 1, 2, or [ADDRESS_330524] be permanently discont inued fro m the 
study  interventi on and [COMPANY_008] medical staff should be informed.
If the participant develops a generalised rash or skin reaction that is not considered a 
maculopapular rash or SAE, the participant may continue dosing if the generalised rash/skin 
reaction occurs fo llowing the init iation o f another COPD therapy  (eg, antibiot ics), and in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator the rash/skin react ion is more likely  to have been as a result of this 
COPD therapy . The suspect COPD therapy  must be stopped and the parti cipant m ust be 
monitored by  [CONTACT_271097] a daily basis unt il the rash/skin react ion has reso lved. If, in the

beco mes maculopapular in appearance despi[INVESTIGATOR_271012] , the 
participant m ust perm anent ly discont inue the study medicat ion. Also, if the part icipant 
develops a generalised rash or skin react ion in the absence of alternat ive suspect COPD 
medicat ions, the participant must perm anent ly discontinue the study  medicat ion. [COMPANY_008]

the EDV (SV7 /EDV ; see Table1), an exploratory  biomarker sam ple and bl ood and urine 
samples for exploratory  metabo lite analysis will also be collected. It is suggested to start 
treatm ent for maculopapular rash, per l ocal standard treatm ent gui delines (which may include 
but not be limited to a topi[INVESTIGATOR_271009]/or oral ant ihistamine). 
The treatment should be individualise d per parti cipant and based on PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. Upon PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_271013], a clinical dermatologist can be consulted, and a skin biopsy  considered. The 
participant can be provided with a treatment for the skin rash, according to clinical 
management standard. Blood samples shoul d be drawn pri or to treatm ent, if possible, and 
without delaying treatm ent. 
The invest igator should make qualit y photo(s) of the participant ’s skin affected with rash 
using the Medidata imaging applicat ion, that will allow the evaluat ion of r ash according to the 
guidance given in this sect ion.

and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
E 1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to i dentify and appropriately 
report potential Hy ’s Law cases and Hy ’s Law cases. It i s not intended to be a comprehensive 
guide to the management of elevat ed liver biochemistries. 
During the study  the investi gator will remain vigilant for increases in liver biochemistry . The 
investigator is responsible for determining whether a participant meets potential Hy ’s Law 
criteria at any  point during the study .
Allsources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of potenti al Hy’s Law and 
Hy’s Law events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other visi ts 
including central and all local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected out side of the study 
visits; for example, potential Hy’s Law criteria could be m et by  [CONTACT_96724] a 
central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL  from a local laboratory . 
The invest igator will also review AE data (for example, for AEs that may indicate ele vations 
in liver bio chemistry ) for possible potenti al Hy’s Law events.
The invest igator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing potential Hy’ s Law cri teria to agree whether Hy ’s 
Law cri teria are m et. Hy ’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the 
elevations in liver biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_86184]. 
The invest igator is responsible for recording data pertaining to p otenti al Hy’s Law/Hy ’s Law 
cases and for reporting SAEs and AEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment 
in line wit h standard safety  reporting processes.
E 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransfer ase (AL T) ≥ 3 × Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together  with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 × ULN at any point during the study 
following the start of study  medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP).
Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN togeth er with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing

coincident with (ie, on the same day ) the el evation in TBL, but there is no specified t imeframe 
within which the elevat ions in transaminases and TBL  must occur .
E 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentif y cases of potential Hy ’s Law i t is important to perform a comprehensive 
review of laboratory  data for any  participant who meets any of the following ident ificat ion 
criteria in iso lation or in co mbinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3 × ULN
AST ≥ 3 × ULN
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN
Local Laboratories Being Used:
The invest igator will wit hout delay  review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative 
Determine whether the participant meets potential Hy’s Law criteria (see Secti on 
E 2for definit ion) by [CONTACT_244995] m all previ ous visi ts
Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  eCRF
E 4 Follow -up
E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the participant does not meet potential Hy ’s Law cri teria the investigator will:
Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the participant has not met poten tial 
Hy’s Law criteria. 
Perform  follow-up on subs equent l aboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the protocol.
E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the participant does meet potential Hy’ s Law criteri a the invest igator will:
Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the ce ntral Study  Team

For parti cipants that met potential Hy’s Law criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator 
is not required to submit a potential Hy’s Law SAE unless there is a significant change#in 
the participant’s condit ion
The Study  Physician wil l contact [CONTACT_093], to provide guidance, discuss and agree 
an approach for the study  parti cipants’ fo llow-up (including any  further l aboratory  
testing) and the continuous review of data
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_33157]:
-Moni tor the participant until liver bio chemistry  param eters and appropri ate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
-Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnosti c investi gations as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available in 
the Hy ’s Law laboratory  kit shoul d be used. 
-Com plete the three Liver eCRF Modules as information beco mes available 
#A ‘significant ’ change in the participant ’s condi tion refers to a clinically  relevant change 
in any of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (AL T, AST or TBL) in iso lation or i n 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the investigator, this

The instructions in this appen dix shoul d be f ollowed for all  cases where potential  Hy’s Law 
criteria are met.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y is initially detected, the Study  
Physician will contact [CONTACT_271131] w hether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting potent ial Hy’s Law cri teria other than DILI 
caused by  [CONTACT_2203] , to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin 15 
calendar day s from date potential Hy’s Law criteria was met. The [COMPANY_008] Glo bal Study  
Physician or equivalent and Global Safet y Physician will also be invo lved in this review 
together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.

determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:
If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate eCRF
If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential 
Hy’s Law SAE and AE eCRFs accordingly wit h the new informat ion (reassessing event 
term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the [COMPANY_008] standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the AL T or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
-The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
-As there is no alternat ive explanation for the Hy’s Law case, a causalit y 
assessment of ‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 15 cal endar days in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether the case meets the criteria for Hy ’s Law , then i t is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an in formed decisio n can be made:
Provi de any further update to the previously  submitted SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law, 
(report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related to IMP and 
seriousness cri teria is m edically important, according to p rotocol process for SAE 
reporting.
Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether Hy’s Law criteria are still met. Update the previousl y submitted potential Hy’s 
Law SAE report fo llowing protocol  process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome 
of the review and amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemistry  elevat ions is determined.

L 1 Substudy Synopsis
Backgr ound: A composite endpo int (COPDCom pEx) for exacerbat ions is a novel endpo int 
that is being used as a surrogate efficacy endpo int for exacerbat ion risk reduction in 
rando mised controlled trials. COPDCompEx captures AWEs, ie, clinically relevant 
deteri orations of PEF , reliever use or symptoms that fulfil specific criteria in terms o f reaching 
thresho lds or slopes. The Q -SAW substudy  aims to provi de a deeper understanding of 
day-to-day variat ions in symptoms and the impact of AWEs on the parti cipant ’s life.
Objectives:
1To evaluate the impact of an AWE on daily lives of pat ients with COPD
2To identify and explain the AWE associated behaviours
Methods: A qualitat ive substudy will be conducted using a grounded theory approach 
(Strauss and Corbin 1994). T wo semi -structured individual interviews will be conducted by  
[CONTACT_271144]- ended questi ons, each of 30- minute duration. A  topic 
list and interview guide with e xample quest ions will be used as a framework for the interviews 
(Appendix L 3)
.
Participant selection: Participants from  selected si tes in selected countri es may  be eligible 
for parti cipation. 
Parti cipants who provi ded informed consent for this substudy  may be invited for the init ial 
interview after occurrence of an A WE. Study  site personnel and interviewers will be instructed 
to avoid sharing infor mation on the full study  objectives and the procedure by  [CONTACT_271145] ’s 
recogni tion of  having an A WEupon which any fo llow-up actions would be expected. Instead, 
participants will be informed that the aim o f this substudy  is to l earn m ore about the impact of 
COPD on daily life. A  second interview will be scheduled up to [ADDRESS_330543] recovered from the AWE (Wageck et al  
2019). 
Selection of participants will cont inue unt il saturatio n in topi [INVESTIGATOR_271019], which is expected 
to occur within a total of approximately 40 partic ipants.
Methods of Analysis: Audio recordings of interviews will be transcribed and analysed wit h 
qualitat ive content analysis. Data will be coded and analysed by [ADDRESS_330544] ion and coding will 
be done in an iterative manner . This allows for adaptation of the interview guide based on new

L 2 Collection of Adverse Events During Participant Interviews
If a parti cipant during the interview reports an AE, which occurred at any  time, this will be 
recorded by  [CONTACT_20679]. For each AE the fo llowing variables will be collected: 
Parti cipant details: Pat ient Ecode, Gender, Age. 
Treatment details: A straZenecaproduct, Dose regimen, Date when treatment received.
AE details: Descript ion of AE (what experience), Date when the AE started and stopped, 
Whether the AE required any  medical intervention (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], medical treatment 
etc), Causalit y, Action taken wi th regard to m edicinal product, Outcome.
If follow-up is consented by  [CONTACT_271147] (Yes/No)
Reporter information (name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_4203]) 
Date/time of AE reporting 
Causalit y collection 
Causalit y assessment will be done by  [CONTACT_271148] t. The interviewer will ask about 
causalit y during the interview (“Do y ou consider that there i s a reasonable possibilit y that 
the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_9934] X?”).

inform ation is provided to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_271020]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_271021]. Fo llow-up is undertaken only  if the parti cipant 
has consented to be fo llowed-up. If so, GPRI i nforms the PI [INVESTIGATOR_271022]-up inform ation 
within the same t imeframe as the original report. 
In the event that GPRI and its Emplo yees, during the course of performing the Services,

CSP Version 4.0, 28 April 2023 
This modificat ion is considered to be substant ial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20 /EC of the European Parliament and the Council o f the European Unio n 
and in the EU Clinical Trial Regulat ion Article 2, 2 (13). 
Overall Rationale for the Modification:
The primary  rationale for the m odificat ions in this CSP is to add the optional Q -SAW, SPFQ 
and pat ient experience interview substudies which affect only selected sites in selected 
countri es where the substudies will be conducted. A substant ial change was made to remove 
history  of treatm ent wi th cardi otoxi c medicat ions from  the list of exclus ion criteria.

It is anticipated that a more detailed 
analysis of responders to treatment will 
be done on the basis of pre -existing 
emphysema severity and the pre sence of 
mucous plugging in particular. This may 
guide the inclusion of patients in the 
subsequent development program and

“To assess the effects of AZD4831 
compared to placebo on change in cough 
frequency  measured over a 24 -hour period 
between start of treatment and Week 12” 
corrected to exploratory objective. 
Due to template update, only primary and 
secondary objectives and endpoints are 
included in synopsis; therefore, removed 
from synopsis. 
The wording of “baseline” changed to 
“start of treatment”.Correction of endpoint of the 
cough substudy from 
secondary t o exploratory, as 
the substudy is an exploratory 
study and hence the endpoints 
would not be considered 
secondary. This does not 
impact the scientific value of 
the main study or the substudy. 
Start of treatment is used in 
place of baseline to clarify the 
time of study measure.

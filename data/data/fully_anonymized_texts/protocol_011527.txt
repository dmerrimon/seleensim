6 Study Description :   
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open -label) and Part B (randomized, double -
blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of Part A data. 
The methods of the 2 parts will be identical unle ss otherwise noted. Subjects who participate in Part A 
will not be allowed to participate in Part B. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  
and efficacy of SAGE -217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder , who are currently expe riencing 
an MDE.   
The assessments are summarized in the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form at  the Screening Visit The diagnosis of 
bipolar I or II disorder  will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) 
performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  
Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self -administer the study drug once daily in the evening 
with food for 2 8 days. In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -217. For Part B, subjects w ill be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on 
use of mood stabilizers  (Y/N) . Subjects on a ntidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, 
and valproic acid only) that have been taken at  the same dose for at least 60 days prior to Day 1 are to  
continue the stable dose throughout the treatment period.  The planned dosing regimen is as follows:  
Treatment Days 1 -3 Days 4-24 Days 2 5-28 
SAGE -217 SAGE -217, 20 mg  SAGE -217, 30 mg  SAGE -217, 20 mg  
Placebo  (Part B only)  Placebo  Placebo  Placebo  
If at any time , [ADDRESS_969491] has a YMRS score  of ≥13, the I nvestigator  will clinically 
assess  the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with 
hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and treated as clinically 
appropriate. These incidents will be documented as AEs.  
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in 
Table  1. 
Number of Subjects  (planned):   
Part A: Approximately 30 subjects will be dosed.  
Part B: Approximately 132 subjects will be randomized and dosed  to obtain a total of 112 evaluable 
subjects .

Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration  (Part B only) :  
In Part B, p lacebo capsules are visually matched to the active capsules and are available as hard gelatin 
capsules containing only the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_712642]. Study drug will 
be administered orally once daily in the evening, with food . 
Duration of Treatment: 28 days 
Statistical methods:    
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) for each part (Part A and Part B) will provide a detailed 
description of the analyses to be performed in the respective part of the study . The SAP s will be  
finalized and approved prior to database lock . Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
General : 
The data from Part A and Part B will be analyzed separately. For the purpose of all safety and efficacy 
analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last available measurement prior to the start of 
study drug administration .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum . In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and 
summarized descriptively . For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets :  
Randomized set ( Part B only) will be defined as all subjects who are randomized. This analysis set will 
be used of all data listings in Part B. Data listings for Part A will be based on Safety or Efficacy Set, as 
appropriate.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects received at l east [ADDRESS_969507] -baseline 
HAM -D evaluation , will be used to analyze efficacy data  unless oth erwise specified.  
 
Safety Analysis:   
The overall incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_656391] (MedDRA ) system organ class and preferred term. Data for vital signs, clinical laboratory 
measurements, ECG, and concomitant medication usage will also be summarized .  
Safety data  will be summarized and examined for possible relationships betwe en subject characteristics 
and plasma SAGE -217 concentrations, as appropriate . Suicidality data collected using the C -SSRS and 
evaluation of mania collected using the YMRS at baseline and at each visit during the active Treatment 
Period  will be listed for all subjects . Out-of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable . Subjects will be summarized according to treatment received for the purpose of 
safety.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary endpoint in Part B, the change from baseline in HAM -D total score , will be analyzed 
using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) ; the model will include treatment, 
baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment 
as explanatory variables . All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed effects and the subject 
effect will be considered random in the model. All post -baseline time points will be included in the 
model . The primary comparison will be between SAGE -217 and matching placebo at Day 25. Model -
based point estimates (ie, least squares [ LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values ) will be  
reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors . Other 
continuous en dpoints  will be analyzed using similar methods .  
Other efficacy analyses, including those in Part A,  will be  specified in the SAP. In general, data will be 
analyzed  using appropriate descriptive statistics or pre-specified statistical methods as  applicable ; 
subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data . Subjects will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Size Calculation  
Part A : The sample size of approximately 30 subjects was selected based on clinical and not statistical 
considerations.  
Part B : Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 112 total evaluable subjects (56 per 
treatment group) would provide 80% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 
approximately  [ADDRESS_969508] deviation (SD) of 7.5 points.  
Assuming a 15% dropout rate, approximately [ADDRESS_969509] -baseline HAM -D assessment. 
Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop -out rate is higher than 15%.

 21  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Bipolar D isorder s and Unmet Medical Need  
Bipolar disorder is a chronic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_712646] ( Sachs 2007 ). The Global Burden of Disease Study revealed that in 2013, there were 
48.8 million cases of bipolar disorder globally ( Ferrari 2016 ). Bipolar disorder accounted for 
9.9 million disability -adjusted life years (DALYs)  globally , explaining 0.4% of total DAL Ys and 
1.3% of total years lived with disability.  
There are subtypes of bipolar disorder; this study includes the bipolar I and II subtypes. Bipolar I 
is characterized by a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], whereas bipolar II is characterized by a hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The dif ference in the severity of the manic features relies on functional impairment that is caused 
by [CONTACT_712706][INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( DSM -5). The National Comorbidity Survey estimate of the lifetime 
prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.1% in the US population when bipolar I disorder and 
bipolar  II Disorder are combined ( Merikangas 2007 ). 
While the manic or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712647], evidence suggests that depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712648] I and 
II are associated with more disability than any other aspect of the illness. A seminal long -term 
study of patients with bipolar I disorder demonstrated that over the 13 -year follow -up period, 
patients were symptomatic about 47% of the time, and depressive symp toms were present in 
32% of the follow -up weeks vs manic features, which were present in 9% ( Judd 2002 ). A similar 
analysis in patients with bipolar II disorder with a longer follow up of up to 20 years found that 
patients were symptomatic more than half o f the time (54%)  where  depressive symptoms 
dominated the course at 50% of the follow -up weeks vs 1.3% for the hypomanic symptoms 
(Judd  2003 ). A study in patients with unipolar depression found a prevalence of depressive 
symptoms 47% of the time ( Judd 1998 ), suggesting a comparable time spent with depressive 
symptoms in the bipolar spectrum. These naturalistic studies have also found that about half the 
time patients reported taking psychotropic medications. In another large -scale study with a 
follow -up peri od of up to 2 years, 58% of nearly 1500 patients with bipolar disorder who were 
symptomatic at study entry achieved recovery ( Perlis 2006 ). Similarly, during the follow -up 
period, 49% of these individuals experienced recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], where depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(38%) outweighed manic, hypomanic, or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_712649] (13.8%). In the Stanley 
Foundation Bipolar Network Study, in which y ear-long, daily clinician ratings were included, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_712650] 4.1 psychotropic medications, patients with bipolar disorder 
spent 3 times as much time with depressive symptoms as manic symptoms ( Post 2003 ). 
There are only 3 medicatio ns approved  in the US for the treatment of bipolar depression, 
(lurasidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -fluoxetine combination , and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ), all of which include  atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712651]. None of the 
current ly available antidepressants are indicated for bipolar depression due to their limited 
efficacy, and the possibility that their use may be associated with a manic switch and rapid 
cycling. While some studies reported varying levels of efficacy with antidep ressants 
(Gijsman  2004 ), a large -scale, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial  sponsored by [CONTACT_712707] , The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for 
Bipolar Disorder (STEP -BD), found that only 23.5% of patients wi th bipolar depression 
receiving a mood stabilizer and adjunctive antidepressants vs 27.3% of those receiving a mood 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 22  stabilizer and placebo experienced a durable recovery, confirming the lack of effectiveness of 
antidepressants in bipolar depression ( Sachs 2007 ). The tolerability profile of the approved 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712652] . 
In 1998, the lifetime cost of bipolar disorder in the US was estimated at $[ADDRESS_969520] of a 
single manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712653]  $11,720 to $624,785 for persons with 
nonresponsive/chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( Begley 1998 ); the c ost of bipolar depression  specifically, is less 
well studied, however, available estimates indicate a higher cost associated with bipolar 
depression than for mania ( Bowden 2004 ). 
Kessler ha s studied the impact of mood disorders on work performance in a representative 
sample of ove r 3,000 US workers ( Kessler 2006 ). Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder 
were associated with 65.[ADDRESS_969521] workdays per worker per year, respectively. Moreover, it 
was found that the increase in bipolar disorder was attributable to depressiv e symptoms rather 
than manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_146616].  
Taken together, these findings point to substantial predominance of depressive symptoms across 
the spectrum of bipolar disorder . In particular, they also highlight the importance of successful 
depressive symptom control, and an unmet need in the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712654] I and bipolar II disorder.  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA )A receptors, the 
major class of inhibitory neuro transmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
in mice and rats, SAGE -[ADDRESS_969522] good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in 
vitro receptor and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE -217 was 
highly selective for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor 
potentiators ( Rudolph 2011 ), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic , and sedative activity 
when administered in vivo.  
Data from a n open -label  portion of the Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administered to subjects 
with moderate to severe major depressive disorder (MDD)  showed clinically significant 
improvements from baseline in depression scale scores (HAM -D, Montgomery -Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement [CGI -I]) as 
early as Day 2 of the 14 -day treatment period, with dur able responses following the end of 
treatment. This result was further supported by [CONTACT_712708] , double -blind portion of this 
study (N=89) in which  a rapid and substantial decrease in HAM -D scores was observed at  
Day 15 (primary endpoint) , starting at Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other 
efficacy scales, including MADRS  and CGI-I. Statistically significant differences from the 
placebo group favoring the SAGE -[ADDRESS_969523] common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
AEs were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among the over [ADDRESS_969524] with essential tremor 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to discontinuation of 
study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE -217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Non-serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with SAGE -217. Given  the outcome  of the Phase  2 study  of SAGE -217 in subjects  with 
MDD  and the current  significant  unmet  need  in the treatment  of depressive  epi[INVESTIGATOR_712655]  I/II disorders , a favorable  risk-benefit  balance  and investigation  of SAGE -217 in 
patients  with bipolar  I/II disorders  are justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
The highest dose level of SAGE -217 to be administered in this study (30 mg) was determined 
based on  the maximum tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE -217 in 
healthy subjects and is the same dose level that has been  used and generally well tolerated in 
clinical studies in various patient populations , including patients with MDD . Due to the observed 
improved tolerability of sedation/somnolence effects when taken in  the evening  in previous 
clinical studies , SAGE -[ADDRESS_969525] been approved for the treatment of bipolar 
depression ( Sachs 2007 ). Given this foreseen challenge, the duration in this trial has been set at a 
total of [ADDRESS_969526] 3 days at 20 mg of SAGE -217 are thought to 
provide immediate tolerability data at this relatively lower dose  when  combine d with other 
concomitant medicati ons including mood stabilizers and increase the probability of tolerance on 
the 30 mg dose level.  The 30 mg dose level is based on previous clinical trial data with SAGE -
217 demonstrating highly effective improvement in dep ressive symptoms  in patients with MDD. 
Based on the absence of clinical data for a treatment duration longer than 2 weeks at this time , 
and the GABAergic mechanism of action of SAGE -217, a titration  down to 20  mg is included in 
the study design .

 27  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study will be cond ucted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open -label) and Part B (randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of 
Part A data. The methods of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. The study is 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SAGE -217 in adult subjects with 
bipolar I/II disorder , who are currently experiencing an MDE.  
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Vi sit. The 
diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM -5 for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, and valproic acid only) that 
have been taken at the same dose for at least 60 days prior to Day 1 are to continue the stable 
dose throughout the treatment period . 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in  
the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). All assessments to be performed are summarized in Table  1. 
If at any time during the study, a subject has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will 
clinically assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is 
consistent wi th hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and 
treated as clinically appropriate  (see Section  8.3). 
Part A  
The study design for Part A is presented in Figure 1. In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -
217. Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self -administer the study drug once daily in the 
evening with food for 28 days : 20 mg SAGE -217 for 3 days, 30 mg SAGE -217 for 21 days, and 
then 20 mg -SAGE -217 for 4 days . Dose adjustments based on study drug tolerability are 
permitted following the guidelines out lined in Section  7.4.

Part B  
The study design for Part B is presented in Figure  2. In Part B, subjects wi ll be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on use of mood 
stabilizers  (Y/N) . Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self -administer the study drug once 
daily in the evening with food for 28 d ays: 20 mg SAGE -217 for 3 days, 30 mg SAGE -217 for

 38  11. ASSESSMENT O F EFFICACY   
All assessments will be conducte d according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table  1). 
11.1. Efficacy Assessment s 
11.1.1.  Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the 17 -item HAM -D total score at 
Day 2 5.  
The 17 -item HAM -D will  be used to rate the severity of depressi on in subjects who are identified  
as experiencing a n MDE  (Williams 2013 a; Williams 2013b ). The 17 -item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and  speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Every effort should be 
made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments for an individual subject.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as hav ing a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM -D total score of ≤7.  
The HAM -D subject interview may be  audio -recorded for independent quality control purposes . 
11.1.2.  Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_969552] to the HAM -D that 
would be more s ensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by [CONTACT_712714].  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the ten individual item scores.  
The MADRS subject interview may be  audio -recorded for independent quality control purposes . 
11.1.3.  Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utiliz ed in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information in to a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of [ADDRESS_969553] 2 items are being used in this study.  
The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S) uses a [ADDRESS_969554]’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969555] i s assessed 
on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline 
mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill 
(Busner  2007 a).  
The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI -I) employs a [ADDRESS_969556]’s condition posttreatment. The Investigator will 
rate the subject’s total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response 
choices in clude: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally 
improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse 
(Busner  2007 b). The CGI -I is only rated at posttreatment assessments. By [CONTACT_108], all CGI -I 
assessmen ts are evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having 
a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or “much improved.”  
11.1.4.  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, an d impact of 
insomnia  (Morin 2011 ). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0  = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe) , satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = moderately satisfied, 3 = 
dissatisfied, 4 = very dissatisfied),  and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily 
functioning ( 0 = not at all, 1  = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much ). A total score of 
0 to 7 = “no clinicall y significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = 
“clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22  to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”

12.1. Safety Parameters  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -217 will be assessed  by [CONTACT_712715]; 
changes  from  baseline  in clinical  laboratory  measures,  vital signs,  and ECGs;  suicidal  ideation  
and behavior  using  the C-SSRS ; and the YMRS.  All assessments will  be conducted according to 
the schedule of assessm ents (Table  1). 
12.1.1.  Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic  and baseline  characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status , 
highest education level , marital/ civil status ) and a full medical history , including family 
psychiatric history,  will be documented.  The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be 
determined using the SCID -5-CT. 
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height (Screening onl y) and weight will be measured and documented.   
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Physical examination s assessing body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental status 
examinations will be conducted  and documented . Whenever possible, the same individual is to 
perform all physical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any a bnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically signifi cant will be recorded as 
AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supi[INVESTIGATOR_712658]. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supi[INVESTIGATOR_712659] [ADDRESS_969557], 
with the blood sample collected as close to the scheduled time as possible.  
Any abno rmality in vital signs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be 
clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to  Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
12.1.5.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_969558] intervals (heart rate, PR, 
QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as  any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded. When ECG  
sample collection occur during the same visit, the ECG s will be conducted  first.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis. The resul ts of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is responsible 
for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically 
to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by [CONTACT_712716].  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_712717]. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, 
clinically significant (CS) in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged 
to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assess ed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . A 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality following subject randomization will be followed 
until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been 
obtained.  
Follicle stimulating hormone testing will be conducted a t Screening to confirm whether a female 
subject with ≥[ADDRESS_969559] -menopausal ( Section  8.1).

A serum pregnancy test in women of child -bearing potential will be conducted at Screening and 
a urine pregnancy test will be conducted at all other scheduled timepoints  (see Table  3).  
12.1.7.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011 ). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post -baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit . The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_969560] severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months) . The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table  1. 
12.1.8.  Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)  
Mani c symptoms  will be assessed during the study using the YMRS ( Young 1978 ). The 
clinician -administered scale is based on 11 items  of core symptoms of mania. Four of the items 
(irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are graded on a scale of 
0 to 8 (choices given as even numbers), with the remaining 7  items graded on a scale of 0 to 4. 
Scoring betwe en the points given (whole or half points) is possible.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutica l product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medici nal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product . In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatmen t has been administered.  
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the value represents a clinically 
significant change from baseline  as determined by [CONTACT_737] .  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the informed consent form and throughout the 
duration of the study , whether o r not they are related to the study, must be re ported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 45  [IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_245594] , 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home tha t do not require an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled  and throughout the duration of the study , 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE form provided by [CONTACT_712718] . 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse 
event ( not related, possibly related or probably related) . The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, th ere is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_7198] . If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then 
the adverse event should be classified as “ not related.”  If there is any valid reason, even if  
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at 
least “possibly related.”   
Table  4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be  reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product  is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969561]  and/or in r esponse to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235] . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible . For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
wheth er or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study  drug or withdraw early from the 
study . 
Intensi ty will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activitie s) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and se vere AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_49900]  [IP_ADDRESS] . An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sage Therapeutic s pregnancy 
notification form . Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_712660] a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented on the Sage Therapeutics 
pregnancy outcome form  even if the subject  was discontinued from the study . Reports of 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs .  
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage , or designee,  immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage , or designee,  within [ADDRESS_969562] awareness of the event by [CONTACT_36284]/or his staff  on the SAE report form . The I nvestigator must complete, sign and 
date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE form  with the 
corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage , or designee .  
Additional follow -up information, if required or availab le, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics , or designee,  within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study 
file. 
Any SAEs discovered by [CONTACT_712719], 
should be promptly reported to Sage , or designee,  according to the timelines noted above .  
Sage , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinic al study . Each site is responsible 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  for notifying its ethics committee of these S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug 
Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel , or designee , will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting. The Sponsor , or designee , will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded 
fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. The Sponsor , or designee , will submit 
S[LOCATION_003]R s to investigators in a blinded fashion.  
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, t he blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_712720] a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage . If the unblinding occurs without 
Sage ’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage  as soon  as possible and no later than the 
next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the 
unblinding of individual subjects mu st be made in writing to Sage  and approved by [CONTACT_712721], according to standard operating procedures . The blinding of the 
study will be broken after the database has been locked. Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_712661].  
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical 
Monitor if  unblinding is warranted for medical management of the subject. If there is agreement 
to unblind treatment assignment, the unblinding procedure described in the Safety Management 
Plan for the study will be followed. If the Investigator is unable to contact  [CONTACT_199193] a medical emergency, and it is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_737], the treatment 
group for that subject may be unblinded in the IRT system.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertin ent information 
(including the reason for unblinding)  must be documented in the subject’s records and on the 
eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be 
permanently discontinued  from the study.

 6  Study Description:   
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open-label) and Part B (randomized, double-
blind, placebo- controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of Part A data. 
The methods of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. Subjects who participate in Part A 
will not be allowed to participate in Part B. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  
and efficacy of SAGE -217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder, who are currently experiencing 
an MDE.   
The assessments are summarized in the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form at the Screening Visit. The diagnosis 
of bipolar I or II disorder will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) for c linical trials (SCID -5-CT) 
performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  
Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self-administer the study drug once daily in the evening 
with food for 14  days. In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -217. For Par t B, subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE-217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on 
use of mood stabilizers (Y/N) . Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, 
and valproic acid only) that hav e been taken at the same dose for at least [ADDRESS_969576] has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will clinically 
assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with 
hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and treated as clinically appropriate. These incidents will be documented as AEs.  
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in Table  1. 
Number of Subjects (planned):   
Part A: Approximately 30 subjects will be dosed.  
Part B: Approximately 132 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain a total of 112 evaluable 
subjects.

oranges, or products containing these within [ADDRESS_969591] John’s Wort, within [ADDRESS_969592] plans to undergo elective surgery during participation in the study.  
SAGE -217 dosage and mode of administrati on:  
SAGE -[ADDRESS_969593] gelatin capsules containing a white to off -white powder. In addition to 
SAGE -217 Drug Substance, the SAGE-217 c apsules contain croscarmellose sodium, mannitol, 
silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) , colloidal silic on dioxide , and sodium stearyl fumarate as 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component of the SMCC or a standalone excipi[INVESTIGATOR_712665] . Subjects will take the assigned dose orally once daily in the evening ( approximately 
8:00 t o 11:00 pm) with food. 
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration (Part B only):  
In Part B, placebo capsules are visually matched to the active capsules and are available as hard gelatin 
capsules containing only the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_712642]. Study drug will be administered orally once daily in the evening (approximately 8:00 to 11:00 pm)  with food.  
Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods:   
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) for each part (Par ts A and B) will provide a detailed 
description of the analyses to be performed in the respective part of the study . The SAP s will be 
finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
General:  
The data from Parts A and B will be analyzed separately. For the purpose of all safety and efficacy 
analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last available measurement prior to the star t of 
study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 10  summarized descriptively. For catego rical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets:  
Randomized set (Part B only) will be defined as all subjects who are randomized. This analysis set will 
be used of all data listings in Part B. Data listings for Pa rt A will be based on Safety or Efficacy Set, as 
appropriate. 
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects received at least [ADDRESS_969594]- baseline 
HAM -D evaluation, will be used to analyze efficacy data unless otherwise specified.  
 
Safety Analysis:   
The overall incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. Data for vital signs, clinical laboratory measurements, ECG, and concomitant medi cation usage will also be summarized.  
Safety data will be summarized and examined for possible relationships between subject characteristics 
and plasma SAGE -217 concentrations, as appropriate. Suicidality data collected using the C- SSRS and 
evaluation of mania collected using the YMRS at baseline and at each visit during the active Treatment Period will be listed for all subjects. Out -of-range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable. Subjects will be summarized according to tre atment received for the purpose of 
safety.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary endpoint in Part B, the change from baseline in HAM- D total score, will be analyzed 
using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point- by-treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed effects and the subject effect will be considered random in the model. All post- baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The primary comparison will be between SAGE-217 and matching placebo at Day 15 . Model-
based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be 
reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject errors. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods.  
Other efficacy analyses, including those in Part A, will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be 
analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics or pre- specified statistical methods as applicable; 
subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless ot herwise specified.  
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Size Calculation  
Part A : The sample size of approximately 30 subjects was selected based on clinical and not statistical 
considerations. 
Part B : Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 112 total evaluable subjects (56 per 
treatme nt group) would provide 80% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969595] deviation (SD) of 7.5 points.  
Assuming a 15% dropout rate, approximately [ADDRESS_969596] -baseline HA M-D assessment. 
Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop-out rate is higher than 15%.

 22  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Bipolar D isorder s and Unmet Medical Need  
Bipolar disorder is a chronic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_712646] ( Sachs 2007 ). The Global Burden of Disease Study revealed that in 2013, there were 
48.8 million cases of bipolar disorder globally ( Ferrari 2016 ). Bipolar disorder accounted for 
9.9 million disability -adjusted life years (DALYs)  globally, explaining 0.4% of total DALYs and 
1.3% of total years lived with disability.  
There are subtypes of bipolar disorder; this study includes the bipolar I and II subtypes. Bipolar I 
is characterized by a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], whereas bipolar II is characterized by a hypomanic epis ode. 
The difference in the severity of the manic features relies on functional impairment that is caused 
by [CONTACT_712706][INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( DSM -5). The National Comorbidity Survey estimate of the lifetime 
prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.1% in the US population when bipolar I disorder and 
bipolar II Disorder are combined ( Merikangas 2007 ). 
While the manic or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712647], evidence suggests that depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712648] I and 
II are associated with more disability than any other aspect of the illness. A seminal long -term 
study of patients with bipolar I disorder demonstrated that over the 13- year follow -up period, 
patients were symptomatic about 47% of the time, and depressive symptoms were present in 32% of the follow-up weeks vs manic features, which were present in 9% ( Judd 2002). A similar 
analysis in patients with bipolar II disorder with a longer follow up of up to 20 years found that 
patients were symptomatic more  than half of the time (54%) where depressive symptoms 
dominated the course at 50% of the follow-up weeks versus 1.3% for the hypomanic symptoms 
(Judd 2003). A study in patients with unipolar depression found a prevalence of depressive 
symptoms 47% of the time ( Judd 1998), suggesting a comparable time spent with depressive 
symptoms in the bipolar spectrum. These naturalistic studies have also found that about half the 
time patients reported taking psychotropic medications. In another large- scale study with a 
follow-up period of up to 2 years, 58% of nearly 1500 patients with bipolar disorder who were 
symptomatic at study entry achieved recovery ( Perlis 2006). Similarly, during the follow -up 
period, 49% of these individuals experienced recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], whe re depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(38%) outweighed manic, hypomanic, or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_712649] (13.8%). In the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network Study, in which year-long, daily clinician ratings were included, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_712650] 4.1 psychotropic medications, patients with bipolar disorder 
spent 3 times as much time with depressive symptoms as manic symptoms ( Post 2003).  
There are only 3 medications approved in the US for the treatment of bipolar depression, (lurasidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-fluoxetine combination, and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), all of which include atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712651]. None of the currently available antidepressants are indicated for bipolar depression due to their limited 
efficacy, and th e possibility that their use may be associated with a manic switch and rapid 
cycling. While some studies reported varying levels of efficacy with antidepressants 
(Gijsman  2004), a large-scale, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_3433] e 
National Institutes of Mental Health , The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for 
Bipolar Disorder (STEP -BD), found that only 23.5% of patients with bipolar depression 
receiving a mood stabilizer and adjunctive antidepressants versus 27.3% of those receiving a 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  mood stabilizer and placebo experienced a durable recovery, confirming the lack of effectiveness 
of antidepressants in bipolar depression ( Sachs 2007). The tolerability profile of the approved 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712652]. 
In 1998, the lifetime cost of bipolar disorder in the US was estimated at $[ADDRESS_969606] of a 
single manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712653]  $11,720 to $624,785 for persons with 
nonresponsive/chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( Begley 1998); the cost of bipolar depression  specifically, is less 
well studied, however, available estimates indicate a higher cost associated with bipolar depression than for mania ( Bowden 2004).  
Kessler h as studied the impact of mood disorders on work performance in a representative 
sample of over 3,000 US workers ( Kessler 2006 ). Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder 
were associated with 65.[ADDRESS_969607] rum of bipolar disorder. In particular, they also highlight the importance of successful 
depressive symptom control, and an unmet need in the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712668] I and bipolar II disorder.  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA )A receptors, the 
major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mi 
ce and rats, SAGE -[ADDRESS_969608] good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in 
vitro receptor and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was 
highly selective for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor 
potentiators ( Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity 
when administered in vivo. 
Data from an open -label portion of the Phase 2a study of SAGE-217 administered to subjects 
with moderate to seve re major depressive disorder (MDD) showed clinically significant 
improvements from baseline in depression scale scores (HAM-D, Montgomery- Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as 
early as Day 2 of the 14-day treatment period, with durable responses following the end of 
treatment. This result was further supported by [CONTACT_712708], double-blind portion of this 
study (N=89) in which a rapid and substantial decrease in HAM- D scores was observed at 
Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other 
efficacy scales, including MADRS  and CGI -I. Statistically significant differences from the 
placebo group favoring the SAGE-[ADDRESS_969609] common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
AEs were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among the over [ADDRESS_969610] with essential tremor 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to discontinuation of 
study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Non-serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with SAGE -217. Given  the outcome of the Phase 2 study of  SAGE -217 in  subjects  with  
MDD and  the current  significant unmet need  in the treatment  of depressive  epi[INVESTIGATOR_712669] I/II disorders, a favorable risk -benefit  balance and investigation of SAGE -217 in  
patients  with  bipolar I/II disorders are justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
The dose of SAGE-217 to be administered in this study (30 mg) was determined based on the 
maximum tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects, 
and is the same dose level that has been  used and generally well tolerated in clinical studies in 
various patient populations, including patients with MDD. Due to the observed improved 
tolerability of sedation/somnolence effects when taken in the evening  in previous clinical studies,

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open-label) and Part B (randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of 
Part A data.The metho ds of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. The study is 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  and efficacy of SAGE-217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder , who are currently experiencing an MDE.  
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM -5 for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, and valproic acid only) that have been taken at the same dose for at least 60 days prior to Day 1 are to continue the stable dose throughout the treatment period. 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). All assessments to be performed are summarized in Table 1. 
If at any time during the study, a subject has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will 
clinically assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from stu dy drug and 
treated as clinically appropriate (see Section  8.3).  
Part A  
The study design for Part A is presented in Figure 1 . In Part A, all subjects will receive  
SAGE -217. Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self- administer 30-mg SAGE -217 once 
daily in the evening (approximately 8:00 to 11:00 pm) with food for 14 days. Dose adjustments 
based on study drug tolerability are permitted following the guidelines outlined in Section  7.4.

QD = once daily  
A dose adjustment to 20- mg SAGE -217 is permitted if the 30 -mg dose is not tolerated at any time.  
 
Part B  
The study design for Part B is presented in Figure  2. In Part B, subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on use of mood 
stabilizers (Y/N). Beginning on D ay 1, qualified subjects will self -administer the study drug Day -28 to -1

SAGE -217 (Parts A and B)  or placebo (Part B only) will be self-administered by [CONTACT_712735] (approximately 8:00 to 11:00 pm) with food. Sites  will dispense study drug to the 
subjects to take at home with instructions for use ( Section  10.4).   
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform 
used on smartphones to visually confirm medication in gestion. S ubjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will 
follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front- facing webcam to visually confirm their 
ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time of study drug 
administration by [CONTACT_15994] , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to each visit during the 
treatment period, at which time the Inv estigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the 
kit contains sufficient doses until the next scheduled dispensation. 
If the subject is persistently noncompliant with the study drug, the Investigator should discuss 
with Sage Therapeutics  the potential discontinuation of the subject ( Section  8.3). Dosing 
requirements will be reviewed with each subject  during all study contacts. The authorized study 
personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the subject source records.  
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
Part A  
Part A is an open- label design in which all subjects will receive SAGE -217. 
Part B  
Part B  is a randomized , double-blind, placebo- controlled , parallel group design. Subjects who 
meet the entrance criteria will be stratified based on use of mood stabilizers (Y/N)  and randomly 
assigned within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE-217 or matched placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation.  Randomization will be 
performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
Randomization schedules will be generated by [CONTACT_55467]. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE-217 or placebo) will be based on the randomization schedule. The 
randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized 
personnel until the time of unblinding.  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only if  the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment p lan is dependent on the study treatment received. See Section  12.[ADDRESS_969636] is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be permanently discontinued from the study.

for each subject. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary subject-
identifying infor mation, including the subject ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the 
eligible subject into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be dispensed to that subject. 
At the subsequent study drug-dispensing visit, the inves tigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same subject ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID 
number for the study drug to be dispensed at that visit. In the event of an unscheduled dose 
reduction (Section 7.4), a new subject- specific kit will be dispensed.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by [CONTACT_135477]’s designee, the Sponsor must be notified immediately. 
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. After the study is completed, 
all unused study medication must be returned as directed or destroyed on site per the Sponsor’s 
instructions. The Investigator or designee must keep a record of all study drug received, 
dispensed and discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time within usual 
business hours and with appropriate notice during or after completion of the study to perform 
drug accountability reconciliation.

 39  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
All assessments will be conducte d according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). 
11.1. Efficacy A ssessment s 
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM- D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the 17 -item HAM -D total score at 
Day 15 .  
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression  in subjects who are identified  
as experiencing an MDE  (Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments for an individual subject.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM- D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
The HAM -D subject interview may be  audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.2. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_969641] to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by [CONTACT_712714].  Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 200 8). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the ten individual item scores.  
The MADRS subject interview may be audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.3. Clinical Global Impression ( CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale consists of [ADDRESS_969642] 2 items are being used in this study.  
The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S) uses a [ADDRESS_969643]’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969644] i s assessed

mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and  7=extremely ill 
(Busne r 2007a ).  
The Clini
cal Globa l Impression  - Impr ovement (CGI- I) em ploys a 7-poi nt Likert scale to 
measure the ov erall improvement in the  subject’s condition pos ttreatment. T he Investigator  will 
rate the s ubject’s 
total improvement whether or no t it is due  entirely to drug treatment. R esponse 
choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally 
improved, 4=no change , 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse , and 7=very much worse 
(Busner 2007b). The CGI-I  is only rated at posttreatment assessments. By [CONTACT_108], all CGI-I 
asses
sments are evaluated against
 baseline conditions. CGI-I response will be defined as having a 
CGI-I score of “very much improved” or “much improved.”  
11.1.4. Insomnia Se ver ity Index ( ISI) 
The ISI is a vali
dated questionna ire des igned t o assess t he nature, s everity, and  impact of  
insomnia (Morin 2011). T he ISI uses a 5-p oint Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1
 = mild, 2  = moderate;
 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction 
with cur rent sleep p att
ern (0 = very s atisfied,  1 = satis fied, 2 = neutral , 3 = dissati sfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied), a nd various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 
1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A tot al scor e of 0 t o 7 = “no  clinically 
signific
ant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate 
severity),” and 22 to 28  = “cl inical i nsomnia (severe).”

 42  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -217 will be assessed  by [CONTACT_712736]; 
changes  from  baseline in  clinical  laboratory measures,  vital signs,  and ECGs;  suicidal  ideation  
and behavior using the C- SSRS; and  the YMRS.  All assessments will be conducted according to 
the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status, 
highest education level , marital/civil status) and a full medical history , including family 
psychiatric histor y, will be documented. The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be 
determined using the SCID-5- CT. 
12.1.2. Weight and Height 
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examination s assessing body system s (eg, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental status 
examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual is to 
perform all p hysical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], 
not clinically signific ant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supi[INVESTIGATOR_712672]. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supi[INVESTIGATOR_712659] [ADDRESS_969645], with th e blood sample collected as close to the scheduled time as possible.  
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], NCS or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinicall y significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12-lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate. The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc F) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded. When ECG  
sample collection occur during the same visit, the ECGs will be conducted first.

documentation in the source document s as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, 
clinically significant (CS) in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. A 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality following subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been obtained. 
Follicle stimulating hormone testing will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a female 
subject with ≥[ADDRESS_969647]- menopausal (Section  8.1).  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drugs of Abuse  and Alcohol 
Urine toxicology will be performed for selected drugs of abuse, and a breath test will be 
performed for alcohol ( Table 1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Screen  
A serum pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential will be conducted at Screening and a urine pregnancy test will be conducted at all other scheduled timepoints ( Table 1).  
12.1.7. Colu mbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_969648] severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table 1.

 45  12.1.8. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
Manic symptoms will be assessed during the study using the YMRS ( Young 1978). The 
clinician -administered scale is based on 11 items of core symptoms of mania. Four of the items 
(irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are graded on a scale of 
0 to 8 (choices given as even numbers), with the remaining 7 items graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Scoring between the points given (whole or half points) is possible.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal rel ationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to t he medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs afte r the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the value represents a clinically significant change from baseline as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the informed consent form and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeutics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medica l intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969649] awareness (Section 12.5). All SAEs should to be followed 
until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered clinically significant 
or the subject was lost to follow-up. 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse 
event ( not related, possibly related or probably related). The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may  have been 
caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at least “possibly related.”  
Table 4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relations hip Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible tempor al sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_712738]’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7200] . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolutio n (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  • Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and se vere AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS]. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy 
notification form . Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_712660] a contraceptive medication  
or a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs (eg, spontaneous abortion, which requires 
reporting as an SAE). All pregnancies occurring during this study are to be reported in the same time frame as SAEs (eg, within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy) . 
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented on the Sage Therapeutics 
pregnancy outcome form even if the subject was discontinued from the study . Reports of 
congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs .  
If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify 
Sage Therapeutics, or de signee. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will 
document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for 
immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage, or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage, or designee, within [ADDRESS_969650] awareness of the event by [CONTACT_1755]/or his staff on the SAE report form. The Investigator must complete, sign and 
date the SAE report form , verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE repo rt 
form  with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage Therapeutics , or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report f orm and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study 
file. 
Any SAEs discovered by [CONTACT_712719], should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee, according to the timelines noted above. The contact [CONTACT_712739]/or pregnancies is located in the study reference manual.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible 
for notifying its ethics committee of these S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  In addition, appropriate SAGE  Drug Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or designee, will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 48  regulatory reporting. SAGE , or designee, will sub mit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) 
to regulatory agencies according to local law. SAGE , or designee, will submit S[LOCATION_003]R s to 
investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_135488] a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs without 
Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the 
unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by [CONTACT_712740], according to standard operating procedures. The blinding of the 
study will be broken after the database has been locked. Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_712673] p erforming the bioanalytical analyses in order to 
allow for limited analysis of samples from subjects receiving placebo.  
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor if unblinding is warranted for medical management of the subject. If there is agreement to unblind treatment assignment, the unblinding procedure described in the Safety Management 
Plan for the study will be followed. If the Investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_199193] a medical emergency, and it is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_737], the treatment group for that subject may be unblinded in the IRT system. 
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be permanently discontinued from the study.

point- by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969652]- baseline time 
points will be included in the model. The primary comparison will be between SAGE- 217 and 
matching placebo at Day 15. Model- based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% 
confidence intervals, and p values ) will be reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used to model the within -subject errors.  In case of convergence issues, other covariance 
structures will be considered; this will be detailed in the statistical analyses plan. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods.  
Other efficacy analyses w ill be specified in the statistical analysis plan. In general, data will be 
analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics or pre- specified statistical methods as 
applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Subjects will be anal yzed 
according to randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified.

Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by [CONTACT_3598].  
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medicat ions will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO-DD) September 2015, or later .  
Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be denoted “Prior”. 
Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing beyond the 
initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation of 
the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those w ith a start date on or after the first dose 
of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale

217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969656] ACCESS TO S OURCE DATA/ DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring visits to the study site will be made periodically during the study to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The investigator and the study site guarantee access to source documents by [CONTACT_712727]’s designee and by [CONTACT_4186]. 
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by [CONTACT_712728]’s designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s Binder, study drug, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, and 
review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the investigator and other 
study personnel are available durin g the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to 
the process.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics , a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site  to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The 
investigator should conta ct Sage Therapeutics  immediately if contact[CONTACT_426] a regulatory agency 
about an inspection. 
14.3. Protocol Deviations 
Investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpec ted circumstances arise that will 
require deviation from protocol-specified procedures, the investigator should consult with the 
Sage Therapeutics or sponsor’s designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate 
course of action. There will be no exemptions (a prospectively approved deviation) from the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria.

The primary change occurs in Section 12.4, Recording Adverse Events.  
Added text: Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy notification form. 
Pregnancy in itself is  not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_363350] a contraceptive medication or a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs (eg, 
spontaneous abortion, which requires reporti ng as an SAE). All pregnancies occurring during this study are to be 
reported in the same time frame as SAEs (eg, within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy).  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy outcome form even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. Reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  
If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify Sage Therapeutics, or 
designee. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for rep orting an SAE.

 6  Study Description:   
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open-label) and Part B (randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of Part A data. The methods of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. Subjects who participate in Part A 
will not be allowed to participate in Part B. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  
and efficacy of SAGE -217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder, who are currently experiencing 
an MDE.   
The assessments are summarized in the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). 
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form at the Screening Visit. The diagnosis 
of bipolar I or II disorder will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth  Edition (DSM -5) for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) 
performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  
Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self- administer  the study drug once daily in the evening 
with food for 14  days. In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -217. For Part B, subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE-217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on 
use of mood stabilizers (Y/N) . Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, 
and valproic acid only) that have been taken at the same dose for at least [ADDRESS_969673] has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will clinically 
assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with 
hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and treated as clinically appropriate. These incidents will be documented as AEs.  
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in Table  1. 
Number of Subjects (planned):   
Part A: Approximately 30 subjects will be dosed. 
Part B: Approximately 132 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain a total of 112 evaluable 
subjects.

 10  Statistical methods:   
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) for each part (Part s A and B) will provide a detailed 
description of the analyses to be performed in the respective part of the study . The SAP s will be 
finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
General:  
The data from Parts A and B will be analyzed separately. For the purpose of all safety and efficacy 
analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last available measurement prior to the start of 
study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and 
summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets:  
Randomized set (Part B onl y) will be defined as all subjects who are randomized. This analysis set will 
be used of all data listings in Part B. Data listings for Part A will be based on Safety or Efficacy Set, as 
appropriate. 
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects received at least [ADDRESS_969690] -baseline 
HAM -D evaluation, will be used to analyze efficacy data unless otherw ise specified.  
 
Safety Analysis:   
The overall incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_12513] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. Data for vital signs, clinical laboratory 
measurements, ECG, and concomitant medication usage will also be summarized.  
Safety data will be summarized and examined for possible relationships between subject characteristics 
and plasma SAGE -217 concentrations, as appropriate. Suicidality data collected using the C- SSRS and 
evaluation of mania collected using the YMRS at baseline and at each visit during the active Treatment 
Period will be listed for all subjects. Out-of- range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable. Subjects will be summarized according to treatment received for the purpose of 
safety.  
Efficacy Analysis:   
The primary endpoint in Part B, the change from baseli ne in HAM -D total score, will be analyzed 
using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM- D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed effects and the subject effect will be considered random in the model. All post- baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The primary comparison will be between SAGE-217 and matching pla cebo at Day 15 . Model-
based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be 
reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject errors. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods.  
Other efficacy analyses, including those in Part A, will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be 
analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics or pre -specified statistical methods as applicable; 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969691] listings  will be provided for all efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Size Calculation  
Part A : The sample size of approximately 30 subjects was selected based on clinical and not s tatistical 
considerations. 
Part B : Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 112 total evaluable subjects (56 per 
treatment group) would provide 80% power to detect a placebo- adjusted treatment difference of 
approximately [ADDRESS_969692] deviation (SD) of 7.5 points.  
Assuming a 15% dropout rate, approximately [ADDRESS_969693] -baseline HAM- D assessment. 
Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop-out rate is higher than 15%.

 21  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Bipolar D isorder s and Unmet Medical Need  
Bipolar disorder is a chronic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_712646] ( Sachs 2007 ). The Global Burden of Disease Study revealed that in 2013, there were 
48.8 million cases of bipolar disorder globally ( Ferrari 2016 ). Bipolar disorder accounted for 
9.9 million disability -adjusted life years (DALYs)  globally, explaining 0.4% of total DALYs and 
1.3% of total years lived with disability.  
There are subtypes of bipolar disorder; this study includes the bipolar I and II subtypes. Bipolar I 
is characterized by a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], whereas bipolar II is characterized by a hypomanic epis ode. 
The difference in the severity of the manic features relies on functional impairment that is caused 
by [CONTACT_712706][INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( DSM -5). The National Comorbidity Survey estimate of the lifetime 
prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.1% in the US population when bipolar I disorder and 
bipolar II Disorder are combined ( Merikangas 2007 ). 
While the manic or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712647], evidence suggests that depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712648] I and 
II are associated with more disability than any other aspect of the illness. A seminal long -term 
study of patients with bipolar I disorder demonstrated that over the 13- year follow -up period, 
patients were symptomatic about 47% of the time, and depressive symptoms were present in 32% of the follow-up weeks vs manic features, which were present in 9% ( Judd 2002). A similar 
analysis in patients with bipolar II disorder with a longer follow up of up to 20 years found that 
patients were symptomatic more  than half of the time (54%) where depressive symptoms 
dominated the course at 50% of the follow-up weeks versus 1.3% for the hypomanic symptoms 
(Judd 2003). A study in patients with unipolar depression found a prevalence of depressive 
symptoms 47% of the time ( Judd 1998), suggesting a comparable time spent with depressive 
symptoms in the bipolar spectrum. These naturalistic studies have also found that about half the 
time patients reported taking psychotropic medications. In another large- scale study with a 
follow-up period of up to 2 years, 58% of nearly 1500 patients with bipolar disorder who were 
symptomatic at study entry achieved recovery ( Perlis 2006). Similarly, during the follow -up 
period, 49% of these individuals experienced recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], whe re depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(38%) outweighed manic, hypomanic, or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_712649] (13.8%). In the Stanley Foundation Bipolar Network Study, in which year-long, daily clinician ratings were included, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_712650] 4.1 psychotropic medications, patients with bipolar disorder 
spent 3 times as much time with depressive symptoms as manic symptoms ( Post 2003).  
There are only 3 medications approved in the US for the treatment of bipolar depression, (lurasidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-fluoxetine combination, and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), all of which include atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712651]. None of the currently available antidepressants are indicated for bipolar depression due to their limited 
efficacy, and th e possibility that their use may be associated with a manic switch and rapid 
cycling. While some studies reported varying levels of efficacy with antidepressants 
(Gijsman  2004), a large-scale, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_3433] e 
National Institutes of Mental Health , The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for 
Bipolar Disorder (STEP -BD), found that only 23.5% of patients with bipolar depression 
receiving a mood stabilizer and adjunctive antidepressants versus 27.3% of those receiving a 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 22  mood stabilizer and placebo experienced a durable recovery, confirming the lack of effectiveness 
of antidepressants in bipolar depression ( Sachs 2007). The tolerability profile of the approved 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712652]. 
In 1998, the lifetime cost of bipolar disorder in the US was estimated at $[ADDRESS_969703] of a 
single manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712653]  $11,720 to $624,785 for persons with 
nonresponsive/chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( Begley 1998); the cost of bipolar depression  specifically, is less 
well studied, however, available estimates indicate a higher cost associated with bipolar depression than for mania ( Bowden 2004).  
Kessler h as studied the impact of mood disorders on work performance in a representative 
sample of over 3,000 US workers ( Kessler 2006 ). Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder 
were associated with 65.[ADDRESS_969704] rum of bipolar disorder. In particular, they also highlight the importance of successful 
depressive symptom control, and an unmet need in the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712668] I and bipolar II disorder.  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a positive allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA )A receptors, the 
major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mi 
ce and rats, SAGE -[ADDRESS_969705] good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in 
vitro receptor and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was 
highly selective for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor 
potentiators ( Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity 
when administered in vivo. 
Data from an open -label portion of the Phase 2a study of SAGE-217 administered to subjects 
with moderate to seve re major depressive disorder (MDD) showed clinically significant 
improvements from baseline in depression scale scores (HAM-D, Montgomery- Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as 
early as Day 2 of the 14-day treatment period, with durable responses following the end of 
treatment. This result was further supported by [CONTACT_712708], double-blind portion of this 
study (N=89) in which a rapid and substantial decrease in HAM- D scores was observed at 
Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other 
efficacy scales, including MADRS  and CGI -I. Statistically significant differences from the 
placebo group favoring the SAGE-[ADDRESS_969706] common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
AEs were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among the over [ADDRESS_969707] with essential tremor 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to discontinuation of 
study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Non-serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with SAGE -217. Given  the outcome of the Phase 2 study of  SAGE -217 in  subjects  with  
MDD and  the current  significant unmet need  in the treatment  of depressive  epi[INVESTIGATOR_712669] I/II disorders, a favorable risk -benefit  balance and investigation of SAGE -217 in  
patients  with  bipolar I/II disorders are justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
The dose of SAGE-217 to be administered in this study (30 mg) was determined based on the 
maximum tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects, 
and is the same dose level that has been  used and generally well tolerated in clinical studies in 
various patient populations, including patients with MDD. Due to the observed improved 
tolerability of sedation/somnolence effects when taken in the evening  in previous clinical studies,

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open-label) and Part B (randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of 
Part A data.The metho ds of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. The study is 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  and efficacy of SAGE-217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder , who are currently experiencing an MDE.  
Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM -5 for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, and valproic acid only) that have been taken at the same dose for at least 60 days prior to Day 1 are to continue the stable dose throughout the treatment period. 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). All assessments to be performed are summarized in Table 1. 
If at any time during the study, a subject has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will 
clinically assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from stu dy drug and 
treated as clinically appropriate (see Section  8.3).  
Part A  
The study design for Part A is presented in Figure 1 . In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -
217. Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self -administer 30-mg SAGE -217 once daily in 
the evening with food for 14 days. Dose adjustments based on study drug tolerability are permitted following the guidelines outlined in Section  7.4. 
 
Figure 1: Study Design (Part A)  
 
 
 
QD = once daily  
A dose adjustment to 20- mg SAGE -217 is permitted if the 30 -mg dose is not tolerated at any time.  
 
Part B  
The study design for Part B is presented in Figure  2. In Part B, subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on use of mood 
stabilizers (Y/N). Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self- administer the study drug Day -28 to -1

8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
8.3.1. Withdrawal from the Study  or Discontinuation of Study Drug 
Subjects may discontinue study drug  or withdraw from the study at any time for any reason . The 
Investigator may discontinue the subject from the study or study drug for a ny of the following 
reasons:  
• The subject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 33  • The subject experiences an intolerable AE  
• Other medical  or safety  reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the 
Medical Monitor 
In addition, if at any time during the study, a subject has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator 
will clinically assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is 
consistent with hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and treated as clinically appropriate. These incidents will be documented as AEs.  
The reasons for study drug discontinuation and/or subject withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form ( eCRF ). The Investigator must notify the 
Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a subject has discontinued or been withdrawn for any reason. 
Subjects who discontinue study drug early /withdraw  during the treatment period should, if 
possible, have an end of treatment  (EOT) visit, including the EO T assessments as summarized in 
the Schedule of Events  (Table 1). The EOT visit should be scheduled as soon as possible, 
preferably the day after the subject’s last dose. All details of the EOT visit should be recorded in 
the subject’s medical source documents. For subjects that discontinue study drug early, follow-
up visits should take place every [ADDRESS_969727] should return for an early termination (ET) visit. 
The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and 
terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for 
both visits will be conducted only once.  
If the subject fails or refuses to return to the study center, an attempt must be made to contact [CONTACT_582458]. All 
data collected over the telephone must be documented and kept in the subject’s record. A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up after [ADDRESS_969728]'s source documents.

Elective surgeries or procedures are prohibited during participation in the study. 
9.3. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 (Parts A and B)  or placebo (Part B only) will be self-administered by [CONTACT_712743]. Sites  will disp ense study drug to the subjects to take at home with 
instructions for use ( Section  10.4).   
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform 
used on smartphones to visua lly confirm medication ingestion. S ubjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will 
follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front- facing webcam to visually confirm the ir 
ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time of study drug 
administration by [CONTACT_15994] , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to each visit during the 
treatment peri od, at which time the Investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the 
kit contains sufficient doses until the next scheduled dispensation. 
If the subject is persistently noncompliant with the study drug, the Investigator should discuss 
with S age Therapeutics  the potential discontinuation of the subject ( Section  8.3). Dosing 
requirements will be reviewed with each subject  during all study contacts. The authorized study 
personnel conducting the re- education must document the process in the subject source records. 
9.4. Randomization and Blinding

Part A is an open- label design in which all subjects will receive SAGE -217. 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 37  Part B  
Part B  is a randomized , double-blind, placebo- controlled , parallel group des ign. Subjects who 
meet the entrance criteria will be stratified based on use of mood stabilizers (Y/N)  and randomly 
assigned within each stratum in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE-217 or matched placebo. Subjects, 
clinicians, and the study team will be blinded  to treatment allocation. Randomization will be 
performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system. 
Randomization schedules will be generated by [CONTACT_55467]. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE-217 or placebo) will be based on the randomization schedule. The 
randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding.  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only if  the safety of a subject is at  risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. See Section  12.[ADDRESS_969733] is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the

All assessments will be conducte d according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). 
11.1. Efficacy A ssessment s 
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM- D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from  baseline in the 17- item HAM -D total score at 
Day 15 .  
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression  in subjects who are identified  
as experiencing an MDE  (Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments  for an individual subject.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM- D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
The HAM -D subject interview may be  audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.2. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_969737] to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brough t on by [CONTACT_712714].  Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum o f the ten individual item scores.  
The MADRS subject interview may be audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.3. Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate  
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of [ADDRESS_969738] 2 items are being used in this study.  
The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S) uses a [ADDRESS_969739]’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969740] is assessed 
on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline 
mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill (Busner 2007a ).  
The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI- I) employs a [ADDRESS_969741]’s condition posttreatment. The Investigator will rate the subject’s total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response 
choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally 
improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse (Busner 2007b). The CGI- I is only rated at posttreatment assessments. By [CONTACT_108], all CGI -I 
assessments are evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having 
a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or “much improved.”  
11.1.4. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe) , satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral , 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfi ed), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all,

12.1. Safety Parameters  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -217 will be assessed  by [CONTACT_712736]; 
changes  from  baseline in  clinical  laboratory measures,  vital signs,  and ECGs;  suicidal  ideation  
and behavior using the C- SSRS; and  the YMRS.  All assessments will be conducted according to 
the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status, 
highest education level , marital/civil status) and a full medical history , including family 
psychiatric history, will be documented. The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be 
determined using the SCID-5-C T. 
12.1.2. Weight and Height 
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examination s assessing body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive  and neurological examinations and mental status 
examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual is to 
perform all physical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief physical examinations 
may also be conducte d per the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. New or worsening abnormalitie s that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as 
AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supi[INVESTIGATOR_712672]. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supi[INVESTIGATOR_712659] [ADDRESS_969742], with the blood sample collected as close to the scheduled time as possible. 
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12-lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate. The standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be recorded. When ECG  sample collection occur durin g the same visit, the ECGs will be conducted first.

The central laboratory will perfor m laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is responsible 
for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronical ly 
to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by [CONTACT_135482].  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_712744]. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged 
to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. A 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality following subject randomization will be followed 
until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been 
obtained. 
Follicle stimulating hormone testing will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a female 
subject with ≥[ADDRESS_969743]- menopausal (Section  8.1).

A serum pregnancy test in women of child- bearing potential will be conducted at Screening and 
a urine pregnancy test will be conducted at all other scheduled timepoints ( Table 1).  
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_969744] severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table 1. 
12.1.8. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
Manic symptoms will be assess ed during the study using the YMRS ( Young 1978). The 
clinician -administered scale is based on 11 items of core symptoms of mania. Four of the items 
(irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are graded on a scale of 
0 to 8 (choices given as even numbers), with the remaining 7 items graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Scoring between the points given (whole or half points) is possible.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any u ntoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable med ical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the value represents a clinically significant change from baseline as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
All AEs that occur afte r any subject has signed the informed consent form and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeutics.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  [IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical oc currence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled and throughout the duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE form provided by [CONTACT_712745] [ADDRESS_969745] awareness (Section 12.5). All SAEs should to be followed 
until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered clinically significant 
or the subject was lost to follow-up. 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse event ( not related, poss ibly related or probably related) . The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at least “possibly related.”  
Table 4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the sus pected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 48  If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7200] . The AE ter m should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
wheth er or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS]. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
[ADDRESS_969746]’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject 
is participating in  the study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (sponta neous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (eg, spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should follow the pr ocedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage, or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage, or designee, within [ADDRESS_969747] awareness of the event by [CONTACT_712746]/or his staff on the SAE report form. The Investigator must complete, sign and 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -201 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 49  date the SAE report form , verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report 
form  with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or des ignee .  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics , or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study file. 
Any SAEs discovered by [CONTACT_712719], should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee, according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact [CONTACT_712739]/or pregnancies is located in the study reference 
manual.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible 
for notifying its ethics committee of these S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  In addition, appropriate SAGE  Drug Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or designee, will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting. SAGE , or designee, will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) 
to regulatory agencies according to local law. SAGE , or designee, will submit S[LOCATION_003]R s to 
investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_135491] a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
admi nistered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs without 
Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later than the 
next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblindi ng must be clearly 
documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the 
unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by [CONTACT_712721], according to standard operating procedures. The blinding of the 
study will be broken after the database has been locked. Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_712680].  
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor if unblinding is warranted for medical management of the subject. If there is agreement 
to unblind treatment assignment, the unblinding procedure described in the Safety Management 
Plan for the study will be followed. If the Investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_712747] a medical emergency, and it is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_737], the treatment group for that subject may be unblinded in the IRT system. 
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the

using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include center, treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time 
point- by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD -[ADDRESS_969750]- baseline time 
points will be included in the model. The primary comparison will be between SAGE- 217 and 
matching placebo at Day 15. Model- based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% 
confidence intervals, and p values) will be reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be 
used to model the within- subject errors. In case of convergence issues, other covariance 
structures will be considered; this will be detailed in the statistical analyses plan. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods.  
Other efficacy analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. In general, data will be 
analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics or pre -specified statistical methods as 
applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless other wise specified.  
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -217 will be assessed by [CONTACT_712722]; 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, and ECGs. Suicidal ideation 
and behavior will be evaluated using the C -SSRS. Mania will be evaluated using the YMRS. 
Safety data will be listed by [CONTACT_712723] . All safety summaries 
will be performed on the S afety Set .

Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by [CONTACT_3598].  
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO-DD) September 2015, or later .  
Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing beyond the 
initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation of 
the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incom plete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring visits to the study site will be made periodically during the study to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The investigator and the study site guarantee access to source documents by [CONTACT_712748]’s designee and by t he IRB or IEC.  
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by [CONTACT_712748]’s designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s Binder, study drug, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, and 
review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the investigator and other 
study personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics , a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported accord ing to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_712729] a regulatory agency 
about an inspection. 
14.3. Protocol Deviations 
Investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will 
require deviation from protocol- specified pr ocedures, the investigator should consult with the 
Sage Therapeutics or sponsor’s designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate 
course of action. There will be no exemptions (a prospectively approved deviation) from the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria.

 6  Study Description:   
This study will be conducted in 2 sequential parts: Part A (open-label) and Part B (randomized, double -
blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group). Part B will be initiated pending the review of Part A data. 
The methods of the 2 parts will be identical unless otherwise noted. Subjects who participate in Part A 
will not be allowed to participate in Part B. The study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability,  
and efficacy of SAGE -217 in adult subjects with bipolar I/II disorder , who are currently experiencing 
an MDE.   
The assessments are summarized in the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
Screening begins with the signing of t he informed consent form at the Screening Visit . The diagnosis 
of bipolar I or II disorder  will be made using the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) for clinical trials (SCID-5-CT) 
performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  
Beginning on Day 1, qualified subjects will self -administer  the study drug once daily in the evening 
with food for 14 days. In Part A, all subjects will receive SAGE -217. For Part B, subjects will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or placebo; randomization will be stratified based on 
use of mood stabilizers (Y/N) . Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, 
and valproic acid only) that have been taken at the same d ose for at least [ADDRESS_969766] has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will clinically assess the subject for a manic or hypomanic switch. If the clinical assessment is consistent with 
hypomania or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and treated as clinically 
appropriate. These incidents will be documented  as AEs.  
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in 
Table  1. 
Number of Subjects (planned):   
Part A: Approximately 30 subjects will be dosed . 
Part B: Approxim ately 132 subjects will be randomized and dosed  to obtain a total of 112 evaluable 
subjects.

 10  Statistical methods:   
A separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) for each part (Part s A and B) will provide a detailed 
description of the analyses to be performed in the respective part of the study. The SAP s will be 
finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following 
database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
General: 
The data from Part s A and B will be analyzed separately. For the purpose of all safety and efficacy 
analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last available measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  
Analysis Sets:  
Randomized set (Part B only) will be defined as all subjects who are randomized. This analysis set will 
be used of all data listings in Part B. Data listings for Part A will be based on Safety or Efficacy Set, as 
appropriate.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects received at least [ADDRESS_969782] -baseline 
HAM-D evaluation, will be used to analyze efficacy data unless otherwise specified. 
 
Safety Analysis:   
The overall incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_10607] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. Data for vital signs, clinical laboratory measurements, ECG, and concomitant medication usage will also be summarized.  
Safety data will be summarized and examined for possible relationships between subject characteristics and plasma SAGE -217 concentrations, as appropriate. Suicidality data collected using the C -SSRS and 
evaluation of mania collected using the YMRS at baseline and at each visit during the active Treatment Period will be listed for all subjects. Out-of -range safety endpoints may be categorized as low or high, 
where applicable. Subjects will be summarized according to treatment received for the purpose of safety.  
Efficac y Analysis:   
The primary endpoint in Part B, the change from baseline in HAM -D total score, will be analyzed 
using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment 
as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be considered as fixed effects and the subject effect will be considered random in the model. All post -baseline time points will be included in the 
mode l. The primary comparison will be between SAGE -217 and matching placebo at Day 15 . Model -
based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be 
reported. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. Other 
continuous endpoints will be analyzed using similar methods.  
Other efficacy analyses, including those in Part A, will be specified in the SAP. In general, data will be 
analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics o r pre-specified statistical methods as applicable; 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-[ADDRESS_969783] listings will be provided for all efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment for the purpose of efficacy unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
 
 
 
Sample Size Calculation 
Part A: The sample size of  approximately 30 subjects was selected based on clinical and not statistical 
considerations.  
Part B : Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 112 total evaluable subjects (56 per 
treatment group) would provide 80% power to detect a place bo-adjusted treatment difference of 
approximately [ADDRESS_969784] deviation (SD) of 7.5 points.  
Assuming a 15% dropout rate, approximately [ADDRESS_969785]-baseline HAM -D assessment. 
Additional subjects may be randomiz ed if the drop- out rate is higher than 15%.

 22  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Bipolar D isorders and Unmet Medical Need 
Bipolar disorder is a chronic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_712646] ( Sachs 2007). The Global Burden of Disease Study revealed that in 2013, there were 
48.8 million cases of bipolar disorder globally ( Ferrari 2016). Bipolar disorder accounted for 
9.9 million disability -adjusted life years (DALYs)  globally, explaining 0.4% of total DALYs and 
1.3% of total years lived with disability.  
There are subtypes of bipolar d isorder; this study includes the bipolar I and II subtypes. Bipolar I 
is characterized by a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], whereas bipolar II is characterized by a hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The difference in the severity of the manic features relies on functional impairment that is caused 
by [CONTACT_712706][INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( DSM -5). The National Comorbidity Survey estimate of the lifetime 
prevalence of bipolar disorder is 2.1% in the US population when bipolar I d isorder and 
bipolar II Disorder are combined ( Merikangas 2007).  
While the manic or hypomanic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712647], evidence suggests that depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712687] r I and 
II are associated with more disability than any other aspect of the illness. A seminal long -term 
study of patients with b ipolar I disorder demonstrated that over the 13-year follow-up period, 
patients were symptomatic about 47% of the time, and depressive symptoms were present in 
32% of the follow-up weeks vs manic features, which were present in 9% ( Judd 2002). A similar 
analysis in patients with bipolar II disorder with a longer follow up of up to 20 years found that 
patients were symptomatic more than half of the time (54%) where  depressive symptoms 
dominated the course at 50% of the follow-up weeks versus 1.3% for the hypomanic symptoms (Judd 2003). A study in patients with unipolar depression found a prevalence of depressive 
symptoms 47% of the time ( Judd 1998), suggesting a comparable time spent with depressive 
symptoms in the bipolar spectrum. These naturalistic studies have also found that about half the time patients reported taking psychotropic medications. In another large-scale study with a 
follow-up period of up to 2 years, 58% of nearly 1500 patients with bipolar disorder who were 
symptomatic at study entry achieved recovery ( Perlis 2006). Similarly, during the follow -up 
period, 49% of these individuals experienced recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], whe re depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(38%) outweighed manic, hypomanic, or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_712649] (13.8%). In the Stanley 
Foundation Bipolar Network Study, in which year-long, daily clinician ratings were included, despi[INVESTIGATOR_712650] 4.1 psychotropic medications, patients with bipolar disorder 
spent 3 times as much time with depressive symptoms as manic symptoms ( Post 2003).  
There are only 3 medications approved in the US for the treatment of bipolar depression, (lurasidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -fluoxetine combination, and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), all of which include atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712651]. None of the currently available antidepressants are indicated for bipolar depression due to their limited efficacy, and the possibility that their use may be associated with a manic switch and rapid 
cycling. While some studies reported varying levels of efficacy with antidepressants 
(Gijsman  2004), a large -scale, double-blind, placebo- controlled clinical trial sponsored by [CONTACT_712707] , The Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for 
Bipolar Disorder (STEP -BD), found that only 23.5% of patients with bipolar depression 
receiving a mood stabilizer and adjunctive antidepressants versus 27.3% of those receiving a 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  mood stabilizer and placebo experienced a durable recovery, confirming the lack of effectiveness 
of antidepressants in bipolar depression ( Sachs 2007). The tolerability profile of the approved 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_712688]. 
In 1998, the lifetime cost of bipolar disorder in the US was estimated at $[ADDRESS_969796] of a 
single manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_712653]  $11,720 to $624,785 for persons with 
nonresponsive/chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( Begley 1998); the cost of bipolar depression  specifically, is less 
well studied, however, available estimates indicate a higher cost associated with bipolar 
depression than for mania ( Bowden 2004).  
Kessler h as studied the impact of mood disorders on work performance in a representative 
sample of over 3,000 US workers ( Kessler 2006 ). Bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder 
were associated with 65.[ADDRESS_969797] rum of bipolar disorder. In particular, they also highlight the importance of successful 
depressive symptom control, and an unmet need in the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712654] I and bipolar II disorder. 
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a positive allos teric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors, the 
major class of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 
in mi
ce and rats, SAGE -[ADDRESS_969798] good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was 
highly selective for GABA
A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor 
potentiators (Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity 
when administered in vivo. 
Data from an open- label portion of the Phase 2a study of SAGE-217 administered to subjects 
with moderate to seve re major depressive disorder (MDD)  showed clinically significant 
improvements from baseline in depression scale scores (HAM -D, Montgomery-Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], and Clinical Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as 
early as Day 2 of the 14-day treatment period, with durable responses following the end of 
treatment. This result was further supported by [CONTACT_712708], double-blind portion of this 
study (N=89) in which a rapid and substantial decrease in HAM- D scores was observed at 
Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other 
efficacy scales, including MADRS  and CGI -I. Statistically significant differences from the 
placebo group favoring the SAGE-[ADDRESS_969799] common 
treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
AEs were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. As of the Investigator’s Brochure cut -off 
date (24 September 2018), among the over [ADDRESS_969800] with essential tremor experienced a serious 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  adverse event (SAE) of transient confus ion leading to discontinuation of study drug. No other 
SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
Non-serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with SAGE -217. Given the outcome of  the Phase 2 study  of SAGE -217 in  subjects with  
MDD and the current significant unmet need  in the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_712669] I/II disorders, a favorable risk -benefit  balance and  investigation of SAGE -217 in  
patients  with  bipolar I/II  disorders are  justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
The dose of SAGE-217 to be administered in this study (30 mg) was determined based on the maximum tolerated dose in the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects, and is the same dose level that has been  used and generally well tolerated in clinical studies in 
various patient populations, including patients with MDD. Due to the observed improved tolerability of sedation/somnolence effects when taken in the evening in previous clinical studies,

Screening begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. T he 
diagnosis of bipolar I or  II 
disorder will be  made using the Structured C lini cal Interview f or 
DSM -5 for clinical trials (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Subjects on antidepressants or mood stabilizers (lamotrigine, lithium, and valproic acid only) that 
have been t aken
 at the same dos e for at least 60  days prior t o Day 1 are to cont inue the stable 
dose throughout the treatm
ent period. 
Subjects w ill return to the study center during  the treatment and  follow -up periods as outlin ed in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 1). A ll asses sments to be  performed ar e summarized in Table 1. 
If at any time during the study, a subject has a YMRS score of ≥13, the Investigator will 
clinically as sess the  subject f or a manic or  hypo manic switch.  If the clinical assessm ent is 
consistent with hypoma
nia or mania, the subject will be discontinued from study drug and 
treated as clinically appr opriate (s ee Section  8.3). 
Part A 
The study design f or Part A is presented in Figure 1. I n P art A, all subjects will receive

 41  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table  1). 
11.1. Efficacy Assessment s 
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in the 17 -item HAM -D total score at 
Day 15.  
The 17- item H AM-D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are identified  
as experiencing an MDE  (Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), soma tic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM- D assessments for an individual subject.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculate d as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM- D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale sco res will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
The HAM -D subject interview may be audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.2. Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a [ADDRESS_969831] to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive than the Hamilton Scale to the changes brought on by [CONTACT_712714].  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the ten individual item scores.  
The MADRS subject interview may be audio-recorded for independent quality control purposes. 
11.1.3. Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’ s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of [ADDRESS_969832] 2 items are being used in this study.  
The Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI- S) uses a [ADDRESS_969833]’s illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-[ADDRESS_969834] is assessed 
on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline 
mentally ill; 3=m ildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill 
(Busner 2007a ).  
The Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) employs a 7- point Likert scale to 
measure the overall improvement in the subject’s condition posttreatment. The Investigator will 
rate the subject’s total improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally 
improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse 
(Busner 2007b). The CGI -I is only rated at posttreatment assessments. By [CONTACT_108], all CGI -I 
assessments are evaluated against baseline conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having 
a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or “much improved.”  
11.1.4. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral, 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied),  and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning ( 0 = not at all, 
1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinically significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”

12.1. Safety Param eters  
The safety  and tolerability  of SAGE -217 will be assessed  by [CONTACT_712754] s; 
changes from  baseline in clinical  laboratory  measures,  vital signs, and ECGs;  suicidal  ideation  
and behavior using the  C-SSRS; and the YMRS.  All assessment s will be conducted according to 
the schedule of a ssessments (Table  1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status, 
highest education level , marital/civil status) and a full medical history , including family 
psychiatric history, will be documented. The diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder will be 
determined using the SCID-5- CT. 
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; 
abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental status 
examinations will b e conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual is to 
perform all physical examinations for a given subject. Unscheduled brief physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, and 
urinalysis. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is responsible 
for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically 
to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by [CONTACT_135482].  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_712717]. Any abnormalities identified prior to first d ose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s referen ce range will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_7248], not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, 
clinically significant (CS) in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged 
to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE s, assessed according to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. A 
clinically significant laboratory abnormality following subject randomization will be followed 
until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory e xplanation has been 
obtained. 
Follicle stimulating hormone testing will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a female 
subject with ≥[ADDRESS_969836]- menopausal (Section 8.1 ).

Urine toxicology will be performe d for selected drugs of abuse, and a breath test will be 
performed for alcohol ( Table  1). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Screen  
A serum pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential will be conducted at Screening and 
a urine pregnancy test will be conducted at all other scheduled timepoints ( Table  1).  
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C- SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for a ssessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from [ADDRESS_969837] severe) .  

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 mont hs). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table  1. 
12.1.8. Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) 
Manic symptoms will be assessed during the study using the YMRS ( Young 1978). The 
clinician -administered scale is based on 11 items of core symptoms of mania. Four of the items 
(irritability, speech, thought content, and disruptive/aggressive behavior) are graded on a scale of 
0 to 8 (choices given as even numbers), with the remaining 7 items graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Scoring between the points given (whole or half points) is possible.  
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, inc luding baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug. The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the value represents a clinically 
significant change from baseline as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the informed consent form and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any othe r medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 48  listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatm ent in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled and throughout the duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE form provided by [CONTACT_712755] [ADDRESS_969838] awareness (Section 12.5). All SAEs should to be followed 
until the event reso lved, the condition stabilized, was no longer cons idered clinically significant 
or the subject was lost to follow -up. 
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse event ( not related, possibly related or probably related). The In vestigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at least “possibly related.”   
Table  4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship Definition 
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction might ha ve been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follo ws a known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adver se event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235]. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 49  • Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Seve re (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_49900]  [IP_ADDRESS]. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
[ADDRESS_969839]’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject is participating in  the study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth , or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy in itse lf is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (eg, spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnanc y meets the 
criteria for immediat e classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs must be reported to Sage , or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage , or designee, within [ADDRESS_969840] awareness of the event by [CONTACT_36284]/or his staff  on the SAE report form. The Investigator must complete, sign and 
date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report 
form  with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee .  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage Therapeutics, or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow- up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the CRF and/or study 
file. 
Any SAEs discovered by [CONTACT_712719], 
should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee, according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact [CONTACT_712739]/or pregnancies is located in the study reference 
manual.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-BPD-201 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 50  serious, adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical study . Each site is responsible 
for notifying its ethics committee of these S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  In addition, appropriate SAGE  Drug Safety 
and Pharmacovigilance personnel , or designee, will unblind S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the purpose of 
regulatory reporting. SAGE , or designee, will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) 
to regulatory agencies according to local law. SAGE , or designee, will subm it S[LOCATION_003]Rs to 
investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug 
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a s ubject is at immediate 
risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_135491] a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the treatment 
administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs without 
Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the sour ce records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for the 
unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by [CONTACT_712721], according to standard operating procedures. The blinding of the 
study w ill be broken after the database has been locked. Electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_712661].  
In the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy, the Investigator will discuss with the Medical Monitor if unblinding is warranted for medical management of the subject. If there is agreement to unblind treatment assignment, the unblinding procedure described in the Safety Management 
Plan for the study will be followed. If the Investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_199193] a medical emergency, and it is deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_737], the treatment group for that subject may be unblinded in the IRT system. 
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from the study.

Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the initiation of 
the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after the first dose 
of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Monitoring visits to the study site will be made periodically during the study to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed. Source documents will be reviewed for verification of data recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The investigator and the study site guarantee access to source documents by [CONTACT_712727]’s designee and by [CONTACT_4186]. 
All aspects of t he study and its documentation will be subject to review by [CONTACT_712728]’s designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the 
Investigator’s Binder, study drug, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, and review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the investigator and other 
study personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to 
the process.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorize d representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clini cal Practice guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_7240] a regulatory agency about an inspection. 
14.3. Protocol Deviations 
Investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will 
require deviation from protocol- specified procedures, the investigator shou ld consult with the 
Sage Therapeutics or sponsor’s designee (and IRB, as required) to determine the appropriate 
course of action. There will be no exemptions (a prospectively approved deviation) from the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria.

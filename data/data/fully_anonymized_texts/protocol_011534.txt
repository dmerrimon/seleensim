  1.0 Background  & Rationale  
Endoscopic resection of large benign lesions is the preferred treatment over surgical resection.  
Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is associated with a lower risk and cost compared to surgical treatment.  However, it is important that patients undergo en doscopic follow -up after 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_558076] 6 months because there is an approximately 25% risk of recurrence of adenoma polyps 
1. 
   
A randomized controlled trial in only [ADDRESS_732713] Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) versus Snare Tip Soft Coagulation (STSC) vs no treatment.  In a previous trial of APC, the recurrence rate of  the control arm was very high at 67%. With only 24 patients in the study 
the actual benefits of APC remain uncertain.  The previous study using STSC was a non-randomized trial.  In this trial we hope to provide definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of APC and STSC vs control.

IRB#: [PHONE_11603]  
 
 
Version Date: September 3rd, 2020  Page 4 of 13 
 
  Hypothesis:  
APC or STSC treatment of the perimeter of the EMR defect will reduce the 
recurrence rate of adenomas when compared to our control of no treatment.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objective  
Time it takes to apply each respective treatment (APC or STSC)  
Number of complications for each randomization arm. Examples include bleeding, perforation, pain or post polypectomy syndrome. 
Cost analysis detailing the effectiveness of the treatment versus the cost of each 
therapeutic device (argon probe vs. snare).

Version Date: September 3rd, 2020  Page 5 of 13 
 
  treatment time will be recorded as the time, after initial polyp resection, that the 
randomized treatment instrument comes into view until before clips are applied. Complications will be assessed during the follow-up call simply by [CONTACT_558087]. We will use the following definitions to ascertain complications:
 
Bleeding : severe bleeding event that required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a blood transfusion, 
a colonoscopy, surgery, or any other invasive intervention to control bleeding, and 
that occurred after the patient left the endoscopy unit and within 30 days after 
completion of the colonoscopy Perforation : 
 iatrogenic full thickness defect in the colon wall diagnosed within 
two weeks of the procedure Pain: 
Any pain perceived by [CONTACT_558088] [ADDRESS_732716] 
polypectomy syndrome: Abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis and peritoneal 
inflammation in the abse nce of perforation within two weeks of the procedure 
Our cost analysis will then take all of these endpoints into account to report which method we found to be more affective. As stated, this will be based on the instrument cost, treatment time, polyp recurrence, and reported complications.

4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• Pedunculated lesions  
• Inflammatory bowel disease  
• Inability to provide informed consent  
• Lesions less than 15mm in largest dimension 
 
5.[ADDRESS_732717] prior  approval of the study site's Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). Failure to obtain informed consent renders the subject ineligible  for the study. 
 Patients who have provided informed consented and are scheduled to undergo endoscopic 
mucosal resection (EMR) of lesions 15mm and larger will be enrolled in the study. During the 
procedure randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_558089][INVESTIGATOR_558077] (at least one sessile polyp greater than [ADDRESS_732718] dimension 
measured by [CONTACT_558090]). The three arms of randomization are STSC ([ADDRESS_732719] 5) vs APC 
(preferred settings) vs No Treatment of the perimeter of the EMR  site. The randomization list,

7.0 Study Calendar  
Index procedure will be the day of colonoscopy where one of the intervention arms or the control 
arm is administered. Patients will receive a follow-up phone call at 30 -days (+ 7  days) to 
ascertain any complications as previously described. Patients will also receive a follow -up 
colonoscopy (standard of care for large polyp removal) where the polypectomy site is observed for any recurrence.  
 Index procedure Follow -up phone 
call Follow-up colonoscopy 
Day 1  Day 30 + [ADDRESS_732722] to follow- up: All patients who are randomized to one of the interventions but fail to 
complete the required follow-up colonoscopy. Failure to contact [INVESTIGATOR_136] [ADDRESS_732723] to follow-up (complications information in such cases will be deemed acceptable if collected at the first  follow-up but an accurate accounting of the number of such patients will 
be kept and reported to the DSMB).  
8.0 Reportable Events  
All adverse events meeting prompt reporting criteria will be reported to the IRB within 5 business days of the study team becoming aware of the event. An adverse event meeting prompt

Version Date: September 3rd, 2020  Page 9 of 13 
 
  reporting criteria for this study is defined as any event assessed by [CONTACT_978], or appropriately 
trained and qualified designee, as (1) unexpected, (2) related or possibly related to study participation, AND (3) suggesting that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm than was previously known. The period for assessing AE’s will be from the point of inserting the colonoscope until [ADDRESS_732724] comprises 4 members : Charles J. Kahi MD (Indiana University), 
Huipi[INVESTIGATOR_558080] (Indiana Universtiy), Cyrus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_558081] (Henry Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and Joseph B. 
Elmunzer MD  (Chair) , (Medical University of South Carolina ). None of the board members are 
involved with the current study in any capacity. Additionally, [CONTACT_535795]'s research team will provide him up to date information regarding the status of patients and any reportable events.  
 The data collected at sites other than  IU will be de -identified before being sent to us.
 Each site 
will enter their data in to a secure web application (REDCap), which will then be accessed at the 
primary site. Only de -identified data from external sites will be added to the database (no HIPAA  
identifiers will be collected from external sites besides procedure dates and de- identified images 
of study lesions). Any other communication that is not patient related will be done over email or phone. 
Variables that will be transmitted from the other s ite include:  
• Information from the procedure to remove the large polyp 
 This includes information about meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, procedure 
date, randomization envelope number/randomization treatment, age, gender, race,

  ethnicity, whether a fellow was involved in the procedure (and which parts of 
procedure, if appl icable), procedure times, study polyp characteristics, de -
identified study lesion images, resection times, information about the resection such as snare/ injection fluid usage and number of resected pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928], treatment times, other additional treatments used , clippi[INVESTIGATOR_8071], number/type of clips used, 
type of colonoscope used, [LOCATION_011] Bowel Preparation Score, whether fibrosis was present, whether there were any prior attempts at resection, information about 
procedural complications (if any), and study polyp pa thology results  
• Information from the 30 day follow up call  
 This includes information about whether the follow -up phone call was made 
successfully, date subject was reached by [CONTACT_648], and whether patient reported 
experiencing adverse events (and if so, infor mation about the adverse event).  
 Information from the first follow -up procedure  
 This includes information about the previous EMR site, date of follow -up 
procedure, pathology results from residual or recurrent polyp tissue found at previous EMR site (if applicable), and  pathology results from biopsies obtained 
from previous EMR site  
 
10.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
Any subject who wishes to withdraw from this investigation on his/her own accord and for 
whatever reason is entitled to do so without obligation and prejudice to further treatment. In addition, the Investigator may decide for reasons of medical prudence, to withdraw a subject. In either event, the Investigator will clearly document the date and reason(s) for the subject’s

was related to the study interventions.
 
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
Assuming a 25% recurrence rate of the control arm, and a reduction to 10% in both of the 
treatment arms, we estimate that a sample size of 115 subjects per arm will be needed to demonstrate that APC and STSC are superior to no treatment for reduction of re currence rate 
after EMR, based on 80% power and a two- sided 5% significance level for comparison of 
independent proportions with one interim analysis.  The no treatment arm will be used as our control. In order to account for drop- outs, an extra [ADDRESS_732725] will be 
randomized in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_732726] been randomized study- wide with a potential to randomize up to 10 0 patients. Randomization numbers will be 
assigned as follows: IU will be assigned numbers 001 – 095 and 496 -  526; AdventHealth 
Orlando will be assigned 096 – 145 and 446 -  470; The Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558082] 146 – 195; Dartmouth- Hitchcock Medical Center will be assigned numbers 196 – 245; 
NYU Langone M edical Center will assigned numbers 246 – 295 and 471 -  495; the Mount Sinai

  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558083] 296 – 345, Sibley Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_558083] 346 – 395, the 
University of Kansas Medical Center will be assigned 396 – 445, and Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center will be assigned 546 -  595. The proportion of subjects with 
recurrence will be compared between study arms using chi -square tests. The number of 
complications will be compared among treatment arms using negative binomial r egression. 
Treatment times and costs will be compared between the APC and STSC arms using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests. A 5% significance level will be used for all tests. 
 
Interim analysis and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  
The interim analysis will be conducted after half of  the subjects have completed the study, using 
an O’Brien -Fleming spending function with alpha levels 0.003 and 0.049 at the interim and final 
analyses. Any results will be considered significant at a p- value of <=0.[ADDRESS_732727] from the endoscopy area. Each site will enter their data in to a secure web application (REDCap). V irtual data will be stored on an 
internal network drive with encryption and password security. Only approved personnel by [CONTACT_558091].  This file will also not have any identifiable patient information.  A study log with the identifiable information will be kept in a separate folder to enable the investigators to assist in any research audit. No procedural data except the date of examination w ill be entered into this log.

  The storage location on IU servers will be backed u p automatically and continuously. Quality 
assurance steps will include  built in range checks for a ge, procedure duration, lesion size, total 
resection time, treatment time, clippi[INVESTIGATOR_558084] 190 patients.    Remote study site visit:  
Before interim analysis and after completion of the study by 190 patients, 10% of case report 
forms from each site will be verified with the site’s electronic medical system information via a 
video based call from the central data site (IU). Any patterns of systematic errors will trigger the verification of all case report forms for that particular site.

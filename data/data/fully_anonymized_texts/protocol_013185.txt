STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, open -label study to evaluate the safety  and 
effectiveness of IV CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after 
each dialysis session. This study will consist of a Screening Period and 
an up to 12- week Treatment P eriod. The Screening Period includes a 
Screening Visit and a Run- In Period . After the completion of the 
Treatment Period , patients will be required to complete a Follow-up 
Visit.  
Screening Period  
Screening Visit:  
Informed consent will be obtained prior to performing any study-specific procedures.  The Screening Visit will occur within 21 days 
prior to the start of the Run -in Period.  Patients should be trained on 
completing patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionna ires prior to the 
start of the Run-in Period. The site has the option of starting the Run -in 
Period on the same day as the Screening V isit at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  
Run-In Period:  
Patients will start the Run -in Period during the week prior to T reatment  
Period  to complete eligibility  verification . The Run- in Period will start 
on the first dialysis session of that week (i.e, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for p atients 
on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule). The primary 
purpose of the Run- in Period is to confirm that each patient has 
moderate- to-severe pruritus (ie, weekly average worst itch ing score 
>5), as measured by [CONTACT_857174] a baseline itch intensity. During the Run-in Period, 
patients will complete the  Worst Itching Intensity NRS and Sleep 
Quality questionnaires only on the dialysis days and the EQ -5D-5L 
with EQ -PSO bolt on (EQ-5D-5L-P) on the third dialysis session.   
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 8 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 If patients continue to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_857175] -in Period, they will enter the 
Treatment Period  of the study.   
Treatment Period : Day [ADDRESS_1193945] treatment week (ie, Monday for 
patients on a Monday -Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule, or Tuesday 
for patient s on a Tuesday -Thursday- Saturday dialysis schedule).  
Before the first dose of CR845 , patients will complete their Worst 
Itching Intensity NRS  and a series of itch -related quality of life and 
sleep questionnaires (ie, Sleep Quality , 5D Itch , Skindex-10, and EQ -
5D-5L-P questionnaires).   
All scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period  will be 
conducted on dialysis days.  Patients will be administered CR845 as an 
IV bolus after the end of their dialysis, either during rinse back or 
after rinse back .  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], infections, missed dialysis 
sessions, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital 
signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications will be monitored 
throughout the study.  
End of treatment (EOT) is defined as the first day of dialysis following 
the last dose of drug. The EOT procedures will be conducted on the 
dialysis visit following the last dose of study dru g.   
Follow -up Visit  
A final safety Follow -up Visit will be conducted 7- 10 days after the 
EOT or Early Termination ( ET) Visit.  
  
STUDY DRUG  Study drug will be supplied in glass vials containing an extractable 
volume of at least 1.3 mL of CR845 at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL 
in 0.04M isotonic acetate buffer, pH 4.5.  CR845 dose will be 
calculated and adjusted based on prescription dry body weight.  
REFERENCE 
PRODUCT  No placebo will be used for this study.  
TREATMENT

CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 In nonclinical studies, CR845 has been shown to exhibit antipruritic and 
anti-inflammatory properties [ Investigator’s Brochure ].   Thus, CR845 is intended to 
reduce the severity of itching in hemodialysis patients and thereby [CONTACT_273578][INVESTIGATOR_857163]. 
4.2 Clinical Experience 
4.2.1 Overall Exposure 
As of October 2018, the intravenous (IV) formulation of CR845 has been evaluated in 
>1440 patients and healthy volunteers across 17 studies (including two Phase 2 studies for 
the relief of moderate -to-severe pruritus and an ongoing long- term safety trials in 
hemodialysis patients conducted in the US).  CR845 has been evaluated both as an IV 
bolus and a 15-minute infusion of single or repeated doses ranging from 0.25 to  40 mcg/kg.  
Of the patients exposed to IV CR845 to date, >[ADDRESS_1193951] received single or repeated IV injections of CR845 doses (for up to 1 year ) ranging from 0. 25 to 6 
mcg/kg across Phase 1 to Phase 3 studies with > 90 and > 30 hemodialysis patients exposed to the intended therapeutic dose of 0.5 mcg/kg for 6 months and for one year, respectively . 
4.2.2 Safety in Hemodialysis Patients 
A review of the aggregate safety data in completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials shows that CR845 was generally well tolerated in hemodialysis patients when administered after each dialysis session for up to 8 weeks at I V doses ranging from 0.5 mcg/kg to 6 mcg/kg.  
Although patients exposed to CR845 reported more adverse events compared with placebo patients, most events were mild or moderate in nature.  Generally mild, transient paresthesias (facial tingling) and/or hypoesthesias (in different anatomic locations), mostly 
on the first week of dosing, as well as headache, dizziness, and somnolence, were the most 
frequently reported adverse events associated with CR845 administration. Consistent with its lack of affinity for  mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] , CR845 did not cause euphoria or respi[INVESTIGATOR_41826].  
The study CR845- CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of 
repeated IV doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8- week treatment period in 
174 hemodialysis patients.  As expected with patients on hemodialysis, a significant 
number of the reported serious adverse events (SAEs) were considered not treatment -
related, but related to the disease and/or comorbid conditions.  Of the 174 patients 
randomized and treated on the study, 31 (17.8%) had treatment- emergent SAEs.  Out of 
these SAE reports, 4 (9%) occurred in 45 placebo -treated patients and 27 (21%) in 
129 CR845-treated patients.  Only 1 SAE of mental status changes (moderate in severity) in a patient who received CR845 1.5 mcg/kg IV was considered by [CONTACT_273579].  However, based on the Sponsor’s medical review, an alternate etiology of urgent/emergent hypertension offers a more plausible explanation for 
the acute change in mental status.  There were 4 patient deaths (1 in placebo group, 1 in 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 18 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 CR845 0.5 mcg/kg group, and 2 in CR845 1.5 mcg/kg group; 2.3% of the total study 
population) in the study, all of which were considered not related to the study drug. In patients with normal renal function, CR845 can cause free- water diuresis (aquaresis) and 
increased  serum sodium.  However, as would be expected in patients undergoing dialysis 
in whom there are few functioning nephrons, there was no evidence of aquaresis or significant increases in serum sodium concentrations.  There were no adverse trends in 
clinical chemistry or hematology values (drawn pre-dialysis), including no apparent 
differences between the placebo and CR845 groups in serum sodium.  There were no discernable differences between treatment groups in vital sign results.  Of particular note, 
among patients receiving CR845, there was no apparent reduction in blood pressure or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_273563]. 
Adverse event summary tables can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure , with further 
details of the safety profile of CR845.   
4.2.3 Efficacy of CR 845 in Hemodialysis Patients with Uremic Pruritus  
The efficacy of CR845 at reducing itch  was evaluated in two Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies (CR845-CLIN2005 [Part B] and 
CR845-CLIN2101). 
CR845-CLIN2005 (Part B) included 65 he modialysis patients with moderate -to-severe 
pruritus who received either IV CR845 1.0 mcg/kg (n=33) or placebo (n=32) 3 times per 
week for 2 weeks, after each hemodialysis session .  CR845 significantly decreased itching 
intensity compared with placebo (p=0.016), as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS) 
and significantly improved quality of life related to itching (Skindex- 10) (see 
Investigator’s Brochure for details).  Furthermore, CR845- treated patients exhibited 
statistically significant reductions in b oth daytime (p=0.03) and nighttime (p=0.007) worst 
itching scores compared with placebo, and the reduction in itching intensity scores was 
similar on dialysis and nondialysis days.  The mean change from baseline VAS curves 
over time showed numerical separa tion between the treatment groups within the first week 
of treatment.  
CR845- CLIN2101 evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeated IV 
doses of CR845 compared to placebo over an 8-week treatment period in [ADDRESS_1193952] of 3 doses of CR845 (ie, 0.5 mcg/kg, n=44; 1 mcg/kg, n=41 and 1.5 mcg/kg, n=44) or placebo (n=45) admini stered at the end of each dialysis session (ie,  3 times/week).  The 
primary efficacy endpoint for Study CR845-CLIN2101 was based on itch intensity measurement and defined as the change from a [ADDRESS_1193953] Itching Intensity numerical rating scale (NRS) score.  The least squares (LS) mean (±standard error [SE]) treatment group difference from placebo at Week  8 across all CR845 doses was -1.3 (±0.41) (95% confidence interval [CI]:  
-2.1 to -0.5) (p=0.002) with an average NRS score reduction from baseline of -3.2 (±0.22) (LS mean ±SE) and 95% CI ranging from -3.7 to -2.8.  Examination of the individual 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 19 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 CR845 dose group results for the Full Analysis Population indicates that a substantial 
improvement over placebo was observed with all 3 doses.  These differences from placebo were statistically significant for the lower dose group of 0.5 mcg/kg (p<0.001) and the 1.5 
mcg/kg group (p=0.019), with an effect size estimated as 0.82, 0.39, and 0.62 for the 0.5, 
1.0, and 1.5 mcg/kg doses, respectively.  Average reduction from baseline (LS mean ± SE) ranged from -2.8 (±0.38) in the 1.0 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -3.5 to -2.0) 
to -3.8 (±0.38) in the 0.5 mcg/kg dose group (95% CI ranging from -4.5 to -3.1).  The 
reduction in itch intensity directly correlated with a significant improvement in itch -
related quality of life and sleep measurements (see Investigator’s Br ochure, with further 
details of the efficacy  profile of CR845).   
4.2.[ADDRESS_1193954] been identified in humans.  Consequently, total body clearance of CR845 in patients with 
severe renal impairment is reduced relative to healthy, matched, control patients 
(CR845-CLIN1005) such that plasma levels of CR845 remain relatively constant until cleared during dialysis in hemodialysis patients (CR845- CLIN1003 and 
CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]).  Half-life ranges between 26 and 34 hours in hemodialysis patients compared to a typi[INVESTIGATOR_273564] 2 to 3 hours in patients with normal renal function.  Thus, lower doses of CR845 can be administered at a less frequent interval in 
hemodialysis patients to achieve the same or higher overall exposure compared to 
individuals with normal renal function.  Based on this pharmacokinetic profile, CR845 
does not need to be administered more than 3 times a week after each hemodialysis 
session, which is convenient for this patient population and ensures treatment compliance 
in a population already burdened with complex medication schedules.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of repeat -dose CR845 was studied in 24 hemodialysis 
patients who received doses of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5 mcg/kg 3 times per week for 1 week 
(CR845-CLIN2005 [Part A]).  In this study, there were dose-proportional increases in maximum concentration and area under the curve, and minimal to no accumulation with 
repeat doses due to clearance of the drug by [CONTACT_121264] (see Investigator’s Brochure for 
details).   
4.3 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
During preclinical development, no specific safety findings to preclude the use of CR845 in humans were observed.  During early clinical development, IV CR845 was 
administered to healthy volunteers; patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment,  including end- stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis patients; 
recreational poly -drug users; and postsurgical patients.  The effects of CR845 have been 
shown to be in line with the underlying pharmacological mechanism of KOR activity.  Consistent with the nonclinical abuse liability studies conducted to date, the results of an 
abuse-potential study in humans indicated that CR845 is different from typi[INVESTIGATOR_857164] -effects such as addiction.

 Overall, tingling/numbness, headache, dizziness, fatigue and/or drowsiness/somnolence 
have been the most common adverse events.  Precaution is recommended in the operation of machinery for patients who experience dizziness, fatigue, and/or 
drowsiness/somnolence.  This is described in the informed consent form (ICF), as 
appropriate, and will be discussed with each patient prior to initiation of the study.  In general, CR845 appeared to be generally well tolerated  in both single- and repeat -dose 
clinical studies  in hemodialysis patients , which support continued study and development 
of this compound.

 6.0 Investigational Plan  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description 
This is a multicenter, ope n-label study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of IV 
CR845 at a dose of 0.5 mcg/kg administered after each dialysis session. This study will 
consist of a Screening Period, an up to 12- week Treatment P eriod  and a Follow Up Visit.  
 
6.1.1 Screening Period  
The S creening P eriod  can occur within 28 days prior to treatment to assess eligibility . It 
consists of a S creening Visit and a Run-in Period.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening Visit  
The Screening Visit will occur within 2 1 days prior to the Run-In P eriod . During this  visit, 
patients will sign the Informed Consent Form and then will be evaluated for eligibility by 
[CONTACT_273580]/exclusion criteria.   
Serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential must be performed within [ADDRESS_1193955] (ie, gait disturbance, fall, dizziness, somnolence, 
seizure, syncope, mental status changes, mood altered, feeling abnormal, tachycardia, and 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814])  will be recorded during screening. During s creening and before the first visit 
of the Run-in Period, patients will be trained on completion of the Worst Itching Intensity 
NRS , EQ-5D- 5L with EQ -PSO bolt-on (E Q-5D- 5L-P) and Sleep Qu ality questionnaires.  
Patients may also  be trained on other patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire s 
during the Screening  Period prior to treatment on Day 1 (ie, Skindex-10 and 5- D itch  
questionnaires).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Run-in Period  
Eligible patients will begin the Run-in Period during the week prior to T reatment Period to 
complete  eligibility  verification , starting on the first dialysis session of that week 
(ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for 
patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).  The purpose of the Run-in 
Period will be to confirm that each patient has moderate -to-severe pruritus (ie,  weekly 
average worst itching score >5), as measured by [CONTACT_857176], and to establish a baseline itch intensity.  These criteria for eligibility should not be communicated to the patients.  This period will also be used to record each patient’s use of a ntipruritic medications.   
During the first dialysis visit of the Run- in Period, patients will start the reporting of their 
Worst Itching Intensity NRS score s and will continue to do so at every dialysis session. 
For consistency the Worst Itching Intensity  NRS scores will be collected at approximately 
the same time around the start of the dialysis session  preferably within one hour of starting 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1193956] dialysis session of the Run-in P eriod (Friday 
or Saturday), patients will complete the EQ -5D- 5L-P questionnaire. Preferably, the 
patients will complete the sleep questionnaire followed by [CONTACT_20367] -5D-5L and then the 
EQ-PSO bolt on. P atien ts may continue to be trained on PRO questionnaires during the 
Run-in Period. 
The site has the option of starting the Run- in Period on the same day as the Screening 
Visit at the discretion of the Investigator. In these cases, all screening procedures should 
be conducted first, and then Run-in procedures should be conducted after confirmation of 
eligibility with exception of the lab results , which will be reviewed during the Run-in 
Period . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Perio d 
If patients continue to meet all inclusion and no ex clusion criteria at the end of the Run -in 
Period, they will be able to start the Treatment Period  and begin IV CR845 0.5 mcg/kg.   
Day [ADDRESS_1193957] treatment week (ie, Monday for patients on a Monday- Wednesday -Friday dialysis schedule or Tuesday for 
patients on a Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday dialysis schedule).   
All scheduled study visits during the Treatment Period will be conducted on dialysis days.
 
Patients will be administered CR845 as an IV bolus after the end of their dialysis, either 
during rinse back or after rinse back , during a Treatment Period of up to 12- week so that 
each patient will receive CR845 [ADDRESS_1193958] Itching Intensity NRS  and Sleep Quality  will also  be completed  at each dialysis 
session (Monday/Wednesday/Friday or Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday) during W eek 12. In 
addition, the EQ -5D- 5L-P questionnaire should be performed during the third dialysis 
session (Friday/Saturday) of Week 12. 
At the End of Treatment visit (the first dialysis session after last dose of CR845),  patients 
will complete the  Worst Itching Intensity NRS , Sleep Quality, 5- D Itch , and Skindex-10 
questionnaires preferably within one hour of starting dialysis. 
All questionnaires will be performed at Early Termination.  
On days when multiple questionnaires are to be completed, the following sequence should 
be adhered to : 
1. Itching  Intensity NRS questionnaire  
2. Sleep Quality questionnaire 
3. 5-D Itch  
4. Skindex-10 
Cara Therapeutics, Inc.  Confidential  Page 24 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 5. EQ-5D- 5L-P 
All questionnaires are to be completed preferably within one hour of starting dialysis but 
before the completion of dialysis. 
Clinical laboratory tests ( see detail in S ection [IP_ADDRESS])
 will be collected during first day of 
treatment and at
 End of Treatment  or Early Termination Visit.  Pre-dialysis vital signs will 
be monitored and recorded  on the third  dialysis session of the week for W eek 1  and every 
four weeks after Week 1 . Adverse events, infection assessment , and concomitant 
medications will be continuously recorded during the Treatment Period . 
Electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be monitored at the Screening Visit and at End of 
Treatment  or Early Termination Visit. 
The number and reason(s) for missed dialysis , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s (including duration) and  
the use of antipruritic medications will be recorded throughout the study. 
End of Treatment or Early Termination is defined as the first dialysis day following the 
last dose of study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow- up Visit   
Patients will have a  final safety Follow -up Visit conducted 7- [ADDRESS_1193959] Itching Inten sity NRS score > 5.

Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request. Although a 
patient will not be obliged to give a reason for withdrawing prematurely, the Investigator 
must make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while ful ly respecting the patient’s 
rights.  The reason(s) for termination and date of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_273567] (eCRF) and source documents. 
If a patient discontinues early due to an adverse event, the event will be followed until 
resolution, the patient returns to baseline status, the condition stabilizes, or the patient is 
lost to follow -up. 
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up when no response is received from the 
patient after at least [ADDRESS_1193965] the patient over a minimum time of 
2 weeks by [CONTACT_3452].  
If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data already collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
6.3.2 Discontinuation or Suspension of Entire Study  
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any 
reason. Reasons may include the following, among others: 
• Investigators have not been able to enroll patients within a reasonable period of 
time or according to inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
• The target number of patients  required for the study is enrolled earlier than 
expected;  
• Unexpected safety concern.    
If the study is suspended or terminated, the Sponsor will ensure that applicable regulatory 
agencies and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) 
are notified, as appropriate.

Intensity of itch will be measured using an NRS scale (Appendix 2, Section 14.2) on a 
worksheet on which pa
tients will be asked to indicate the intensity of the worst itching 
they experienced over the past [ADDRESS_1193977] describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase “no itching” and “10” is labeled “worst itching imaginable.”   
The Worst Itchin
g Intensity NRS has been widely utilized for evaluation of chronic itch, 
including pruritus in hemodialysis patients [Kumagai 2010; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_144786] 2006; Mathur 2010; 
Ständer 2013].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sleep Quality  Questionnaire  
The impact of itch on patients’ quality of sleep will be mea sured using an NRS scale 
(Appendix 3,  Section  14.3)  on a workshe
et on which patients will be asked to indicate 
how their itch inter
feres with their sleep over the past [ADDRESS_1193978] describes it, where “0” is labeled with the anchor phrase 
“did not interfere ” and “10” is labeled “completely interfered”

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Event s 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigational patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necess arily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medici nal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
In this study, adverse events will be captured from the time a patient signs the ICF to the 
Follow-up Visit and include the following: 
• Any new sign, symptom, or disease; 
• Any new clinically significant or symptomatic laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality; 
• Any clinically significant worsening of laboratory/diagnostic test abnormality;  
• Any worsening (ie, clinically significant change in frequency, nature, and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition.  
A pre -existing condition is a condition that is present prior to signing the ICF for the 
study.  Pre-existing conditions, such as illnesses, symptoms, reactions, progression of disease states, and other comorbidities, as well as laboratory/diagnostic test 
abnormalities, will be documented in the patient’s record as medical history. In addition 
to general history, patients will be specifically asked if they have a history of certain 
conditions including but not limited to gait disturbances , falls, dizziness, somnolence, 
seizures, syncope, mental status changes, mood alterations, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_857168].   
Signs and symptoms will be reported individually as adverse events (non-serious), unless a medical diagnosis was provided.  Medical diagnosis, whenever provided, will be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms.   
Any adverse event that satisfies any of the seriousness criteria described below will be 
reported as an SAE using the SAE Report Form, in addition to documenting in the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events that occurred up to [ADDRESS_1193979] dose of study drug need 
to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by [CONTACT_63033] “Related” to study drug.  
An SAE that occurred after a period of [ADDRESS_1193980] of the study.

 Adverse Event Severity Assessment  
The Investigator will assess the severity (i e, intensity) of each adverse event (serious and 
non-serious) reported during the study based on his/her clinical judgment.  The severity 
of each adverse event will be assigned to one of the following categories:  
Mild : Transient, requires no special treatment, is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_4677], causes minimal discomfort, and does not interfere with the 
patient’s daily activities  
Moderate : Introduces a level of inconvenience or concern to the patient that may 
interfere with daily activities, but usually is ameliorated by [CONTACT_273588] : Interrupts a patient’s usual daily activity and requires systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment 
 
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life -threatening; 
NOTE:  The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an 
event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have ca used death if it were 
more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize 
the patient or may require inter vention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  These are usually considered serious. 
Severe versus Serious Adverse Event  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate , or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  An adverse event as well as an SAE must be assessed for severity.  An adverse event that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  “Severity” is not the same as “Serious,” which is 
based on patient outcome or reaction criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page 38 of 68 
CR845 -CLIN3105 
 
 
Feb 12, 2019   Version 2 .0 
 
 threat to a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a gui de for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Adverse Event Causality or Relatedness to the Study Drug  
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_857180], if any, to study drug.  The Investigator should consider many factors, 
including, but not limited to, temporal association of the event and date/time of study 
drug, duration of study drug, medical/biologic plausibility, pharmacology and adverse event profile of study drug, medical history (past medical history, underlying disease, 
comorbidities, intercurrent illness), concomitant medications, medical judgment, 
dechallenge, rechallenge, drug interaction, other plausible causes, etc., to determine the causality assessment of an event.   
The Investiga tor as well as the Sponsor will determine adverse event/SAE causality as 
‘Related’ or ‘Not Related’ to study drug.  Although there is no international consensus on how to define ‘Related’ and ‘Not Related,’ in general, an event is considered ‘Related’ if 
there is reasonable possibility that the event is related to study drug rather than to any 
other possible cause(s).  Conversely, an event is considered ‘Not Related’ if there is 
reasonable possibility that the event is related to other factors than the stud y drug.  
Adverse Event Documentation and Follow- up 
All adverse events, including observed, elicited, or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms are to be recorded on the adverse event page in the patient’s eCRF from the time the patient signs the ICF and until the Follow-up Visit/early termination, whether or 
not judged by [CONTACT_66325].  The need to capture this 
information is not dependent upon whether adverse events are related to study drug.  Serious adverse events th at occurred up to [ADDRESS_1193981] dose of study drug need 
to be documented on an SAE Report Form if they are deemed by [CONTACT_63033] “Related” to study drug.  
Each adverse event is to be documented with a verbatim/reported term, start and stop date 
and time, severity, causal relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, and 
outcome (resolved, resolved with sequelae, resolving, fatal, unknown).  The Investigator must review new adverse events and the outcome of ongoing adverse events frequently throughout the study.  
In addition to recording all adverse events (serious and non- serious) in the patient’s 
eCRF, all SAEs must also be documented on the SAE Report Form for the study. The Investigator will follow all adverse events until they resolve, the Investigator 
assesses them to be stable, or the patient’s participation in the study ends, whichever comes first.  In addition, the Investigator will follow all adverse events assessed as related 
to study drug that are ongoing at the time of the patient’s last visit, until they resolve or 
the Investigator assesses them as stable, even if the patient's participation in the study has ended.  Resolution of such events is to be documented in the patient’s record as appropriate.

 It is anticipated that some patients may undergo procedures and/or experience events that 
are common in the study population under investigation, independent of study therapy.  
Preplanned procedures and procedures (e g, kidney transplant, catheter replacement) or 
events that are independent of study therapy, according to the Investigator’s assessment, will be documented as specified in the Safety Management Plan.   
Serious Adverse Event Notification, Documentation, and Reporting  
The Investigator will report an SAE within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.  An SAE Report Form will be completed regardless of relationship to the study drug.  The 
initial report will not be delayed in order to obtain additional information.  Any additional 
information will be reported as a follow-up to the initial report within 24 hours of collection.  
Details for reporting and follow-up of SAEs are provided in the ISF. 
In the event of any SAE (other than death) occurring after the last dose of study drug and 
prior to the Follow- up Visit, the patient will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_273590].   
The Medical Monitor will review reported SAEs and may contact [CONTACT_857181].  
The Sponsor will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to 
reporting of SAEs to the appropriate regulatory authorities  in the countries and regions 
this study is conducted, while the Investig ator and designated study personnel will 
comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements related to reporting of SAEs to the IRB /IEC  and the Sponsor.   
It is the responsibility of the Sponsor or designee to send all regulatory reports to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities .  Adverse events that are serious, related to the study 
drug, and unexpected (per the Investigator’s Brochure ) will be reported to  the regulatory 
authorities as specified in the Safety Management Plan.  
As applicable, the Sponsor will also notify other participating Investigator(s) of S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
to ensure prompt notification of significant new adverse events or risks with respect to study drug.  This notification will occur as soon as possible and in compliance with country- specific regulations.  
Refer to the Safety Management Plan for further details about SAE reporting and processing.  The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_273592].

 7.0 Discussion and Justification of Study Design  
This is an open- label study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CR845 
0.5 mcg/kg IV administered after each dialysis session (generally 3 times per week for up 
to 12 weeks) in hemodialysis patients. This design is commonly used in clinical development to obtain additional safety information  regarding a novel investi gational 
drug.

 8.0 Statistical Methods  
8.1 General Considerations  
This section describes the statistical analysis of safety, effectiveness, and additional 
endpoints collected during the study.   The statistica l analysis plan (SAP) will provide a detailed description for the handling of 
missing data, patient eligibility criteria for the analysis, and statistical methodology. If differences occur between analyses of data described in the SAP and the current protocol,  
those found in the SAP will assume primacy.   Unless otherwise noted, continuous variables will be summarized using number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum; categorical variables will be summarized using the frequency count and the percentage of patients in each category. In addition to the descriptive summaries, pertinent data listings  
will be provided.  All analyses will be performed using SAS
® version 9.[ADDRESS_1193989] one non- missing effective endpoint assessment after 
baseline.  
All summaries and analysis of safety will be conducted usi ng the Safety population. 
Effectiveness endpoints analysis will be conducted using the Full Analysis population. 
There will be two sets of analysis for the effectiveness endpoints: main analysis and 
Cara Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1193990] one dose of study 
drug, completed, or discontinued from the study drug prematurely, along with the reason for discontinuation, will be presented.  The percentage of patients who completed or discontinued will be based on the safety population.  
8.5.2 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be identified in several ways:  through programmatic checks, 
through medical reviews, and by [CONTACT_725167].  Protocol deviations will be classified as minor or major prior to the database lock.  Major 
protocol deviations will be summarized.  All protocol deviations will be listed.   
8.5.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline patient characteri stics to be summarized, will include age at 
screening, age category (<45, 45 to >65, 65 to <75, ≥75), gender, ethnicity, race, and 
prescription dry body weight (kg).   
Baseline characteristics of the disease to be summarized, will include variables such as  
etiology of chronic kidney disease, years since ESRD, duration of pruritus, and time on 
chronic hemodialysis.  
8.5.4 Medical History  
Medical history data will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and summarized by [CONTACT_857182] (SOC) and Preferred 
Term.  The data will also be listed, including the verbatim investigator description of the 
relevant medical condition, the coded terms (SOC, Preferred Term), start date, end date, and whether or not the condition is ongoing. 
A separate coding listing will be created with all the distinct levels of SOC, Preferred

 receiving an additional unscheduled ultrafiltration treatment.  The number of pati ents 
getting such an extra treatment will be summarized.  
8.7.2 Adverse Events  
All adverse events, as reported by [CONTACT_779], will be coded using MedDRA to MedDRA 
SOC and Preferred Term for standardization and summary purposes. 
All reported adverse events (whether or not treatment-emergent) will be included in a 
by-patient adverse event listing.   Only TEAEs will be included in summary tables . 
Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Run -in Period are 
identified as any adverse event wit h an onset date after the start of the Run-in Period and 
up to the first dose of study drug. 
Adverse events that are considered “treatment emergent” relative to the Treatment Period 
are identified as any adverse event  with an onset date after the first dose of the study drug 
up to the Follow- up Visit or Early Termination Visit (or [ADDRESS_1194000] dose if no 
Early Termination Visit was conducted), whichever is later.  
The number and percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs will be summarized.  A 
patien t will be counted only once in the incidence count for a MedDRA SOC or Preferred 
Term, although a patient may have multiple occurrences (start and stop) of an event 
associated with a specific MedDRA Preferred Term or SOC.   The most frequent TEAEs 
(≥5% of patients) will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_88462].  
The incidence and percentage of patients experiencing treatment -emergent SAEs and 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_725173].   Adverse events that result in death will also be summarized.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_128498].  If the severity and/or relationship to the study drug of an adverse event is missing, a worst -case scenario will be assumed (ie, the adverse event 
will be categorized as “severe” and/or “related” to the study drug).  If a patient reports the 
same TEAE multiple times the event with the worst severity and the strongest 
relationship to study drug will b e tabulated.  
An overall summary table will be provided including the number and percentage of 
patients with an adverse event (both treatment and non- treatment emergent), a TEAE, 
serious TEAE, related TEAE, severe TEAE, TEAE leading to dose interruption, and 
TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation.  This table will also include the number of events for each specific Preferred Term.  
Separate tables summarizing the incidence of AESIs will be presented for Run-In and Treatment Period. S elected preferred ter ms will be determined prior to database lock and 
combined into the following categories:

• Tachycardia  
• Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_857170], including patient identifier, age, 
race, gender, a flag indicating whether the event was treatment -emergent, and all related 
event status information (start and stop dates, whether the event was ongoing, study day of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study medication, action taken with study treatment, and outcome).  Separate listings will be generated for SAEs, deaths, and 
adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation.  Additionally, a coding list of

Summary statistics for each scheduled time point measured and mean changes from 
baseline to each time point (whe n applicable) will be presented for clinical laboratory 
results.   
All laboratory evaluation summaries will include the patients in the Safety Population 
who have at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline 
assessments) and with both a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline).  
Laboratory values will be reported in Système International units.   
Laboratory test results will be assigned an L/N/H classification according to wheth er the 
value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory parameter’s reference range.  
Comparisons will be based on 3×3 tables (shift tables) that, for a particular laboratory 
test, compare the baseline L/N/H classification to the highest and/or  lowest L/N/H 
classification during the Treatment Period.  Clinically important laboratory values based 
on prespecified criteria defined in the SAP will also be summarized.  
Additionally, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase will be presented in a separate listing, with 3× and 5×ULN flagged for 
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase; 2×ULN flagged for bilirubin, 
and 1.5×ULN flagged for alkaline phosphatase.  
8.7.[ADDRESS_1194001] a postbaseline time point (for criteria based on postbaseline assessments) and with both a baseline and at least one postbaseline time point (for criteria evaluating changes from baseline).  
Clinically notable vital signs will be identified based on the criteria defined in the SAP.  For each vital sign parameter, the number and percentage of patients with at least one notable value will be tabulated by [CONTACT_857184]. 
All vital signs will be listed in by- patient listings, including visit and collection date/time, 
and will be sorted by [CONTACT_273608]/time of assessment.   
Electrocardiogram results include an overall interpretation of ‘normal,’ ‘abnormal but not 
clinically significant,’ or ‘abnormal and clinically significant.’  These results will be tabulated at each time point.   
Electrocardiogram results will be listed for each visit, including visit, whether ECG was 
performed (yes/no), explanation (if not performed), assessment da te/time, study date, 
overall interpretation, and relevant medical history number or adverse event number, if deemed a clinically significant abnormality.  
8.8 Additional Analyses  
8.8.1 Missed Dialysis Visits , Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_857171], and the total number of missed dialyses visits will be tabulated.   
Incidence of infections based on adverse events and/or use of antibiotics for treatment of 
infection overall or related to pruritus wi ll be presented.

 12.0 Administrative Procedures  
12.1 Protocol Adherence  
It is vital to the success of the study that the Investigator adhere to the details of the 
protocol, and thus to keep to a minimum the number of cases later classified as 
“incomplete,” “unusable,” or “not evaluable.”  If, in the interest of safety and/or well-being of a particular patient, it is necessary to depart from the protocol, then that 
protocol deviation will pertain to that individual patient only and will be documented.  Protocol deviations due to lack of patient compliance must also be documented.   
The site monitor will review protocol deviations throughout the course of monitoring 
visits and document new findings of deviations.  The monitor will notify the Investigators 
of deviations verbally or in writing.  The IRB/IEC  should be notified of all protocol 
deviations in a timely manner according to IRB/IEC  requirements.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer 
worldwide. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_775717], a significant proportion of patients progress despi[INVESTIGATOR_775718]. Unresectable recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC has a dismal survival and development of novel therapeutics has been met with little success.   
Platinum compounds historically are the backbone of first line therapy however 
documented response rates to cytotoxic chemotherapy range between 10- 30% with 
single agent regimens and 20- 40% for multi -drug regimens.  Although increased 
response rates are seen with doublet regimens, progression free survival (4.2- 5.1 
months) and overall survival (5.7- 6.6 months) have not been significantly increased with 
the addition of further cytotoxic agents
2-4.  To date, the regimen associated with the best 
survival outcomes in the first line setting are seen with the use of a triplet consisting of cetuximab, a platinum, and 5- flurouracil (the ‘EXTREME’ regimen’).  In a sentinel 
publication when compared to platinum plus 5- flurouracil, the EX TREME regimen 
resulted in improved overall survival (10.1 vs 7.4 months) and response rate (36 vs 20%). However this aggressive regimen is accompanied by [CONTACT_775742]
5. Given issues with toxicities and the baseline mediocre 
performance status at diagnosis, many patients with R/M HNSCC are not candidates for the EXTREME triplet regimen. Therefore, novel ther apeutic approaches are necessary.  
 
Now with a greater understanding of aberrant cellular signaling and function in carcinogenesis, there has been a shift in modern chemotherapeutics towards targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_775719]. Commonly altered 
genes include cell cycle regulatory genes CDKN2A and CCND1
7.  These cell cycle 
regulatory genes encode a complex group of proteins including cyclin dependent kinases 
and cyclin D which regulate progression through the cell cycle. Sustained CDK 4/6 
activation is believed to be present in the majority of tumors as a mechanism to continually allow transition from G1 to S phase
12.  In R/M HNSCC, alterations in CCND1 
or CDKN2A are two genomic events which lead to loss of checkpoint control.  In patients with R/M HNSCC CDKN2A alterations include homozygous deletions in 30%, additional gene mutations in 10- 20%, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_775720] 80%. 
CCND1 has been noted to be amplified in 20%
7-10.  Between the two, genomic alterations 
in either CCND1 or CDKN2A have been identified in between 60- 94% of R/M HNSCC 
making these potential targets of interest7,10,11. 
1.2 Palbociclib - Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
• Palbociclib is a reversible, oral, highly selective inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6)[ADDRESS_1065445] cancer . 
• The predominance of the clinical experience with palbociclib comes from the 
PALOMA trials  (-1,-2, and -3) evaluating its efficacy in the first line treatment of 
hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer.  When considered together, over 
[ADDRESS_1065446] been treated with palbociclib in combination with hormone therapy 
(letrozole or anastrozole)  on these trials14-16.  These trials demonstrated significant 
improvement in median progression free survival with the addition of palbociclib (14.5 
to 24.8 months with the addition to Letrozole, 4.6 to 9.5 months with the addition to 
Fulvestrant).   Response information from these trials are summarized in Table 1.   
Interestingly, although the rate of objective response was somewhat increased with the addition of palbociclib, the biggest impact with the addition of palbociclib was

Page 7 of 55 
 increase in the rate of stable disease and clinical benefit (defined as percentage of 
patients who had a confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease for 24 weeks  or more).   Given the mechanism of CDK4/6 inhibition, response has 
been evaluated by [CONTACT_68295] (CCND1 amplification , p16 loss, PIK3CA mutant) 
in PALOMA -[ADDRESS_1065447] cancer.

• There is a significant amount of safety information available surrounding the use of 
palbociclib, most comprehensively documented through the PALOMA trials .  The 
most common SAEs are hematologic including neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia 
as summarized below in Table 2. Interestingly , despi[INVESTIGATOR_775721], febrile 
neutropenia and discontinuation due to adverse events has repeatedly been noted to be extremely low
14-16.  A complete description of the safety information can be found 
in the current Investigator’s Brochure or Study Agent Prescribing Information.

• Recognizing the potential as a targeted therapy in other  cancers with CDK 
abnormalities, palbociclib has been evaluated in advanced CDK4- amplified well -
differentiated or  dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  The study met its primary end point 
with a 12 week PFS of 66% (historical PFS for a second line agent 20- 40%).  
Treatment was reasonably well tolerated with predominantly hematologic adverse events.  Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities included anemia (17%), neutropenia 
(50%), and thrombocytopenia (30%).  Only one epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 3 febrile 
neutropenia was noted
17. This study acts not only to demonstrate a signal of 
response in CDK4- amplified well- differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma but 
also demonstrates the promise of this agent for the treatment of diverse malignancies with cyclin -dependent kinase dysregulation.  
• Palbociclib is a novel therapeutic in R/M HNSCC. Only one small phase I trial utilizing 
a doublet of palbocicilb and cetuximab (an IgG1 anti -EGFR monocl onal antibody) has 
been conducted in R/M HNSCC. This phase 1 study, presented at ASCO 2015, demonstrated suggestion of activity in both p16 negative and positive patients
18.  
Nine patients were enrolled  in this Phase 1 study; 5 of whom were both platinum  and 
cetuximab resistant, 1 of whom was cetuximab resistant.  Of the nine patients, 5 
patients were p16- and 4 p16+.  No dose limiting toxicities or AE related treatment 
discontinuations were encountered hence the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  was 
not reached.  Tumor assessment after cycle 2 demonstrated partial response (PR) in 2 patients, stable disease (SD) in 5 patients, progressive disease (PD) in 1 patient, and one patient was non- evaluable.  Responses were seen in patients who were 
cetuximab resistant as well as those resistant to platinum and cetuximab. Based on 
the results of this trial, a Phase II utilizing cetuximab with palbociclib in HPV - patients 
is ongoing ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Therefore, the early results of this trial support further exploration of palboc iclib in R/M HNSCC.

 gemcitabine. This was demonstrated to be due to chemotherapy induced tumor 
S-Phase recruitment/synchronization resulting in a greater degree of cell cycle 
arrest and apoptosis with flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_106540].  Interesting, the increased apoptotic effect 
was observed only in immortalized cells20. Similar synergistic lethality was 
observed in a study examining other chemotherapeutics in a xenograft model21. 
 
Preclinical and phase II studies have previously demonstrated potentiation of 
doxorubicin efficacy by [CONTACT_775743][INVESTIGATOR_106540].  In the Phase II study by [CONTACT_80952], the doublet of doxorubicin and flavopi[INVESTIGATOR_775723]- differentiated liposarcoma 
resulted in improved response rates compared to historical controls without encountering a MTD
22. 
 Within our institution, combination of CDK4/[ADDRESS_1065451].  Unpublished research from our 
colleagues (Coffman, Buchanovich, et al) has explored the role for combining 
cisplatin with CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1065452] with concurrent cisplatin and CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1065453] (Personal Communications, 
Unpubli shed Data).  Similarly, Baldassarre et al presented data at the [ADDRESS_1065454] 
been examined both of which were derived from stage IV oral cavity carcinomas.  Cells were plated and allowed to expand into logarithmic growth phase, then 
treated with either vehicle (DMSO), cisplatin alone, palbociclib alone, or cisplatin 
and palbociclib in combination.  Cell response was analyzed with cell proliferation with resazurin assays and clonogenic cell survival assays.   Enhanced response 
was seen with the combination of cisplatin and palbociclib in comparison to either 
agent alone.  For UMSCC -59, survival fractions were 33% for combination 
therapy, 71% for cisplatin alone, and 88% for palbociclib alone.  For UMSCC -
103, survival fractions were 34% for combination therapy, 40% for cisplatin alone, and 80% for palbociclib  alone.  There was suggestion of increased 
sensitivity with the presence of a CDKN2A mutation (UMSCC -59) compared to 
wildtype CDKN2A (UMSCC -103) (Brenner, Unpublished Data- Manuscript in 
progress) .

utilize a dose of Carboplatin AUC 5, day 1, and Palbociclib 125 mg daily, 2

non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_775724] (Unpublished Personal

toxicities of this dosing regimen and adjust if necessary.

 1.4 Rationale  in Head and Neck Cancer  
 
Given the molecular alterations (CDKN2A, CCND1) seen in R/M HNSCC and signal of 
efficacy with the use of palbociclib in patients in other malignancies with these alterations, 
exploration in R/M HNSCC is warranted.   Based on preclinical evidence, the combination 
of a CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1065456]-line cytotoxic treatment of R/M HNSCC. This will be a single arm, non-
randomized, non- blinded phase II trial .  Patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic 
HNSCC with no previous  cytotoxic chemotherapy therapy in the recurrent/metastatic 
setting will be included. Previous treatment with imm unotherapeutics in the 
recurrent/metastatic setting will be  permitted. 
 
Based on pre- clinical data, we hypothesize that this doublet will have activity in eliciting a 
greater antitumor response and hence improved disease control rate.  Much of the benefit 
seen in previous  palbociclib  trials was SD and clinical benefit (CR + PR + SD at 24 
weeks) rather than improvement in ORR, CR, or PR .  As the increase in SD was 
associated with improved PFS compared to placebo in these trials, we believe this 
represents drug effect rather than disease biology. Therefore, we believe disease control 
rate (DCR) at [ADDRESS_1065457] shown a correlation between response to therapy and molecular 
genetics for genetic networks centers on RB1 amplification and/or CDKN2A  loss. Some 
studies have used RB1 phosphorylation as a marker for enrollment, others have 
retrospectively assessed molecular profiles. Thus, to assess the potential of using 
molecular genetics to enrich for responsive populations in future studies of head and neck cancer, we propose to determine correlations of the molecular networks wi th 
Palbociclib -based therapy . According to our recent and published NGS data (including 
with the TCGA network) patients  with R/M HNSCC have CDKN2A  alterations (30% 
homozygous deletion, 10-20% mutations , and epi[INVESTIGATOR_304460] ) leading to loss of 
RNA ex pression. Likewise, CCND1  as a gene within the 11q13 ampi[INVESTIGATOR_775725] 20%  of cases
7-10.  With low rates of alterations also 
seen in RB1 and CDK4/[ADDRESS_1065458] only been reported in 0.5% of the population and it will be important to identify 
patients with these alterations. Given the overall alteration frequency of the genes as well 
as the potential to define a companion molecular diagnostic for this therapy, we propose 
the following hypothesis:  Specific genetic networks will correlate with response to 
Palbociclib -based therapy including patients with alterations in CDKN2A, CyclinD1, 
CDK4/6, RB and/or human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509].  
 
In addition to advancing studies of pr e-enrollment companion diagnostics, we also 
propose to leverage our experience with analyzing ctDNA in the saliva an d serum to 
assess ctDNA for its ability to identify response to therapy. In other cancers, ctDNA is 
routinely monitored as a potential biomarker to assess response to therapy as well as to 
provide early identification of obvious mutations that drive resistance to targeted inhibitors
23-26. With the recent advances in the utility of molecular barcoding for next 
generation sequencing, quantification of low yield DNA samples has become a pi[INVESTIGATOR_775726] a technology that we propose to 
UMCC 2017.054

Page 12 of 55 
 leverage in this proposal. Thus, we also propose the following h ypothesis:   Cancer 
response to therapy  can be detected in saliva and serum biospecimens collected at 
routine interval time points and will identify tumor recurrence earlier than interim imaging.

5.2 Toxicities and Dose Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity . Each 
patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events 
Table ( Section 6. 1). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Terminology  
Crite ria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. Dose adjustments should be made 
according to the system showing the greatest degree of toxicity .

• Grade 3 neutropenia (ANC <1000/mm3) associated with a documented 
infection of fever ≥ 38.5° C 
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <500/mm3) 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/mm3) 
• Grade ≥ 3 non- hematologic toxicity (including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
fatigue, and hypertension only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4571])  
UMCC 2017.054 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 18 of 55 
  
Appropriate follow up assessments should be done until adequate recovery occurs as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Criteria required before treatment can 
resume are described in Section 5.2.2.  
 
Doses  of palbociclib ± carboplatin infusions  may be held as needed until toxicity 
resolution. Depending on when the adverse event resolved, a treatment interruption may lead to the patient missing all subsequent planned doses within that same cycle or even dela y the initiation of the subsequent cycle.  If the 
adverse event that led to the treatment interruption recovers within the same cycle, then re- dosing in that cycle is allowed.  Doses omitted for toxicity are not 
replaced within the same cycle.  The need for a dose reduction at the time of treatment resumption should be based on the criteria in Section 5.2.3.  
 In the event of a treatment interruption for reasons other than treatment -related 
toxicity (ie non -cancer related surgery) lasting >[ADDRESS_1065473] 
been met:  
 
• Platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm
3 
• ANC ≥ 1000/mm3 and no fever  
• Grade 3 or higher treatment -related non- hematologic AEs (including 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypertension only if persisting despi[INVESTIGATOR_4570]), with the exception of alopecia, h ave 
recovered to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline (or, at the investigator’s discretion, Grade ≤ 2 if not considere d a safety risk for the patient)  
 
If a treatment delay results from decline in hematologic parameters, the frequency of blood count assessments should be increased as clinically indicated.  G-CSF (Filgrastim or Peg -filgrastim) may be given for neutropenia at 
the investigator’s discretion.  
 
If these parameters are met within [ADDRESS_1065474] not been met after 2 weeks of dosing interruption (including the scheduled 1 week off Palbociclib treatment) or 2 weeks of cycle 
delay, permanent treatment  discontinuation should be considered.  Treatment 
resumption for patients recovering from toxicity after > 2 weeks of treatment 
interruption of cycle delay but deemed to be deriving obvious clinical benefit per the investigator’s best medical judgement is left at the investigator’s discretion.  
 
A new cycle only starts when the criteria listed above are met and treatment with 
palbociclib ± carboplatin may be administered.  Otherwise, initiation of the new 
cycle must be delayed until such criteria are met.  In the event that the start of a new cycle is delayed due to treatment related toxicity, procedures required on Day 1 of the given cycle will be performed when palbociclib ± carboplatin  is 
resumed. New Day 1 procedures that were performed prior to knowing t he need 
to delay the start of the cycle do not need to be repeated 1) if not required to

 determine whether study drugs may be resumed and 2) if performed within 7 
days prior to study drug resumption.  
  
5.2.3  Dose Reductions  
 
Following dosing interruption or cycle delay, the dose of the study drugs may need to be reduced when treatment is resumed.  No specific dose adjustments are recommended for Grade 1/2 treatment -related 
toxicity.  
 Dose reduction of palbociclib and carboplatin by 2 dose levels will be all owed 
depending on the type and severity of toxicity encountered (Table 3 and 4).  
Patients requiring more than 2 dose reductions will be discontinued from the 
study and entered into the follow -up phase.  
 Once a dose has been reduced for a given patient, all subsequent cycles should be administered at that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required.  Dose re- escalation is not allowed.

physician’s discretion . 
 5.3.5  Other concomitant medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_775729].  
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue until 
one of the following criteria apply:  
• Disease progression as defined in Section 7.0 unless evidence of clinical 
benefit per the judgement of the treating clinician as per Section 5.5  
• Inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment  OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
5.[ADDRESS_1065475]  v1.1 defined PD as 
long as they meet the following criteria:  
 
- Investigator -assessed clinical benefit and do not have rapid disease progression  
- Tolerance of study drug  
- Stable performance status  
- Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent 
serious complications of disease progression (i.e. CNS metastases) 
UMCC 2017.[ADDRESS_1065476] be documented in the study records. Subjects will be re- consented with an informed consent describing any 
reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts.  
 Subjects should discontinue study therapy upon further evidence of further progression, defined as an additional 10% or greater increase in tumor burden volume from time of initial progression (including all target lesions and new measurable lesions).  
 
New lesions are considered measurable at the time of initial progression if the longest 
diameter is at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have a short axis of at least 15 mm). Any new lesion considered non- measurable at the time of 
initial progression may become measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden measurement if the longest diameter increases to at least 10 mm (except for pathological lymph nodes, which must have an increase in short axis to at least 15 mm).  
 For statistical analysis that include the investigator -assessed progression date, subjects 
who continue treatment beyond investigator -assessed, response defined progression will 
be considered to have investigator -assessed progressive disease at the time of the initial 
progression event.  
5.[ADDRESS_1065477] withdraws consent for all study 
procedures or loses the ability to consent freely .
 
5.7 Duration  of Follow -Up 
Patients will be followed for survival until death. Patients removed from treatment for 
unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  End of treatment visit will be conducted within 30 days (+/- 5 days)  of 
treatment discontinuation, however if patient refuses to present for a clinic visit, phone 
contact [CONTACT_775751] 30 days after study discontinuation of study treatment.  
Survival assessment can be done by [CONTACT_775752] (+/ - 1 month) until death.

Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) 
Committee [ EJC 45 (2009) 228- 247]. Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor  lesions are used in the RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1065483] one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 
• 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (irrespective of scanner type) for studies with a slice thickness of <5mm or twice the slice thickness or  MRI 
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be  
             accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as  
             non-measurable)           
• 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776])  
                           
                         All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of     
                         centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_14216] (CT scan slice  thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At 
baseline and in follow -up, only  the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Tumor lesions  in previously irradiated areas are considered measurable if there 
has been progression in the lesion since completion of radiotherapy  
 
Non- measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_1065484] scan), are considered non- measurable disease. Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non- measurable.  
 
Target l esions . All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
and 5 lesions in total should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organ, 
UMCC 2017.[ADDRESS_1065485] meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥15mm by [CONTACT_3610]. Only the short axis 
of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is involved by [CONTACT_48862] . Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI 
the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20mm x 30mm has a short axis of 20mm and qualifies as a malignant,  
measurable node. In this example, 20mm should be recorded as the node 
measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10mm but <15 
mm) should be considered non- target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis 
<10mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characteri ze any objective tumor  regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non- target l esions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be ide ntified as non- target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more details to follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple non- target 
lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
7.1.3  Guidelines  for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s)  being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by 
[CONTACT_461].  
 
CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions  
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT sl ice thickness is 5mm or 
less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size 
for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness . 
 
7.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all t arget lesions, 
determined by [CONTACT_43897] 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
UMCC 2017.054 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 27 of 55 
 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions  (with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm), taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR  (taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD)  nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD (taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment 
started). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non- target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started) . The patient's best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

 “symptomatic deterioratio n”. Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of 
treatment.  
 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease 
resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surger y. 
7.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
7.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of 
treatment to time of progression.  
7.2 Safety/T olerability 
  Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug. The study will use the CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_1065487] recent safety update, please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure or

8.2 Adverse Event  Reporting Requirements  
Adverse event  (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial  and is 
done  to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who will 
enroll in future studies using similar agents . Data on adverse events will be collected from 
the time of the initial study treatment administration through [ADDRESS_1065489] also be reported. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will continue to be followed until : 
• Resolution or the symptoms or signs that constitute the serious adverse event return to baseline;  
• There is satisfactory explanation other than the study treatment  for the changes 
observed;  or  
• Death.  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation, grading and assignment of attribution of events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE. The definitions of AEs and SAEs are given below . It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16496].  
Any medical condition or laboratory abnormality with an onset date before initial  study 
treatment administration is considered to be pre- existing in nature. Any known pre-
existing conditions that are ongoing at time of study entry should be considered medical history.  
All events meeting the criteria and definition of an AE or SAE , as defined in Section 8.3,  
occurring from the initial study  treatment administration through [ADDRESS_1065490] be recorded as an adverse event in the patient’s source documents and on the CRF regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to the study t reatment . All serious adverse events (SAEs) and unanticipated 
problems (UPs), regardless of causality to study drug, will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_249055]. In addition, SAEs should be submitted 
to the Coordinati ng Center and PI [INVESTIGATOR_775731] a causal relationship between the palbociclib  and 
the SAE.  
UMCC 2017.054 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 31 of 55 
 In addition to new events, any increase in the frequency or severity ( i.e., toxi city 
grade) of a pre- existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment  
is also considered an adverse event.  
8.3 Definitions  
8.3.1  Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  
 
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive (i.e. , surgical) 
procedures will not be reported as adverse events . However, the medical 
condition for which the procedure was performed must be reported if it meets 
the definition of an adverse event unless it is a pre- existing (prior to protocol 
treatment) condition.  
 
• Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events if they 
induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy.  They are to be c aptured 
under the signs, symptoms or diagnoses associated with them.  
8.3.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator  
or sponsor -investigator , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
  
o Death  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.  
 
o A life -threatening adverse event  
An adverse even is considered ‘life- threatening’ if, in the view of either the 
investigator [or sponsor -investigator ], its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] > [ADDRESS_1065491] normal life functions  
 
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
o Important medical event  
Any event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or requir e 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
of “Serious Adverse Event” . Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home;  convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249053].  
UMCC 2017.054 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 32 of 55 
  
Previously plann ed (prior to signing the informed consent form) surgeries should 
not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has worsened 
during the course of the study. Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16499]’s medical history at the time of study enrollment should not be considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16500] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (for example, for the administration of study therapy or other protocol -required procedure) should 
not be considered SAEs. However, if the preexisting condition worsened during 
the course of the study, it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
8.3.3  Expected Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “expected” if:  
• For a pproved and marketed drugs or devices, those adverse events  are 
described in the approved Package Insert (Label).  
• For investigational new drugs or devices, those adverse events are 
described in the FDA Investigator’s Brochure.  
• In clinical research studies, information on expected adverse events is 
also summarized in the protocol and in the consent document .  See 
section 9.[ADDRESS_1065492] of expected adverse events related to the drug 
under study.  
8.3.4  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “unexpected” if it is not described in the 
Package Insert, Investigator’s Brochure, in published medical literature, in the protocol, or in the informed consent document.  
8.4 Adverse Event  Characteristics  
8.4.1  CTCAE T erm

safety reports will be submitted in the annual report.  
In addition to new event s, any increase in the frequency or severity (i.e., toxicity 
grade) of a pre- existing condition that occurs after the patient begins study treatment 
is also considered an adverse event.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1065497] subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  
 Upon becoming aware of any incident, experience, or outcome (not related to an adverse event) that may represent an unanticipated problem,  the investigator should assess 
whether the incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem . The 
incident, experience or outcomes is considered unanticipated if it meets all of the 
following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency);  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
UMCC 2017.[ADDRESS_1065498] report it to the IRB according to the local 
IRB reporting requirements .

palbobciclib.   The drug accountability records will capture drug receipt, drug dispensing, drug return and final disposition.  
10.0 CORRELATIVES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
10.1 Sample Collection Guidelines  
 
We plan on collecting and banking serial saliva and serum samples  as well as tumor tissue. 
 10.1.1 Serum  and Saliva Samples 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] These samples are mandatory .  They w ill be obtained at Day 1 Cycle 1, 
Day 8 (+/- 4 days)  Cycle 1 , and Day 1 (+/- 4 days) of each subsequent 
Cycle while on therapy  (see section 6. 1). 
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Sample Transportation  
- Whenever as specimen has been obtained (i.e. after a procedure, 
blood draw, oral  rinse in clinic), sample will be labeled with the 
subject’s de- identified study number and collection date, and the 
UMCC 2017.054 
________________________________________________________________________ 
Page 38 of 55 
 study coordinator will transport the sample directly to the Brenner 
laboratory.  
 
10.1.2 Tumor Samples  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] We plan on obtaining tumor samples at screening, at Cycle [ADDRESS_1065503] be obtained within 
the 56 days prior to study treatment. No systemic therapy (i.e. immunotherapy) may have been administered since obtaining the 
biopsy, if so, a new biopsy is needed.     
- Interim Biopsy at Cycle 2, Day 1 (+/- 7 days)  is optional and will be 
offered if safe and clinically feasible  
- Biopsy at the time of progression is mandatory however if the treating 
physician deems biopsy to be either unsafe or not clinically feasible, 
this must be documented and patient may forego repeat biopsy  
- FFPE core biopsy is preferred, H owever , if not clinically feasible or 
safe to obtain a core biopsy , contact [CONTACT_775754] (P.S. and 
F.W.) as a block made from several FNA passes is acceptable.  
10.1.3  Brenner lab will receive and process samples.  See Lab Manual for details   
10.2 Assay Methodology  
 
 
Hypothesis 1.  Specific genetic networks will correlate with response to Palbociclib- based 
therapy including patients with alterations in CDKN2A, CyclinD1, CDK4/6, RB and/or human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509]. Thus, developi[INVESTIGATOR_775734].     
 
Experimental design:  We will perform integrative targeted sequencing of all available 
tumor specimens to identify the distribution of lesions co- incident with commonly 
deregulated genes (e.g. CyclinD1  and CDKN2A  and their modifying genes) as well as the 
transcriptional programs deregulated in these tumors. We will utilize the knowledge gained from existing publicly available sequencing studies
10,11, 27-[ADDRESS_1065504] and will identify representative FFPE secti ons 
with >50% tumor content, he has extensive experience in tissue specimen evaluation for molecular analysis
33-45. We will use macrodissection to enrich for tumor content as 
needed. At least 3x10um sections per case will be cut for simultaneous DNA/RNA extraction using the Qiagen Allprep FFPE DNA/RNA kit and protocols optimized by [CONTACT_775761] (median 1.5 ug) and RNA (median 5.3 ug). As little as 9x10um sections from a single needle biopsy core yield sufficient DNA and RNA for the 
studies proposed herein. DNA and RNA will be quantified using the Qubit fluorometer.

 1ii. Targeted next generation 
sequencing (NGS).  Targeted, 
capture based NGS will be 
performed as shown in our 
preliminary data to the left using Ion Torrent or Illumina based sequencing (as in Fig 11). Briefly, barcoded libraries 
will be generated from 40ng 
of DNA per sample using our 
HNSCC- gene enriched 
custom  Ion AmpliSeq panel, 
and the Ion Ampliseq Library Kit 2.0 with barcode incorporation. Templates will 
be prepared using the PGM 
Template OT2 Kitv2 on the Ion One Touch2; all protocols will be performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing of 
multiplexed templates will be 
performed on Ion 318 chips using the Ion PGM 200 
Sequencing Kitv2, sequenced to an average depth >100x. We routinely generate between 400- 500 million aligned bases per 318 chip, yielding ~300- 500x coverage for 
~4-6 Oncomine Cancer Panel prepared templates. Mutation analysis will be performed in 
Torrent Suite 3.6, with alignment by [CONTACT_775762], and variant calling using the Torrent Variant Caller plugin using default low -stringency somatic variant 
settings . Variants will be annotated using ANNOVAR
46. Called variants will be filtered to 
prioritize likely candidate somatic drivers by [CONTACT_775763]: sy nonymous 
variants, those with frequencies >0.001 in ESP6500 or 1000 genomes, those with flow 
corrected read depths (FDP) <20, flow variant allele containing reads (FAO) <5 or variant 
allele fractions (FAO/FDP) <0.05. Copy number alterations will be identified as described
34,47 (24, 39) using normalized read counts per amplicon with GC content 
correction and comparison to distributions from multiple unrelated normal FFPE derived genomic DNA samples. Gene- level copy number estimates will be determined by [CONTACT_775764]- weighted mean of the per -probe ratios, with expected error determined by 
[CONTACT_32975]- to-probe var iance; genes with |Z|>2.[ADDRESS_1065505] protocols for Ion Torrent sequencing, and has used the above methodology to characterize >600 tissue specimens. Alterations will be advanced for potential as HPV+ 
co-dependent drivers and correlated with RNA pathway alterations based on known roles 
in oncogenesis and H&N cancer, comparison to Oncomine (including TCGA and publicly available data) and COSM IC mutational data, and comparison to in house databases of 
driving lesions. Sanger sequencing, FISH, or qPCR will be performed to confirm prioritized alterations.

performed using standard plugins in the Torrent Server Suite (v3.6) and variants w ere filtered 
through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_775735], sequencing errors, germline variants and 
common polymorphisms 1. Results were compared to known mutations in COSMIC, the 
          
  

UMCC 2017.[ADDRESS_1065506] s including HPV 
signaling status (including both E6 and E7 genes), deregulated CDK4/[ADDRESS_1065507] 
genes, known HNSCC cancer fusions (through 5’ and 3’ assays for FGFR-
TACC3
48 and EGFR -ADACM  (TCGA -CV-
6941), R -spondin 49, potential therapeutic 
targets in other malignancies (ie. 5’ and 3’ 
assays for ALK and RET overexpression), 
and housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582]. Our team has 
extensive experience in RNA -SEQ, 
transcriptome evaluations and statistical 
analysis and will determine the frequencies of RNA signatures with DNA lesions as described
33-40,50-58.     
 
1iv. Determination of protein expression 
and validation of sequencing data.  We will 
create a tissue microarray of excess FFPE tissue from samples sequenced for this 
Aim. Gene fusions and copy number 
alterations will be confirmed by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH) and critical targets advanced from 
sequencing studies will also be assessed by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) if IHC grade antibodies are available. Staining and scoring will be completed as we described
59-61 with 
prioritization beginning with proteins found in the CDK4/[ADDRESS_1065508] (e.g. CDK4, CDK6, 
RB, CyclinD1, etc.). We will leverage this data by [CONTACT_775765], mutation and expression as well as  HPV status using statistical methods described above.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207], alternative strategies and future directions.  We do not anticipate significant 
obstacles as we have extensive experience in tissue examination, NGS and integrative statistical analysis of molecular data in cancer as well as modeling of 
disease
34,40,41,43,44,51,62. Additionally, [CONTACT_331882] is involved in several protocols that are 
sequencing tissue specimens as part of clinical trials or protocols, including the MiOncoseq- SU2C program
48,63. The cohort size is based on conservative statistical 
estimates as noted to reach independent correlative endpoints. Targeted sequencing has been proposed to enable a focused analysis of tumors with limited DNA/RNA yield s. 
However, we have had success sequencing whole exomes from FFPE tissues from large quantities of DNA using multiple platforms and may implement these if the technology becomes robust enough during the course of the proposal for smaller quantities of DNA.  
Similarly, we are currently evaluating whole transcriptome analysis as an alternative to 
targeted RNA -SEQ from FFPE in samples with sufficient RNA yield.  Overall, we expect 
that completion of this Aim will identify the co- incident frequency of commonly 
deregulated pathways on the DNA and RNA levels that will predict response to standard 
therapy. Importantly, we will create a molecularly characterized TMA of specimens from 
this clinical trial to assess correlations between genetic and protein expression st atus. 
Taken together, this Aim will provide a wealth of data and resources for future studies Fig 12. Example of targeted RNA -seq from FFPE isolated 
RNA.  A) Reverse transcription and targeted multiplexed PCR 
(Ampliseq) was performed on 20ng FFPE isolated RNA per 
sample on a cohort of macrodissected benign urothelium, non-
invasive urothelial carcinoma (pTa) and invasive urothelial 
carcinoma (>pTa). Technical and biological replicates are 
indicated, as well as unique components isolated from the same 
case. For each sample, the log 2 total reads for each target gene 
(n=103) was normalized to the average log 2 total reads for 8 
housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_8582]. Median centered normalized target gene 
expression and samples were clustered using centroid linkage 
clustering and visualized as a heat map. B) Scatter plot of target 
gene expression (log2 normalizd gene expression) for two biological replicates of normal urothelium (BL193A and BL193B, macrodissected from separate blocks).  (R

 and provide a comprehensive data set correlating genetic aberrations with clinical 
outcome in this trial setting.  
 
Hypothesis 2:  Cancer response to therapy  can be detected in saliva and serum 
biospecimens collected at routine interval time points and will identify tumor response 
earlier than interim imaging . 
 
Correlative Justification  
 
Less than 40% have a response (SD, PR, CR) to chemotherapy in R/M which currently 
only be identified by [CONTACT_775766] 8- [ADDRESS_1065509] to University 
Policy Governing Tissue Sample Collection, Ownership, Usage, and 
Dispositio n within all UMMS Research Repositories . 
 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
 
This is a n open- label  multi- institution single arm Phase II study with a two- stage design.  
We will  power this study to detect a 20% improvement in disease control rate (DCR) with 
the addition of palbociclib.  Based on historical data, the DCR in R/M HNSCC with single 
agent platinum therapy is 40%4,64.  We hypothesize that addition of Palbociclib to 
carboplatin will increase the DCR at 12 weeks to 60%. We anticipate no los s to followup 
for this endpoint.  The primary clinical objective of this trial is to estimate disease control 
rate (DCR) at 12 weeks in patients with metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer 
treated with carboplatin and palbociclib.  Response will be assessed after every two cycles. DCR  will be defined as either CR, PR or SD at 12 weeks. The regimen w ill be 
considered promising if the true disease control rate is 60% or better.  Conversely, if the 
DCR is 40% or lower, there would be little interest in pursuing this therapy in further 
studies.  In this case, we would like to terminate the trial early and consider a new therapy.  The optimal two- stage accrual  design has been adopted
65.

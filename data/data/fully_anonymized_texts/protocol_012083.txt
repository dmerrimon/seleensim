Page 9 of 52 1. BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
 1.1. Introduction  
 
The efficacy of endocrine therap y needs to be improved in patie nts with hormone receptor positive 
metastatic breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most comm on cancer in women worldwide and more than 1.[ADDRESS_3640] cancer is classified based on the p resence of estrogen 
receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] g rowth factor receptor 2 (HER2) antigen. 
Hormone receptor positive (HR+)  breast cancer is the most commo nly diagnosed subset  of breast cancer 
(60-65%), and affects th ousands of patients every year. Hormone  receptor positive subgroup is defined as 
estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor positive or b oth, and HER [ADDRESS_3641] relapse durin g or after completi ng adjuvant therapy. 
Management of these patients re mains challenging. Single agent treatment with aromatase inhibitors or 
tamoxifen has shown limited clini cal benefit (1, 2). Tamoxifen works by [CONTACT_3961] t cancer cells and has an overall  response rate of 25-30% when used as first-
line therapy for advanced breas t cancer (3). Even if HR+ metast atic breast cancer patients respond to 
tamoxifen initially, they event ually develop acquired resistanc e and their disease pr ogresses, and transition 
to continuous lifelong treatment w ith chemotherapy. Therefore, improving the efficacy of endocrine 
therapy would benefit a large  number of breast cancer patients,  and is an unmet medic al need. A variety of 
novel agents targeting c ritical pathways in cellular growth are  in development to improve the efficacy of 
endocrine therapy against HR + breast cancer.  Palbociclib, its mechanism of ac tion, and its efficacy in HR+ m etastatic breast cancer 
Palbociclib is a reversible, oral , small molecule inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) 
(4). CDK4 and CDK6 together with c yclin D have important roles in regulation of the G1/S transition via 
regulation of the phosphorylation s tate of retinoblastomaprotei n (Rb). When phosphorylation of pRb 
occurs, it causes release of tra nscription factors that then al low the transition from G1 to S phase and 
progression of the cell cycle (5 ). The luminal A and B subtypes  of breast cancer (85 % of which are 
HR+/Her2 negative) have high rates  of cyclin D/CDK activation; in the luminal A and B subtypes, cyclin 
D1 (CCND1) amplifications wer e observed in 29% and 58% , and CD K4 amplifications were observed in 
14% and 25% respectively (6). Lum inal A subtype tumors also hav e loss of CDKN2A which encodes 
p16Ink4a, a CDK inhibitor (7). The  luminal subtypes also mainta in expression of Rb, whi ch is essential for 
benefit from treatment with a C DK4/6 inhibitor. (8) Patients wi th HR + breast cancer exhibiting a gene 
expression signature [CONTACT_4006] d shorter recurrence-free sur vival following adjuva nt tamoxifen (9). A 
tumor gene expression signature [CONTACT_4007]  E2F activation was associate d with higher residual tumor cell 
proliferation following pre-surgi cal AI therapy. Therefore, act ivation of the CDK4/CDK6/E2F axis 
promotes endocrine resistance , and treatment with a CDK4/6 inhi bitor or knockdown of CDK4 expression 
abrogates endocrine-re sistant cell prolifer ation. Targeting the  inhibition of CDK 4/[ADDRESS_3642] cancer cell lines (10). I n the clinical setting, palboci clib has been studied a s monotherapy in phase I 
studies, as well as in combina tion with endocrine therapy. A pr ior phase II study suggested that single 
agent palbociclib induced respons es in HR + breast cancer (11).  In this trial, 7% of pat ients had a partial 
response (PR) and 50% had stable  disease (SD). The overall clin ical benefit was 21% among 33 ER + 
patients. Median progression free survival was 3.8 months for p atients with ER+HER2- disease. A 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-[ADDRESS_3643] line t reatment (PALOMA-
1/TRIO-18) was conducted in postme nopausal women with HR+/ huma n epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
2 negative (HER2-) metastatic br east cancer (12). At the time o f the final analysis for progression-free 
survival (PFS) (median follo w-up 29·6 months [95% CI 27·9–36·0]  for the palbocicli b plus letrozole group 
and 27·9 months [25·5–31·1] for  the letrozole group), 41 PFS ev ents had occurred in the palbociclib plus 
letrozole group and 59 in the le trozole group. Median PFS was 1 0·2 months (95% CI 5·7–12·6) for the 
letrozole group and 20·2 months ( 13·8–27·5) for the palbociclib  plus letrozole gr oup (HR 0·488, 95% CI 
0·319–0·748; one-sided p=0·0004). The results of this trial led  to FDA approval of palbociclib in 
combination with letrozole as first line therapy for patients w ith metastatic breast cancer. The 
recommended starting dose is  [ADDRESS_3644] common adverse events from the phase 
II PALOMA-1 trial were neutrope nia (48% grade 3), leukopenia (1 9% grade 3) and fati gue (36% grade 2) 
(12). Notably, despi[INVESTIGATOR_3916], no neutropenic fever was reported. Dose 
delay was required in 45 % of pa tients in the combination arm a nd dose reduction was required in 40% of 
patients. Findings from the conf irmatory trial PALOMA-2, a rand omized phase III tri al of palbociclib plus 
letrozole versus placebo plus let rozole for the first-line trea tment of post-manopausal patients with 
ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer  is expected to be reported lat er this year. In seco nd line setting, 
palbociclib plus fulvestrant de monstrated an improvement in PFS  compared with placebo pl us fulvestrant 
in the PALOMA-3 phase III trial (13). The median PFS was 9.[ADDRESS_3645] synergistic anti-cancer effects with tamox ifen based on a phase I trial without 
either drug affecting each other’s pharmacokinetic profile. Preclinical data showed that in combination with tamoxifen, pal bociclib had synergistic growth inhibitory 
activity as well as efficacy in a m odel of acquired tamoxifen r esistance (11). Studies e valuating the role of 
cyclin D
[ADDRESS_3646] cancer support the obser vations of the activity of CD K4/[ADDRESS_3647] s on cell cycle progression ar e tightly linked to expression of cyclin D 1 
(14). Cyclin D 1 amplification and/or overexpre ssion has been more commonly asso ciated with an ER-
positive breast cancer subtype (15) and, is associated with tam oxifen resistance (16, 17). 
 Tamoxifen could affect the metabol ism of co-administered drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4 since in 
vitro  data indicate tamoxife n is a reversible a nd time-dependent inh ibitor of CYP3A4 (18) as well as an 
inducer of CYP3A4 (19). Palbociclib  is mainly metabolized by [CONTACT_3962] P3A4. A clinical drug interaction study 
of tamoxifen and palbociclib revea led that there were no signif icant changes in exposur e in the presence of 
steady-state levels of tamoxife n when compared with exposure wh en given alone (20). Therefore based on 
this phase I study, tamoxifen is  not expected to affect palboci clib pharmacokinetics due to CYP-mediated 
interactions.  
1.2. Study Rationale 
Combining palbociclib with tamoxi fen in first line treatment of  metastatic HR+ breast cancer offers an 
appealing alternative to other e ndocrine combinations. Tamoxife n remains an active endocrine therapy for 
pre- and post-menopausal women with hormone receptor (HR) posit ive breast cancers.  In addition, most 
postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer receive aromatase i nhibitors (AI) as adjuvant endocrine 
therapy. The group of women that  progress on adjuvant therapy w ith AIs may not benefit from the addition 
of CDK 4/[ADDRESS_3648] and inconveni ence of monthly injections remai ns a challenge.  Thus, the combination of 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-016 Version Date  23JAN2020 
  Confidential  
Page 11 of 52 tamoxifen with palbociclib will offer the option of continuing oral combination endocrine therapy with

 5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 5.1. Overall Design and Study Plan 
This is a non-randomized, open-la bel, single-arm, multicenter, phase II study of palbociclib in combination 
with tamoxifen in subjects with H R(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast c ancer who have not received prior systemic 
anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3917]/metastatic disease. Th e primary objective of the Phase II trial is to 
determine progression free survival (PFS) based on RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_3661] progressive disease, or 
unacceptable toxicities will be followed for a total of 24 mont hs after disconti nuation of study drug.  
 If funding is secured, correlative research  analyses includes c orrelating alterations i n circulating tumor DNA 
at the time of progression, corr elating molecular alterations o f genes associated with ER+ breast cancer in 
tumor tissue samples with clinical outcome and at the time of p rogression, comparing difference in response 
for subjects presenting with de novo metastatic breast cancer t o subjects that progressed while on aromatase 
inhibitors, and comparing differ ences in response and toxicity profile in African American and Hispanic 
subjects to Cau casian subjects. 
 
5.2. Pre-medication  
Pre-medication is not required bu t may be adminis tered per phys ician discretion.

5.3.1.  Palbociclib + Tamoxifen Administration 
The palbociclib dose will be 125 mg administered orally once da ily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. 
Subjects will not take palbocic lib on days 22-28. The tamoxifen  dose will be 20 mg administered orally once 
daily for every day of the 28-day cycle (i.e., continuously). I t is encouraged but not mandatory that 
premenopausal subjects will also receive treatment with Goserel in or equivalent (e.g. Lupron) given as an 
injectable subcutaneous imp lant on day 1 of every 28 days cycle  or every 3 months. 
 
Drug Dose Route Schedule Cycle Length 
Palbociclib 125mg Oral Days 1-21 
28 days 
Tamoxifen 20mg Oral Continuous 
 
Palbociclib should be taken with f ood in combination with Tamox ifen. Subjects should be encouraged to take 
their dose at approximately the same time each day.   
5.3.2.  Missed Doses: 
Missed doses may be taken up to [ADDRESS_3662] will skip t he dose and take the next dose as  scheduled.  
 If emesis occurs after study medi cation ingestion and whole cap sule(s) are visible in t he vomitus, replacement 
capsule(s) should be taken; otherwise, the dose will not be re- administered and subjects should simply adhere 
to the dosing schedule and resume dosing at the next scheduled time with the prescribed dosage. Subjects 
should record the time of the emesis in their dosing diary (see  Documents/Info tab of the EDC). Under no 
circumstance should a subject r epeat a dose or double-up doses.   
 
5.4. Supportive Care 
Optimal patient care is to be given to all subjects.  Subjects should receive full s upportive care during the study, including transfusion of blood and blood 
products, treatment with antibioti cs, analgesics, erythropoieti n, or bisphosphonates (or denosumab), when 
appropriate.   Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as  deemed necessary by [CONTACT_3966]:  
 Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressi vely, and consideration should be given 
in subsequent cycles to the adm inistration of prophylactic anti emetic therapy according to standard 
institutional practice. If pr ophylactic antiemetic therapy is n eeded, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (without 
corticosteroids) should be tried f irst. Due to the potential of  benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_3919] e sedation, the use of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_3920] f or subjects who cannot be satisfactorily 
managed otherwise.  Subjects should be strongly encour aged to maintain liberal oral  fluid intake. 
 Anti-infectives: Subjects with a documented infectious complica tion should receive oral or IV antibiotics 
or other anti-infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_3967] a given infectious 
condition, according to standard  institutional practice.

5.5. Concomitant Medications 
Medications specifically prohib ited in the exclusion criteria a re not allowed during the ongoing trial. If there 
is a clinical indication for one o f these or other medications specifically prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy  may be required. The site in vestigator should discuss any questions 
regarding this with the sponsor-i nvestigator by [CONTACT_3968]. The final decision 
on any supportive therapy rests with the investigator and/or th e subject's primary physician. However, the 
decision to continue the subject on trial therapy requires the mutual agreement of the local Investigator, the 
sponsor-investigator , and the subject.  
 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures All treatments the investigator considers necessary for a subje ct’s welfare may be administered at the 
discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_3922]. All concomitant 
medications will be recorded on the  electronic cas e report form  (eCRF). 
 Palliative radiation i s permitted but palbociclib must be withh eld throughout the cours e of radiotherapy. 
Palliative RT should not be deliver ed to a target lesion and it  should not encompass more than 25% of the 
irradiated bone marrow. The reas on for radiotherapy must be cle arly documented and progression as per 
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_3663]’s  malignancy should be treated at the discretion 
of the investigator.  All other medical conditions shoul d be treated at the discretio n of the investigator in accordance with local 
community standards of medical care.  The Effects of Other Drugs on Palbociclib  
Palbociclib is primarily metab olized by [CONTACT_097]3A a nd sulfotransfer ase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1.  
 The use of strong CYP3A inhibito rs (e.g., clarithromycin, indin avir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, nefazodone , nelfinavir, posaconazole, rito navir, saquinavir, tel aprevir, telithromycin, 
verapamil, and voriconazole) should be avoided as these drugs c ould increase plasma lev els of palbociclib.  
 The use of strong CYP3A indu cers (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, ca rbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_3923]'s Wort) or 
moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., bose ntan, efavirenz, etravirine,  modafinil, and nafcilli n) should be avoided 
as these drugs could decrease pl asma levels of palbociclib.  
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-016 Version Date  23JAN2020 
  Confidential  
Page 18 of 52  
The use of strong inhibitors or  inducers of CYP2D6 (Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], dacomitinib, fluoxetine, paroxetine, 
quinidine) should be avoided   The Effects of Palboci clib on Other Drugs 
In vivo, palbociclib is a time-dependent i nhibitor of CYP3A. 
 Coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of palbocicli b increased the midazolam plasma exposure 
by 61%, in healthy subjects, compa red with administration of mi dazolam alone. The dose of the sensitive 
CYP3A substrate with a narrow th erapeutic index (e.g., alfentan il, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, 
ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimu s and tacrolimus) may need to be reduced as 
palbociclib may incr ease their exposure. 
 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3925]: 
 Anti-cancer systemic chemothera py or biological  therapy not spe cified in this protocol 
 Other investigational and a ntineoplastic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3926], in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require th e use of any of the aforementioned treatments 
for clinical management shoul d be removed from the trial.   
 There are no prohibited therapi [INVESTIGATOR_3927]-Treatment Fol low-up Phase. 
 
5.6. Diet/Activity/Other Considerations 
 
Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are  required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, 
nausea, or vomiting.  Contraception Palbociclib may have adverse effe cts on a fetus in utero. Non-p regnant, non-breast-feeding women may be 
enrolled if they are willing to use 2 methods of birth control or are considered highly unlikely to conceive. 
Highly unlikely to con ceive is defined as 1) surgically sterili zed, or 2) postmenopausal  (a woman who is ≥45 
years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year wil l be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not 
heterosexually active for th e duration of the study.   
 It is encouraged but not mandato ry that premenopausal subjects will also receive treatment with goserelin or 
equivalent (e.g. Lupron) given as an injectable subcutaneous im plant on day 1 of every 28 days cycle or every 
3 months.  The following are considered ade quate barrier methods of contra ception: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_3969]), 
copper intrauterine device, sponge , or spermicide. The use of h ormonal contraceptives is discouraged. 
 Subjects should be informed tha t taking the study medication ma y involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn 
baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. In order to participate in the study they must adhere to the 
contraception requirements descri bed above for the duration of the study and at least [ADDRESS_3664] be reported to BTC RC AHQ within 1 business day using the 
Pregnancy Report form (See Docu ments/Info tab of the EDC).  
 The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permiss ion to follow the outcome of the pregnancy 
and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to BTCRC AHQ. The site should make every effort to contact 
[CONTACT_3970]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or 
terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to BT CRC AHQ as soon as the information is 
available. If the outcome is a serious adverse event (e.g., dea th, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other 
disabling or life-threatening co mplication to the mother or new born), it will be reported to BTCRC AHQ

  8. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION 
 Response assessments for subjects  with visceral/ visceral plus bone disease will be made using 
RECIST v1.1. Response assessment s for subjects with bone only d isease will be made using MDA 
criteria.  8.1. Definitions Associated with Resp onse Evaluation Criteria in Sol id Tumors (RECIST) 
version 1.1 
 
8.1.1.  Measurable disease:  The presence of at l east one measurable les ion. If the measurab le 
disease is restricted to a so litary lesion, its neoplastic natu re should be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Measurable lesions:  Measurable lesions are defined a s those that can be accurately  
measured in at least one dimens ion (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_3679] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_3680] scan, or  >[ADDRESS_3681] be recorded i n millimeters (or decimal fracti ons of centimeters). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Non-measurable lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pat hological lymp h nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable d isease.  Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followe d by [CONTACT_462]), are considere d as non-measurable. 
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet  the criteria for radiographical ly defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as maligna nt lesions (neither measurab le nor non-measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the defin ition of measurability described  above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the  same subject, these are prefe rred for selection as target 
lesions.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Malignant lymph nodes .  To be considered pathologicall y enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_3682] sca n (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no grea ter than 5 mm) .  At baseline  and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 [IP_ADDRESS].  Baseline documentation of “Targe t” and “Non-Target” lesions:   
 
Target lesions . All measurable lesions up to a m aximum of 2 lesions per organ  and 5 
lesions in total, representativ e of all involved organs, should  be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and meas ured at baseline.  Tar get lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be rep resentative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be tho se that lend themselves to  reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It ma y be the case that, on occasion, the larges t lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement in w hich circumstance the next larg est lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be s elected.  A sum of the diamete rs (longest for non-nodal 
lesions, short axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions w ill be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum diameters .  If lymph nodes are to be includ ed in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the su m.  The baseline s um diameters w ill be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the meas urable dimension of the 
disease.  Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (o r sites of disease) including any measur able 
lesions over and above the 5 targe t lesions should be identifie d as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baselin e.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in r are cases unequivocal progression  of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up. 
 
8.2. Response Criteria for Target Lesions –RECIST version 1.1 
 
8.2.1.  Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all target lesions.  An y pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) At least a  30% decrease in the sum of the  diameters 
of target lesions, taking as r eference the baseline sum 
diameters
Progressive Disease (PD) At leas t a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as r eference the smallest sum 
on study (this includes the ba seline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum m ust also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered pro
gressions).

8.2.2.  Evaluation of non-target lesions  
Response Criteria Evaluation of non-target lesions 
* Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all  non-target lesions 
and normalization of tumor marker level
* Incomplete Response/ Stable Di sease (SD) Persistence of one o r more non-target 
lesion(s) or/and mai ntenance of tumor 
marker level above t he normal limits
* Progressive Disease (PD) App earance of one or more new lesion s 
and/or unequivocal progression of existin

* Although a clear progression of “n on-target” le sions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3933], and th e progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator.  
8.3. Evaluation of best overall re sponse –RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_3683] response recorded from th e start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (t aking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment st arted). In general, the subject' s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both  measurement and confirmation criteria.

Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of dis ease progression at that time should be classified as having  
“symptomatic deterioration.” Eve ry effort should be made to doc ument the objective 
progression even after dis continuation of treatment. 
 
In some circumstances it may be di fficult to dist inguish residu al disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determ ination, it is recommended 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-016 Version Date  23JAN2020 
  Confidential  
Page 30 of 52 that the residual lesion be inve stigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/ biopsy) to confirm  the complete 
response status. 
 8.4. Definitions for Response Eval uation –RECIST version 1.[ADDRESS_3684] Documentation of Response: 
The time between initiation of t herapy and first documentation of PR or CR. 
 
8.4.2.  Confirmation of Response: 
To be assigned a status of compl ete or partial response, change s in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_3974] e are first met. 
 
8.4.3.  Duration of Response: 
Duration of overall response—the period measured from the time that measurement 
criteria are met for complete or  partial response (whichever st atus is recorded first) until 
the date that recurrent or progr essive disease is objectively d ocumented (taking as 
reference for progressi ve disease the smalle st measurements rec orded since treatment 
started).  
8.4.4.  Duration of Overall Complete Response: 
The period measured from the time that measurement criteria are  met for complete 
response until the first date t hat progressive disease is objec tively documented. 
 
8.4.5.  Objective response rate:  
The objective response rate is the proportion of all subjects w ith confirmed PR or CR 
according to RECIST v1.1 from the start of treatment until dise ase progression/recurrence 
(taking as reference for progres sive disease the smallest measu rements recorded since the 
start of treatment).  
8.4.6.  Progression-Free Survival: 
Progression-free survival is defi ned as the time the treatment is initiated until to the first 
documented progression of diseas e, as determined per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_3685] disease evaluation.   
 
8.5. Methods of Measurement –RECIST version 1.1 
All measurements should be tak en and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be  performed as closely as poss ible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more tha n 28 days before the beginning of t he treatment. 
 
Imaging-based evaluation is pr eferred to evalu ation by [CONTACT_3975](s) being followed cannot  be imaged but are assessable by  [CONTACT_461]. The same 
imaging modality must be used t hroughout the study to measure d isease. 
 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-[ADDRESS_3686] and MRI: 
CT and MRI are the best currentl y available and most reproducib le methods for measuring 
target lesions. This guideline ha s defined measurability of les ions on CT scan based on the 
assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_3687] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum si ze for a measurable lesion sho uld be twice the slice 
thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a  complex issue.  MRI ha s excellent contrast , spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measureme nt.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning s equences used should be optimiz ed for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furtherm ore, as with CT, the modalit y used at follow-up should 
be the same as was used at ba seline and the lesions should be m easured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guid elines to prescribe 
specific MRI pulse sequence pa rameters for all scanners, body p arts, and diseases.  Ideally, 
the same type of scanner shoul d be used and the image acquisiti on protocol should be 
followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans sho uld be performed with 
breath-hold scanning tec hniques, if possible. 
 PET-CT.  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal  diagnostic CT qua lity for use w ith RECIST 
measurements.  However , if the site can document that the CT pe rformed as part of a PET-
CT is of identical diagnostic qu ality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the 
CT portion of the PET-CT can be use d for RECIST measurements an d can be used 
interchangeably with conventiona l CT in accurately measuring ca ncer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additi onal data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not rou tinely or serially performed. 
 
8.5.2.  Chest X-Ray: 
Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions whe n they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by [CONTACT_3976] l ung (CT is preferable).   
 
8.5.3.  Clinical Examination: 
Clinically detected lesions will  only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g. skin nodules and palpable lym ph nodes). For skin lesions,  documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to e stimate size of the lesion, is recommended. Photographs 
should be retained at  the institution. 
 
8.5.4.  Cytology and Histology: 
Cytologic and histologic techni ques can be used to differentiat e between complete and 
partial responses in rare cases  (e.g. after tr eatment to differ entiate residual benign lesions 
and residual malignant lesions i n germ cell tumors). Cytologic confirmation of the 
neoplastic nature of any effusi on that appears or worsens durin g treatment is required when 
the measurable tumor has met re sponse or stable disease criteri a.

Page 33 of 52 9. BIOLOGICAL CORRELATIVES  
The goal of the correlative objec tives are to identify candidat e biological mechanisms underlying 
primary and secondary resistan ce to endocrine therapy combined with CDK 4/6 inhibitors (CDK 
4/6i) using liquid biopsy approach es. Previous work from the PA LOMA-3 trial (22 ) shows that 
approximately 30% of patients tr eated with endocr ine therapy pl us palbociclib acquire a driver 
mutation during treatment  that may contribute to disease progre ssion, including RB1 aberrations, 
amplification of FGFR  and mutations in ESR1  and PIK3CA in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). 
However, the majority of tumors  do not demonstrate emergence of  a characteristic  driver mutation 
at the time of progression that is driving resistance to therap y. Therefore, there  is a need for 
studies exploring other mechanisms  of resistance in clinical sp ecimens. We will conduct a multi-
omics analysis of cir culating plasma exosomes  isolated from blo od samples collected at baseline 
and at the time of disease progr ession in order to identify can didate mechanisms o f resistance to 
the combination of tamoxifen plus palbociclib.   
The release of membrane-bound extr acellular vesicles (EVs) from  cancer cells into body fluids 
like plasma is a tightly regulated mechanism of intracellular c ommunication that involves cell-to-
cell transfer of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], proteins , and nucleic acids. This proc ess has been impli cated in several 
aspects of cancer-related pat hology, including tumor growth, in vasion, angiogenesis, and 
metastasis. Emerging evidence su ggests that oncogenic mutations  in tumors impact  EV-mediated 
cell-cell communication, a nd that EVs shed from tumors contain oncogenic macromolecules (23, 
24). Thus, analyzing EV cargo can s hed light on biologic proces ses ongoing in tumors in response 
to treatment. Exosomes are an a bundant form of EVs that are ide ally suited for serial analyses in 
patients participating clinical t rials since exosomes and their  cargo are highly stable in plasma for 
prolonged periods of time and ca n be readily isolated from froz en plasma sampl es (25), unlike 
circulating tumor cells.  Importantly, analysis of exosom es provides a dynamic and functi onal read-
out of biological pathways that a re activated in cancer cells s ince exosome cargo includes proteins 
and RNA. This is a significant a dvantage compared to analysis o f ctDNA. For all of these reasons, 
a multi-omics analysis of plasma  exosomes isolated from study p articipants is a promising liquid 
biopsy approach for identifying candidate mechan isms of primary  and secondary resistance to 
tamoxifen and palbociclib. 
 We collected blood samples (6 mL ) in Streck tubes on cycle 1 da y 1, cycle 5 day 1, and at the time 
of progression. Samples were sh ipped overnight on the day of co llection to the Laboratory of 
Genomic Medicine at the Univers ity of Illinois at Chicago. Plas ma was isolated immediately on 
arrival and was frozen at -80C ° with [ADDRESS_3688] asma exosomes will be isolated 
from frozen specimens using the E xoQuick Exosome Isolation and RNA Purification for future 
RNAseq experiments if additiona l funding is obtained, and the E xoQuick-ULTRA® for proteomic 
experiments as described below (S ystem Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA).  
 
9.1. Perform proteomic analysis of pl asma exosomes to identify poten tial mechanisms of 
primary and secondary resistanc e to tamoxifen/palbociclib.  
A collaborator (Y. Gao, PhD, UIC) pi[INVESTIGATOR_3935]-cell mass sp ectrometry for proteomic 
analysis of sub-populations of cir culating tumor cells. The met hods developed in the Gao lab 
have shown that sub-populations  of cells could be differentiate d at single-cell resolution  (26). 
We will not perform single-cell proteomics, but rather we will use this enabling technology to 
perform  ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry on the small am ount of protein typi[INVESTIGATOR_3936]. The single-cell proteomics meth od developed in the Gao lab comb ines 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-[ADDRESS_3689] extracted from each 
plasma sample as previously de scribed (27, 28). Once separated,  the exosome from each 
sample will be labeled with Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) isobaric tags  for quantitative mass 
spectrometry (MS) analysis. Exos omes obtained from each patient  prior to treatment will be 
measured three times in three i ndependent experiments as techni cal replicates. To improve 
the detection and quantitation of  low abundant exosome proteins , we will use existing 
exosome proteomics data and ExoCarta ( http://www.exocarta.org/ ) to guide our analysis. 
Specifically, an inclusion list will be generated to include al l the known exosome protein-
derived peptides, as well as prot eins that belong to candidate resistance mechanisms (e.g. 
Cdk2, cyclin E, Rb, and other cell cy cle regulatory proteins an d proteins involved in ER 
signaling). We will also guide the mass spectrometer to aim for  these ions as specific 
retention time points. This type o f experiment is similar to mu ltiple reaction monitoring 
(MRM), which is highly sensitive  and reproducible. After mass s pectrometry analysis, all the 
data will be analyzed and quantif ied using ProLuCID (29) and Ce nsus (30) to generate a 
complete exosome protein iden tification and quan titation data s et. We will then analyze the 
data to identify key proteins and pa thways that contribute to t he differences between 
responders and non-responders in p re-treatment samples. This will provide insight into 
possible mechanisms of primary resistance.   For the responders, we will also compare the 
exosome proteome at baseline  vs. at the time of progression . This will provide insight into 
potential mechanisms responsib le for secondary (i.e. acquired) resistance to CDK 4/6i . 
For both analyses, we will, in a ddition, correlate with the pri mary outcome PFS. 
 Protein clusters that persistent ly change together will be subj ect to pathway analysis using 
STRING database ( http://www.string-db.org/ ). With both the pr oteomics data and 
transcriptomics data , we will perform a mul ti-omics data integr ation to find the correlation 
between the proteome and the tra nscriptome. We have previously shown that such analysis 
could greatly improve the qualit y and confidence of the results  (26). 
 
9.2.  Analyze tumor specimens for protein expression of candidate ma rkers of primary 
resistance.  
In order to confirm potential biom arkers of primary resistance identified with the multi-omics 
analysis of plasma exosomes, we will analyze pre-treatment tumo r specimens using a 
multiplex immunofluor escence (IF) tissue imag ing system. We wil l use a multiplex 
immunofluorescence (IF) staining a ssay and automated digital im age analysis with the Vectra 
3® automated quantitative pathol ogy imaging system (Perkin-Elme r, Waltham, MA) to 
assess the extent of protein sta ining in tumor cells for up to [ADDRESS_3690]. 
Optimization of antibody staining w ith commercially available a ntibodies, tumor staining, 
image analysis and quantificati on of protein staining will be c onducted by [CONTACT_3978] (RHTIC) in the Research Resou rces Center (RRC) at the 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-[ADDRESS_3691]. The multiplex 
antibody panel will include a pan- cytokeratin antibody that wil l allow us to distinguish tumor 
cells from the stromal compartme nt, and DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_3937]. Stains will be 
optimized using Opal® reagents (Pe rkinElmer). Slides will be sc anned on a Vectra 3® 
multispectral imaging system for whole-slide image analysis. Ma chine learning algorithms 
will isolate epi[INVESTIGATOR_3938], and all images will be revi ewed by [CONTACT_3979] 
(Wiley) to confirm the accuracy of cellular compartment segment ation. Quantification of 
protein staining in digitized images will be accomplished using  algorithms that generate a 
normalized, log2 transformed staining intensity for each protei n. T-tests will compare staining 
intensity in responders vs. non-re sponders. Cox model will be u sed to correlate staining 
intensity with PFS. 
 9.3. Compare differences in response for subjects presenting with de  novo metastatic breast 
cancer to subjects that progressed while on aromatase inhibitor s. 
There will be two main subject  populations in this trial: subje cts that present with de novo 
metastatic disease and subject s that will progress while on adj uvant endocrine therapy with 
aromatase inhibitors . Looking at differences in response betwee n these [ADDRESS_3692] consent will be obtaine d to bank any left over samples t hat were collected for study-
specific correlative research. H oosier Cancer Research Network (HCRN), as Administrative 
Headquarters for the Big Ten CRC, will manage the banked sample s. Samples will be banked 
indefinitely in the Hoosier Can cer Research Network Bioreposito ry and used for future 
unspecified cancer-related research. 
 9.6. Banking Samples for Future Unspecified Research  
Subject consent will be obtained for additional samples collect ed for future Big Ten Cancer 
Research Consortium studies. HCRN will manage the banked sample s. Samples will be 
banked indefinitely in the HCRN Biorepository.

 Warnings and Precautions 
Please refer to the package inse rt or Investigator’s Brochure f or a complete list of adverse 
events. 
 Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was the most frequentl y reported adverse reaction in St udy 1 (PALOMA-2) 
with an incidence of 80% and Study  2 (PALOMA-3) with an inciden ce of 83%. A Grade 
≥3 decrease in neutrophil counts was reported in 66% of patient s receiving palbociclib 
plus letrozole in Study 1 and 66% of  patients receiving palboci clib plus fulvestrant in 
Study 2. In Study [ADDRESS_3695] epi[INVESTIGATOR_3941] 
15 days and the median duration of  Grade ≥3 neutropenia was 7 d ays.  
Febrile neutropenia has bee n reported in 1.8% of patients expos ed to palbociclib across 
Studies 1 and 2. One death due to neut ropenic sepsis was observ ed in Study 2. Physicians 
should inform patients to promptl y report any epi[INVESTIGATOR_3942] .  
 Pulmonary Embolism Pulmonary embolism was reporte d in 15/872 (1.7%) of palbociclib  treated patients in Study 
A5481003, A5481008, and A5481023, and in 5/471 (1.1%) of patien ts treated in the 
comparator arms of these studies . These incidences are consiste nt with epi[INVESTIGATOR_3943] c ancer population, and the 
higher incidence for pulmonary e mbolism in the palbociclib trea ted patients may be 
explained by [CONTACT_3981]. Pulmonary embolism a nd other venous thromboembolic eve nts will continue to be 
monitored but are not currently considered t o be adverse drug r eactions of palbociclib. 
 Effects on the Gastr ointestinal Tract 
Non-adverse palbociclib-related ga strointestinal (GI) tract fin dings were noted in 
nonclinical toxicity studies. Tre atment-related G I tract events  have been commonly 
observed in patients who receive  palbociclib as a single agent or in combination with other 
anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The most fre quent gastrointestinal treatm ent-related events were 
Nausea, Vomiting, Diarrhea, and Dec reased appetite. Most occurr ences were mild (Grade 
1).  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and m echanism of action, palbocicl ib can cause fetal harm. 
Palbociclib caused embryo-fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that 
were greater than or equal to 4 times the human clinical exposu re based on area under the 
curve (AUC). Advise females of r eproductive potential to use ef fective contraception 
during therapy with palbociclib a nd for at least [ADDRESS_3696] dose of study drug.

Effects on Testes Palbociclib caused testicular  degeneration in rats and dogs. Th e incidence and severity was 
dose related and correlated wit h decreases in testicular weight  in the rat. Reversibility of the 
testicular degeneration was de monstrated following a 12-week no n-dosing period in rats 
and dogs (also following a 4-wee k recovery period in rats). Pat ients should consider sperm 
preservation prior to beginni ng therapy with palbociclib. 
 Male patients must be surgically s terile or must agree to use e ffective contraception during 
the therapy and for at least [ADDRESS_3697] udy drug.

 Classification 
Nonsteroidal antiestrogen.  Mechanism of Action 
Tamoxifen citrate is a  nonsteroidal agent t hat has demonstrated  potent antiestrogenic 
properties in animal test systems . The antiestrogenic effects m ay be related to its ability to 
compete with estrogen for bindi ng sites in target tissues such as breast. Tamoxifen inhibits 
the induction of rat mammary car cinoma induced by [CONTACT_3982] (DMBA) and 
causes the regression of already established DMBA-induced tumor s. In this rat model, 
tamoxifen appears to exert its  antitumor eff ects by [CONTACT_3983]. 
In cytosols derived from human br east adenocarcinomas, tamoxife n competes with estradiol 
for estrogen receptor protein.

 Classification 
Luteinizing hormone releas ing hormone (LHRH) agonist 
 Mechanism of Action 
Leuprolide acetate is a synth etic nonapeptide analogue of GnRH.   Leuprolide acetate is a 
long-acting GnRH analog. A single monthly injection of LUPRON D EPOT 3.[ADDRESS_3698].  Storage, Handling, and Accountability 
Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions  permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F)  
 
Administration  
Leuprolide, at a dose of 3.75 mg, s hould be administered intram uscularly on day 1 of each 
cycle into the gluteal area, a nterior thigh, or  deltoid; inject ion sites should be alternated.  
using an aseptic technique by [CONTACT_3985]. 
 
Risks 
Estradiol levels may increase dur ing the first weeks following the initial injection of 
leuprolide, but then decline to m enopausal levels. This transie nt increase in estradiol can be 
associated with a temporary w orsening of signs and symptoms.  
 
As would be expected with a drug th at lowers serum estradiol le vels, the most frequently 
reported adverse reactions were those related to hypoestrogenis m. Adverse events occurring 
in clinical studies with LUPRON DEPOT that are associated with hypoestrogenism include: 
hot flashes, headaches, emotio nal lability, decreased libido, a cne, myalgia, reduction in 
breast size, and vaginal dryness . Patients should be counseled on the possibility of the 
development or worsening of depr ession and the occurrence of me mory disorders.  
 The induced hypoestrogenic state also results in a loss in bone  density over the course of 
treatment, some of which m ay not be reversible.  
 Pain, bruising, bleeding, redness, or swelling at the injection  site may also occur.

study whether or not considered related to the study therapy. T he following are examples 
of AEs:  
 A sign (including an abnormal labo ratory finding) or symptom 
 A disease temporally associat ed with particip ation in an invest igational study 
 An intercurrent illnes s or injury that imp airs the well-being o f the subject 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3945] (e.g., surgical insertion o f central line) should not be recorded as an AE. Disease 
progression should not be recorde d as an AE, unless it is attri butable by [CONTACT_3986]. 
 
11.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE): 
A SAE is an adverse event that:

SAE, unless it is attributable  by [CONTACT_3987](s) 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject w as at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not r efer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused 
death if it were more severe) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3946] >24 hours or prolongatio n of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. NOTE:  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3947], central line  insertion, metastasis 
interventional therapy, resecti on of primary tumor, or elective  surgery, will not be 
considered serious  adverse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anom aly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event ( defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be 
immediately lif e-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3092], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific  judgment, may jeopardize the
 subject or may require 
intervention (e.g., medical, surgi cal) to prevent one of the ot her serious outcomes listed 
in the definition above). Example s of such events include, but are not limited to, 
intensive treatment in an emerge ncy room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions not r esulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug

 AEs will be recorded regardless  of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to 
trial medications.  
 All AEs considered related to tri al medication will be followed  until resolution, return 
to baseline or ≤ Grade 1, deemed c linically insignificant, and/ or until a new anti-cancer 
treatment starts, whichever is earlier 
 
11.3. Reporting of Pregnancy 
Although pregnancy is not consider ed an adverse event, it is th e responsibility of 
investigators or their design ees to report any pregnancy in a s ubject (spontaneously 
reported to them) that occurs dur ing the trial or within [ADDRESS_3700] be followed to the comple tion/termination of the 
pregnancy. All pregnancies mu st be reported within 1 business d ay to BTCRC AHQ on the

 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1. Study Design 
This is a non-randomized, open-la bel, multicenter, phase II stu dy of palbociclib in 
combination with tamoxifen in sub jects with HR(+)/HER2(-) advan ced breast cancer who 
have not received prior systemic a nti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3948] r advanced/metastatic 
disease. Palbociclib is taken or ally with food at a dose of 125  mg on days 1-21 of each 28-
day cycle. Tamoxifen is taken or ally at a dose of 20 mg on days  1-28 of the 28-day cycle 
(i.e., continuously). Treatment will continue until disease pro gression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or subj ect refusal. 
 It is planned that the data from all centers participating in t he trial will be combined, so 
that an adequate number of subjec t are available for analysis.  
 12.2. Analysis Datasets 
 Methods of Statistical Analysis The definitions of the study popula tions are listed below. The appropriate study population for 
each analysis should be chosen a nd defined in t he protocol. 
 
Population Definition 
Enrolled This will comprise all subjects who meet the eligibili ty 
criteria and are regi stered onto the study.  
Evaluable This will comprise all subjects who receive at least one cycle 
of trial drug and either undergo at least one post-baseline assessment or die before any evaluation.  
Safety This will comprise all s ubjects who received at least a single 
dose of study drug.

12.3. Sample Size 
Study endpoint is progression fre e survival (PFS) as assessed b y RECIST v1.1 criteria). 
Previous studies (31, 32) identif ied progression free survival with tamoxifen of [ADDRESS_3704] cancer. We use a null hypothesis of median  PFS 15 months as a 
conservative choice and the alternative hypothesis of median PF S 25 months (31, 32). 
Controlling for a probability of one-sided Type I error of 0.05 , the proposed sample size will 
be 48 to achieve an 80% statistic al power for detecting this di fference, assuming 20% 
censoring rate due to unevaluabl e, drop-out, and other lost-to- follow-up. The sample size 
analysis was conducted using the software PASS 14 (NCSS, Kaysvi lle, Utah, [LOCATION_003].). The 
test was based on an exponentia l distribution assumption for si ngle arm studies. The accrual 
period was assumed to be 24 months  and the maximum follow-up 24  months too.  
 
12.4. Analysis of Primary Objectives/Aims 
The primary objective of the Phase II study is to estimate the activity of the combination of 
palbociclib and tamoxifen in first line therapy for subjects wi th HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced 
breast cancer who have not recei ved prior systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3949]/metastatic disease, eva luated by [CONTACT_3988]-free surv ival (PFS) using RECIST 
1.1 in subjects with HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer who h ave not received prior 
systemic anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3917]/metastatic di sease treated with palbociclib 
in combination with tamoxifen. Me dian PFS times will be compute d, and PFS rate will be 
calculated with associated 95% confidence intervals. Kaplan-Mei er curves will be plotted. 
Data will be analyzed using the PROC FREQ and PROC LIFETEST in SAS. 
 
12.5. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Characterize safety and tolerability of palbociclib and tamoxif en in first line therapy for 
subjects with HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer who have not  received prior systemic 
anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3948] r advanced/metastatic disease. 
 Proportion of subjects with each grade of adverse events as def ined by [CONTACT_3989] v4 will 
be computed along with 95% confidence intervals, and reported i n a tabular and 
descriptive manner. 
 Assess response rate based on RECIST 1.1 or MDA Criteria. The r esponse rate (complete 
or partial response) and 95% confidence interval for the respon se rate will be computed using 
PROC FREQ in SAS (Cary, NC).   Evaluate clinical benefit rate RR (complete, partial response, or stable disease) based on 
RECIST 1.1 or MDA Criteria in subj ects with HR(+)/HER2(-) advan ced breast cancer who 
have not received prior systemic  anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3948] r advanced/metastatic disease 
treated with palbociclib in c ombination with tamoxifen. 
 Clinical benefit rate (complete,  partial response, or stable di sease) will be assessed every 
8 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_3705] 1.1 (s ection 8)
 or MDA 
Criteria (for patients with bone only disease). Response will b e recorded as disease 
control rate (DCR), or stable di sease plus partial response plu s complete response, and 
reported via waterfall plot. The response rate and 95% confiden ce interval for the 
response rate will be computed us ing PROC FREQ in SAS (Cary, NC ).

 13.4. Compliance with Trial Registration and Results Posting Requirem ents 
Under the terms of the Food and D rug Administra tion Modernizati on Act (FDAMA) and 
the Food and Drug Administration A mendments Act (FDAAA), the sp onsor-investigator 
of the trial is solely responsib le for determining whether the trial and its resu lts are subject 
to the requirements for submis sion to the Clinical Trials Data Bank, 
http://www.clinicaltrials.gov . The sponsor-investigator has  delegated responsibility to 
BTCRC AHQ for registering the t rial and posting the results on clinicaltrials.gov. 
Information posted will allow s ubjects to identify potentially appropriate trials for their 
disease conditions and pursue participation by [CONTACT_3379] a centra l contact [CONTACT_3996].

 14.1. Data Management 
BTCRC AHQ will serve as the Clini cal Research Office for this t rial. Data will be 
collected through a web based clini cal research platform, OnCor e
®, a system compliant 
with Good Clinical Practices and F ederal Rules and Regulations.  BTCRC AHQ personnel 
will coordinate and manage data for quality control assurance a nd integrity. All data will 
be collected and entered into OnCore® by [CONTACT_3997].   
 14.2. Case Report Forms and Submission 
Generally, clinical data will be e lectronically captured in OnC ore
® and correlative results 
will be captured in OnCore® or other secure database(s). If procedures on the study 
calendar are performed for standa rd of care, at minimum, that d ata will be captured in the 
source document. Select standard o f care data wil l also be capt ured in OnCore®, according 
to study-specific objectives. Pl ease see the Data and Safety Ov ersight Process (DSOP) 
guidelines for further details.   The completed dataset is housed at BTCRC AHQ and is the sole pr operty of the sponsor-
investigator’s institution. It should not be made available in any form to third parties, 
except for authorized represent atives of appropriate Health/Reg ulatory Authorities, without 
written permission from the spons or-investigator and BTCRC AHQ.  After the initial 
publication, the complete data set  will be available to all BTC RC institutions. 
 
14.3. Record Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or aud its from Health Authorities/BTC RC AHQ, the 
investigator agrees to keep record s, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records; e.g., hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] ), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_3951] s ource documents, and detailed rec ords of drug disposition. 
All source documents are to rem ain in the subject’s file and re tained by [CONTACT_3998] h local and federal  regulations. 
 
14.4. Confidentiality 
There is a slight risk of loss  of confidentiality of subject in formation. All records 
identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the e xtent permitted by [CONTACT_3999]/or regulat ions, will not be made publicly a vailable. Information 
collected will be maintained on s ecure, password protected elec tronic systems. Paper files 
that contain personal informa tion will be kept in locked and se cure locations only 
accessible to the study site personnel.   Samples that are collected w ill be identified by a subject’s st udy number assigned at the 
time of registration to the tria l. Any material issued to colla borating researchers will be 
anonymized and only identified by [CONTACT_4000]. 
 Subjects will be informed in writi ng that some organizations in cluding the sponsor-
investigator and his/her researc h associates, BTCRC AHQ, [COMPANY_007] , IRB, or government 
agencies, like the FDA, may inspect their medical records to ve rify the information 
Big Ten Cancer Research Consor tium BTCRC-BRE15-[ADDRESS_3707]’s identi ty will remain confidential. 
 
15. ETHICS 
 15.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 
The final study protocol, includ ing the final version of the Wr itten Informed Consent 
Form, must be approved or give n a favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3952]. The 
investigator must submit writte n approval to the BTCRC AHQ offi ce before he or she can 
enroll any subject into the study.    The site investigator is respons ible for informi ng the IRB of a ny amendment to the 
protocol in accordance with lo cal requirements. In addition, th e IRB must approve all 
advertising used to recruit subj ects for the study. The protoco l must be re-approved by [CONTACT_4001], as local re gulations require.  
 Progress reports and notificati ons of serious and unexpected ad verse events will be 
provided to the IRB according t o local regulations and guidelin es. 
 
15.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The study will be performed in acco rdance with ethical principl es originati ng from the 
Declaration of Helsink i, which are consist ent with ICH Good Cli nical Practice, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
 15.3. Informed Consent Process 
The site investigator will ensure the subject is given full and  adequate oral and written 
information about the nature , purpose, possible risks and benef its of the study. Subjects 
must also be notified they are free to discontinue from the stu dy at any time. The subject 
should be given the opportunity t o ask questions and allowed ti me to consider the 
information provided.  The subject’s signed and dated i nformed consent must be obtaine d before conducting any 
procedure specifically for the s tudy. The investigator must sto re the original, signed 
informed consent form. A copy of t he signed informed consent fo rm must be given to the 
subject.

• Subject is willing and able to  return for all follow -up visits  
Exclusion 
Criteria  Subject  undergoing placement of a BSC US or UDS is not pe rmitted to 
enroll if th ey mee t any of the following exclusion c riteria: 
• Subject meet s any of the contraindications as per individual stent 
IFU/DFU  
• Subject receiving different stent type in case of bilateral /multiple 
stenting  
• Subject with an indwelling ureteral stent(s) not planned to be removed prior to/or concurrently with the study stent implant  
Primary Statistical Hypothesis The study is being statistically powered for only Tria ™ implanted  
subjects for S tone Management.  
Tria™ stents have technical success during planned indwell in more than 85% in stone manage ment . 
The null and alternative hypotheses are:  
H0: p ≤ 0.85 H1: p > 0.85 where p = the proportion of stent ed ureter(s)with technical success   
Statistical Test 
Method  The hypotheses above will be evaluated based on the two -sided 95% 
exact Clopper -Pearson confidence interval for the proportion of stented 
ureters with technical success . Only stents placed at least 12 hours will 
be included in the analysis. If the lower bound of the confidence interval exceeds 85%, the alternative hypothesis will be demonstrated  
Sample Size Parameters  Assuming that the Tria™ stent technical success rate is 94% for S tone 
Management, a sample size of 127 subjects with Tria™  placed  at least 
12 hours for Stone M anagement is required to attain 90% power to 
demonstrate the primary hypothesis at the 2.5% significance level(one-sided). Approximately 142 Stone M anagement subjects  with Tria™ 
stent procedures where stents indwell at least 12 hours will be required  
to allow for 10% subject attrition

Page [ADDRESS_485350]-procedural period.  Stents may also be used for long- term 
drainage in patients with strictures or tumors, or to aid in ureteral healing after an accidental ureteral perforation or a therapeu tic ureterotomy.  With such a wide variety of uses, ureteral 
stents may remain indwelling for periods as short as 48 hours or up to as long as 365 days (see individual stent Instructions/ Directions for Use (IFU/ DFU) for maximum indwell time) . 
One such use of ureteral stents is temporary stenting following ureteroscopic treatment of upper urinary tract stones.  These stones can range in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters and are generally made up of mineral and acid salts, with 70 -80% of kidney 
stones being made of calcium oxalate.   The remaining make up of stones are split by [CONTACT_387469], uric acid and calcium phosphate. (Satyanand, Patel, Patel, Tarun, & Soniya, 2012) In a 2007-2010 survey showed kidney stone prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] population estimated to be 10.6% for men and 7.1% for women with an overall unadjusted prevalence to be 8.8%.  (Ziemba & Matlaga, 2017) 
 
Treatment decisions for stones are determined at the individual case level and take into account stone size, stone location, and (if known) stone composition, as well as patient preference and physician expertise. Current treatment recommendations are generally endourologic procedures such as ureteroscopy (URS), shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). (Türk, et al., 2016)  Ureteral stents are placed after ureteroscopy for stone removal to prevent pain (Torric elli, De, Hinck, Noble, & Monga, 
2014) and to aid in future removal of residual stone fragments. (Chen, Tsai, Yu, Wu, & Lin, 2013)  Thus, ureteral stents are a fundamental part of a urologic stone practice. Further, ureteral stents have been used for maintaining luminal patency in ureteral obstruction, including cases of malignant ureteral obstruction due to pelvic malignancy. If uri ne flow to 
the bladder is not possible, a ureteral stent is placed in the kidney to facilitate drainage following ureteral conduit construction and urinary diversion procedures ; rerouting of urine 
flow to an opening in the wall of the abdomen (stoma) . This  stenting provides greater 
assurance of sustained internal urinary diversion, in addition to lessening concerns regarding anastomotic leaks from the pouch.   
 
While usually used temporarily, occasionally patients may have long- term stent placement.  
Long-term indwell of a ureteral stent increases the risk of encrustation (accumulation of urine salts on the surface of the stent) and can lead to serious and difficult complications such as ureteral obstruction and renal impairment.  The most common contributors to encrustation include urinary tract infection, extended indwell times (for chronic strictures or forgotten stents), urinary composition (hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, homocystinuria, and hyperuricosuria), and history of urolithiasis.  Severely encrusted and retained stents are

Page [ADDRESS_485351] often 
occurs in the bladder and kidney, they often require a multimodal endoscopic approach to achieve stent -free status.  (Mohan-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_24124], Keeley, Maussa, Smith, & Tolley, 1999)
  
 
Beyond encrustation, another area of interest in ureteral stents is patient discomfort.  Ureteral stent pain is a known side- effect of indwelling stents.  There have been various studies to 
determine the best way to measure and decrease the pain associated with ureteral stents with no apparent resolution for the issue.  It is hypothesized that a stent composed of a soft flexible material may reduce stent related discomfort.   A randomized controlled study of 155 
subjects showed a significantly higher incidence of dysuria, renal, and suprapubic pain in those subjects who received a firm polyurethane stent versus a soft stent. (Koprowski, Kim, Modi, & Elsamra, 2016)   
 
Other published studies have explored the duration of time the stent is left in place, (Ozgur, Ekici, Yuceturk, & Bayrak, 2013) use of image guidance in stent placement,  (Grasso, et al., 
2013) length and other physical features of the inserted stent, (Calvert, et al., 2013) and efficacy of pre -stenting prior to ureteroscopy. (Torricelli, De, Hinck, Noble, & Monga, 2014) 
 
4.2. Study Rationale  
Under normal conditions, urine is carried from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters. A ureter may become obstructed as a result of a number of conditions including kidney stones, tumors, blood clots, postsurgical swelling, or infection. When the urine flow is blocked, it backs up into the kidney, which can lead to kidney swelling or hydronephrosis, as well as severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or side; nausea; vomiting; and hematuria. The goal of treatment for ureteral obstruction is to  relieve or reduce the blockage and restore urinary 
drainage. Ureteral obstruction is commonly treated via placement of a ureteral stent; a thin, 
flexible tube that is threaded into the ureter and restores the flow of urine to the bladder.  The 
most common reason for urinary diversion is bladder cancer that requires the bladder to be removed, a procedure called a cystectomy. Urinary diversion creates a new way for  urine  to 
exit body when urine flow is blocked or when there is a need to by[CONTACT_387470] . 
 The patient is usually placed under anesthesia for stent insertion, ensuring that the patient remains relaxed and immobile during the procedure. A cystoscope is inserted into the urethra to the bladder, and the opening to the ureter is identified. In some instances, a guidewire is inserted into the ureter under the aid of a fluoroscope. The stent is loaded onto the guidewire and subsequently advanced over the guidewire by a stent positioner (pusher). Once the stent is in place, the guidewire, positioner, and cystoscope are removed. If retrograde stenting is 
not possible, patients may have the stent placed percutaneously into the kidney, and subsequently into the ureter.  Postoperative urine flow is monitored to ensure the stent has not been dislodged or obstructed. The stent may remain in place on a short-term (days to weeks) or long-term (weeks to months) basis and  is removed most often cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. A

(available in Soft and Firm durometers) with proprietary Percushield™ surface technology aimed at reducing calcium and magnesium urine salt accumulations . The goal of this registry 
is to collect real -world clinical  data on BSCs Ureteral Stents  to address  changing European 
Regulatory requirements .  In contrast to the limited published data for safety and efficacy  of  
BSC Double- J Ureteral Stents, there are published clinical data sets on stent -related pain and 
Quality of Life (QoL), with many  of studies showing increased side effects and reduced QoL

A certified copy is a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the original record that has been verified (i.e., by a dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_97214] a validated process) to have the same information, including data that describe the context, content, and structure, as the original.  
 
11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1. Endpoints 
11.1.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  – Technical Success  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the technical success of Tria™ in stone management. For 
all stents except UDS, technical success is defined as stented kidney drains (to bladder) 
during the planned indwell time with no re -intervention due to obstruction of the stented 
ureter (s). For UDS, technical success is defined as drainage following stent placement during 
the planned indwell time with no re-intervention for obstruction.  Restenting with a new 
study stent may only occur during the initial stent placement procedure for such situations as 
stent misplacement, improper stent size choice, or other conditions, as necessary and will not be considered as a primary effectiveness endpoint failure or a secon dary endpoint failure for 
stricture resolution.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses 
The study will evaluate whether Tria™ stents have technical  success during planned indwell 
in more than 85% in stone management. The null and alternative hypotheses for this evaluation are

Page 50 of 90 
 
     H 0:  p ≤  85% 
   H 1: p > 85% 
where p is  the proportion of ste nted ureter (s) with technical success .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sample Size  
There are two published studies on the patency in the stone management for Double J 
stents.   The success rates were 98% with a 95% CI [94%, 99%] (Calvert, et al., 2013) and 
96% with a 95% CI [92%, 99%] (E l-Faqih SR, 1991).  As a result, an 94% patency rate is 
estimated as the performance for the Double J stents.  T he performance goal of 85% is 
chosen for the patency for TRIA in the stone management, with a non-inferiority margin of 9%. 
With a one-sided type I error of 0.025 and a type II error of 0.10 (90% power), a sample size of 127 subjects with Tria™ placed at least 12 hours for stone management are needed to demonstrate the proportion of stented ureters with technical success exceeds 85%. Assuming a 10% attrition rate, at least 142 stone management subjects with Tria™ stent procedures where stents indwell at least 12 hours are required. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
The hypotheses above will be evaluated based on the two- sided 95% exact Clopper -Pearson 
confidence interval for the proportion of stented  ureters with technical success . Only stents 
placed at least  12 hours will be included in the analysis. If the lower bound of the confidence 
interval exceeds 85%, the alternative hypothesis will be demonstrated. Sensitivity analysis to missing data will be performed using tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-point analysis.  
In addition, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model will be used to estimate the 
technical success rate to account for within -subject correlation due to bilateral stent 
placement  if applicable . 
Descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals will be utilized to summarize the technical success rates for the non- stone management subjects treated with Tria™ stents 
respectively.  
For non T ria™ ureteral stent s in the study, the technical success rates will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_387460] 95% confidence intervals by [CONTACT_35151] ( i.e. stone 
management, benign obstruction, malignant obstruction, ureteral dysfunction, bladder cancer , 
and other as  applicable) respectively  for each device type.  Only stents placed at least [ADDRESS_485365] related to the study stent( s) 
implanted.

  [IP_ADDRESS]. Hypotheses 
There is not a pre-specified pass/fail hypothesis for this endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Statistical Methods  
Rates of serious adverse device effects will be summarized using descriptive statistics (event 
counts, proportion of subjects with a SADE) for each study stent type implanted respectively.  
In addition, all AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_387476] e and/or device for each 
study stent type implanted respectively.  
 
11.2. General Statistical Methods  
11.2.1. Analysis Sets 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) subject population includes all subjects who provide written 
informed consent to be enrolled into the study, and have the stent placement pr ocedure 
initiated.  The As Treated (AT) Population includes all subjects for whom the sten t placement is 
completed . 
The Per Protocol (PP) population includes all subjects in the AT Population who meet all 
eligibility criteria.  
The endpoint analyses will be performed for the ITT population. The AT and  PP populations 
will be evaluated as sensiti vity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint and the safety 
outcomes will also be assessed using the AT population. 
11.2.2. Control of Systematic Error/Bias 
All subjects will be treated according to the directions in the Operating Manual and 
IFU/DFU.  
The primary efficacy endpoint analysis based on the exact Clopper-Pearson confidence interval  is specified to be conservative in order to avoid bias towards demonstrating the 
primary hypothesis (i.e., achieving the performance goal) of the study. Furthermore, the potential of bias from missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed through tippi[INVESTIGATOR_18275].  
11.2.3. Number of Subjects per Investigative Site

  procedures and/or follow-ups and by [CONTACT_113646]. 
17.5. Anticipated Benefits  
The benefits of having any ureteral stent include the facilitation of drainage from the kidney, or kidney  to the bladder.  Ureteral stents may also aid the ureter as it heals after procedural 
intervention.  The information gathered from this study may help physicians worldwide develop a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of ureteral stents, li terature reported 
stent related pain and QoL  associated with stent indwell time.  
 
18. Safety Reporting 
18.1. Reportable Events  by [CONTACT_387485] f rom the time of index procedure to end of the study: 
• Serious Adverse Device Effects  
• Serious Adverse Events related to the Index Procedure (inclusive of Study Stent Implant Procedure) and/or  Study Stent Removal Procedure  
• Serious Adverse Events resulting in death (regardless of relatedness to the study device and/or procedure, i.e., Index, Stent Implant, and/or Stent Removal)  
• Device Deficiencies  
• Adverse Device Effects   
• Adverse Events related  to the Index Procedure (inclusive of Study Stent Implant 
Procedure) and/or Study Stent Removal Procedure. 
Adverse events to be reported include both anticipated and expected post procedural events (such as pain, hematuria, urgency, frequency, urinary leakage and ureteral strictures , etc.) in 
addition to any other unanticipated or unexpected events. 
When possible, the medical diagnosis should be reported as the Event Term instead of 
individual symptoms. 
If it is unclear whether  an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be 
isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or

Not Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 Relationship to the device , comparator or procedures can be excluded when:  
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the study device or the 
procedures  related to the use of the study device ; 
- the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device 
(if the r esponse pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible;  
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or 
increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event;  
- the event involves a body- site, or an organ  that cannot  be affected by [CONTACT_272627];  
- the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying  
or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment 
or other risk factors);  
- the event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_262474], when applicable;  
- In order to establish the non- relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be 
met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious 
event.  
Possibly Related  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 The relationship with the use of the study device or comparator, or the relationship 
with procedures  is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are 
also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an 
effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases w here relatedness cannot be 
assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible.  
Probably Related

Causal Relationship  
Ref: MDCG 2020- 10/1 
 The serious event is associated with the study device, comparator  or with 
procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:  
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or 
of similar devices and procedures;  
- the event has a temporal relationship with  the study  device use/application or 
procedures;  
- the event involves a body- site or organ that  
-the study device or procedures are applied to;  
-the study device or procedures influence ; 
- the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the 
response pattern is previously known);  
- the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of 
activation/exposure)  and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of 
activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible);  
- other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition 
or/and an effect of another devi ce, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled 
out; 
- harm to the subject is due to error in use;  
- the event depends on a false result given by [CONTACT_387487], 
when applicable;

investigative site’s IRB/EC/REB .  Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to 
use of the form.  The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC /REB  approval prior to their use.  Privacy language shall be included 
in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable.   
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall at a minimum include the following steps, as well as any other steps required by [CONTACT_5751], rules, regulations and guidelines: 
• be conducted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_5704],  
• include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate throughout the clinical study,  
• avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate, 
• not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights,  
• use native language that is non-technical and understandable to the subject or his/her legal representative,  
• provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if necessary,  
• ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the clinical study.
  
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_387489], rules, regulations and guidelines and by [CONTACT_1755]/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by [CONTACT_5753] a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written informa tion must be given to the person signing the form.  
Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by [CONTACT_387490] (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning of such an event). Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC /REB ), as 
appropriate. 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future healt h 
and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, administrative changes, or

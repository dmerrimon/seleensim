Protocol Number: MNK15011001  Phase: 3 Country:  US 
Title of Study: A Phase 3 Multicenter, Single Arm,  Open -label  Study Evaluating the Safety , 
Tolerability  and Efficacy of StrataGraft® Construct in Pediatric Subjects with Deep Partial -Thickness  
(DPT)  Thermal Burns  
Study center(s):  Approximately  10 sites 
Objectives:  
Primary:  To evaluate whether StrataGraft treatment promotes wound closure and reduces or 
eliminates the need for donor site harvest and autografting in a pediatric population with thermal 
burns that contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting would be  part of standard of 
care (deep partial -thickness [DPT] burns).  
Study Design:  This is a prospective, open -label, single  -arm, age -stratified study to examine the 
safety and efficacy of StrataGraft construct in the treatment of pediatric subjects with therm al burns 
that contain intact dermal elements and for which autografting would be part of standard of care  (deep 
partial -thickness [DPT ] burns ). This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of StrataGraft 
in the treatment of DPT thermal burns, d efined as those that contain intact dermal elements and for 
which excision/debridement and autografting are clinically indicated . 
Methodology: Approximately 50  subjects will be enrolled into one of two age -based cohort s: 2 to < 
12 years ( up to  n = 40) and 12 to ≤ 17 years (up to n = 10). The proposed study population will 
include pediatric subjects with thermal injuries covering no more than 30% of their total b ody surface 
area (TBSA)  with at least 0.5% TBSA DPT thermal burn . Each subject must also have a sufficient 
area of healthy skin available for use as a donor site in the event that autografting is clinically 
necessary. Study assessments will include the incidence of adverse events (AEs), including wound 
infection, and additionally monitor ing of  vital signs, clinical laboratory values, immunological values 
(where possible), wound closure, including any autografting, and skin quality of the treatment site .  
Number of patients (planned): Approximately 50 subjects are planned to be enrolled.

• Percent of subjects achieving and maintaining persistent wound closure at Months 6 and 12.  
• Mean scar satisfaction based on PSAQ scores at  Week 12 and  Months  6 and 12.  
Safety:  The assessment of subject safety will consist of monitoring treat ment -emergent adverse 
events, adverse events of special interest, serious adverse events, vital signs, and w ound -related 
adverse events, including infection, throughout the study duration.  These data will be epi[INVESTIGATOR_706676] a Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC ). Safety laboratory values (complete blood count 
with differential and  comprehensive metabolic panel)  will be measured along with panel reactive 
antibodies (PRA) and anti -bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies.  
Statistical Overview : This pediatric study plans to enroll up to 50 subjects  into one of two age 
cohorts : 2 to < 12 years ( up to n = 40) and 12 to ≤ 17 years (up to n = 10). Analyses will be performed 
as the overall population . Analyses by [CONTACT_706716] . 
For the primary endpoint, number (%) and 95% confidence interval ( CI) will be summarized based on 
the Intent -to-Treat population. Subjects with missing data will be imputed as nonresponders. The 
summary will also be performed based on all observed data, ie , excluding any missing data.  
After the primary endpoint is successfully achieved, the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will 
each be tested in a hierarchical manner in their ranked order , using  a 2-sided confidence interval with 
0.05 Type I error .  
• The averaged percent area closed per subject will be calculated as, “Sum of percent area 
closed across treatment sites for a subject/the number of treatment sites on that subject”  
• The percentage of StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure 
without autograft placement on or before Week 12 will be calculated as [(Total number of 
StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure without autograft ing on 
or before Week 12/Total number of treatment sites) x 100]

5 years  (Krishnamoorthy, 2012 ; Kramer, 2010 ). Every day in the U nited States, more than 
300 children (age  from  0 to 19 years ) are treated for burn injuries in  emergency departments , and 
2 children die as a consequence of their burn injury  (Borse, 2008 ). Approximately 90% of 
pediatric burns are caused by [CONTACT_706718] , with scald burns being most common 
amongst younger children and flame burns most c ommon in the older child  (National Burn 
Repository, 2019 ). Further, far more children under the age of 12 years are burned than are 
adolescents.  
Figure  1: Number and Etiology of Burns by [CONTACT_706719]: Figure 11, National Burn Repository, [ADDRESS_960075] 
burn wound management. The ultimate aim of wound management in burns is to prevent wound 
infection and facilitate closure of the wounds, either spontaneously or by [CONTACT_363892].  
Key elements of burn wound management include cleansing, debridement or surgical excision, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_706678], and dressi ngs. 
Regardless of the age of the patient, evidence suggests that early excision of burn eschar is 
effective in decreasing morbidity, improving the mortality rate , and reducing length of stay  
(Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9245], 1985 ; Muller, 1994 ; Herndon, 1989 ), as well as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680]  (Munster, 1994 ). Deep 
partial  thickness (DPT) burns that  are expected to  take longer than 3 weeks to heal and full -
thickness burns (with the exception of very small injuries) should be grafted, as this reduces 
hypertrophic scarring and results in better cosmesis  (Heimbach, 1987 ; Chipp, 2017 ).  
Excised areas are usually closed with autograft or with allograft, xenograft , or other skin  
substitute until autograft is available or the wound spontaneously closes.  Availability of 
autologous donor tissue , however, is limited by [CONTACT_363893] . In larger injuries, 
donor sites are often harvested  repeatedly , increasing the likelihood of scarring at those sites.  
Further, the simple harvest of a donor site incurs acute pain as well as the potential for infection 
and scarring.  As such, methods to reduc e the amount of donor tissue needed to achieve wound 
closure are always sought.  
StrataGraft is a viable, bioengineered,  allogeneic , cellularized scaffold product  composed of a 
differentiated epi[INVESTIGATOR_706679] a single  human donor 
grown on a dermal equivalent comp osed of purified Type I animal collagen containing normal 
human fibroblasts from a second donor. The viable cells of StrataGraft produce and secrete a 
variety of growth factors, cytokines, and antimicrobial pep tides . These factors  are known  to be 
involved in wound repair and tissue regeneration.  
4.2. Study Rationale  
StrataGraft is under development by [CONTACT_706720] , a Mallinckrodt Company, as an 
alternative to autografting to promote the healing of acute the rmal burns.  A Biologic s Licens e 
Application for StrataGraft for the treatment of adults with thermal burns containing intact 
dermal elements for which surgical intervention is clinically indicated (DPT burns) has received 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  approval . Data from a Phase  3 study  in adults  
demonstrate d that 83% of  wounds treated with a single application of StrataGraft achieve d 
durable closure at Month 3  without autografting  (Holmes, 2020 ). For th at study, durable wound 
closure was defined as closure at [ADDRESS_960076] common ly reported  adverse event s (AEs) 
associated with StrataGraft are pruritus , blister , and hypertrophic scar .  
Subjects in this study will undergo surgical excision /debridement  of nonviable tissue in the burn 
wound . The risks associated with this procedure  include pain and bleeding at the surgical site as 
well as potential complications of anesthesia, such as nausea/vomiting, chills, and sore throat.  
All procedur es and activities in this study, other than the actual application of StrataGraft, are 
generally accepted as standard of care for patients with thermal burns and are not considered to 
present any potential increased risk to the subjects.  More detailed info rmation about the known 
and expected benefit, risks, and reasonably expected AE s can be found in the StrataGraft 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
4.4. Xenotransplantation Considerations  
StrataGraft  is a xenotransplantation product because in the past, one of the cell types used to 
make StrataGraft  was grown with mouse cells. The cell banks have been tested and found to be 
free of detectable infectious agents and mouse cells are no longer used in the manufacture of 
StrataGraft . There have been no identified health concerns associated with these mouse cells.   
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_706680] , per federal regulations,  to 
donate whole blood, blood components, source p lasma or source leukocytes. However, 
individual blood banks may request an exception  from FDA . StrataGraft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_706681]. StrataGraft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_706682], tissues, breast 
milk, ova, sperm, or body parts for transplantation.  
A small amount of blood (3 mL), called an archival sample, will be collected before StrataGraft 
application. This sample could be used as a b aseline to assess health issues that may be related to 
treatment. These samples will be used only for the purpose of responding to a request from FDA. 
Both archival samples and any associated subject  information will be stored and used only as 
required and  allowed by [CONTACT_2371].

5.1.3.  Primary Outcome Measures:  
• Percentage of participants achieving confirmed complete closure of StrataGraft 
treatment sites without autograft within 12 weeks of StrataGraft application, ie,

needing the doctor to treat the burn with skin cut from other parts of the pat ient’s own 
body.  
• Number of participants with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) that 
occurred between StrataGraft application and the end of the study (within [ADDRESS_960079] data collection) and considered related to StrataG raft. This measure is  not to be

Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960082] of care . As 
previously discussed, far more pre -school and school -aged children are burned than adolescent s. 
Qualified subjects will be enrolled into one of two age -based  cohorts : 2 to < 12 years ( up to 
n=40) and 12  to ≤ 17 years (up to n=10).   
Informed consent  will be obtained from parents/guardians and assent  from the child , whe n 
appropriate, as determined by [CONTACT_706722] -related assessments or procedures are conducted.  After  consent is provided, 
data collected during the course of admission and routine  assessment may be  abstracted from the 
medical record and  used for study purposes.  
Following a screening period of up to 14 days, subjects will be enrolled and r eceive a single 
application of StrataGraft to  0.5% to 10% total body surface area ( TBSA ), which may be 
composed of up to [ADDRESS_960083] visit will depend upon 
the ability of the sites to identify and enroll eligible subjects. The study is expected to enroll 
subjects over a period of 12 to 18 month s. The e ntire study is expected to require approximately 
2.5 years to complete.  
Safety  assessments will include monitoring incidence of AE s, wound -related events, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory values (where possible ), immunological markers (where possible ), wound 
closure, pain , and scarring.  
Subjects will undergo baseline assessment s including a targeted physical examination an d 
collection of clinical laboratory assessments during  Screening. After enrollment and StrataGraft 
application, wound asses sments , photographs,  and solicitation of AEs will be performed at each 
study visit  via telephone  or video  interaction  if the subject is  unable to attend the visit . However, 
wound closure may only be assessed at face-to-face visits. If not collected during Screening, 
clinical laboratory samples will be collected via venipuncture performed prior to StrataGraft 
application on Day 1. Immuno logical samples (monitoring of PRA and anti-BSA antibodies) will 
be collected prior to StrataGraft application , and again  between Week  [ADDRESS_960084]’s study participation ends after the Month [ADDRESS_960085]’s wound status

6.2. Study Design Rational e  
Deep partial thickness  and full thickness burns that are expected to take longer than 3 weeks to 
heal are usually autografted, as this reduces the incidence of hypertrophic scarring and results in 
better cosmesis  (Heimbach, 1987 ; Chipp, 2017 ). Donor sites are painful and patients have 
rema rked that they are more painful than the burn injury itself (Romanelli, 2019 ; Sinha, 2017 ). 
Availability of autologous donor tissue is limited by [CONTACT_363893], and in larger 
injuries, donor sites may be  repeatedly harvested, increasing the likelih ood of scarring at those 
sites.  
Clinical data  from the STRATA2016 pi[INVESTIGATOR_706683] d that more than 95% of subjects achieved 
closure without autografting after treatment with StrataGraft, thereby [CONTACT_706723] .   
6.3. Treatment Rationale  
StrataGraft is a  viable, bioengineered , allogeneic , cellularized scaffold product  that is anticipated 
to provide immediate wound coverage, aid in wound bed conditioning, and promote autologous 
tissue regeneration and wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need to harvest 
autologous donor tissue in adults.  
Recent clinical data in adults demonstrate that treatment of DPT  thermal burns with StrataGraft 
results in wound closure while reducing or eliminating the need for autograft.  Although similar 
to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_706684]  (ie, STRATA2016) , this study of pediatric subjects will recruit not 
only younger subjects (ie, no t adults) but also subjects with smaller TBSA burn. The reduced 
TBSA burn in pediatric subjects reflects the greater surface area to mass ratio of children 
compared to adults and the accompanying fluid status lability, limited physiologic reserves, as 
well as the reduced body size and attendant challenges.  
The present  study is being conducted to explore the efficacy and safety of StrataGraft in pediatric 
subjects with thermal burns containing dermal elements to better understand the product profile 
in a ped iatric population.  
6.4. Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_706685], the medical monitor as well as the DMC  will assess safety  and efficacy . The DMC  
will be independent of study conduct  and their activities governed by a Charter .  
Subject enrollment may be paused  pendin g discussion with the DMC  if any of the following  
events  occur:  
• Unexpected infection at the StrataGraft  treated site  that is possibly or probably related 
to StrataGraft  and is an SAE.   
• Severe acute hypersensitivity reaction attributed to StrataGraft .  
• Death attributed to StrataGraft .  
Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960086] Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
Subjects are free t o withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time. If a 
subject/parent/guardian decides to discontinue subject’s participation, the reason(s) for 
discontinuation will be documented.  
A subject’s participation may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator, if 
the subject is uncooperative, is noncompliant, or the investigator feels that it is in the subject’s 
best interest to be withdrawn from the study. Additionally, the subject may be considered lost to

Subjects who reach the age of majority (usually 18 years of age) during their participation in the 
study will be re -consented.  
11.2. Screening Assessments  
The screening period is a maximum of 14 days from the day of injury to Day 1. The screening 
assessments wil l help to determine eligibility for study enrollment. During this period, the 
prospective study sites will be managed nonoperatively per the institution’s standard of care . 
Subjects and/or parent/guardian will provide informed consent prior to any study -specific 
assessments being performed.  If, following excision/ debridement , the designated potential study 
site does not meet eligibility criteria, the subjec t will be considered a screen failure and no 
further assessments or study procedures will be performed . Only after excision/debridement  of 
the study site and application of StrataGraft will the subject be considered “enrolled .” 
11.2.1.  Medical History and Physical Examination  
Significant medical history will be collected using an abbreviated review of systems with  
particular attention to any previous surgical procedures performed, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], diagnosed 
chronic conditions and any routinely administered medications.  The date of last menstrual period 
will be collected from post -menarche females.  
The physical examination will be performed to include evaluation of lungs, heart, abdomen, and 
extremities.  The findings of the physical examination will be recorded.

identified  and following fenestration/meshing, sheet(s) of StrataGraft will be applied and 
secured. The number of StrataGra ft constructs  applied to each treatment site will be documented . 
Details are provided in the Manual of Procedures . 
11.3.2.  Wound Closure Assessment  
After excision/debridement  and application of study treatments, the investigator  will examine the 
study site(s) as per the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8) and visually assess wound 
closure, documenting a quantitative assess ment  of the proportion of  the wound that is 
re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_129091] . For this study, confirmed compl ete wound closure is defined as , “complete  
re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_706698]”  observed at [ADDRESS_960101] 2 
weeks apart  (FDA, 2006 ), but no later than Week 20 .  
11.3.3.  Area of the Study  Sites Autografted  
The area of each StrataGraft treatment site that is autografted will be measure d during the 
autografting procedure.  Details about obtaining wound measurement s is provided in the Manual 
of Procedures.

Page 39 of 75 11.3.4.  Photography of Treatment Sites  
All StrataGraft treated sites will be photographed in the operating room and at each study visit  to 
seria lly assess the area(s) of open wound in each treatment site. The photographer will be a 
trained study team member or trained caregiver.  Subjects will atte nd weekly visits until complete 
wound closure is confirmed . Following  confirmed complete  wound closure , or if subjects cannot 
attend the study site,  subjects and/or caregivers will be asked to photograph their wounds  so that  
ongoing closure of their wound(s) can be assessed.  In the event of a wound -related adverse 
event, photos of the affected wound will b e taken to help document the event. Specific 
instructions and guidelines for photo -documentation will be provided in the Photography 
Manual.  
11.3.5.  Skin Quality of Treatment Sites  
The POSAS (Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale) will be  used to assess the StrataGraft  
treated site(s) at visits designated in the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8). The POSAS 
scale has 2 components : the observer assessment and the subject assessment. The observer 
assessment uses a [ADDRESS_960102] component uses the same 10 -point scal e to 
assess pain, itching, stiffness, color, thickness , and overall opi[INVESTIGATOR_706699]. 
The investigator will complete the Observer POSAS assessment and a  parent/guardian will 
complete the subject assessment on behalf of subjects unable t o do so themselves . 
The PSAQ (Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire) was created specifically to assess linear 
scars and has not previously been used to assess burn scars. However, one of the [ADDRESS_960103]’s satisfaction with their scar, an assessment 
that is not made in the POSAS. In its development, the PSAQ demonstrated internal consistency 
for each subscale, including the Satisfaction with Appearanc e subscale (Cronbach ɑ of 0.89 to 
0.94), as well as high test -retest reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient [ ICC] of 0.67  
to -0.83) of the same, demonstrating a high level of reliability in the use of the subscales 
independently. Only the [ADDRESS_960104] or a parent/guardian (on behalf of subjects unable to do so themselves) at each 
assessment per the Schedule of Study Events ( Section  6.8). 
11.3.6.  Other Wound Assessments  
The StrataGraft treatment site(s)  will also be assessed for clinical signs of infection, and the 
investigator will document the appearance of the wound using various descriptive terms.  At 
investigator discretion, treatment of infected/suspected infected wound sites may include the use 
of targeted wound cleansing agents, topi[INVESTIGATOR_706678] (excluding silver  and 
sulfa - -containing treatments  such as  mafenide acetate ) and/or systemic antibiotics. Wound -
related adverse events will be documented with photographs of the affected wound. See 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for further details.  
11.4. Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
The start and stop date s, dose, unit, frequency, route of administration , and indication for all 
prior and concomitant me dications, nondrug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg , blood transfusions, oxygen 
supplem entation, physical therapy, etc) and other procedures will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960105].  If such results are not avail able, blood samples for research purposes 
will be collected only as part of a clinically necessary  venipuncture.  Clinical sample  analysi s for 
CMP and CBC  with differential  studies will be performed at the institution’s local laboratory.  
Investigators must review and sign laboratory reports and document the clinical significance of 
any laboratory abnormalities . New , clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or clinical ly 
significant changes in laboratory values will be reported as AEs.  
11.6. Immunological Assays  and Archival Samples  
Panel reactive antibodies  (PRA), anti-BSA antibody and archival samples will be obtained prior 
to StrataGraft application from all enrolled subje cts. Samples for the assessment of PRA and 
anti-BSA antibodies will also be obtained between Week 7 and Month 6 for all treated subjects.  
Specific instructions for collection, processing, storage, and shipment of these samples will be 
provided in the Labor atory Manual . 
11.7. Pain Assessment  
The EVENDOL pain assessment scale, a tool validated in preverbal children, will be used to 
assess pain in enrolled subjects  up to 5 years of age  (inclusive) . The EVENDOL scale is 
designed such that it can  be completed by [CONTACT_206091] (eg,  parent) based upon outward 
behavioral manifestations such as crying, facial expressions, movements and posturing as well as 
environmental interactions  (Fournier -Charr ière, 2012 ).  
The FPRS (F ACES  pain rating scale ), a well -documented and validated tool, will be used to 
assess pain in enrolled subjects  older than 5  years of age.  The FPRS is demonstrated to 
effectively evaluate pain using a Likert -like scale of facial expressions, which  are converted into 
numeric values to obtain a quantitative assessment of pain  (Wong, 1998 ).  
Details regarding  administration of the pain assessment tools are provided in the Manual of 
Procedures.  
11.8. Assessment of the Need for Continued Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706700] 1 but prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], an assessment of the need 
for continued hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706701].  Investigators will be asked to identify the 
reason(s) for continued hospi[INVESTIGATOR_631620]: pain management, fluid  or nutritional  status, 
infection risk, ongoing infection, inability to perform activities of daily living, insufficient social 
support, or other issues .

11.9.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward or undesirable medical occurrence in a subject who is administered a 
study treatment, which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (inclu ding an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of study treatment.  
Examples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to pro gression of 
underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medica tion. Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• “Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacologi cal action ” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the d efinition of an AE 
or SAE.  
Events that do not meet  the definition of an adverse events  include:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.

Page 42 of 75 • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated da y-to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Failure to achieve complete wound closure by [CONTACT_10585] 12.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is an AE which exhibits a different nature or severity than those identified in 
the Investigator’s Brochure or has not previously been noted in relationship to StrataGraft.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as those that are not present  at start of study treatment or 
that represent the exacerbation of a pre -existing condition during the treatment -emergent period. 
The treatment -emergent period is defined as the time from the application  of StrataGraft to the 
end of the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adv erse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
Death  
Death is an outcome of an event. The cause of death should be recorded and reported on 
the SAE Form. All causes of death must be repo rted as SAEs. The investigator should 
make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to the Sponsor 
or designee, or state not available. See Section  4.4 for xenotransplantation considerations.  
Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening if, in the 
view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused dea th. For example, hepatitis that resolved 
without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening, even though 
hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, an allergic reaction resulting in 
angioedema of the face would not  be life -threatening, even though angioedema of the 
larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706702] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The following si tuations should 
not be reported as SAEs:  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760].  
Protocol V ersion  3, 26 Sep 2023  MNK15011001  
 
______________________________________________________________________________  
Confidential and Proprietary  
Page 43 of 75 • A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine 
procedure followed by [CONTACT_16018] (eg , stent removal after surgery). This should 
be recorded in the study file.  
• A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition that has not worsened.  
Persistent or significant incapacity  
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) whic h may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Congenital anomaly or birth defect  
After enrollment and follow up in this study, any pregnancy reported to occur will be              
followed to conclu sion and all live -born children will be followed for [ADDRESS_960106] may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical 
events inc lude allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
department or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Anticipated Adverse Events  
Adverse events (serious or nonserious) that commonly occur in the study population or 
background regimen will be considered anticipated events. Such events include known 
consequences of the condition under investigation (eg, symptoms, disease progression)  
and other events that may be common in this study population. A list of anticipated 
events for this study population is provided in the Investigators Brochure. Anticipated 
events are to be recorded in the eCRF and reported as SAEs when serious. These SAEs  
will not be expedited to health authorities, but rather, included in aggregate safety reports.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (serious or nonserious) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the sponsor ’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_35348]. AESI will be reported 
using the SAE /AESI  Report Form and observe the same reporting timeline ( Table  6). For this 
study, Adverse Events of Special Interest  (AESI)  include:

Page 44 of 75 • Signs/symptoms of endot oxin reaction (ie., combination of hypo/hyperpyrexia, 
hypo/hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and change in mental status) within 24 
hours after StrataGraft application  
• Unexpected or unusual infections   
• Derma tological malignancy  
If any of the above occ urs, the event will be reported within [ADDRESS_960107] knowledge of the 
event and follow -up reports provided as changes in the event occur.  Photographs will be taken of 
the affected wound(s) to document the AESI.  
11.9.2.  Adverse Event Medical Management Plan  
In the event of an AE, the investigator will use accepted standard of care (medication or surgery) 
as needed. A tiered approach will be used for the medical management of complications specific 
to the study burn sites, as described below:  
• Initial management of local infection or immune reactions with topi[INVESTIGATOR_706703] -inflammatory agents, respectively.  
• Systemic antibiotics or anti -inflammatory medications administered for infections or 
immunological responses that fail to respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_706704]. 
• For complications that do not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_538669], the treated 
wound may be excised and the complication managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_110845], as necessary.  
• Based on clinical judgment, autograft may be applied to the resulting wo und bed to 
expedite wound closure.  
11.10.  Relationship to Investigational Product   
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred , and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always assesses causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE 
data to the Sponsor.  
The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
The following classifications should be used when evaluating the relationship of AEs or SAEs to 
study treatment.  
Table  4: Adverse Event Relationships  
Relationship  Definition  
Unrelated  No relationship between the AE and the administration of study treatment; the AE 
can be explained by [CONTACT_706729]’s 
clinical state.  
Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960108]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject.  
Probably related  A reaction that follows a plausible  temporal sequence from administratio n of the 
study treatment  and has a biologically causal  relationship with the study treatment , 
and the influence of alternative factors  for the AE is unlikely .  
11.11.  Severity Assessment  
For purposes of consistency, if required the investigator may use the intensity grades presented 
in Table  5. 
Table  5: Adverse Event Intensity Grades  
Grade  Definition  
Mild  Does not interfere with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
Moderate  Interferes to some extent with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
Severe  Interferes significantly with subject ’s usual function and activities.  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or 
severe myocardial infarction). The event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
importance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the 
subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject ’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  
If an AE increases in severity (eg, from moderate to severe); decreases in severity (eg, changes 
from moderate to mild); or if there is a change in seriousness, a new AE will b e opened and the 
original AE will be closed. If an AE is still ongoing at the time of a subject’s completion of the 
last study follow -up visit, the resolution/stop date and time is left blank.  
11.12.  Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be r ecorded starting at the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) and 
will be followed by [CONTACT_706730]. All study site follow -
up should be documented.  
Adverse events, AESIs, and SAEs will be reported from execut ion of the ICF through 
completion of study participation. The investigator is required to record the AE, regardless of the 
severity of the event or its relationship to study treatment.

Page 46 of 75 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event ba sed on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
The investigator must follow all A Es until the event has resolved or stabilized or at such tim e, 
the investigator refers the subject to a non -study physician. The investigator will document 
further all of the follow -up information in the subject’s source documents.

11.13.  Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female subject, or the female partner of a male subject, be comes pregnant during the study, 
the investigator will report to the Sponsor as soon as she/he becomes knowledgeable of the 
pregnancy. The subject will be followed for the duration of the pregnancy and the outcome (eg, 
spontaneous abortion, live birth, sti ll birth, congenital anomalies, birth defects) will be reported 
to the Sponsor as soon as it is known. If the pregnancy results in a live birth, a postdelivery 
follow -up will be performed at least [ADDRESS_960110] be reported to the 
Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance personnel, or designee, within 24  hours of the study site becoming

12.1. Sample Size Determination  
Approximately  50 subjects will be enrolled  into one of two age cohorts:  up to 40 subjects in  2 to 
< 12 years  cohort or up to 10 subjects in 12 to < 17 years .  
An overall  sample  size of 50 subj ects will provide  greater than 90% power to d etermine that at 
least 50%  of the subjects achieve confirmed complete closure of all StrataGraft treatment sites on 
or before Week 12 without autograft placement, assuming  that the actual proportion of  subjects 
with confirmed complete  closure of all  StrataGraft treatment sit es without autografting will be > 
83%. This assumption is based upon the results of a study in adults for the same indication 
(Holmes, 2020 ).

the normal approximation to the  binomi al will be summarized based on the ITT population. 
Subjects with missing data will be imputed as non-responders.  The statistical significance for th e 
primary endpoint is declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the endpoint is ≥ 50%.  
The analysis will also be performed based on all observed data, i.e, excluding any missing data.

The Objective, Population , Hypothesis, Endpoi nt, and Intercurrent Events and Data Handling for 
the Primary Endpoint are described in  Table  7. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ranked Secondary Endpoints  
After the primary endpoint is successfully reached, the ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will 
each be tested with a 2 -sided confidence interval with 0.05 Type I error in a hierarchical manner 
in the rank order as in  Table  8. The ranked secondary endpoints are:  
1. Mean of averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment site closed per subject at 
Week  [ADDRESS_960115] acement  
2. Number (%)  of confirmed complete wound closu res of the StrataGraft treatment sites 
on or before Week [ADDRESS_960116] at Week 12 will be calculated as (Sum of  percent 
area closed across treatment sites for a subject at Week 12/the total number of treatment sites on 
a subject) . 
The percentage of StrataGraft treatment sites with confirmed complete wound closure on or 
before Week 12 will be calculated as [(Total n umber of StrataGraft treatment sites with 
confirmed complete wound closure without autografting on or before Week 12/Total number of 
treatment sites) x 100].   
The averaged percent area of StrataGraft treatment sites per subject autografted by [CONTACT_10585] 12 will  
be calculated as (Sum of percent area of StrataGraft treatment sites per subject autografted by 
[CONTACT_10585] 12/the number of treatment sites on that subject ). It is a cumul ative sum of  percent area 
autografted for all nonmissing  visits on or  before Week 12 .

For binary endpoints, number (%) of subjects and its 95% CI derived from  the normal 
approximation to the  binomi al will be summarized based on ITT  by [CONTACT_706734].  The denominator for a treatment site is determined by [CONTACT_706735]. The number and percent of missing data will be shown.  
The missing data of binary endpoints will not be imputed  for exploratory endpoints .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exploratory Endpo ints 
For continuous and binary exploratory endpoints, the analyses will be the same as ones in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . For the time -to-event efficacy endpoint, the Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be presented based on the ITT population. Subjects not having any event during the 
study will hav e their time censored at the last available date in the study. The Kaplan -Meier 
estimates and 95% CIs for the 25th percentile, 50th percentile and 75th percentile will be 
presented.  
For each exploratory continuous  endpoint, the summary statistics with 95% confidence interval 
(CI) will be presented based on the ITT population  by [CONTACT_706736].  
The exploratory endpoints for this study are:  
• Mean percent area of StrataGra ft treatment site closed without autograft placement at 
Week  8 
• Mean Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) observer total score at 
Week 12, and Months 6 and 12.  
• Changes in skin quality outcome (POSAS and Patient Scar Assessment Questionnaire 
[PSAQ] scores) across time.  
• Incidence and severity of pain at the treatment site using EVENDOL (EValuation 
ENfant DOuLeur, ie, Evaluation of Child Pain; observer or parent) or FPRS (Wong -
Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale with 6 faces with expressions denoting de grees of 
pain; subject) over time.  
• Percent of subjects with complete closure of StrataGraft treatment site without 
autografting at Weeks 6 and 8 and Months 6 and 12.  
• Time to complete closure following application of StrataGraft.  
• Mean percent wound closur e over time from Day 21 through Month 12.  
• Percent of subjects achieving and maintaining persistent wound closure at Months 6 
and 12.  
• Mean scar satisfaction based on PSAQ scores at Week 12 and Months 6 and 12.

Page 54 of 75 13. SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted in full compliance with applicable international, national , and local 
regulatory requirements , including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations , 21 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 56, 314.106 and 312.120 (where applicable), 
International Council  on Harmonization ( ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) in 
accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki, and 
European regulation 536/2014/EU (where applicable).  
13.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain the approval of the IRB/ independent ethics 
committee (IEC) before the start of the study. A copy of the approval letter along with a roster of 
IRB/IEC members and compliance letter or their US Departmen t of Health and Human Services 
general assurance number will be provided to the Sponsor and retained as part of the study 
records. During the course of the study, the investigator will provide timely and accurate reports 
to the IRB/IEC on the progress of t he study at appropriate intervals and at the completion of the 
study. The investigator  will notify the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings per 
IRB/IEC guidelines. The study protocol, ICF, advertisements (if any), subjec t-facing materials, 
and amendments (if any) will be approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC in conformance with international, 
national , and local regulatory requirements.  
An investigator may not make any changes in the conduct of the study without IRB/IEC and 
Sponsor approval except when ne cessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the 
subjects. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may 
be implemented immediately ; however,  the change must then be documented, reported to the 
IRB/IEC and Spons or within [ADDRESS_960119] Information and Consent  
The ICF to be submitted to the IRB /IEC  must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_706739]/IEC  submission.  Once approved, only the IRB/IEC -reviewed and -approved consent form 
may be used to consent subjects.  The investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the 
IRB/IEC’s written approval as well as the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of the study.  
At Screening, and at any other time as may be required by [CONTACT_138314], subjects/parents/guardians 
will be presented with the IRB/IEC -approved consent forms and any privacy authorization as 
required by [CONTACT_27952] (such as the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act [HIPAA] authorization form).  Subjects/parents/guardians will be given a 
description of the stud y providing content as per the essential elements of informed consent,

Page 55 of 75 allowed time to ask questions, asked to read the consent form(s) and then provided an 
opportunity to discuss the  contents of these forms with study site personnel.  
As the subjects in this study are all minors  at study enrollment , parents/guardians will be asked 
to sign these forms in compliance with ICH GCP and all applicable national and international 
regulations,  before participating in any study -related procedures. Subjects and/or parent/guardian 
will be made aware that they may withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects unable to give 
written informed consent must orally assent to the procedures when having r eached the 
appropriate age per local policies and written informed consent must be obtained in accordance 
with national and local laws, as applicable.  Subjects who reach the age of majority (usually 
18 years of age) during their participation in the study will be re -consented.  
The ICF must contain all applicable elements of informed consent and the mandatory statements 
as defined by [CONTACT_6573], including confidentiality.  All versions of each 
subject's signed ICF (originals) will be maint ained by [CONTACT_779].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_706707](s) and the HIPAA authorization form, if applicable, will be given to the 
subject/parents/guardians.  
If a subject withdraws consent and/or HIPAA authorization, the investigator may no longe r 
disclose health information, unless it is needed to preserve the scientific integrity of the study.  
13.4. Master Identification List  
At the time of consent, each subject will be assigned a unique study identification number.  The 
investigator or designee is res ponsible for maintaining a list of each subject’s name, medical 
record number and assigned study identification  number.  The investigator must follow all 
applicable privacy laws in order to protect a subject’s privacy and confidentiality.  Information 
that c ould identify a subject will be blinded on any material received by [CONTACT_1034].  
13.5. Data Protection  
Study subjects will be assigned a unique study identifier.  All subject records or datasets that are 
transferred to the Sponsor will be identified by [CONTACT_706740] e study identifier only.  Study site 
personnel are responsible for purging subject names and medical record number from any 
records shared with the Sponsor.  
Within the ICF, the subject/parents/guardians will be informed that his/her personal study -related 
data will be used by [CONTACT_706741].  In addition, 
subject/parents/guardians will be informed that medical records may be examined by [CONTACT_591841] t he Sponsor, by [CONTACT_1744]/IEC 
members, and/or by [CONTACT_465213]/auditors from regulatory authorities.  
13.6. Committees Structure  
An independent DMC  will be convened in order to ensure that the safety of subject s is 
adequately protected. The DMC  objectives, composition, and  operational details of its activitie s 
will be defined in the DMC Charter.  
Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960120] data will be released as required by [CONTACT_123356]/or 
national regulation.  
13.8. Data Quality Assuran ce 
The Sponsor performs quality control and assurance checks on all clinical studies that it 
financially supports. Before enrolling any subjects in this st udy, Sponsor personnel and the 
investigator review the protocol, the investigator ’s Brochure, the eCRF and instructions for their 
completion, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting AEs 
and SAEs. A qualified representative of the Sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study.  
The investigator  will per mit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspections by [CONTACT_155608].  
Each subject’s eCRF should be fully completed in a timely fashion, usually within [ADDRESS_960121] notify the Sponsor to agree upon an acceptable storage solution. Regulatory 
agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation.  
Any changes in investigator (s) or sub -investigator(s) will be promptly disclosed to the Sponsor 
and will require an updated Statement of Investigator (ie,  FDA form 1572) . As such, the 
investigator  must promptly disclose these changes to the Sponsor or their designee.  
The investigator  must notify their IRB/IEC of protocol deviations in accordance with local 
regulatory and IRB/IEC requirements.  
The eCRF data are stored in a database and processed electronically. The Sponsor’s medical 
monitor  will review  the data for safety information. The data are also reviewed for completeness 
and logical consistency. Automated validation programs will identify  missing data, out -of-range 
data, and other data inconsistencies. In addition, clinical laboratory data will be processed 
electronically. Requests for data clarification will be forwarded to the study site for resolution 
and responded to in a timely fashio n, usually within [ADDRESS_960122]. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_222343]. It is the responsibility 
of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need 
Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960123] 
obtain written approval from the Sponsor.  
13.10.  Study and Site Closure  
The Sponsor may suspend or terminate the study or part of the study at any time for any reason. 
If the investigator suspends or terminates the study, the investigator will promptly inform the 
Sponsor and the IRB/IEC and provide them with a detailed written explanation. Upon study 
completion, the investigator will provide the Sponsor, IRB/IEC, and reg ulatory agency with final 
documents, reports , and summaries as required by [CONTACT_19124]. Study termination and follow -up 
will be performed in compliance with the Sponsor ’s or designee ’s standard operating procedures.  
The Sponsor, investigator, or local and  national regulatory authorities may discover conditions 
during the study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated. This action may 
be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and investigator. Conditions that 
may war rant termination of the study/study site include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled 
in the study.  
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing or 
evaluation of the investigational product . 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate.  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulations.  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to the Sponsor, study 
monitor, or local and national regulatory authorities.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.

Protocol V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960125] animal 
(Ward, 2018 ), which prompts this discussion for the study of StrataGraft.  
There are several questions that should be addressed to justify this clinical study. These 
questions are: 1) is this disease only found in pediatric patients? 2) are alter nate treatment s 
available that are just as effective? a nd 3) will the study result in value to the subject or to the 
population of subjects that may receive the treatment?  
To address the first question, although burns of the nature to be recruited in this study, are seen 
across the age spectrum, the healing response may differ depending upon the recuperative 
abilities, which do not change with age. As such, the issue of burn  treatment in this age group is 
unique. Second, there are alternate treatments that may be considered to be just as effective.  
However, there are collateral concerns about autografting that make the StrataGraft approach 
particularly attractive in this pop ulation. Should StrataGraft decrease or eliminate the need for 
autografting in pediatric children with DPT burns as it has been demonstrated to do in adults, 
then use of StrataGraft may be beneficial  to these patients . Moreover, the ease of use of 
StrataGr aft will be very helpful to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_706710] s where dedicated burn units are geographically distant.  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and the following:  
• Consensus ethical princi ples derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences (CIOMS) International Ethical Guidelines  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines  
• Applicable laws and regulations  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, Investigator Brochure, and other relevant 
documents ( eg, advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by [CONTACT_10998]/IEC before the study is initiated.  
• Any am endments to the protocol will require IRB/IEC approval before 
implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC  
Protocol V ersion  3, 26 Sep 2023  MNK15011001

− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 
536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable lo cal 
regulations  
Financial Disclosure  
Investigators and sub -investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statem ents to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are 
responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 
1 year after completion of the study.  
Informed Consent Process  
• The investigator or his/her  representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
participant (who is capable of providing assent) and his/her legally authorized 
representative and answer all questions regarding the study. Participants and their 
legally authorized representativ e must be informed that their participation is 
voluntary . The statement of informed consent (ICF)  that meets the requirements of [ADDRESS_960126] (HIPAA) requirements, where a pplicable, and the IRB/IEC or 
study center must be signed by [CONTACT_423]’s legally authorized representative as all 
subjects will be minors  at the time of enrollment. Subjects who reach the age of 
majority (usually 18  years of age) during their participati on in the study will be re -
consented.  
• The medical record of each study subject must include a statement that written 
informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and 
the date the written consent was obtained. The authorize d person obtaining the 
informed consent must also sign the ICF.  
• Participants must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during 
their participation in the study.  
• A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant and the participa nt’s legally 
authorized representative.  
Data Protection  
• Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456]. Any participant 
records or datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; 
participant names or any in formation which would make the participant identifiable 
will not be transferred.  
• The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used 
by [CONTACT_10999]. The level of disclosure 
must also be explained to the participant.

[CONTACT_78582], by [CONTACT_6667]/IEC members, and by [CONTACT_9326].  
Committees Structure  
An independent DMC will be convened in order to ensure that the safety of subjects is 
adequately protected. The DMC objectives, composition, and operational details of its activities 
will be defined in the D MC Charter.  
Publication Policy  
• The results of thi s study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this 
is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the 
sponsor before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information 
and to provide co mments.  
• The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as ind ividual 
site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9231].  
• Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_14346].  
Data Quality  Assurance  
• All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic CRF 
unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory data). The 
investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accu rate and correct by 
[CONTACT_1189].  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports 
the information entered in the CRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC  review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study 
including quality checking of the data.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source  data verification to confirm that data 
entered into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in  accordance with the currently 
approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
• All records, source documents, study worksheets, signed ICFs, and any other 
documents pertaining to the conduct of this s tudy must be retained by [CONTACT_706742] V ersion  3, [ADDRESS_960127], unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. 
(US 21CFR§312.62). No records may be destroyed during the retention period 
without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another 
location or party without written notification to the sponsor.  
Source Documents  
• Source documents provide evidence for the existence  of the participant and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the 
investigator’s site.  
• Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source 
documents must be consistent with the source d ocuments or the discrepancies must be 
explained. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer 
records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available.  
Study and Site Closure  
The sponsor designee reserve s the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time 
for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies 
have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_11004]:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guid elines  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_093]  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development

PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile.  
Non-WOCBP Status  
• Premenarchal  
• Permanently sterile female is a post-menarchal, pre-menopausal female with 1 of the 
following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Docume nted bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
− Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation may come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• A post -menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post -
menopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy  (HRT). Note that in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
Pregnancy Testing  
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate in this study. All women 
of childbearing potential will be t ested for pregnancy  during Screening  and if found to be 
pregnant, will be excluded from participation.  
Contraception  
Acceptable forms of contraception include hormonal measures (oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, injections), intrauterine devices, double barrier method 
(condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicidal gel or foam), and abstinence.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Participants Who Become Pregnant     
• The investigator will collec t pregnancy information on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant's pregnancy. The partic ipant will be followed to determine the outcome of 
the pregnancy. The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant 
and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, 
follow -up will not be required for lon ger than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated

status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported 
as such. Any post -study, pregnancy -related SAE considered reasonably rela ted to the 
study treatment by [CONTACT_135708]. While the 
investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study 
participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
continue with all scheduled study evaluations. Pregnant subjects will be followed 
until post -partum and the outcome of the pregnancy will be reported.

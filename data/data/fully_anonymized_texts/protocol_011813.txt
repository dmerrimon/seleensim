to 8 years after randomization, which is described in Protocol Amendment II.  36 
 37 
Protocol Change #1  38 
 39 
Current Protocol (Protocol Amendment III 6 -18-15) 40 
Symptoms of d iplopia are not assessed in the current version of the protocol.  41 
 42 
Proposed Change  43 
To assess symptoms of diplopia by [CONTACT_803245] 44 
8-year visit.   45 
 46 
Rationale for Change  47 
Diplopia (double vision) is an important long -term outcome following surgery for strabismus  and [ADDRESS_1108751] 50 
and whether it differs between treatment groups.   The Diplopia Questionnaire1 is a validated, 51 
reliable 8-item self -administered questionnaire designed to assess the presence and frequency of 52 
diplopia in specific gaze positio ns.   53

up after the 3-year primary outcome  (>3 years to 8 years from randomization) .  93 
 94 
Objective  95 
To compare long -term outcomes between subjects originally treated with bilateral lateral rectus 96 
muscle recession versus unilateral  lateral rectus recession with medial rectus resection for the 97 
treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type intermittent exotropia.  98

Protocol Specified Follow -up Visits  100 
Visits will occur at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years ( ±2 months ) from randomization.  Additional follow -up 101 
visits are at investigator discretion.   102 
 103 
Study Procedures and Data Collection  104 
The following testing procedures will be performed  in the following order: * 105 
 106 
1. Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaire  (8-year visit only)   107 
2. Diplopia Question naire (8-year visit only)  108 
3. Visual acuity  109 
 Testing will be performed using the electronic E-ETDRS testing protocol  110 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction , if worn.     111 
 If prism is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be performed with prism.   112 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be 113 
performed with the overminus correction.  114 
 If visual acuity is 20/32 or worse (75 letters or less)  in either eye, a manifest refraction [ADDRESS_1108755] be performed. If the examiner believes that the patient’s current correction is not 116 
optimal, trial frames with new correction should be used for all testing at the visit.  This 117 
includes testing vis ual acuity again, with the patient wearing trial frames.    118 
4. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near #1:   119 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.    120 
 If prism is currently prescribed, testing should be performed without prism.   121 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, testing should be performed in trial 122 
frames without the overminus component of the prescription.   123 
5. Preschool Randot stereoacuity testing at near (performed at 40 cm)  124 
 Testing must be performed in cur rent refractive correction .     125 
 If prism is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be performed with prism.   126 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, stereoacuity testing should be 127 
performed with the overminus correction.    128 
 Stereoacuity is tested immediately following the first assessment of control of the 129 
exodeviation ; no 10 -minute break is needed.  130 
6. Ocular alignment  testing in prism or deliberate overminus (for patients currently prescribed 131 
prism or deliberate overminus)    132 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17   Measure ocular alignment at near  only, in the primary position using cover/uncover , [ADDRESS_1108756]  134 
 This testing should be performed with prism or deliberate overminus (as applicable).   135 
7. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near #2 (repeat) ( see item #2 ) 136 
 The second control testing is performed immediately after the previous testing —it does 137 
not need to be performed before dissociative testing  and no 10 -minute break is needed.  138 
 The same examiner  should assess IXT control each of the three different times that 139 
control is assessed during the annual study visit.    140 
8. Ocular alignment in the primary position using cover/uncover , SPCT  and PACT at distance 141 
and near   142 
 Testing must be performed in current refractive correction.    143 
 If prism is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be performed without 144 
prism.   145 
 If deliberate overminus ** is currently prescribed, ocular alignment testing should be 146 
performed in trial frames without the overminus component of the prescript ion.   147 
9. Control of exodeviation assessment at distance and near  #3 (repeat) ( see item #2 ) 148 
 The third control testing is to be performed immediately after the previous testing —it 149 
does not need to be performed before dissociative testing  and no 10 -minute break  is 150 
needed.  151 
 The same examiner  should assess IXT control each of the three different times that 152 
control is assessed during the annual study visit.   153 
10. Cycloplegic refraction (7-year visit only)  154 
 If the current correction at the 7 -year visit is not optimal ba sed on the cycloplegic 155 
refraction, new spectacles should be prescribed.   156 
 157 
*Testing procedures are performed as described in section 2.5 unless otherwise specified  above .   158 
 159 
**Deliberate overminus lenses = lenses that yield > 0.50 D more minus  spherical equivalent (SE) [ADDRESS_1108757] refraction will be recorded.    166 
 167 
Treatment  168 
Treatment in the extension study is at investigator discretion , including non -surgical treatment 169 
and reoperation.    170 
 171 
Costs  172 
The parent/guardian of each subject will be compensated $50 per visit for completion of each 173 
annual protocol -specified follow -up visit (4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8 - year) for a maximum of $250.  If [ADDRESS_1108758] is unable to complete the annual study visits 175 
without additional funds due to travel costs, additional funds may be provided.  176 
  177 
In the additional 5 years of follow up provided for by [CONTACT_803246] (>3 years to 8 178 
years after randomization), t he study will pay for visits specific to the research study, but will not [ADDRESS_1108759] of 180 
usual care visits will be the parent(s) or their insurance company’s responsibility.  181 
 182 
Treatment is at investigator discretion and is not part of this protocol.  Any costs associated with 183 
treatment will not be paid for by [CONTACT_1758].  The study will pay for a pair of spectacles (lenses 184 
and frames) at the 7 -year visit; spectacle changes / new spectacles prescribed at other times will [ADDRESS_1108760] During Follow Up  192 
Between annual visits, subjects will be called by [CONTACT_803247]; birthday [ADDRESS_1108761] to 197 
continue their child’s study participation. An assent for the extension  study will be signed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1108762] (and respective parent)  may withdraw from the study at any time.   201 
 202 
Statistical  Analysi s 203 
Statistical analyses will primarily be cross -sectional comparisons of outcomes including ocular 204 
alignment, exotropia control, and stereoacuity between treatment groups at each annual visit .   205 
 206 
The analysis of the primary basic IXT cohort  will be considered primary whereas the analyses in 207 
the smaller primary pseudo divergence excess IXT cohort and the secondary cohort  will be 208 
considered exploratory.  209 
 210 
Statistical analyses may also be performed combining some or all of the cohorts.  211 
 212 
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be written and finalized prior to the completion of the 213 
study  and may supersede the plan briefly described herein.   214

PROTOCOL AMENDMENT (4 -30-10) 221 
 222 
This amendment provides for the following protocol changes:  223 
 224 
Protocol Change #[ADDRESS_1108763] exodeviation at either distance or near to be 228 
between 15 and 50 PD (inclusive) by [CONTACT_803248] (PACT).  [ADDRESS_1108764] exodeviation at either distance, near, or 232 
remote distance  be between 15 and 50 PD (inclusive) by [CONTACT_803248] (PACT) 233 
(sections 1.3, 1.4, 2.2.1, and 6.1).  Add an additional eli gibility criterion requiring that the [ADDRESS_1108765] 15 PD at distance or near (sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2.1).   [ADDRESS_1108766] at distance (6 meter), near, 238 
or remote distance (at least 50 feet). The largest angle in the surgical dose tables in the protocol 239 
is 50 PD because BLRrec is considered by [CONTACT_803249] 240 
larger than 50 PD.  Because randomization would not be appropriate for patients with angles 241 
greater than 50 PD, the eligibility criteria is being tightened to exclude not only patients with 242 
distance or near angles >50 P D, but also those patients with remote distance angles >[ADDRESS_1108767] the distance or the near angles.   248 
 249 
Protocol Change #2  250 
 251 
Current Protocol  252 
There is no upper limit on the  amount of hyperopia allowed for eligibility. Refractive correction is 253 
required for patients with hyperopia >+5.00 D and the guidelines for prescribing refractive correction 254 
specify that residual (uncorrected) hyperopia cannot exceed +5.00 D.    255 
 256 
Proposed Change  257 
Add an eligibility criterion which specifies ‘no hyperopia greater than +3.50 D spherical 258 
equivalent (SE) in either eye’ (sections 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2.1). Omit from the enrollment chapter the 259 
guideline requiring spectacle correction be prescribed for hyperopia >+5.[ADDRESS_1108768] no more than +5.00 D residual hyperopia (section 2.2.1).  261 
For follow up, change to require refractive correction for patients with hyperopia >+3.50D 262 
(section5.3.1) and change ref ractive correction guidelines to specify that residual (uncorrected) 263 
hyperopia cannot exceed +3.50 D (section5.3.2).          264 
 265 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  Rationale for Change  266 
The proposed changes are to make refractive error eligibility and prescription guidelines 267 
consistent with th ose in the IXT2 study.  The reasons for this change are as follows: 1) it was felt 268 
that making these items parallel between the two studies will avoid confusion among study 269 
investigators, 2) it is expected that the percentage of otherwise -eligible IXT pati ents with 270 
hyperopia greater than +3.50 D SE is very low, and 3) that patients with very high hyperopia [ADDRESS_1108769] a neurologic condition and might be a different than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_803240] 272 
patient  273 
 274 
Protocol Change #3  275 
 276 
Current Protocol  277 
All patie nts are randomized regardless of whether the magnitude of their exodeviation increased or 278 
decreased out of study eligibility range (15 to 50 PD) before surgery has occurred.     [ADDRESS_1108770] rec ent distance, near, and remote 282 
distance angles has decreased to <15 PD or increased to >[ADDRESS_1108771] already been 284 
randomized, it is at investigator discretio n whether to perform surgery and what type of surgical 285 
method to perform (i.e. BLRrec, R&R, or any other type of procedure). Changes made to [ADDRESS_1108772] preoperative angle is 290 
between 15 and 50 PD.  Given that the surgery window extends to 60 days after enrollment and 291 
that surgery could potentially occur even later, it is possible that a patient’s exotropia could 292 
increase or decrease out of the elig ibility range of 15 to 50 PD before surgery. As discussed in 293 
protocol change #1 above, randomization to BLRrec or R&R would not be appropriate in [ADDRESS_1108773] preoperative angle is 295 
required to be a minimum of 15 PD to ensure that a reasonable amount improvement would be 296 
required to meet one of the study’s treatment success criteria --an exodeviation less than [ADDRESS_1108774] of distance and 298 
near angles at enrollment.  299 
   300 
Protocol Change #4  301 
 302 
Current Protocol  303 
Currently the surgical dose tables start with doses for 15 PD angles.   304 
 305 
Proposed Change  306 
In surgical dose tables 1 and 2 (section 3.3), removed 15 PD angles, added 16 PD angles using 307 
the 15 PD doses, and added 18 PD angles using the 20 PD doses.  308 
 309 
Rationale for Change  310 
There was an inconsistency between the angles listed in the surgical dose tables and the prism 311 
increments that the IXT1 Procedures Manual specifies should be used for meas uring ocular 312 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17  alignment. Prisms in 2 PD increments should be used for angles between 10 and 20 PD, therefore 313 
an angle between 15 -20 PD could be measured as 16 PD or 18 PD, but not as 15 PD.   314 
 315 
Protocol Change #5  316 
 317 
Current Protocol  318 
Control of exodeviation is measured at enrollment only.   319 
 320 
Proposed Change  321 
Control of exodeviation would be measured at masked exams as well as at enrollment (sections 322 
1.3 and 4.5).  [ADDRESS_1108775] better control if their exodeviation persists or recurs, particularly 328 
if the primary analysis does not find a di fference in surgical failure rates between the two 329 
procedures.  330 
 331 
Protocol Change #[ADDRESS_1108776] -operative treatment 336 
(section 4.1) indicates that any non -surgical treatment of any overcorrection, undercorrection, or 337 
deviations associated with diplopia is at investigator discretion at any time during the study.  338 
However, the guideline s for refractive correction during follow -up (section 5.3.2) indicate that 339 
deliberate overminus using refractive correction with more than 0.50 D of overminus will not be 340 
allowed.   341 
 342 
Proposed Change  343 
The prohibition of deliberate overminus with more than 0. 50 D of overminus will be removed 344 
from the refractive correction guidelines during follow up (section 5.3.2), although it will be 345 
retained in the refractive correction guidelines for enrollment.  346 
 347 
Rationale for Change  348 
This change resolves a protocol inconsi stency.   349 
 350 
Protocol Change #[ADDRESS_1108777] 6 PD at distance and near (sections 1.4, 4.1, and 4.4.1).   360 
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17   361 
Rationale for Change  362 
Although these concepts are different —i.e. what level of constant esotropia should receive 363 
mandatory prism treatment for patient safety, and what level is appropriate for determining 364 
surgical failure —it was felt it would be less confusing and easier for investigators to remember if 365 
the cutoffs used were identical.       366 
 367 
Protocol Change #8  368 
 369 
Current Protocol  370 
The current protocol does not spe cify whether patients wearing prism and/or overminus should [ADDRESS_1108778] clinical assessments performed with prism and/or overminus, or without.   372 
 373 
Proposed Change  374 
Clarified refractive correction to be used for testing during follow -up (section 4.3, 4.4, 4.5).  375 
Ocular alignment testing (and control assessments at masked exams) should be performed in 376 
current correction without any prism or deliberate overminus that has been prescribed.  377 
Stereoacuity testing and visual acuity testing should be performed in current co rrection with any 378 
prism or deliberate overminus that has been prescribed.  379 
 380 
Rationale for Change  381 
For ocular alignment, it was felt that the patient’s true deviation should be assessed and that this [ADDRESS_1108779] be achieved by [CONTACT_803250] c orrection but without prism and 383 
without overminus  384 
For stereoacuity and visual acuity testing, it was felt that we should measure the patient’s best 385 
stereoacuity and visual acuity, which for patients prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus 386 
would likely  be achieved with current correction including prism and/or deliberate overminus.  387 
 388 
Protocol Change #9  389 
 390 
Current Protocol  391 
Protocol change #8 specifies that during follow up, stereoacuity testing should be performed with 392 
any prism or deliberate overminus tha t has been prescribed.  393 
 394 
Proposed Change  395 
At the 3 -year visit, patients who are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus will [ADDRESS_1108780] Preschool Randot Stereoacuity at near repeated without wearing prism or overminus 397 
(sections 4.5.3 and 6.3.1). This additional Preschool Randot retest without prism and without 398 
overminus should occur after all initial stereoacuity testing has been completed (ie. after the 399 
Titmus Fly at near) and before the cont rol of exodeviation assessment. This testing without prism 400 
and overminus is for an exploratory analysis and is not considered in the determining whether 401 
the patient meets surgical failure criteria.             402 
 403 
Rationale:  [ADDRESS_1108781] to 405 
know whether a patient classified as a success would still be classified as a success if the patient 406 
had been measured without prism.  Because ‘success’ only applies to the 3 -year visit (whereas [ADDRESS_1108782]), we propose to measure stereoacuity [ADDRESS_1108783] the primary outcome, and the without -prism measurement wil l be used in an 410 
exploratory analysis which would avoid calling a patient a success at 3 -years on the basis of a 411 
better stereo that is enhanced by [CONTACT_803251]. The same logic should apply to patients wearing 412 
deliberate overminus —ie. stereoacuity should be measure d with the overminus throughout the [ADDRESS_1108784] 414 
used in the exploratory analysis.    415 
 416 
 417 
 418 
 419 
This amendment also provides for the following minor protocol clarifications:   420 
 Clarified guidelines for prescribing the spherical component of refractive correction (sections 421 
2.2.1 and 5.3.2)  422 
 Specified test distances for stereoacuity testing and for ocular alignment testing (sections 2.5, 423 
4.3, 4.4, 4.5).    424 
 Clarified refractive err or eligibility criteria that treatment with prism or overminus lenses [ADDRESS_1108785] one week prior to enrollment (section 2.2.1).  426 
 Clarified eligibility criteria that visual acuity in the worse eye must be ‘0.3 logMAR or 427 
better,’ to elimina te confusion about whether ‘at least 0.3 logMAR’ meant at least 0.3 428 
logMAR numerically (meaning worse acuity) or qualitatively (meaning better acuity) 429 
(sections 1.4 and 2.2.1).    430 
 Clarified that hangback, hemi -hangback, and adjustable techniques will not b e allowed for [ADDRESS_1108786] scleral bite at the original insertion 433 
site (section 3.3).  [ADDRESS_1108787] INFORMATION  437

 CHAPTER 1:  BACKGROUND AND SUMMA RY 535 
 536 
This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_149354] (PEDIG) and [ADDRESS_1108790] or planned that address management of 539 
intermittent exotropia.  540 
 541 
1.1 Background  542 
Intermittent exotropia (IXT) is the most common form of childhood onset exotropia with an 543 
incidence of 32.1 per 100,000 in children under 19 years of age.2  Intermittent exotropia is 544 
characterized by [CONTACT_803252] , 545 
but may also be present at near.  Normal binocular single vision (BSV) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_93177] 546 
near when the exotropia is controlled, with evidence of normal (occasionally sub -normal) [ADDRESS_1108791] effective for the correction of IXT 555 
and the debate has long been related to differentiation between IXT sub -types.  Based on 556 
distance -near angle disparity, IXT sub -types are classified  as: 1) basic (similar magnitude of 557 
misalignment at distance and near); 2) true divergence excess (larger at distance); 3) pseudo 558 
divergence excess (initially larger at distance, but near angle increases following occlusion or 559 
with addition of plus lenses at near); 4) convergence insufficiency (larger at near).  Basic and [ADDRESS_1108792] 562 
common procedures are bilateral lateral rectus recession (BLRrec) and unilateral lateral rectus 563 
recession combined with a medial rectus resection in the same eye (R&R).  Traditionally, 564 
BLRrec has been advocated where there is a larger distance angl e, and R&R where there is a 565 
similar angle at distance and near.7,8  A survey of American strabismus surgeons published in 566 
[ZIP_CODE] found that the majority performed BLRrec for both basic and divergence excess types.  567 
Similarly, we found by [CONTACT_803253] a BLRrec 568 
for basic type IXT .  Nevertheless, controversy sti ll exists as to which of these surgical 569 
approaches is superior.10  Advocates of the BLRrec procedure tend to hold that surgery should be 570 
based purely on the distance angle of deviation.5,11  Proponents of R&R surgery suggest [ADDRESS_1108793] addresses the exodeviation at near.7,12   572 
 573 
The proposed advantage of the R&R procedure is that resecting the medial rectus, with a [ADDRESS_1108794] that the more profound 576 
and prolonged initial overcorrection occurring with R&R is not only unnecessary, but may in [ADDRESS_1108795] will a nswer questions 584 
regarding the failure rates of these surgeries and also provide needed data on the potential harm 585 
of each procedure.   586 
 587 
Only one prospective randomized clinical trial addresses success rates of BLRrec versus R&R 588 
for IXT.12  After  between 12 -15 months of follow up, 82% of 17 patients  undergoing an R&R 589 
had a satisfactory outcome compared to 52% of 19 patients undergoing a BLRrec.  Nevertheless, 590 
there are some important limitations of this previous study.  The sample size was very small.  591 
The study population was a sub -group of patients with basic type IXT, excluding patients with 592 
basic IXT whose angle of deviation increased at far distance or following occlusion, thus 593 
limiting the generali zability of the results.  In addition, outcom es were assessed unmasked, 594 
potentially biasing the results.  One observational  study13 of 103 patients (90% of whom  had 595 
basic type IXT ) found 1-year success rates of 56% for BLRrec and 60% for R&R.  A 596 
retrospective study14 of 115 patients  with basic t ype IXT reported  success rates  of 69% for 597 
BLR rec and 77% for R&R after an average of [ADDRESS_1108796] chance of long -term 605 
success, minimizing suboptimal results and repeat surgeries .  606 
 607 
The present study is being conducted to compare the effectiveness of BLRrec with R&R for the 608 
surgical treatment of basic type and pseudo divergence excess type IXT.  609 
 610 
1.2 Study Objective  611 
To evaluate the effectiveness of bilateral lateral rectus muscle reces sion versus unilateral lateral 612 
rectus recession with medial rectus resection  procedures for the treatment of basic type and 613 
pseudo divergence excess type intermittent exotropia  614

 CHAPTER 2:  ENROLLMENT  AND RANDOMIZATION  683 
 684 
2.1 Eligibility Assessment and Informed Consent  685 
A minimum of 378 subjects (189 with basic type IXT and 189 with  pseudo divergence excess 686 
type IXT ) are expected to be enrolled for the primary cohort ( section 6. 1), with a goal to enroll 687 
an appropriate representation of minorities.  An additional 76 patients are expected to be enrolled 688 
for the secondary cohort ( section 6.3 ) during recruitment for the primary cohort.  As the [ADDRESS_1108810] signed an informed consent form can be randomized up until the end date, which means the 691 
expected recruitment might be exceeded.  The maximum number of randomized subjects will be 692 
474. 693 
 694 
For pat ients who appear eligible for the study following a “standard -care” or preliminary 695 
examination, the study will be discussed with the child’s parent(s) or guardian(s) (referred to 696 
subsequently as parent(s)).  Parent(s) who express an interest in the study w ill be given a copy of [ADDRESS_1108811] be obtained from the parent 698

deliberate overminus and is not allowed at enrollment . However, prescribing no 732 
correction or prescribing less than the full cycloplegic hyperopic correction (i.e., 733 
prescribing reduced plus) is not  considered the same as overminusing for this protocol [ADDRESS_1108821] patients  without intermittent exotropia and hyperopic SE 735

2.3 Determination of IXT Type  780 
IXT will be classified ( see classification below ) at enrollment prior to randomization as:  781 
 Basic  Type  782 
 Pseudo Divergence Excess  Type  783 
 784 
The following types of IXT are not eligible:  785 
 True Divergence Excess  Type  786 
 Convergence Insufficiency Type  787 
 High AC/A Type  788 
 789 
Classification of IXT type will be done  as follows  (also see flowchart on next page ):   [ADDRESS_1108824] at distance and near:  792 
 If the measured deviation at near is > 10 PD larger than at distance, the IXT is classified as 793 
convergence insufficiency type .  794 
 If the distance and near deviations are within 10 PD of one another, the IXT is classified as 795 
basic  type.   796 
 If the measured deviation at distance is > 10 PD larger than at near, +3.00 D lenses should be 797 
placed over the current correction (using  trial frames or Halberg clips ) and the deviation at [ADDRESS_1108825].  799 
o If the angles equalize (dis tance and near within 10 PD) OR near exceeds distance by > 10 800 
PD, the +3.00 D lenses at near should be removed and -2.00 D lenses should be placed 801 
over the current correction (using  trial frames or Halberg clips ) and the deviation at 802 
distance should be re -measured.  803 
 If the distance angle with the -2.00 D lens es decreases by > 12 PD (compared to 804 
the distance measure without the -2.00 D lens es), the IXT type is classified as 805 
high AC/A type ; otherwise the IXT type is classified as pseudo divergence 806 
excess type . 807 
o If the distance angle exceeds near by > 10 PD measured with the +3.00 D lenses at near, 808 
the patient should be occluded for 45 minutes, after which the distance and near 809 
deviations should be measured again in the current refractive correction, while 810 
maint aining the dissociation .  If the near and distance deviations equalize (within 10 PD) 811 
or if near exceeds distance, the type of IXT is classified as pseudo divergence excess 812 
type.  Otherwise, the type IXT is classified as true divergence excess type . 813

following:  847 
 Preschool Randot stereotest at near  (performed at 40 cm) : If stereoacuity is worse than [ADDRESS_1108832] be retested and the  better of the 2 mea surements  will be used  for 849 
eligibility . 850 
 Distance Randot stereotest (performed at 3 meters)  851 
 Titmus Fly & Circles stereotest  at near (performed at 40 cm) (note: Animals are not 852

acuity or ocular alignment) prior to testing stereoacuity.    856 
3. Control of exodeviation : Control of exodeviation will be measured in current refractive 857 
correction at distance and near using the Office Control Score .16  858 
 Distance ( 6 meters )  - fixating  on an accommodative target such as a video for younger 859 
children or  reading optotype letter s for older children  860 
 Near (1/3 meter – fixating  on Lang -near viewing stick or similar accommodative target)  861 
 862 
The scale below applies to both dis tance and near.  863 
Intermittent Exotropia Control Scale16 864 
5 = Constan t Exotropia  865 
4 = Exotropia > 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  866 
3 = Exotropia < 50% of the 30 -second period before dissociation  867

 If no exotropia is observed during the [ADDRESS_1108835] of three rapi[INVESTIGATOR_803241]:  [ADDRESS_1108836] time to re -fuse.  881 
 The wors e level of control observed following the three [ADDRESS_1108837], the scale applies to the exodeviation.  884 
 Testing of control must be performed by a p ediatric ophthalmologist, pediatric [ADDRESS_1108838].  886 
 Testing must be done prior to dissociati ve testing  or at least 10 minutes after such testing . 887 
4. Ocular alignment testing :  888 
 Strabismic deviations will be assessed in current refractiv e correction  (either spectacles , [ADDRESS_1108839] lenses , or a trial frame) by [CONTACT_352722]/uncover test and then measured with the [ADDRESS_1108840] (SPCT) (if tropia is of sufficient duration to 891 
measure) and Prism and Alternate Cover Test (PACT) in p rimary position at near (1/3 892 
meter) , distance ( 6 meters) and remote distance (at least [ADDRESS_1108841]) (PACT only) as outlined in the IXT Testing Procedures Manual . 894 
 The deviation will be recorded as constant  if a manifest tropia is present 100% of the time [ADDRESS_1108842] 3 cover/uncover tests (one must be before 896 
any dissociation), or as intermittent  if a manifest tropia is present (including after 897 
dissociation) but not 100% of the time  during the entire exam .  The magnitude of the 898 
deviation may change (vary) independently of the frequency of the deviation; frequency 899 
of tropia (constant vs. intermittent) is determined solely by [CONTACT_803260] 900 
present all or some of the time , including after dissociation .  If a tropia is not observed at 901 
any time but a phoria is present, then the deviation will be recorded as not tropic (phoric 902 
only).  If no deviation is present at any time, ‘no deviation’ will be recorded.   [ADDRESS_1108843] a constant tropia but shows excellent stereoacuity that 904 
may be inconsistent with the diagnosis of constant tropia, the examiner should look 905 
over the child’s polarized glasses to determine whether the child is indeed 906 
constantly tropic  (by [CONTACT_803261]/uncover test).  907 
 The deviating eye will be recorded as "right", "left", or "alternates."  908 
 Testing will be performed following control of exodeviation testing and prior to any 909 
cycloplegia.  910 
 Ocular motility will be assessed inclu ding: ductions, oblique muscle  dysfunctions , 911

5. Visual Acuity Testing : Visual acuity tes ting will be done with current refractive correction  915 
without cycloplegia by a certified examiner with the Electronic Visual Acuity tester (EVA) 916 
using the ATS single surround HOTV protocol for patients < 7 years old and using the E - 917 
ETDRS for patients ≥ 7 years old.  The protocol for conducting the visual acuity testing is 918 
described in the ATS Testing Procedures Manual.  For each patient, t he same visual acuity 919 
testing protocol used at enrollment will be used throughout the study.    920 
6. Ocular Examination  as per investigator’s clinical routine (if not performed within 6 months)  921

prism.   1181  
 If deliberate overminus is currently prescribed, visual acuity testing should be 1182  
performed with the overminus correction.  1183  
 If visual acuity is found to be reduced by 0.2 log MAR  from the previous visit and the 1184  
patient is wearing a Fresnel  prism , visual acuity should be retested  in trial frames.  1185  
 If visual acuity is found to be reduced by 0.2 logMAR or more ( 2 lines or 10 letters)  1186  
from the previous visit (after removal of Fresnel prism if applicable) , a cycloplegic [ADDRESS_1108870] to the guidelines  in section 5 .3. 1191

In addition, the following will be recorded:  1193  
 Any nonsurgical treatment  of exotropia, esotropia  or symptomatic diplopia (e.g., prism)  1194  
 Any treatment of amblyopia  [interocular visual acuity difference  of more than 0.2 1195  
logMAR (2 lines on ATS HOTV or 10 letters  on E-ETDRS ) and worse eye acuity of 1196  
worse than 0.3 logMAR  (20/40 on ATS HOTV or 70 letters on E -ETDRS ] 1197  
 Any c hange in refractive correction  1198

Treatment  can be prescribed as follows:  1200  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-5 
 
  Nonsurgical treatment of any overcorrection, undercorrection, or deviations associated 1201  
with diplopia is at investigator discretion.   1202  
 If any of the surgical failure criteria are met  (section 4.5.1 ), the investigator may elect to 1203  
reoperate ( section  4.7).  If no ne of the  surgical failure criteria are met, the investigator 1204  
should not reoperate . 1205  
 1206  
All patients should continue in follow up through 3 -years, regardless of whether they undergo 1207  
reoperation.   1208  
 1209  
4.5.1 Surgical Failure Criteria  1210  
Patients will be considered a surgical failure if at any visit occurring 6  months or later any of the 1211  
following failure criteria are present  by [CONTACT_803266] (section 4.5.2) *:  1212  
1. Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e., can be constant or 1213  
intermittent ; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of at least  [ADDRESS_1108871]   1215  
2. Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by [CONTACT_2669] 3  cover/uncover test s—one [ADDRESS_1108872] be before any dissociation ) with a magnitude of at least [ADDRESS_1108873] 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) ( see 1219  
Table 3) from the enrollment measurement , or to nil , confirmed by a retest  1220

*Note that both the initial testing and the retest must be performed by a masked examiner 1224  
(section 4.5.2 ).  If a patient appears to have met one or more of the above surgical failure criteria [ADDRESS_1108874](s) do not confirm that at least one criterion  is met, the patient is not  considered to [ADDRESS_1108875] 10 minutes after the initial ocular 1238  
alignment testing.   1239  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-6 
 
  First, if the surgical failure criterion related to a drop in Preschool Randot stereoacuity at 1240  
near appears to be met  (section 4.5.1 ); the masked examiner will retest Preschool Randot 1241  
stereoacuity at near.  1242  
 Second, if  either of the surgical failure criteri a related to presence of a tropia appear to be 1243  
met ( section 4.5.1 ), the masked examiner will retest cover/uncover testing  and SPCT at 1244  
distance and near (if tropia is of sufficient duration to measure).  [ADDRESS_1108876] be  masked to the patient’ s treatment group , the masked examiner [ADDRESS_1108877] be someone other than the investigator/ surgeon . 1248  
 1249  
4.5.3 Patients Wearing Prism and/or  Deliberate Overminus at 3 -Years   1250  
In addition to the assessments listed in section 4.5, at the 3 -year masked exam only , patients who 1251  
are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate overminus will have Preschool Randot [ADDRESS_1108878] without prism and without overminus should occur after 1254  
all initial stereoacuity testing has been completed (ie. after the Titmus Fly at near) and before the 1255  
control of exodeviation assessment. This testing without prism and overminus is for an 1256  
exploratory analysis only (section 6.3.1) and is not considered in determining whether the patient 1257  
meets surgical failure criteria for the primary analysis.        1258  
 1259  
4.6 Addit ional Visits  1260  
Investigators may schedule additional visits at their own discretion.  If the investigator feels the 1261  
patient has met surgical failure criteria, then he/she  must arrange a masked examiner testing 1262  
(section 4. 5.2) to confirm surgical failure crit eria before performing additional surgery .  If the [ADDRESS_1108879] 6 -month follow -up exam, if the patient meets the surgical failure 1272  
criteria at any foll ow-up exam 6 months or later (see section 4. 5.1).  The exception is patients [ADDRESS_1108880] be recorded and the 1278  
patient will continue to return for all protocol -specified follow -up exams . 1279  
 1280  
4.8 Treatment of Amblyopia  1281  
Treatment of amblyopia is allowed at investigator discretion at any time during follow up if a 1282  
patie nt has an interocular difference of visual acuity more than 0.2 logMAR (2 lines on ATS 1283  
HOTV or 10  letters  on E-ETDRS ) with a worse eye visual acuity of worse than  0.3 logMAR 1284  
(20/40 on HOTV or  70 letters  on E-ETDRS) .  The method of treatment is at investigator 1285  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    4-2 
 
 discretion but cannot include atropi[INVESTIGATOR_803243] .  Any a mblyopia treatment 1286  
will be recorded.  1287

 CHAPTER 5:  MISCELLANEOUS CONSID ERATIONS IN FOLLOW -UP [ADDRESS_1108881] 2 times per 1291  
year.  Permission for such contacts will be included in the Informed Consent Form.  The 1292  
principal purpose of the contacts will be to develop and maintain rapport with the patient and/or 1293  
family and to help coordinate scheduling of the outcome examination s.  Additional contacts will 1294  
be made if necessary for the scheduling of follow -up visits.  1295  
 1296  
5.2 Patient Withdrawals  1297  
A patient (and respective parent)  may withdraw from the study at any time.  This is expected to 1298  
be a very infrequent occurrence in view of the study design’s similarity to routine clinical [ADDRESS_1108882] is in transferring their care to another eye care provider, every effort should be made to 1302  
comply with this and at the same time try to keep the patient in the s tudy under the new 1303  
provider’s care.  1304  
 1305  
5.3 Management of Refractive Error  1306  
A cycloplegic refraction should be performed every 12 months.  In addition, a refraction should 1307  
be performed whenever the investigator suspects that refractive error may not be optimally 1308  
corrected.  1309  
 1310  
For patients whose refractive error meets criteria for requiring a refractive correction ( section  1311  
5.3.1), the correction prescribed should meet the refractive  correction guidelines ( section 5 .3.2).  1312  
 1313  
For patients whose refractive error does not  meet the criteria for a required correction ( section 1314  
5.3.1), it is at investigator discretion whether to prescribe correction ; however, if refractive 1315  
correction is prescribed, it should meet the refractive correction guidelines (section 5 .3.2). 1316  
 1317  
5.3.1 Refractiv e Error Requiring Correction   1318  
The following are the criteria for requiring refractive error correction:  1319  
 Myopia > -0.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  1320  
 Hyperopia > + 3.50 D spherical equivalent in either eye  1321  
 Anisometropia > 1.00 D spherical equivalent  1322  
 Astigmatism in either eye > 2.00 D if ≤ 5 years old and > 1.50 D if > 5 years old  1323  
 1324  
5.3.2 Refractive Correction Guidelines  1325  
The following are the guidelines for refractive correction which apply to patients meeting criteria 1326  
for requiring refractive error correctio n (section 5. 3.1) and to any other patient wearing refractive 1327  
correction.   1328  
 Anisometropia spherical equivalent must be within 0.[ADDRESS_1108883] ion.  1329  
 Astigmatism cylinder must be within 0.[ADDRESS_1108884] be within 5 1330  
degrees of full correction .   1331  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    5-2 
 
  The spherical component can be reduced by [CONTACT_803267] 1332  
symmetrical and results in residual (i.e., uncorrected) spherical equivalent refractive error 1333  
that does not exceed  +3.50D hyperopia o r -0.50 D myopia.  1334  
 1335  
The study will not pay for spectacles required at enrollment, but will pay for lens changes and/or 1336  
new spectacles which are needed during follow up to keep the correction within the study 1337  
guidelines (section 5.3).   All other new spectacles and/or lens changes will not be paid for by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1108885] care.  The risks of surgery  in this study are no different than 1349  
surgery performed outside of the study.  1350  
 1351  
There is a very rare risk of death  (less than 1 in 100,000) , there is a very rare risk of loss of 1352  
vision, and there is a risk of overcorrection or undercorrection which could  require subsequent 1353  
surgeries.  1354  
 1355  
5.4.3 Risk Assessment  1356  
It is the investigators’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_225786]’s level of risk falls under DHHS 46.404 which is 1357  
research not involving greater than minimal risk.   1358  
 1359  
5.5 Reporting of Adverse Events  1360  
Each site is responsible for informing its IRB of serious treatment -related adverse events and for 1361  
abiding by [CONTACT_803268].  Data on the 1362  
complications of the study treatments will be tabulated regularly by [CONTACT_803269] 1363  
review by [CONTACT_40972].  Serious complications will be reported expeditiously to the 1364  
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, which will receive a full adverse event report semi - 1365  
annually.  Following each DSMC data review, a summary will be provided to IRBs.  1366  
 1367  
5.6 Discontinuation of Study  1368  
The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_40972] (with approval of the Data and Safety 1369  
Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of enrollment and follow -up for all 1370  
patients . 1371  
 1372  
5.7 Travel Reimbursement  1373  
The parent /guardian  of each patient will be compensated $30 per visit for completion of each 1374  
protocol -specified follow -up visit, for a maximum of $[ADDRESS_1108886] or his/her insurance will be responsible for the costs that are considered standard 1380  
care.  This includes the initial examination, all fol low up visits, all surgical procedures, and all 1381  
costs involved in managing surgical complications.  1382  
  1383  
The study will not pay for spectacles required at enrollment, but will pay for lens changes and/or 1384  
new spectacles which are needed during follow up to keep  the correction within the study 1385  
guideline s (section 5.3).   All other new spectacles and/or  lens changes will not be paid for by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1108887] lenses.  1387  
 1388  
The study will provide  temporary press -on prisms and spectacles to mount the prism (if needed 1389  
and the patient isn’t wearing glasses).  1390

 CHAPTER 6:  SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATI ON AND STATISTICAL A NALYSIS  [ADDRESS_1108888] at 1399  
distance , near, or remote distance  at the enrollment exam is between 15 and 40 PD inclusive.  1400  
 1401  
The primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the proportion of patients with 1402  
surgical failure by 3 years  (section 6.1.1.) .The primary analysis is stratified by [CONTACT_803254] (basic 1403  
type and pseudo divergence excess type).  [ADDRESS_1108889] visit at which surgical failure criteria are met.  1410  
The primary analysis will follow the intent -to-treat principle.   1411  
 1412  
6.1.1 Classification of Outcome  1413  
At the 3 -year visit, each patient’s c ondition will be classified as either surgical failure, success, 1414  
or indeterminate as follows:  1415  
 1416  
Failure  = ANY of the following criteria are met at a visit 6 months or later:   1417  
1. Exotropia at distance OR near at any time during the exam (i.e. , can be constant or 1418  
intermittent; determined by a cover/uncover test) with a magnitude of at least  [ADDRESS_1108890]   1420  
2. Constant esotropia at distance OR near (determined by [CONTACT_2669] 3 cover/uncover tests — [ADDRESS_1108891] be before any dissociation) with a magnit ude of at least [ADDRESS_1108892] 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) 1424  
(see Table 3) from the enrollment measurement, or to nil, confirmed by a retest  1425  
4. Reoperation or treatment with b otulinum toxin  1426  
 1427  
Success  = ALL of the following criteria are met at the 3 -year visit:  1428  
1. Exodeviation less than 10 PD (tropia or phoria) by [CONTACT_803270] [ADDRESS_1108893]  1431  
3. No decrease in Preschool Randot stereoacuity of 2 or more octaves from the enrollment 1432  
stereoacuity and no drop to nil  1433  
4. No reoperation or treatment with botulinum toxin  1434  
5. No non -surgical treatment for IXT during  the study  1435  
 1436  
Indeterminate  = ALL of the following criteria are met at the 3 -year visit:  1437  
1. Patient meets one or more of the following:  1438  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-2 
 
  Exophoria >=10PD by [CONTACT_803271]   1439  
 Exodeviation less than 10PD by [CONTACT_803272] [ADDRESS_1108894] of distance and near angles at enrollment  1441  
 Intermittent esotropia or esophoria >=6PD at distance and/or near  [ADDRESS_1108895] are baseline monofixation status as determined using Titmus 1457  
stereoacuity data, baseline monofixation status  determined as using Preschool Randot 1458  
stereoacuity data, and age.  Other baseline factors which will be assessed in exploratory 1459  
subgroup analysis are prior treatment, near stereoacuity, distance stereoacuity, control of IXT, 1460  
whether a constant exotropia wa s present at distance , and quality of life .  In accordance with NIH 1461  
guidelines, a subgroup analysis of treatment efficacy according to gender, as well as 1462  
race/ethnicity, will also be conducted.   [ADDRESS_1108896] will be formally 1467  
assessed by [CONTACT_803273] a Cox proportional hazards model that includes  the 1468  
factor .  In general, power will be low for formally detecting interactions unless the interaction is 1469  
very large.  1470  
 1471  
6.2.2 Surgic al Failu re Proportion at 3 Year Timepoint   1472  
The binomial propor tion of patients who m eet surgical failure criteria at the 3 year visit  (as 1473  
opposed to by [CONTACT_941] 3 year visit) will be estimated for each treatment group and  compared using 1474  
Fisher’s exact test.   [ADDRESS_1108897] been re -operated (or treated with botulinum 1480  
toxin), in which case they will be classified as a surgical failure.  1481  
 1482  
The potential for bias in the  treatment group co mparison is recognized .  Once a patient has met  1483  
the clinical criteria for surgical failure criteria at an interim follow up visit, the decision to 1484  
reoperate —and thus permanently classify the patient as a surgical failure for the analysis  at 3 1485  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-3 
 
 years —is at the discret ion of an unmasked investigator and therefore could be related to [ADDRESS_1108898] in assessing f or potential bias, the extent to which treatment group is 1487  
related to the decision to reoperate will be evaluated .   1488  
 1489  
6.2.3 Success Proportion at 3 Year Timepoint  1490  
The estimated proportion of patients who meet criteria for ‘success’ at the 3 -year outcome exam 1491  
(section 6.1.1) will be calculated  and compared between treatment groups  using a Fisher’s exact [ADDRESS_1108899].  A 95% confidence interval on the diffe rence of proportions between the two groups also 1493  
will be calculated.   1494  
 1495  
The potential for bias in th is treatment group comparison is recognized.  Once a patient has met 1496  
the clinical criteria for surgical failure criteria at an interim follow up v isit, the decision to 1497  
reoperate —and thus prevent the patient from being classified as a success for the 3 year 1498  
analysis —is at the discretion of an unmasked investigator and therefore could be related to [ADDRESS_1108900]  for secondary outcomes : near stereoacuity, distance stereoacuity, monofixation status as 1505  
determined using Titmus stereoacuity data, monofixation status determined as using Preschool 1506  
Randot stereoacuity data, development of amb lyopia, and qu ality of life.  1507  
 1508  
6.3 Exploratory Analyses  1509  
6.3.1              Exploratory Analyses in Primary Cohort  1510  
Exploratory analyses will be stratified by [CONTACT_803274] (i.e.  [ADDRESS_1108901] at enrollment is between 15 and 40 PD inclusive) .   1512  
 1513  
As exploratory analyses, t he primary analysis comparing failure proportions by 3 years (section 1514  
6.1), the comparison of failure proportions at 3 years (6.2.2) the comparison of success 1515  
proportions at 3 years (6.2.3) will be repeated using the same outcome classification of surgical 1516  
failure, success, or indeterminate  as described section 6.1.1., with the following exception : 1517  
 At the 3 -year visit, f or patients who are currently prescribed prism and/or deliberate 1518  
overminus : the Preschool Randot at near score to be used for the outcome classification will [ADDRESS_1108902] 2 octaves ( at least 0.6 log arcsec) from the enrollment measurement, or to n il, to [ADDRESS_1108903]  is not  1522  
needed  to be considered a surgical failure  for this analysis .   1523  
 1524  
 1525  
6.3.2 Exploratory Analyses in Patients with Baseline Angle > [ADDRESS_1108904] at enrollment is > 40 to 50 PD .   1528  
 1529  
The proportion of pa tients with surgical failure by 3 years will be calculated and will be 1530  
compared between treatmen t groups  using  the same method as for the primary analysis . 1531  
 1532  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-4 
 
 6.4 Safety Analyses  1533  
Postoperative complications will be tabulated according to treatment group.   1534  
 1535  
6.5 Additional Tabulations and Analyses  1536  
The following will be tabulated according to treatment g roup:  [ADDRESS_1108905]  and because t he treatment groups are 1548  
expected to differ in the timing of surgical failure  and in the criteria met for surgical failure .  1549  
Patients receiving unilateral lateral rectus re cession with medial rectus resection  (R&R) are 1550  
expected to fail earlier, due primarily to consecutive esotropia  (i.e., overcorrection)  which cannot 1551  
be managed with prism , whereas patients receiving bilateral lateral rectus recessions (BLR rec) [ADDRESS_1108906] R&R.   1555  
 1556  
An interim analysis of partial 3 -year data is not planned because by [CONTACT_29623] 50% of the cohort [ADDRESS_1108907] specific differences  1564  
in the proportion of patients meeting surgical failure criteria by  3 years (section 6.1.1 ) with 1565

 1570  
 
IXT1 Protocol v5.0 21Jun17    6-5 
 
 Based upon estimates in the literature  for basic type IXT , the difference in failure proportion 1571  
between bilateral lateral recessions (BLR rec) and unilateral lateral rectus recessions with medial 1572  
rectus resections  (R&R) for the treatment of IXT ranges from as little as 4% (failure rates of 44% 1573  
vs. 40% respectively )13 to as much as 3 0% ( failure rates of 48% vs. 18%  respectively).[ADDRESS_1108908] 25% , assuming a failure rate of 25% in the BLR rec group 1576  
and 50% in the R&R group , respectively) .  In the absence of literature comparing surgical 1577  
outcomes in  patients  with pseudo divergence excess  type IXT, the analysis for these patients will 1578  
be powered similarly to the analysis for basic type IXT patients.   1579  
 1580  
Given estimated failure proportions of 50 % with BLRrec  and 25 % with R&R , and accounting 1581  
for 10% loss to follow -up prior to repeat oper ation, 378 patients will need to be enrolled in the 1582  
primary cohort  (189 with basic type IXT and 189 with pseudo divergence excess type IXT),  half [ADDRESS_1108909] at enrollment is > 40 to 50 PD  1586  
(38 with basic type IXT and 38 with pseudo divergence excess type IXT)  are expected to be [ADDRESS_1108910] signed an informed consent form can be randomized up until the end date, 1594  
which means the expected recruitment might be exceeded .  The maximum number of 1595  
randomized  subjects will be 474.  1596

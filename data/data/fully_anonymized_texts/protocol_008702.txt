1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.  
 1.1 Disease
 Background    
 Fibrillary glomerulonephritis (FGN) is generally recognized as an uncommon and untreatable form of nephritis. The largest series of 66 cases comes from the Mayo Clinic.  During an average of 52.3 months of follow-up for 61 patients with available data, 13% had complete or partial remission, 43% had persistent renal dysfunction, and 44% progressed to ESRD, despi[INVESTIGATOR_12847] a variety of immunosuppressive agents. 
[ADDRESS_808274].   In the majority of cases, the disease is considered idiopathic, although it has also been seen in association w ith B cell lymphomas, hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia and lupus. B 
cells mediate immune responses, and depletion of the CD 19 – 20 subtypes has proven effective in treating other glomerulopathies of various etiologies, especially membranous nephropathy, ANCA associated vasculitis and lupus nephritis. This together with anecdotal case reports and small series
1,2,6,8  and observation that 
glomerular deposits in fibrillary GN are IgG4 dominant13 (similar to membranous 
nephropathy) sugg est that FGN is immune mediated and is the rationale for using an 
agent such as Rituximab that is capable of depleting CD 20+ B cells and preventing the production of nephrotoxic immune globulins that initiate or mediate the disease.   
1.2 Rituximab Background 
 
Rituximab is a genetically engineered, chimeric, murine/human monoclonal antibody 
directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant pre- B 
and mature B cells.  The antibody is an IgG
1 κ immunoglobulin containing murine light -
and heavy- chain variable region sequences and human constant region s equences.  
Rituximab is composed of two heavy chains of 451 amino acids and two light chains of 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  5 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      213 amino acids (based on cDNA analy sis) and has an approximate molecular mass of 
145 kD.  Rituximab has a binding affinity for the CD20 antigen of ~8.0 nM. 
 
1.2.1 Safety Profile  
 
No dose- limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies.  Reported adverse events 
including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, asthenia, and hypotension, occurred p rimarily during  rituximab infusions and typi[INVESTIGATOR_609659] a slower rate.    
Fatal Infusion Reactions:   Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including 
angioedema, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], 
myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, have been reported.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_27803] 30-120 minutes.    
Cardiac Events:   Patients with preexisting car diac conditions, including arrhythmia and 
angina, have had recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions. 
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome:  Tumor lysis syndrome, some with fatal outcome,  has been 
reported and is characterized in patients with a hig h number of circulating malignant cells 
(≥25,000 ul) by [CONTACT_334230], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, 
hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  
Renal Events:   Rituximab has been associated with severe renal toxicity including acute 
renal failure requiring dialysis , and in some cases has led to death.  Renal toxicity has 
occurred in patients with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (≥25,000/mm
2 ) or 
high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis syndrome and in patients administered 
concomitant cisplatin.  
  
Mucocutaneous Reactions:   Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_609660], have been reported in patients 
treated with rituximab.  The onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following 
rituximab exposure.  
Hematologic Events:   In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% 
of patients treated with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), 
leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Rituximab therapy were reported.   In addition, there have been a limited number of postmarketing reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia.   
Infectious Events:   Rituxan induced B-cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients with 
NHL and was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  6 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 days (range, 1-588 days).  Infectious 
events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections.  Serious infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.  
Hepatitis B Reactivation:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in some cases resulting 
in fulmin ant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death , can occur in patients treated with drugs 
classified as CD20 -directed cytolytic antibodies, including Rituxan.  Cases have been 
reported in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and also in patients who are HBsAg negative but are hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive.  Reactivation also has occurred in patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection (i.e., HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive and hepatitis B surface antibody [ anti-
HBs] positive).     
Other Serious Viral Infections:   The following additional serious viral infections, either 
new, reactivated or exacerbated, have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing 
reports. The majority of patients received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. These viral infections included JC virus (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of Rituxan and have resulted in death.  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
PML is a rare disease caused by [CONTACT_223917].  
Immunosuppression allows reactivation of the JC virus which causes demyelination and destruction of oligodendrocytes resulting in death or severe disability.  Rare cases of PML, some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies who have received rituximab.   The majority of these patients had received 
rituximab in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Cases of PML resulting in death have al so been reported following the use of 
rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases . The reported cases had multiple risk 
factors for PML, including the underlying disease and long-term immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy.  Most cases of PML wer e diagnosed within [ADDRESS_808275], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be considered as clinically indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab should be discontinued and reductions or discontinuation of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered.  
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) / Reversible Posterior 
Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)  
Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)/reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have been reported.  Signs and symptoms include 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  7 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      visual disturbance, headache, seizures and altered mental status, with or without 
associated hypertension.    
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation:   Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and 
perforation, in some cases leading to death, were observed in patients receiving Rituxan 
in combination with chemotherapy for DLBCL. In post- marketing  reports, which include 
both patients with low -grade or follicular NHL  and DLBCL, the mean time to onset of 
symptoms was 6 days (range 1−77)  in patients with documented gastro -intestinal 
perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment,  
should prompt a thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.  
Immunogenicity:  Patients may develop a human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) 
response with rituximab treatment.   The cl inical significance of this is  unclear . 
 
Pregnancy:   B-cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in 
infants exposed to rituximab in utero. 
 
Immunization :  Response rates may be reduced  with non- live vaccines.  
 Additional Safety Signals:   The following serious adverse events have been reported to 
occur in pa tients following completion of r ituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of 
blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus-like syndrome), eye disorders (uveitis 
and optic neuritis) , lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the lung 
(bronchiolitis obliterans), that may result in fatal outcomes , and fatal cardiac failure.  
 
See the rituximab Investigator Brochure for additional details regarding safety experience 
with rituximab.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_808276] for kidney injury of multiple etiologies, the immunofluorescent studies are clear that the fibrillary process is mediated by [CONTACT_609667]. Biopsies typi[INVESTIGATOR_609661] C3 and IgG (especially the IgG4 and IgG1 subclasses). A minority of the patients also have monoclonal proteins in circulation and in the biopsy. B cells mediate immune responses, and destruction of the CD 19 – 20 subtypes has proven effective in treating other glomerulopathies of various etiologies, especially membranous glomerulopathy and lupus nephritis. This together with anecdotal case reports and small series suggests rituximab has a rational role in the treatment of fibrillary GN.  
 Thus it appears that FGN is immune mediated. This is the rationale for using an agent such as Rituximab that is capable of depleting CD 20+ B cells and preventing the production of nephrotoxic immune globulins that initiate or mediate the disease.

Rituximab - FINAL  11 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      3.2 Rationale for the Study Design 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. There is not enough treatment data to justify a head- to-head trial or 
even a placebo controlled trial yet. The number of patients required for more extensive 
studies will require a multi- centered trial, but that is premature until there is better 
evidence for effectiveness of rituximab treatment.  
 
3.3 OUTCOME MEASURES  
 
3.3.1 Primary Outcome Measures

4.2  Exclusion Criteria  
 
Patients will be excluded from the study based on the follow ing concerns : 
 
General Medical Concerns:  
• Pregnancy (a negative serum pregnancy test should be performed for all women of 
childbearing potential within 7 days of treatment) , or lactating . 
• Known history of diabetes mellitus or a Hemoglobin A1c result > 6.0% within 90 
days prior to enrollment. 
• Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.   
 
Rituximab- Specific Concerns:  
 
• History of HIV  (as documented as a positive lab value within one year of enrollment) 
• Presence of active infection  
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  13 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      • [LOCATION_001] Hear t Association Classification III or IV heart disease  (See Appendix D)  
• Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies within the last five years, with 
the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin or carcinoma in situ of the cervix  
• History of psychiatric disorder  
• At the Investigator’s discretion, receipt of a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to randomization 
• Positive hepatitis B or C serology is considered a potential exclusion criterion.  Hepatitis B screening should include hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and core antibody (anti-HBc) in all patients.  For patients who show evidence of prior hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive), consult with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B 
regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral therapy before and/or during Rituxan treatment.  For inclusion into the study, the patient must have a 
negative HBsAg and anti -HBc lab value within  2 year s of signing consent. 
 
4.3 Immunization d uring B -Cell Depletion  
 Efficacy and/or safety of immunization during periods of B-cell depletion have not been adequately studied.  It is recommended that a patient’s vaccination record and possible requirements be reviewed. Per the investigator’s discretion, the patient may have any required vaccination/booster administered at least 4  weeks prior to the initiation of study 
treatment.  Review of the patient’s immunization status for the following vaccinations is recommended:  tetanus; diptheria; influenza; pneumoccocal polysaccharide; Varicella ; 
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR); and hepatitis B.  Patients who are considered to be at high risk for hepatitis  B virus (HBV) infection and for whom the investigator has 
determined that immunization is indicated should complete the entire HBV vaccine series 
at least [ADDRESS_808281] infusion, irrespective of CD 20+ cell counts.  Thus each pa tient will 
receive 4 infusions of rituximab.  Given the risk of P neumocystis  pneumonia for rituximab -treated patients and the 
associated significant mortality ,
14 study patients will be  started on double strength 
Bactrim  three times a week (or its equivalen t) for P neumocystis  pneumonia prophylaxis. 
This treatment will continue until the end of the study (12 months) and the B cells (CD19/20+) have been repleted (>15 cells/microliter on peripheral blood flow cytometry).  B cells (CD19/20+) are expected to be r eplete by [CONTACT_43380] 12.  In the rare 
event that B cells (CD19/20+) are not replete by [CONTACT_43380] 12, flow cytometry should be 
repeated at Month 18 (see table 2b) and prophylaxis continued to that point of repletion. 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  14 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/[ADDRESS_808282] to r eceive up to “4” infusions of 
rituximab.  Even if the treatment is shown to be of benefit, additional infusions of rituximab beyond that allowed in the protocol cannot be given to the subject while she/he is participating in this study.  
 Patients who flare will receive no additional treatment, because there is no known alternative. However, this should not be a concern because fibrillary glomerulonephritis is not a disease subject to flares, unlike ANCA associated vasculitis.   Patients who drop out of the study will be encouraged to return for their usual nephrology follow-up visits.   After study completion, patients will receive ongoing care from their usual nephrologist indefinitely.  
 
6.0 STUDY MEDICATION  
 6.1 Rituximab 
 
Rituximab is a highly purif ied, 1328-amino acid antibody with an approximate molecular 
mass of 145 kD.  The chimeric mouse/human anti-CD20 antibody is a glycosylated IgG
1 
κ immunoglobulin containing murine light and heavy chain variable regions and human 
γ1 heavy chain and κ  light c hain constant regions. 
 Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative -free liquid concentrate for 
intravenous (IV) administration. Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single-use vials. The product is formulated for intravenous administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and s terile w ater for i njection . The pH is adjusted 
to 6.5.  “Rituximab will be provided f ree of charge by [CONTACT_609671]. The 
Sponsor/Investigator of the study will ensure maintenance of complete and accurate records of the receipt, dispensation, and disposal or return of all study drug in accordance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.), Part 312.57 and 312.62 and Genentech requirements.” 
 
6.1.1 Rituximab Dosage and Administration  
 The dosage of rituximab to be used is 1000 mg given as an IV infusion once every 2 
weeks for two doses.  Rituximab may be  administered in an outpatient setting  and will be 
repeated in 6 months.   DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  Do not infuse rituximab concomitantly with another IV solution or other IV medications. 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  15 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016       
Preparation for Administration:  Use appropriate aseptic technique. Withdraw the 
necessary amou nt of rituximab and dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL into an 
infusion bag containing either 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP or 5% Dextrose in Water USP. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard any unused portion left in the vial.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration.   Administration: DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS. Infusion and hypersensitivity reactions may occur.  Premedication, consisting of methylprednisolone, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine, should be considered before each infusion of rituximab.  Premedication may attenuate infusion- related events. Since 
transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to rituximab infusion.  For women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) a serum pregnancy test will be required at the screening visit.  For each WOCBP a urine pregnancy test will be required prior to each infusion.  See Appendix E for more information.  
Administration Guidelines for Adult Patient Population 
 
First Infusion of both courses (Day 1 and Day 181) : The r ituximab solution for infusion 
should be administered intravenously at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr. Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs. If hypersensitivity or infusion-related events do not occur, escalate the infusion rate in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr.    Rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions.  In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100mg/hr to 50mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved.  Most patients who have experienced non- life-
threatening infusion- related reactions have been able to complete the full course of 
rituximab therapy  
Subsequent Infusions (Day 15 and Day 195) : If the subject tolerated the first infusion 
well, s ubsequent r ituximab infusions can be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr, 
and increased by 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr as tolerated.   If the first infusion was not well tolerated, the guidelines for the first 
infusion should be followed for the subsequent infusions. Subjects will remain in the Clinical Research Unit for a one hour observation period following each infusion.   
6.1.2 Rituximab Storage 
 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  16 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      Rituximab vials are stable at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).  Do not use beyond expi[INVESTIGATOR_334166]. Rituximab vials should be protected from direct sunlight.  
Rituximab solutions for infusion are stable at 2° to 8°C (36 ° to 46°F) for 24 hours and at 
room temperature for an additional 24 hours. However, since rituximab solutions do not contain a preservative, diluted solutions should be stored refrigerated (2° to 8°C ).  No 
incompatibilities between r ituximab and polyvinylchloride or polyethylene bags have 
been observed. 
 
   6.1.3 Rituximab Overdosage 
 There has been no experience with over dosage of r ituximab in human clinical trials. 
Single doses higher than 500 mg/m
[ADDRESS_808283] not been tested in controlled studies. 
 
7.0  DOSE MODIFICATION/TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
 
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study.  These measures will be addressed through exclusion criteria (see Section 4.2) and routine monitoring as follows.    Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and during their participation in this study.  Safet y evaluations will consist of 
medical interviews, recording of adverse events, physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory measurements.  Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their participation in the study.    Subjects will remain in the Clinical Research Unit for a one hour observation period following each infusion.   
7.1 Rituximab 
 
The dose of r ituximab will remain cons tant throughout the trial. Rituximab infusion 
should be interrupted for severe reactions, e.g., rapid tumor lysis.  Treatment of infusion-
related symptoms with diphenhydramine and acetaminophen is recommended.  Additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines, and corticosteroids should be available for immediate use in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction to rituximab (e.g., anaphylaxis).  In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100mg/hr to 50mg/hr) when symptoms and laboratory abnormalities have completely resolved.    Infusions should be discontinued in the event of serious or life- threatening cardiac 
arrhythmias.  Subjects who develop clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring during and after subsequent infusions.

  11.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  19 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/[ADDRESS_808288] of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to {study drug}, all events of death, and any study specific issue of concern.  
11.[ADDRESS_808289] (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution.  This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with fibrillary glomerulonephritis that were not present prior to the AE reporting period. 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).  
 If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other protocol-mandated intervention.  Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_95048]-specified AE reporting period.  
Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if the following criteria are met: 
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life  threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject 
at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.). 
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the IMP. 
• It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  20 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      Methods and Timing f or Assessing AND Recording Safety variables  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or 
reported during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, Inc. in accordance with  CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed 
consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment or initiation of any study procedures and ends [ADDRESS_808290] administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.  
 
Assessment of Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_13661], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to rituximab  (see following guidance), and actions taken. 
 To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the following general guideline: 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of rituximab , and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to rituximab; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of rituximab  or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- challenge.  
Evidence exists that the AE has an etio logy other than rituxim ab (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to rituximab  administration (e.g., 
cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_808291] dose of study drug).  Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.   Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
 
Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation time points should be 
adopted. Examples of non- directiv e questions include:  
• “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”  
• “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?”  
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  21 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/[ADDRESS_808292] medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or 
SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual 
signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the information t hat is currently available. If a 
diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 
5.1.2), regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such 
conditions should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).  
 
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609663]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15428], record the heart condition that necessitated the by[CONTACT_13664].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15429]: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167726] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_168174] 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15432]. 
 
e. Pregnancy  
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_808293] dose of study drug, a report should be completed and expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy 
Genentech, Inc.  
Rituximab - FINAL  22 Version 3. 6, DATE 3/7/2016      should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should 
always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to rituximab should be repor ted as an SAE.  
 
f. Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has 
completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to prior rituximab  exposure. If 
the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this should be reported as an SAE.   
g. Reconciliation  
The Sponsor agrees to conduct reconciliation for the product. Genentech and the Sponsor 
will agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange monthly line listings of cases received by [CONTACT_15481]. If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case-by- case basis until satisfactory 
resolution. 
 
h.      AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
AEs of Special Interest are defined as a potential safety probl em, identified as a result of 
safety monitoring of the Product   
  
11.[ADDRESS_808294] report all SAEs to Genentech within the timelines described below.

When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriate action necessary to protect the study participants and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The sponsor- investigator  will evaluate the event and determine the 
necessary follow up and reporting required. The sponsor-investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258]-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_191291].  
MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines 
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication 
information, the report should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A form: 
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned) 
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome if known 
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investigational product and suspect medication 
 
Follow-up Information 
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_51756]: 
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow-up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up with 
the original MedWatch 3500A form  
• Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including patient identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, patient number), protocol description and number, if assigned, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or follow-up information is being submitted (The patient identifiers are important so that the new information is added to the correct initial report) 
Occasionally Genentech may contact [CONTACT_15483], clarification, or current status of the patient for whom and adverse event was reported. For questions regarding SAE reporting, you may contact [CONTACT_38312]. Relevant follow-up information should be submitted to Genentech Drug Safety as soon as it becomes available and/o r upon request.

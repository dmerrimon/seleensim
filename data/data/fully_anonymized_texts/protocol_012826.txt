Page 6PROTOCOL SUMMARY
Indication :
Tofacitinib, also known as tofacitinib citrate or CP-690,550, is being developed for the 
treatment of patients with moderatel y to severel y active ulcerative colitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therap y.
Background and Rationale :
Tofacitinib is a potent, sele ctive inhibitor of the JAK famil y of kinases with a high degree of 
selectivity  against other kinases in the human genome.   In kinase assay s, tofacitinib inhibits 
JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent Ty K2.  In cellular settings where JAK kinases 
signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentiall y inhibits signaling b y heterodimers containing JAK3 
and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity  over JAK2 homodimer signaling.   Inhibition of 
JAK1 and JAK3 by  [CONTACT_685190], including IL -2, -4,-7,-9, - 15 and -21.  These 
cytokines are integral to ly mphocy te activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of 
their signaling may  thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the im mune response.   In 
addition, inhibition of JAK1 will result in attenuation of signaling b y additional 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines, such as IL -6 and IFN .  At higher exposures, inhibition of 
erythropoietin, prolactin and other hormones could occur via inhibi tion of JAK2 homodimer 
signaling.
The broad effects of JAK1/[ADDRESS_928534] s provides the rationale 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_685163] l ymphocy te 
activation/proliferation plays a pathogenic role.   Tofacitinib is being studied as an oral 
treatment for ulcerative colitis ( UC), Crohn’s disease, as a disease -modify ing anti- rheumatic 
drug (DMARD) for the treatment of RA, as treatment for plaque psoriasis and for the 
prevention of renal allograft reject ion.
Objectives and Endpoints:
Primary Objective
To assess the safet y and tolerability of long -term tofacitinib therap y in subjects with 
UC.
Secondary Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy  of long -term tofacitinib therap y in subjects with UC .
To evaluate theeffect of long -term tofacitinib therapy  on quality -of-life in subjects 
with UC.
Primary Efficacy Endpoint
As this is an open- label extension study , there will b e no primary  efficacy  endpoint.

Page 8Study Design :
This is a Phase 3, multi -center, open -label study  in subjects who have completed or 
demonstrate d treatment failure in the maintenance study  A3921096, or who were 
non-responders after completing induction studies A3921094 or A3921095.  Approximately  
900subjects are expected to become eligible for the study .  This study  will continue up to 
approximat ely July [ADDRESS_928535] for this 
study  will be assessed based on study  data collected at Week 8/9 of Study  A3921094 or 
A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/ 53 visit (for completers) or e arly termination 
visit (early withdrawals due to treatment failure) of Study  A3921096.  The study  data 
collected at the Week 8/9visit for Study  A3921094 or A3921095 (for non -responders) or the 
Week 52/53visit or early termination visit of Study A3921096 will be recorded as the 
baseline data for Study  A3921139.
Eligible subjects will be assigned to either tofacitinib 5mg twice a day  (BID) or [ADDRESS_928536] is in remission at baseline of Stud y A3921139.  Remission
is defined b y a total Mayo score 2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding 
subscore of [ADDRESS_928537] 3 points from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  
[CONTACT_685191] b y at least [ADDRESS_928538] 1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2) after a minimum 
of 8weeks of treatment in the maintenance study .  In the scenario where the endoscopic 
subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is alr eady  a ‘3’ 
(maximum value) ,then an increase b y at least [ADDRESS_928539] s who complete induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 and are 
classified as non- responders are also eligible to receive tofacitinib 10mgBID.

Page 9Tofacitinib dose can be adjusted from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID for efficacy and from 
10mgBID to 5 mgBID after meeting specific laboratory  abnormalities or other protocol 
defined criteria regarding efficacy  (seeSection 5.8for dose adjustment guidelines).  Dose 
adjustments c an only  occur after a subject has received at least [ADDRESS_928540] the opportunity  to enter Study A3921288 (A Phase 3b/4, Multi -Center, 
Double- Blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Study  of Tofacitinib in Subjects with UC in 
Stable Remission) if they meet the eligibility  criteria. Study A3921288 will evaluate the 
efficacy  and sa fety of tofacitinib in subjects in stable remission on 10 mgBID who decrease 
the dose to and remain on 5 mgBID compared to subjects who remain on 10 mgBID. 
Subjects from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 (i e,non-responders) who fail to 
demons trate clinical response at Month 2 of this study  will be withdrawn from the study .  
Clinical response is defined by a decrease from the induction study  baseline (A3921094 or 
A3921095) May o score of at least [ADDRESS_928541] 30%, with an accompany ing d ecrease 
in the rectal bleeding subscore of at least [ADDRESS_928542] dose of study  medication .
Subjects will be required to remain on stable doses of their concomitant medications fo r UC
during the stud y period , with the exception of oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine and oral 
corticosteroids described inSection 5.5.  Subjects who enter this study  on corticosteroids 
(eg,subjec ts who withdraw from Study  A3921096 due to treatment failure or non -responders 
at the end of Study  A3921094 or A3921095 ) will need to continue the steroid tapering 
regimen described in Study  A3921096 (see Section 5.5).  If a subject requires rescue therap y 
(see Section 5.7) or undergoes surgery for UC , the subject should be withdrawn from the 
study  and appropriate agents should be given at the discretion of the investigator.   If a subject 
discontinues the use of background oral 5-ASA or sulfasalazine during the study  and/orhas 
the therap y re-initiated, this will not constitute rescue therapy , and the subject will be 
permitted to re main in the study .  
Study Treatments :
Subjects will be assigned to one of two dose groups depending on their remission status at 
baseline of Study  A3921139:
Tofacitinib 5mg BID (subjects in remission) .
Tofacitinib 10 mg BID (all other subjects).

Page 251.INTRODUCTIO N
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory  disease of the colon 
characterized b y alternating epi[INVESTIGATOR_685166].  The prevalence 
has been estimated to range from [ADDRESS_928561] commonly  diagnosed in late 
adolescence and early adulthood, with the peak incidence occurring between 20 -39years of 
age.2  
Although the precise pathogenesis of UC is presently  unknown, the prevailing paradigm is 
dysregulation of the enteric immune response in geneticall y susceptible individuals .3Such 
defective immune s ystem leads to upregulation of macrophages and Th2 lymphocytes in UC, 
as a result of inabilit y to appropriatel y downregulate both innate and adaptive immune
response sto endogenous luminal antigens.  This produces an excess of cy tokines, 
interleukins and chemokines, all of which can lead to enhanced inflammation and tissue 
damage.  Evidence has shown that upregulation of some of the common gamma -chain 
cytokines may  play  a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory  bowel disease (IBD), of whi ch 
the two main forms are UC and Crohn’s disease. 
The hallmark clinical presentations for UC include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, passage of 
mucus, tenesmus, urgency, and abdominal pain . Patients may  also experience fatigue, fevers, 
weight loss, and deh ydration, particularl y in more severe cases. Mortality  is not increased in 
UC in general, but the disease may  present as life -threatening fulminant colitis.  Most 
patients follow a chronic intermittent course with periods of increased disease activit y 
separa ted by  [CONTACT_685195]. After the initial diagnosis, approximately  half of 
patients will have active disease at an y single point in time and approximately 90% will have 
a disease course characterized by  [CONTACT_685196].[ADDRESS_928562] universally  involves the rectum, extending proximally  to involve a 
portion of or the entire colon.  At the time of initial presentation, approximately  45% of 
patients have disease limited to the rectum and si gmoid (proctosigmoiditis), approximately  
35% have disease extending bey ond the sigmoid but not involving the entire colon, and 
approximately  20% of patients have pancolitis .5However, a substantial number of pa tients 
will experience disease extension over time .6,7
Current therap y for the treatment of UC includes 5 -aminosalicy lic acid (5 -ASA), sy stemic 
and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_27560] s, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine/6 -mercaptopurine and 
cyclosporin e, and tumor -necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) blockers.[ADDRESS_928563] other kinases in the human genome .12  In kinase assay s, tofacitinib inhibits 
JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser exte nt Ty K2.  In cellular settings where JAK kinases 
signal in pairs, tofacitinib preferentiall y inhibits signaling b y heterodimers containing JAK3 
and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity  over JAK2 homodimer signaling .13  Inhibition of 
JAK1 and JAK3 by  [CONTACT_685197], including IL -2, -4,-7,-9, - 15 and -21.  These 
cytokines are integral to ly mphocy te activation, proliferation, and function, and inhibition of 
their signaling may  thus result in modulation of multiple aspects of the immune response.   In 
addition, inhibition of JAK1 will result in attenuation of signaling b y additional 
pro-inflammatory  cytokines, such as IL -6 and IFN .[ADDRESS_928564] effects of JAK1/ [ADDRESS_928565] s pro vides the rationale 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_685163] l ymphocy te 
activation/proliferation play s a pathogenic role.  Tofacitinib is being studied as anoral 
treatment for UC, Crohn’s disease, as a disease -modify ing anti-r heumatic drug (DMARD) 
for the treatment of RA, as treatment for plaque psoriasis and for the prevention of renal 
allograft rejection.
Summary of Efficacy:
Efficacy  of tofacitinib in the treatment of UC has been evaluated in one Phase 2 study: 
A3921063.  Ef ficacy  of tofacitinib has also been evaluated in Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid 
arthritis, psoriasis, and renal transplant.  Details of the efficacy  results in these patient 
populations can be found in the current version of the tofacitinib Investigator Brochure.
Study  A3921063 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study  
evaluating the safet y and efficacy of tofacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  In 
this study , 195 subjects with moderate to severe active UC were randomized at a 
1:1:1:2:2 ratio into one of the five treatment groups of tofacitinib 0.5mgBID, 3 mg BID, 
10mg BID, 15 mg BID, and the matched placebo for treatment duration of 8 weeks.

Page 27The study  demonstrated dose -dependent improvements with tofacitinib treatment in clinical 
response (primary  endpoint) and clinical remission rates.  Based on protocol- predefined full -
analysis population, the primary  endpoint of clinical response (reduction of May o score by [CONTACT_12697] 3 points or 30% from baseline with an accompany ing de crease in the subscore for rectal 
bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1 ) at Week8 was 
achieved in 47.5%, 29.6%, 51.6%, 63.3%, and 80.0% of subjects in the placebo and 
tofacitinib 0.5 mg, 3 mg, 10mg, and 15 mg BID groups, respectively .  The proportions of 
subjects in clinical remission (total May o score of 2 or lower with no individual subscore 
exceeding 1) at Week8 (secondary  endpoint) were 12.2%, 7.4%, 35.5%, 50.0%, and 42.2% 
in the placebo and tofacitinib 0.5 m g, 3mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg BID treatment groups, 
respectivel y.  Based on the dose -response model, both 10 mg BID and 15 mg BID doses met 
the protocol -predefined criteria for proof of concept for the primary  endpoint . These data 
were further supported by  [CONTACT_685198] -reported outcomes.
Summary of Safety:
The clinical development program for tofacitinib includes health y volunteers and patients 
with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, dry eye disease, and 
renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_685167] 50 Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies.  In the 
completed Phase 2 study  in UC (A3921063), [ADDRESS_928566] one do se 
of tofacitinib (ranging from 0.5 mg BID to 15 mg BID) with 8-week treatment duration.  In 
addition, in the completed Phase 2 study  in Crohn’s disease (A3921043), 105 patients with 
Crohn’s disease received at least one dose of tofacitinib (ranging from 1 mg BID to 
15mgBID) with 4- week treatment duratio n.  These two studies represent an approximate 
total of 28 patient -years of exposure in IBD (approximately  20patient -years in UC and 
8patient -years in Crohn’s disease).
Safety  information from the 8 -week Phase 2 study in UC (A3921063) is summarized below.
Based on the totality  of the clinical data generated thus far, safet y findings and potential risks 
that ma y be associated with the use of tofacitinib include serious and other important 
infections, inclu ding tuberculosis and herpes zoster, potential for malignancies including 
lymphoma, and potential for gastrointestinal perforations. Based on nonclinical data, there is 
the potential for tofacitinib to have effects on pregnancy  and the fetus.
Laboratory  changes observed with the oral use of tofacitinib in humans include decreases in 
neutrophil and ly mphocyte counts and hemoglobin levels, increases in serum creatinine, total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, transaminases and creatine kinase. Recovery  
of laboratory  changes upon discontinuation of tofacitinib treatment are characteristically  
observed.
In the Phase 2 UC study  (A3921063), the overall incidences of AEs were similar between 
tofacitinib- treated and placebo -treated subjects. The most frequentl y reported AEs were 
colitis ulcerative (worsening of ulcerative colitis) (11.3%) and headache (7.2%).  The 
majority  of AEs were mild in severity . Most of the AEs were reported b y the investigator as 
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 28unrelated to stud y treatment . There were 9 subjects (range 0- [ADDRESS_928567] incidence in the placebo group) with permanent discontinuation of study  drug due to 
an AE. None of the tofacitinib -treated subjects had a treatment- related discontinuation.  
SAEs were reported in 10 sub jects (range [ADDRESS_928568] incidence in 
the placebo group). One subject each in the placebo and tofacitinib 0.5 mg and 3 mg groups
experienced a treatment -related SAE (UC each in placebo and 0.5 mg groups; general 
physical health d eterioration in 3 mg group). 
There were no clinicall y significant changes from baseline at Week8 in mean neutrophils, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum creatinine, AST and AL T across all dose groups. 
Dose -related increases from baseline at Week8 in both me an LDL and HDL were observed 
across all dose groups, with the largest increase occurring in the tofacitinib 15mg group. In 
conclusion, tofacitinib up to the doses of 15 mg BID for stud y duration of 8 weeks was 
generall y well tolerated in subjects with UC, and the overall safet y profile was consistent 
with that observed in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
Complete information for this compound may  be found in the Single Reference Safet y 
Document (SRSD) , which for this study  is the Investigator ’sBrochur e (IB) .
1.3. Clinical Pharmacokinetics
The pharmacokinetics of tofacitinib in humans is characterized b y rapid absorption and 
elimination, with a time to peak concentration (T max) of approximately  0.5hour and a 
half-life (t 1/2) of approximately [ADDRESS_928569] to duration or 
population. 
The clearance mechan isms for tofacitinib in humans appear to be both non -renal (hepatic 
metabolism) and renal excretion of the parent drug, the former accounting for approximately  
70% of the total clearance. The metabolism of tofacitinib appears to be primarily  mediated 
by [CONTACT_097]3A4 with minor contribution from CYP2C19 (based on data from poor metabolizers 
of CYP2C19).
1.4.Rational eof Dose Selection
Study  A3921139 is an extension to the Phase 3 placebo -controlled induction studies 
(A3921094 and A3921095) and the maintenance study (A3921096) to provide subjects 
long-term open -label therapy , thus the doses included in this study  are supported by  [CONTACT_685199]  A3921096.  
The inclusion of [ADDRESS_928570] a loss of response due to immunogenicity  once 
efficacy  and safet y are established in a specific patient. Inclusion of 5 mg BID in S tudy
A3921096 allows evaluation of a maintenance dose lower than 10 mg BID.  I mportantly , 
extensive safety  data from the RA program support the choices of 10 mg BID and 5 mgBID 
for this study .
The inclusion of both 5 mg and 10 mg BID in this study  will provide long term safet y data 
should 5 mg and/or 10 mg BID prove to be effective maintenance doses in Study  A3921096.

CP-690,[ADDRESS_928571] for thisstudy will be assessed based on study data collected at Week 8/9 of Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/53 visit (for completers) or early termination visit (early withdrawals due to treatment failure) of Study A3921096.  The study data collected at the Week 8/9 visit for Study A3921094 or A3921095 (for non-responders) or the Week 52/[ADDRESS_928572] is in remission at baseline of Study A3921139.  Remission
is defined by 
a total Mayo score ≤2 with no individual subscore >1, and rectal bleeding subscore of 0.  
Eligible subjects who are in remission at Week [ADDRESS_928573] 3 points from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  
[CONTACT_685191] b y at least [ADDRESS_928574] 1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2)after a minimum 
of 8weeks of treatment in the maintenance study .  In the scenario where the endoscopic 
subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is alr eady  a ‘3’ 
(maximum value) ,then an increase b y at least 1 point will not be needed in order to meet 
treatment failure.  However, all other components of the treatment failure criteria will still 
need to be met.   Subjects who complete induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 and are 
classified as non-responders are also eligible to receive tofacitinib 10mg BID.  
Tofacitinib dose can be adjusted from 5 mg BID to 10 mg BID for efficacy and from 
10 mg BID to 5 mg BID after meeting specific laboratory  abnormali tiesor other protocol 
defined criteria regarding efficacy (seeSection 5.8for dose adjustment guidelines).  Dose 
adjustments can only  occur after a subject has received at least [ADDRESS_928575] theopportunity  to enter Study A3921288 (A Phase 3b/4, Multi -Center, 
Double- Blind, Randomized, Parallel Group Study  of Tofacitinib in Subjects with UC in 
Stable Remission) if they meet the eligibility  criteria .  These subjects must:
Have received tofacitinib 10 mgBID for a minimum of 2 conse cutive years in

Amendment 11
On 17 May  2019, the European Medicines Agency’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment 
Committee (PRAC) issued interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of 
tofacitinib.  These interim recommendations on the restrictions for prescriptions of tofacitinib 
state that patients who are at high risk of blood clots in the lungs must not be started on 
tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928578] be switched to alternative treatments.  Updated guidance from PRAC will be 
provided to patients and their healthcare professionals in the European Union (EU) once 
PRAC has completed its review of all available data. 
In light of the PRAC interim recommendations in the EU, Study  A3921139 will be modified 
globall y thro ugh protocol Amendment 11 ,which will involve the following updates:
1.The study  investigator or designee will need to review each subject ’s medical history

8 weeks of treatment in the maintenance study.  In the scenario where the 
endoscopic subscore is a ‘3’, and the maintenance baseline endoscopic subscore is already a ‘3’ (maximum value), then an increase by [CONTACT_2669] 1 point will not be needed in order to meet treatment failure.  However, all other components of the treatment failure criteria will still need to be met.  Note, endoscopic subscores based on central reading will be used to assess treatment failure.

4.3. Randomization Criteria
Subjects will not be randomized.  Eligible subjects will be assigned to receive either 
tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928589] an influence on the severit y of ulcerative colitis sy mptoms. For that 
reason, subjects should keep their smoking habits constant throughout the study .  Useof 
nicotine patch should be recorded as a concomitant medication.
4.4.2. Activity
Subjects are encouraged to avoid changing their accustomed exercise levels throughout the 
study .
4.4.3. Diet and Dietary Supplements
Subjects are encouraged to keep their diet habits constant throughout the study .It is 
recomm ended that subjects avoid c onsumption of grapefruit juice exceeding 8 ounces 
(~240 mL) total in a day  while in the study .  
For the purposes of this protocol, dietary  supplements, such as vitamins, minerals, purified 
food substances, and herbals with pharm aceutical properties are considered as concomitant 
medications.  Dietary  supplements and herbs are allowed in the study , provided they  are 
taken at stable dose sprior to the baseline visit if they  arestarted prior to study  entry , and not 
associated with k nown effects on CYP3A that may  impact on metabolism of the study  
medication.   Starting dietary  supplement s or herb sduring the stud y as a new medication is 
permissible as long as they are not listed on the prohibited medication list (see Appendix 2).
4.4.4. Vaccination
Vaccination with live components is prohibited during the stud y and for 6weeks after last 
dose of study  medication.  Similarly , current routine household contact [CONTACT_685202] 6weeks following completion of study  treatment.  Following vaccination with live 
component vaccines, the virus may  be shed in bodily  fluids, including stool, and there is a 
potential risk that the v irus may  be transmitted.
General guidelines suggest that exposure to individuals who have been vaccinated should be 
avoided for the following time periods:
a.FluMist(intranasal influenza vaccine) for 1 week following vaccination .
b.Attenuated rotavirus vacci ne for 10 days following vaccination .
c.Varicella for 4 weeks following vaccination.
d.Attenuated t yphoid fever vaccine for 4 weeks following vaccination.

4.4.5. Contraception
Based on preclinical data, tofacitini bhas a potential risk of teratogenicity  and earl y fetal loss. 
Due to this potential risk, women of childbearing potential should not be administered 
tofacitinib until pregnancy  is excluded and should use a highly  effective method of 
contraception (failur e rate <1% when used consistently  and correctl y) during therap y with 
tofacitinib .
For the purposes of this protocol female subjects must be of non -childbearing potential or 
using adequate contraception, as described below.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Females of Non -Childbearing Poten tial
Female subjects of non-childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following 
criteria:
Postmenopausal females are defined as females over the age of [ADDRESS_928590] from Study  
A3921094, A3921095 or A3921096.  If a female has not been confirmed to be 
postmenopausal during Study A3921094, A3921095 or A3921096, then FSH testing 
will be required at basel ine in this study .
Females who had a ph ysician -documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral 
oophorectom y.
Females who have medically -confirmed ovarian failure.
All other female subjects will be considered to be of childbearing potential.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Females of Childbeari ng Potential
All female subjects who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], are biologicall y capable of having 
children and are sexually active, must agree to use a highl y effective method of contraception 
consistently  and correctly  for the duration of the a ctive treatment period and through the 
4-week follow -up procedures.  The investigator, in consultation with the subject, will select 
the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted 
list of contraception methods, a nd instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  The 
investigator, at each study visit, will confirm and document consistent and correct use.  In 
addition, the investigator will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected birth 
control method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected.  
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include:
1. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.

4. Male sterilization with appropriately confirmed absence of sperm in the 
post-vasectomy ejaculate.
5. Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656].
6. Absolute sexual abstinence, without a second method, may be considered an 
acceptable method at the discretion of the investigator.
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing
Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for urine β-hCG at baseline and at 
each study visit (or more frequently if required by [CONTACT_427], if a menstrual cycle is
missed, or if potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected). Urine β-hCG testing will be 
performed at the study site using test kits supplied by [CONTACT_685203] a testing sensitivity at least 25 mIU/mL.  If at any point there is a case of a 
positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study drug interrupted and a serum sample 
will be submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing.  If the serum test confirms 
positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and all the necessary follow up will be 
conducted as per Section 8.[ADDRESS_928591] may resume study 
drug.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reproductive Status of Male Subjects
No tofacitinib effects on male fertility or offspring of dosed males have been observed in any 
preclinical studies conducted to date.  Therefore, no specific contraceptive measures are required in male subjects during study participation.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Surgery
During the course of this study, no elective surgery should be scheduled without first 
consulting with the [COMPANY_007] medical monitor.  Investigators should contact [CONTACT_685204]-elective surgery to discuss their suitability to remain in the study.
4.5. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study is documented in the study contact [CONTACT_346282].CCI
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928592]’s participation in the study .  The contact [CONTACT_167170]; however, it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigational 
site and the study  team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, 
the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and the study  team 
for advice on medical questions or probl ems that may  arise during the study .  The contact 
[CONTACT_74074], and if a subject calls that number, he 
or she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
Subjects will be assigned to one of two dose groups depending on their remission status at 
baseline of Study  A3921 139:
Tofacitinib 5mg BID (subjects in remission) .
Tofacitinib 10mg BID (all other subjects).
Remission is defined by  a total May o score  2 with no individual subscore >1, and r ectal 
bleeding subscore of 0.  Cent ral read assessment of the May o endoscopic subscore will be 
used to determine if a subject is in remission at baseline .
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Assignment of subject identification number, study  medication, and site drug inventory  
control will be managed by  a tele -randomization tool provided by  [CONTACT_456].  A manual 
containing complete instructions for web or telephone access and use will be provided to 
each site prior to stud y start.
At the baseline visit, provided all inclusion /exclusion criteria have been met, the subject will 
be assigned to trial medication via the tele- randomization sy stem.  The investigative site will 
contact [CONTACT_19294] -randomization sy stem (online or via a telephone call).  The site will enroll the 
subject into the tele- randomization sy stem by  [CONTACT_685205] (eg, date of birth and initials).
Eligible subjects will be assigned toone of two dose groups by [CONTACT_3878] ,
tofacit inib5mg BID or tofacitinib 10mg BID ,depending on their remission status at 
baseline in Study  A3921 139.
During a successful call, the tele- randomization sy stem will give the investigative site a code 
which corresponds to study  medication that has been p reviously shipped to the site and is in 
the site’s inventory  read y to be dispensed. This code corresponds to study  medication of th e 
dose group to which the subject has just been assigned .

5.2.Breaking the Blind
This is an open -label study .  Assignment to tofacitinib will be open to the investigators, 
subjects and the [COMPANY_007] study  team.
5.3.Drug Supplies
5.3.1. Formulation and Packaging
Tofacitinib will be provided as 5mg tablets by [CONTACT_685206] .  Tablets 
will be supplied in bottles .  Sufficient study  medication will be dispensed at baseline (Visit 1) 
and a t each subsequent dispensing visit per the Schedule Of Ac tivities to complete dosing 
until the next scheduled dispensing visit.   The number of bottles dispensed will depend on 
whether the subject is taking 5 mg BID (1 bottle) or 10 mg BID (2bottles) ,and the duration 
between the next dispensing study  visit.
5.3.2. Preparation and Dispensing
Subjects will be dispensed tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928593], at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error CRF, which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page , and on the SAE form 
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 43when appropriate.  In the eve nt of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified 
immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product.
Poten tial medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in t he protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149],asdetermined by  [CONTACT_1275] , the medication error is captured on the medication error version of the AE page
and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page .
5.3.4. Compliance
Investigational product compliance will be assessed by  [CONTACT_685207] e visit (Visit 2) up to the end of treatment.  Non-compliance is 
defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of study drug products as directed b y the 
dosing instructions . Subjects are to bring thestudy  drug bottle (s)with an y remaining stud y 
drug and an y empty  bottle(s) to each visit for review.  The investigator has the discretion to 
withdraw an y subject from the study  for reasons of non-compliance with the dosing regimen. 
Investigators should indicate on the appropriate CRF page noncompliance wi th study  
treatment and provide an explanation.  I nventory  control of all study  medications must be 
rigorousl y maintained throughout the duration of the study  until all medication has been 
accounted for and/or returned to the sponsor. Any discrepancies not ed between drug 
dispensing records and the drug inventory  must be reported to [COMPANY_007].
5.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability
Tofacitinib must be stored at room temperature (15 -30C or 59-86F) in a locked area with 
restricted access.  Storage conditions stat ed in the SRSD , the I B, may be superseded b y the 
label storage.
Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures dail y for business day s and 
ensure that thermometers are working correctl y as required for proper storage of 
investigational pro ducts.  These include thermometers for both the room storage and 
refrigerator storage.  An y temperature excursions should be reported immediately.  
The investigator or appropriate delegate at the site (e g,pharmacist), will ensure that all study  
drug is s tored in a secured area, under recommended storage condition, and in accordance 
with regulatory  requirements.

Oral corticosteroid sareallowed for subjects entering Study  A3921139 on oral 
corticosteroids (maximum dose of 25 mg/day  of oral prednisone or equivalent) and 
tapering must commence starting the first week of the study .  
The daily  dose of oral prednisone or equivalent should be decreased at a rate of 5 mg 
per week until the dose reaches 20 mg/day , then reduce by  2.5mg to 5.0 mg weekl y 
until the dose reaches 0 mg.
For example only, if a subject is receiving oral prednisone 25 mg/day  at baseline, the 
subject’s corticosteroid tapering regimen could be as follows:
Baseline/Day  1:25 mg/day
Week 1 ( 2 day s):20 mg/day
Week 2 ( 2 day s):15 mg/day
Week 3 ( 2 day s):10 mg/day
Week 4 ( 2 day s):7.5 mg/day
Week 5 ( 2 day s):5.0 mg/day
Week 6 ( 2 day s):2.5 mg/day
Week 7 ( 2 day s):0 mg/day
Oral budesonide: t he daily  dose should be decreased at a rate of 3 mg every 3weeks 
until discontinuation.
For example only,if a subject is receiving oral b udesonide 9 mg/day  at baseline, 
the subject’s steroid tapering regimen could be as follows:
Week 1 –3 (Day 1 –Day 21): 6mg/day
Week 4 – 6 (D ay22 –Day 42): 3mg/day
Week 7 and bey ond (Day 43): 0mg/day
If a subject experiences worsening of UC s ymptom s during the cortico steroid taper or 
symptoms related to chronic corticosteroid therapy that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_685171], then the investigator may  
instruct the subject to revert back to the preceding dose in the taper schedule (i e,“step
up”).   The signs or s ymptoms leading to this change (e g,increased stool frequency , 
increased rectal bleeding) must be recorded on the CRF. Study  subjects with signs or

If a subject cannot tolerate tapering their corticosteroid dose below 10 mg/day, the 
subject is p ermitted to remain in the study  provided their dose does not exceed 
10mg/day .  However, efforts should be made to taper corticosteroids completely  off.
Re-initiation of oral cortico steroid therap y above 10 mg/day  of prednisone or

5.7.Rescue Therapy
If a subject r equires initiation of a new therapy  for UC (including re -initiation of oral 
corticosteroid therapy  above 10 mg/day  of prednisone or equivalent after a subject has 
achieved steroid -free status during either Study  A3921096 or A3921139 ), the subject should 
bewithdrawn from the study  and appropriate agents should be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If a subject discontinues the use of background oral 5 -ASA or sulfasalazine 
during the study  and/orhas the therap y re-initiated, this will not constit ute rescue therapy , 
and the subject will be permitted to remain in the study .
5.8.Tofacitinib Dose Adjustment Guidelines
The maximum tofacitinib dose allowed in this study  is 10 mg BID.  Tofacitinib dose 
adjustments (increase or decrease) can onl y occur after a subject has received at least 
8weeks of treatment in Study  A3921139. 
If a subject receiving tofacitinib 5mg BID experiences loss of response , defined by  [CONTACT_685208] o score of at least 2 points from baseline in the maintenance study  
(A39 [ZIP_CODE]) for two consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart), accompanied by  [CONTACT_685209] 1 point from baseline of the maintenance study  
(A3921 096), then the subject could be scheduled for endoscop y to determine if the subject is 
experiencing a flare.   Flare is defined b y an increase in May o score of at least 3 points from 
baseline value of the maintenance stud y(A3921096) , accompanied b y an increase in rectal 
bleeding subscore b y at least [ADDRESS_928596] 
1point (unless the endoscopic subscore was a ‘3’ at baseline and remains a ‘3’), after a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_928597] an y of the risk factors for pulmonary  embolism.
Subjects receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID who develop one or more of the risk factors for 
pulmonary  embolism during the study  will not be permitted to increase their dose to 
tofacitinib 10 mg BID .
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin testing is recommended for subjects in whom
C.difficile infection is suspected (eg, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_685172], significantly  worsening disease activity  assessments from the previous visit, 
and/or the presence of risk factors such as recent antibiotic use or a recent history  of 
C.difficile infection ).  A full c ourse of C. difficile treatment, as defined by [CONTACT_53246] ,
must be given to subjects with C. difficile infection to permit their continued participation in 
the study .  Subject swith C. difficile infection that meets serious infection criteria must be 
withdrawn from the study . Stool testing and treatment for other enteric pathogens is at the 
discretion of the investigator.
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928598] meets any  of the following laboratory  criteria after they  are repeated and 
confirmed within approximately  7days:
Any single hemoglobin value that drops >2 g/dL (>20 g/L) below baseline of Study  
A3921139.
Absolute neutrophil count <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/mm3).
Absolute ly mphocy te count <0. 75 x 109/L (<750/mm3).
Platelet count <100 x 109/L (<100,000/mm3).
In addition, for subjects receiving tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928599] is in remission (based on May o score) or in PMS remission at 
Month 24 or any  visit bey ond Month 24, after discussion with the sponsor.  PMS remission is 
defined as a partial May o score 2 with no individual subscore >1.  If a subject experiences 
loss of response and flare after the dose reduction from [ADDRESS_928600] was in 
remission or PMS remission (i e,when the dose was reduc ed to 5 mg BID) for two 
consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart), accompanied by  [CONTACT_685210] [ADDRESS_928601] 
1point (unless the endoscopic subscore was a ‘3’ and remains a ‘3’).
Lastl y, subjects receiving tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928602](s) for 
temporary  withholding of study  drug require documented approval by [CONTACT_456].

6.3.Subject Withdrawal
Should a subject withdraw from active treatment, the subject should complete the procedures 
listed at the Month 12/ET Visit .  After completing the procedures for the early  withdrawal 
visit, the subject should return for a safet y evaluation to occur approximately  4weeks afte r 
discontinuing study  medication as per the f ollow -up visit.
Subjects will be withdrawn from the stud y if an y of the following occurs during the study  
treatment period:
If a subject who enrolled from the induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 
(ie,non-responders) fails to demonstrate clinical response at Month 2.  Clinical 
response is defined b ya decrease from the induction study  baseline (A3921094 or 
A3921095) May o score of at least [ADDRESS_928608] 30%, with an accompany ing 
decrease in the rectal bl eeding subscore of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal 
bleeding subscore of 0 or 1.  The endoscopic subscore based on central reading will 
be used to assess clinical response.
If rescue therapy  is initiated for UC with the exception of oral 5 -ASA or 
sulfasalazine.  Rescue therapy  includes re-initiation of oral corticosteroid therap y 
above 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent after a subject has achieved steroid -free 
status during either Study A3921096 or A3921139.
If asubject undergoes surgery  for UC .
If a subject remains on oral corticosteroids exceeding 15mg/day of prednisone or 
equivalent after Month 3.
A subject may  be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the safet y concerns as listed in 
Appendix 3.
Subjects who develop a serious infection during the study , defined as any  infection (viral, 
bacterial, and fungal) requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685173] a serious adverse event should be withdrawn from the study (seeSection 7.3.10 ).
All abnormal laboratory events of clinical significance should be followed until the 
laboratory  values have returned to normal or baseline levels (see Appendix 3).  Subjects who 
meet the discontinuation criteria described in Appendix 3will be withdrawn from the study.
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928609] has an y clinically significant, stud y-related abnormalities at the conclusion of the 
study , the [COMPANY_007] medica l monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and every  
effort should be made to arrange follow- up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document 
the course of the abnormalities.
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the study  will be recorded in the Case Report 
Form (CRF) .  A discontinuation occurs when a subject ceases participation in the study , 
regardless of the circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol.  The investigator must 
determine the primary  reason for discontinuati on.  Withdrawal due to adverse event should 
be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response.  The early  withdrawal
evaluation required b y the protocol (see Month 12/ET visit procedures) will be performed at 
the time of study  discontinuation , or as soon as possible thereafter .  The investigator will 
record the reason for study  discontinuation, provide or arrange for appropriate follow -up (if 
required) for each such subject, and document the course of the subject’s condition.
Subjects may  withdr aw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety orbehavioral 
reasons , or the inability  of the subject to compl y with the protocol required schedule of stu dy 
visits or procedures at a given stud y site.   If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, 
every  effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_423].  I n any  circumstance, every  effort should 
be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the 
reason for withdrawal, request the subject to return all unused investigational product(s), 
request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow -up with the subject 
regarding an y unresolved adverse event s(AEs) .
In accordance with due diligence requirements, if a subject fails to return for scheduled 
visit(s), the site shall record information concerning attempts to contact [CONTACT_685212], including method of contact (e g,letter, phone call) and date of 
each attempted contact.  It is recommended that the investigational site makes two phone 
calls to the subject who missed the visit, documenting each call in the source documents.  A 
third contact [CONTACT_685213] a certified letter to the subject, and this letter and the response 
received become part of the source documents.  When a site has made at least [ADDRESS_928610] to follow up (LTFU).   Subject’s status shall 
be designated LTFU in the CRF and in the study  monitoring report.
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well-being of the subject. When a protocol re quired test cannot be performed the

7.1.Ulcerative Colitis Assessments
7.1.1. Subject Bowel Movement Diary
Subjects will use a phone -based interactive voice recording s ystem(IVRS) tool to record 
their bowel movement data throughout the stud y.  Subjects will be instruct ed in its use at the 
Baseline visit.  This information should be entered daily  approximately  7daysprior to their 
study  visit AND an y time during the study that the subject experiences a worsening of UC 
symptoms.  A utomatic reminder s will be sent to the subject before their scheduled visit to 
remind them to record their bowel movement data.  Also, as an additional reminder the site 
personnel will call the subject [ADDRESS_928611] the following 
information during the study :
‘Normal’ number of stools per day  (when not having a flare and will only be asked at 
baseline of induction study ).
Num ber of toilet visits for bowel movements (per day ).
Presence of blood in the stools (if any ).
Description of blood in the stools (if an y).
7.1.2. Partial Mayo Score
A partial May o score (PMS) is an instrument designed to measure disease activity  of 
ulcerative col itiswithout endoscop y.  Partial May o score ranges from 0 to 9 points.  I t 
consists of 3 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe 
disease .
stool frequency  (0-3);
rectal bleeding (0 -3);
physician global assessment (PGA) ( 0-3).
The partial Mayo score (PMS) will be assessed prior to the administration of study  
medication at each specified study  visit (seeSchedule Of Activities ).  Partial May o score of 
2or less with no individual subscore >1, is defined as PMS remission, and reduction of PMS 
of [ADDRESS_928612]’s diary data recorded over the 3 prior 
consecutive day s.  The phy sician’s global assessment (PGA) acknowledges the three other
criteria, the patient’s recollection of abdominal discomfort andgeneral sense of wellbeing, 
and other observations, such as ph ysical findings and the patient’s performance sta tus.
7.1.3. Mayo Score
The Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis.  
Mayo score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3 
with higher scores indicating more severe disease (see Appendix 1).
Stool frequency  (0-3).
Rectal bleeding (0 -3).
Findings of flexible sigmoidoscopy  (0-3).
Physician global assessment (PGA) (0 -3).
Mayo score is assessed at Month 2, at the following annual study  visits (Months 12, 24 and 
36),and at the earl y withdrawal/earl y termination visit per the Schedule Of Activities.
The endoscopic finding at Month [ADDRESS_928613]’s stool frequency  and 
quantification of the amount of blood in the stool.  The subject will use the phone- based

during the study.  PRO assessments collected during the study will be presented in separate tables, figures, and data listings, and will be reviewed in the final study report. 
It is important to note that the PRO measurements are collected and evaluated in a different 
manner than the observed or volunteered adverse events.  Given these differences, no attempt will be made to resolve any apparent discrepancies between observed or volunteered adverse events and PRO data collected from subjects.  Adverse event incidence rates will not be calculated from these solicited data but rather from the information recorded on the AE pages on the CRF.
 
 
 
To be completed during study visits:
The following PROs will be completed as specified in the Schedule Of Activities .  Subjects 
should be encouraged to complete the PROs at the clinic at the beginning of the study visitprior to any clinical assessments.  A member of the staff should be available if a subject requires further instruction and to review the PRO questionnaires for completeness prior to leaving the clinic.
•Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) (see Appendix 9 ).
 
7.2.1. Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ)
IBDQ Questionnaire is a psychometrically validated PRO instrument for measuring the 
disease-specific quality of life in subjects with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, including ulcerative colitis.  The IBDQ comprises 32-items, which are grouped into 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function.

Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as AEs if they meet any of the 
following criteria:
•Test result is associated with accompanying symptom, and/or
•Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
•Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or
•Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_394548].
Abnormal test results determined to be caused from laboratory error should not be reported 
as AEs.  Clinically significant laboratory findings at the final assessment should be followed to resolution or until determined by [CONTACT_585011].  Repeat tests may be indicated.
7.3.6. Annual Tuberculosis Testing
Annual tuberculosis (TB) testing will be conducted using Quantiferon-TB
®Gold Plus test 
(QFT) for subjects in those countries in which TB prevalence has been reported at a rate of 
>50 cases per 100,000 persons (eg, Brazil, Latvia, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, South Africa, and South Korea, based on World Health Organization, 2015 http://www.who.int/tb/country/data/profiles/en/index.html).  All subjects with positive results must have a chest radiograph performed and the radiograph must be negative for active TB infection for the subject to continue study participation.  Subjects identified as having latent TB (positive QFT and negative chest radiograph for active TB) should be treated appropriately; for subjects remaining on study during their treatment, the only acceptable regimen is 9 months of isoniazid. Subjects can continue to take tofacitinib without interruption while receiving treatment for latent TB.  Note: QFT should not be performed in subjects who had a positive result during prior testing (screening visit in Study A3921094 or A3921095 or prior annual visits) and/or previously received adequate treatment for TB.
7.3.7. Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine β-hCG pregnancy test, with sensitivity 
of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at baseline (Visit 1), before investigational product 
administration.  A negative urine β-hCG test result is required before the subject may receive 
the investigational product.  Urine β-hCG tests will also be done whenever one menstrual 
cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), repeated at all study visits and at the end of the study to confirm the subject has C
CI
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928618] 
of IRB/IECs or if required by [CONTACT_427].
If at any point there is a case of a positive urine β-hCG test, the subject will have study drug 
interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for β-hCG testing.  If the 
serum test confirms positive, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and all the necessary follow up will be conducted as per Section 8.[ADDRESS_928619] may resume study drug.  It is essential to make sure that female study subjects use acceptable birth control (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and ) from 
the time of the first dose of study medication until completion of follow-up procedures.
In Austria, if the interval between study visits exceeds one month, female subjects of 
childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test performed each month between study visits and results reported to the investigational site to be entered into the subject’s study record.
7.3.8. Serum Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_685174], LDL-cholesterol, direct HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides will be 
measured during the study at specific study visits according to the Schedule Of Activities
requiring subjects to fast at least 9 hours prior to sample collection.  See Appendix 8 for 
recommended clinical management of cholesterol.
7.3.9. Creatinine Clearance
A commonly used surrogate marker for actual creatinine clearance is the Cockcroft-Gault 
formula (see Appendix 5 ), which employs creatinine measurements and a subject’s weight to 
calculate the clearance. Cockcroft-Gault GFR calculation will be done as part of clinical laboratory tests from baseline (Visit 1) through follow-up.
7.3.10. Infections
Subjects will be monitored for development of infection. Infections will be classified as 
either treated or non-treated infections. All treated infections occurring during the study should be cultured if feasible and the results (eg, any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
•Require antimicrobial therapy by [CONTACT_110454];
•Require any surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).
Treated infections will be further classified as serious or non-serious. Serious infections are 
treated infections that:
•Require parenteral antimicrobial therapy or;
•Require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685175];CCI

Page 70Meet other criteria that require the infection to be classified as a serious adverse event 
(SAE).
A subject who experiences a serious infection should be discontinued from the study .  A 
serious infection should be reported as a SAE and should be list ed as the reason for 
discontinuation in the CRF. All serious infections occurring during the study  should undergo 
appropriate laboratory  investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Subjects who experience non- serious infections that require treatment may  have their study  
drug temporaril y discontinued during treatment (seeSection 5.9).  Temporary  
discontinuation of study  drug should be recorded in the CRF.
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin testing is recommended for subjects in whom
C.difficile infection is suspected (eg, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_685172], significantly  worseni ng disease activity  assessments from the previous visit, 
and/or the presence of risk factors such as recent antibiotic use or a recent history  of 
C.difficile infection ).  A full course of C. difficile treatment, as defined by [CONTACT_53246] ,
must be given to subjects with C. difficile infection to permit their continued participation in 
the study .  Subject swith C. difficile infection that meets serious infection criteria must be 
withdrawn from the study. Stool testing and treatment for other enteric path ogens is at the 
discretion of the investigator.
7.3.11. Cardiovascular ,and Malignancy, and Other Safety Events of Interest
The identification of a cardiovascular ,malignancy , or other safet yevent s of interest canbe 
identified by [CONTACT_685215]. These safet y events may  
also be identified b y the [COMPANY_007] Study  Team or designee during the review of subject data 
listings or by  [CONTACT_685216].
Criteria for defining specific cardio vascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular events 
will be provided to investigators in a separate study  manual.  The [COMPANY_007] Study  Team or 
designee will provide a listing of specific documents needed to support cardiovascular event 
adjudication by  [CONTACT_685217] (CV -EAC; see
Section 9.7 ).  Cardiova scular event documentation will include, but is not limited to any  of 
the following: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_685176], operative reports, clinic notes, ECGs, 
diagnostic enz ymes, results of other diagnostic tests, autopsy  reports and death certificate 
information.
When there is a decision to biopsy  a potentiall y malignant tumour, l ymph node, or other 
tissue, the invest igator and/or consultant(s) should contact [CONTACT_685218] y decisions as soon as possible.  For all biopsies of potentially  malignant 
tumours, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685177] , or possible extranodal ly mphoproliferative disorder 
(LPD), the study  site wil l request the pathologist to send the original slides used to make the 
definitive diagnosis, ancillary  study  reports, and the pathologist’s report to the central 
laboratory  for a blinded review by  a central pathologist.  See Appendix 6for the steps to take 
in the event of potentially  malignant tumours, l ymphadenopath y or possible extra -nodal L PD

A subject may  be at high risk for pulmonary  embolism if he/she:
has heart failure ;
has inherited coagulation disorders;
has had venous thromboembolism, either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary  
embolism ;
is taking combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy ;
has malignancy (association is strongest with cancers other than non- melanoma skin 
cancers) ;
is undergoing major surgery .
If asubject has a ny of the risk factors listed above and is receiving tofacitinib [ADDRESS_928621]’s tofacitinib dose should be reduced to [ADDRESS_928622](s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AEand to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a nSAE
requiring immediate notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all AEs, 
sufficient information should be obtained b y the investigator to determine the causalit y ofthe 
AE.  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_685219] a level acceptable to the

receiving investigational product, through and including [ADDRESS_928624] after the active 
reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes 
aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a 
reasona ble possibility  of being related to investigational product are to be reported to the 
sponsor.
AEs (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken at least 1dose of investigational product through thesubject ’slast
visit.   
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AEis an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Exa mples of AEs include but are not limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Addition ally, they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;

8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AEare as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgic al intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing , outside of those permitted b y the 
protocol, or discontinuation from the study, si gnificant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy, and/or
Test result is considered to b e an AEby [CONTACT_4687].
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
8.5. Serious Ad verse Events
Aserious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.

medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AEoutcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury 
Abnormal values in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent wi th abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
impo rtant medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the subject ’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalit ies should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range
who subsequently  present with AST or AL Tvalues 3times the uppe r limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 ×ULN with no evidence of 
hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase 2 ×ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting ALT ORAST OR total bilirubin values above the 
upper limit of normal, th e following threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For s ubjects with pre -existing AST or ALT baseline values above the normal 
range :AST or ALT values 2times the baseline values and 3 ×ULN, or 
8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller) .

(whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_928625] bilirubin, gamma -glutamy l 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT )/international normaliz ed ratio ( INR), and alkaline

acetaminophen , recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. 
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (e g,biliary  tract) 
may be warra nted. All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above , with no other cause for liver function tests ( LFT)abnormalities identified at 
the time should be considered potential Hy’s lawcases irrespective of availabilit y of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal LFTs. Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs .

Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new AEor with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for 
work -up of persistent pre- treatment lab oratory abnormality );
Social admission (e g,subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (e g,for yearly physical exam ination );
Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg,for a procedure required by  [CONTACT_8896]);
Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596](eg,for elective 
cosmetic surgery );
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4597] a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs .  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AEreporting period should be reported as the AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.7.Severity Assessm ent
If required on the AEcase report forms (CRFs) , the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For 
purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe e vent is not 
necessarily  an SAE .  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes significantly  with 
thesubject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAE s, listed above.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 778.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting req uirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor ( see the Section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", 
this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investig ator determines a nSAE is associated with study  procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicabl e.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment o r environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/ or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct conta ct with 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to 
the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If astudy  subject or study  subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the[COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on an SAE report formand an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] pro duct in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AEhas occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).

Page 78Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome f or 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form .  In the case of a live birth, th e structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine f etile demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly  [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outc omes that are reported as SAE s follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion ;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_928626].
Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by  [CONTACT_093].  Further 
follow -up of birth out comes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information 
Form to deliver to his partner. The Investigator must document in the source documents that 
the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the per formance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 2 4hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Alsothe Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to AEsshould be distinguished from withdrawal due to other c auses, 
according to the definition of AEnoted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AECRF 
page.   
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928627] be 
made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AEinformation.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) o n previousl y forwarded SAE reports 
as well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of EDP, exposure via breastfeeding, and 
occupational exposure cases . 
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a nSAE
immediately (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time 
of his/her first awareness of the AE .
For all SAE s, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in an 
expedited fashion.  This i nforma tioncollected for SAE sismore detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF .  In general, this will include a description of the AEin sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causalit y.  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/orillnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AEpage(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE information is not the same as the AECRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse event reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.

Detailed m ethodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study  
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be maintained by  [CONTACT_456].  
This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any  major
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Sample Size Determination
Approximately  900subjects are expected to become eligible for the study .  Approximately  
460subjects are expected to enroll from the maintenance Study  A3921096 assuming a 
78%rollover rate from the maintenance study .  Approximately  440subjects are expected to 
enroll from the induction Study  A3921094 or A3921095 assuming that 38% of subjects 
enrolled in those studi es will not achieve clinical response and will not have improving 
endoscopic subscores after completing induction Study  A3921094 or A3921095.
9.2.Efficacy Analysis
The primary  analysis population will be the Full Analy sis Set (FAS) defined as all subjects 
who receive at l east [ADDRESS_928628]

from baseline value of the maintenance study (A3921096) , accompanied by  [CONTACT_685193] [ADDRESS_928629] 
1point (yielding an absolute endoscopic subscore of  2), 3) all other subjects from 
maintenance stud y A3921096 neither in remission nor fulfilling the definition of treatment 
failure, and 4) non -responders from induction studies A3921094 or A3921095 .
9.3.Analysis of Health Outcome Assessments
These endpoints will be analy zed using the same approach as the secondary endpoints.
9.4.Safety Analysis
The safet y data will be summarized in accordance with [COMPANY_007] Data Standards based on the 
safet y analy sis set defined as all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_928630] (DSMB), a group of experts external to 
[COMPANY_007], will review accumulating safety  data from this study  on an ongoing basis. Review of 
efficacy  data may  occur as part of an y risk-benefit assessment deemed the responsibility  of 
this committee. Based on these reviews, the DSMB will have the capacity to make 
recommendations to [COMPANY_007] that might impact the future conduct of the trial. The DSMB will 
have access to unblinded treatment information during the clinical trial. The management 
and process of this committee will be in accordance with [COMPANY_007]’s Standard Operating 
Procedures and will be documented in the DSMB Charter. The DSMB memb ers will all be 
individuals who are independent of [COMPANY_007].
A DSMB Liaison will be appointed; this is an individual who represents [COMPANY_007] to coordinate 
communications and facilitates access to [COMPANY_007]’s resources, but is not involved in the study 
design, study  management, site management, data accrual, or study  anal ysis. Records of 
DSMB meetings, interactions with [COMPANY_007] contacts, assessments and recommendations and 
materials reviewed will be maintained and kept proprietary  and confidential by  [CONTACT_4318]. 
Further information about the DSMB can be found in the DSMB Charter, which outlines the 
operating procedures of the committee, including specific description of the scope of their 
responsibilities, including a plan where communication timelines are defined.
The DSMB will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects 
in the study  according to the Charter.  The recommendations made by  [CONTACT_685221].  [COMPANY_007] will forward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safet y data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.
9.7.Safety Event Adjudication Committees
To help assess specific safety  eventsin this and other studies for the tofacitinib program, 
adjudication committees have been established to harmonize and standardize selected safet y 
event assessment.  Members of these safet y event adjudication committees will be blinded to 
treatment ass ignment in order to allow for unbiased assessments. These committees include 
a Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CV EAC), Malignancy  Adjudication 
Committee (MAC), Opportunistic I nfection Review Committee (OI RC), Hepatic Event 
Review Committe e (HERC) and Gastrointestinal Perforation Review Committee (GI PRC) .  
Further information about the se committees can be found in the respective charters , including

and standardize selected safet y event assessments.  As described above, individual committee 
charters will provide specific descriptions of the scope of responsibilities and the processes 
and definitions used to review and assess specific safet y events.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During stud y conduct, [COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  [CONTACT_4707] (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (I EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or 
companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_685222].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPIN G
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
CP-690,550
A3921139
Final Protocol Amendment 11, 18 June 2019
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 83consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data cont ained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating subjects (sufficient 
information to link records, e g,CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents , and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Har monisation ( ICH), 
local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement (CSA) , whichever is 
longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfi zer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_928631] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements ha ve been met. 
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant do cuments, e g,
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].

subject .In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of confidentiality and 
protection of subject personal data.
The informed consent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  
requirements, and le gal requirements.
The informed consent document used in this study, and any  changes made during the course 
of the study , must be prospectively  approved by  [CONTACT_36552] I RB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] before use.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject, or his/her legal representative, is fully  
informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible .
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject or the subject's legal representative before an y study -specific 
activity  is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed 
consent document .
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
Competent Authority  in any  area of the World, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately.

regulatory  application (i e,Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for pr emature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member State.
13.2. End of Trial in all Participating Countries
End of Trial in all participating countries is defined as last subject last visit.
14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA
Premature termination of this study  may  occur because of a regulatory  authority  decision, 
change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC, drug safet y problems, or at the discretion of [COMPANY_007].  In 
addition, [COMPANY_007] retains the right to discontinue development of tofacitinib at any  time.
If a stud y is prematurel y terminated or discontinued, [COMPANY_007] will promptly  notify  the 
investigator.  After notification, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_8906][INVESTIGATOR_4601]  (if applicable) within 1week .  As dire cted b y [COMPANY_007], all study  
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

Page 93Appendix 3. Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuations
The following laboratory abnormalities require monitoring and re-testing ideally within 
3-5 days:
•Absolute neutrophil count <1.2 x 109/L (<1200/mm3).
•Absolute lymphocyte count <0.5 x 109/L (<500/mm3).
•Any single hemoglobin value <8.0 g/dL, or any decrease in hemoglobin >2.0 g/dL 
from baseline.
•Platelet count <100 x 109/L (<100,000/mm3).
•An increase in serum creatinine of >50% from the baseline value; OR an absolute 
increase in serum creatinine >0.5 mg/dL (>44.2 umol/L) from baseline value.
•Any single AST and/or ALT elevation ≥3 times the upper limit of normal (repeat 
laboratory testing should include albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, direct and 
indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT [prothrombin time] with INR [international normalized ratio], and alkaline phosphatase), regardless of the total bilirubin. (Please note that [ADDRESS_928638] need confirmation on separate blood draw before undertaking thorough evaluation for liver injury).
•Any creatine kinase (CK) >10 times the upper limit of normal (repeat laboratory 
testing should also include cardiac troponin).
•For women of child-bearing potential with any positive urine β-hCG test, the subject 
will have study drug interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central 
laboratory for β-hCG testing.
Additional individual subject safety monitoring in addition to these guidelines is at the 
discretion of the investigator and dependent on any perceived safety concerns. Unscheduled laboratory testing through the central laboratory may be obtained at any time during the study to assess such concerns, and a subject may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator.
Treatment with tofacitinib will be discontinued and the subject withdrawn from this 
study for:
•Serious infections defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring 
parenteral antimicrobial therapy, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2476], or meeting other 
criteria that require the infection to be classified as serious adverse event.
•Two sequential absolute neutrophil counts <0.75 x 10

Page 98Appendix 6.Evaluation of Potentially Malignant Tumors, Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685165] (LPD)
The following steps should be taken in the event of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685184] (L PD) which might arise in the course of this or 
other studies of [COMPANY_007]’s experimental immunosuppressive drugs. 
Any new cases or worsening cases of existing l ymphadenopath y need to be discussed with 
[COMPANY_007] study  team first. In addition, when there is a decision to biopsy  a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685185], the inv estigator and/or consultants should discuss the issue and an y decisions as soon 
as possible with [COMPANY_007] study  team. It is recommended that specialists with experience in the 
evaluation of immunosuppressed patients be consulted.
If a biops y for l ymphadenop athy or ly mphoma is to be performed, the investigator or 
consultant should refer to the study  biops y procedures instructions and review the following 
points with the surgeon and pathologist:
Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_685186] y are strongl y discou raged; excisional 
biopsy  is required for accurate diagnosis;
Tissue must be sent fresh to the pathology  laboratory ; the pathologist must be 
consulted before the procedure;
Archive multiple frozen tissue samples, if possible;
Include flow cy tometry  and cy togenetics as part of the pathologic evaluation;
Culture for my cobacterium and fungi, if indicated;
Collect and snap freeze peripheral blood ly mphocy tes for germ line evaluation 
(DNA);
Archive multiple aliquots of serum samples.
For all biopsies of potential ly malignant tumors, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685177] , or possible 
extranodal ly mphoproliferative disorder (L PD), request the pathologist to send the original 
slides used to make the definitive diagnosis, ancillary  study  reports, and the pathologist’s 
report to the central laboratory  for a blinded review by  a central pathologist. Should the 
central pathologist make a diagnosis that is not essentially  similar to the local pathologist’s 
diagnosis, the site will be notified and provided with an opportunity  to consu lt with the 
central pathologist. Translation during this consultation, if needed, will be provided b y the 
staff of the [COMPANY_007] Clinical Country  Office (CCO) or designee .
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928640] biopsies, obt ained from any  gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure 
performed during the study  because of a clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_556973]  (even if the local 
pathologist reading is negative for d ysplasia or malignancy ) ORgastrointestinal tract 
biopsies obtained during the study  for any  reason that show the findings or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_685187] , the original slides will need to be sent for central pathologist over 
read in addition to the local pathologist’s diagnosis.
CP-690,[ADDRESS_928641]’s lipid panel results is recommended to include an assessment
of individual subject risk for cardiovascular disease. Management of lipid levels should be
determined on an individual subject level due to the individuali zed nature of cholesterol
treatment recommendations. The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III, National Cholesterol Education
Program 2002) provides guiding principles for th e intensity  of lipid lowering therapy  based 
on an individual’s absolute risk for coronary  heart disease (CHD). ATP III guidelines and/or 
other relevant local practices and guidelines should be used to determine if any  lipid lowering 
intervention is requir ed for a subject. Such assessments sho uld occur throughout the stud y, 
in light of the observed increases in lipid levels in previous clinical trials with tofacitinib. As 
appropriate, lipid management decisions may be considered in collaboration with the 
subject’s primary  care phy sician or general practitioner.
A cop y of the complete ATP III guidelines will be provided to each stud y site for reference.

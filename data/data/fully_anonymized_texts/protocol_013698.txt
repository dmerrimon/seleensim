19(127)Duration of treatment
The study will start with a 2-week screening period. Eligible p atients will enter a 4-week 
single-blind placebo lead-in period and then be randomized to d ouble-blind treatment in a 
1:1:1 ratio to receive either:
a) Dapagliflozin 10 mg tablet plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg tablet,
b) Dapagliflozin 10 mg tablet plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg placebo ta blet,
             or
c) Dapagliflozin [ADDRESS_472656], dos age and mode of administration
Dapagliflozin 10 mg alone or dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxaglipt in 2.5 mg will be 
administered orally once daily during the 24-week double-blind,  treatment period.
Comparator, dosage and mode of administration
Placebo to match dapagliflozin 10mg and placebo to match saxagl iptin 2.5mg will be 
administered orally once daily during the 4-week single blind p lacebo lead-in period and the 
24-week double-blind treatment period.
Other treatments
x Insulin, antihypertensive drugs, lipid lowering drugs, and oral  anti-diabetic drugs 
(except SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists and DPP4 inhibitors) a re allowed during 
the study. The dose should be kept constant throughout the enti re study from start of 
run-in to end of follow-up (week 27). CCI

20(127) x Patients may receive open-label rescue medication added on to, but not as a 
replacement for their current study drug regimen. Rescue medica tion in this 
protocol refers to any approved, appropriate anti-diabetic agen t, except SGLT2 
inhibitor, GLP1 agonist and DPP4 inhibitors, for which there is  either initiation or 
upward titration, in accordance with the approved label and con ventional standards 
of care. 
x The dose of any concomitant anti-hypertensive medication should  be kept constant 
as far as possible throughout the entire study from start of ru n-in to the end of 
follow-up (week 27). However, in case of symptomatic hypotensio n or severe 
uncontrolled hypertension, anti-hypertensive treatment can be a djusted according to 
the Investigator’s judgement.  
Statistical methods 
Multiplicity due to the two active treatment groups will be con trolled by a Bonferroni 
adjustment, such that statistical significance will be determin ed according to a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.025. Within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 1 0 mg treatment group the 
control of the alpha level in the testing of both co-primary en dpoints (the percent change in 
urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to 24 we eks and the change in HbA1c 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require that each achieves stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints.  Within the dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha 
level for the primary endpoint (the percent change in urine alb umin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require the achievement of stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints. Parallel sequential testing strategies wil l be used for comparing each 
active treatment group to placebo for the secondary endpoints. 
The analysis of the change in HbA1C from baseline to Week 24 wi ll be based on a repeated 
measures model (RMM) including all scheduled time points follow ing randomization up to 
and including week 24. The analysis of percent change in UACR f rom baseline to Week 24 
will be conducted on the log-transformed UACR values using RMM.

30(127) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study 
Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®, Farxiga®) is a stable, reversible, hig hly selective, and orally active 
inhibitor of human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2 ), the major transporter 
responsible for renal glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Dapag liflozin’s mechanism of action 
results in the direct and insulin-independent elimination of gl ucose by [CONTACT_8212]. 
Traditionally, the presence of glucose in the urine has been se en as a sign of poor glycemic 
control and, thus, something to be avoided. Familial renal gluc osuria in humans, however, due 
to genetic mutations that reduce the function of SGLT2, is asso ciated with life-long glucosuria 
that is generally asymptomatic. Results from nonclinical- and c linical studies have shown that 
dapagliflozin can be used to promote urinary excretion of gluco se as a well-tolerated and 
effective method of reducing blood glucose levels. Thus, treatm ent with an SGLT2 inhibitor 
may affect hyperglycaemia directly by [CONTACT_377606] T2DM. 
Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action reduces plasma glucose rega rdless of the patient’s 
insulin sensitivity and β -cell secretory function. Because this mechanism is independent  of 
insulin secretion or insulin action, this approach to anti diab etic therapy provides an 
opportunity to achieve clinically important glycemic efficacy w ith a comparatively low risk of 
hypoglycemia. This insulin-independent mechanism is also potent ially applicable to a broad 
spectrum of patients. In addition, the excretion of glucose may  promote weight loss or prevent 
weight gain, as a consequence of calorie loss, a potential bene fit for many patients with T2DM. 
The dapagliflozin clinical development program was designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of dapagliflozin in a wide range of patients with T2DM . The program included both 
placebo-controlled and active comparator studies in drug-naïve patients at an early stage of 
disease and patients who require additional therapy after failu re to reach adequate glycemic 
control with their current regimen. Dapaglif lozin’s pharmacodynamic effect of glucosuria is 
detected almost immediately (within [ADDRESS_472668]-dose), is maint ained through 2 years of 
treatment, and results in reductions in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Post-prandial Glucose 
(PPG), and HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin). Treatment with dap agliflozin, with its unique 
mechanism of action, results in a persistent loss of glucose wi th associated calories in the 
urine, resulting in a consistent and maintained reduction of th e total body weight, in addition 
to the improved glycemic control. The weight loss is predominan tly a result of a reduction in 
fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tis sue in T2DM. Dapagliflozin 
also has a mild diuretic effect, which in combination with weig ht loss, has the potential to 
reduce blood pressure.  
Saxagliptin (Onglyza®) is a highly potent, selective, reversibl e, and competitive dipeptidyl l 
peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor. DPP4 is the enzyme responsible fo r the inactivation of 
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Gastric inhibitory polypept ide (GIP). By [CONTACT_377607]4, saxagliptin potentiates active endogenous GLP-1 co ncentrations, augmenting 
the physiological mechanism of insulin secretion and decreasing  glucagon release, thereby 
[CONTACT_377608] T2DM.

31(127)The results from the saxagliptin Phase IIb and IIIprograms in over patients support the 
oral dose of saxagliptin 2.5 and 5 mg once daily in a wide rang e of patients with T2DM, as 
either monotherapy, add-on combination therapy with metformin, a thiazolidinedione (TZD ), 
a sulfonylurea (SU), insulin or initial combination therapy wit h metformin and the results 
from the Phase III studies confirmed clinically meaningful bene fits on HbA1c, as well as 
fastin g plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial glucose (PPG), insulin, C -peptide, and glucagon 
levels. 
Diabetic subjects with renal impairment are of interest because  diabetic nephropathy affects 
approximately 30% of patients with diabetes. In the United Stat es, for instance, about 20% of 
individuals with diabetes have an estimated glomerular filtrati on rate (eGFR) lower than 60 
ml/min/1.73m2(chronic kidney disease, CKD stage ≥3). As diabetic patients pr ogress from 
normal to diminished renal function over the natural history of  their disease, there is a medical 
need for safe and effective oral anti-diabetic therapy. Several  existing anti-diabetic agents are 
contraindicated in this population, are associated with increas ed risk of hypoglycemia, or have 
not been adequately studied in these patients. Safety and effic acy data in subjects with normal, 
mildly, and moderately impaired renal function have been collec ted in previous studies in the 
dapagliflozin and saxagliptin development program.
While saxagliptin 2.5 mg daily has been shown to be well tolera ted and improve glucose 
control even in individuals with CKD stage >3  (Nowicki et al 2 011), dapagliflozin’s ability to 
inhibit renal glucose reabsorption declines with decreasing eGF R and in CKD3, urinary 
glucose excretion with dapagliflozin is about 50% lower than in  patients with normal or 
mildly impaired renal function. In a previous study in CKD3, dap agliflozin [ADDRESS_472669] decrease in HbA1 c and FPG in patients
with a GFR of 45 –59 ml/min (Kohan et al 2014). However, that study suffered from  several 
limitations. The use of insulin-based regimens in almost two-th irds of patients, often with 
sliding scale administration, made accurate capture of insulin dosing difficult. Differential 
adjustments of insulin between placebo and dapagliflozin could have blunted the apparent 
efficacy of dapagliflozin. A second limitation was the relative ly small size of the study, which 
was powered for a 0.6% change in HbA1c, and therefore limited i n its ability to demonstrate 
smaller glycemic effects and thus, the study may be considered underpowered and subject to 
type [ADDRESS_472670] is thought to b e achieved partly by 
[CONTACT_377609]. Such other 
mechanisms are thought to be reduced intra-glomerular pressure through an enhanced CCI

32(127) tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism (De Nicola 2014 and Thomas 2014) as well as a 
reduced glucose and sodium transport over the proximal tubule c ells (Pollock et al 1991 and 
Komala et al 2013) 
Preclinical data in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes and obesit y show similar reductions in 
renal inflammatory response after dapagliflozin treatment as ha s been seen with ARB 
treatment (Terami et al 2014 and Sato-Horiguchi et al 2012). Fu rther, data from a type [ADDRESS_472671] indicated that a combination th erapy with SGLT2i and 
ACEI is more effective in lowering blood pressure and more neph roprotective than 
administration of either agent alone (Kojima et al 2013). Of no tice, treatment with a SGLT2i 
in a type 1 diabetic nephropathy (eNOS knockout) rat model did not have any 
nephroprotective effect.  
Preclinical data do also support nephroprotective effects of DP P4 inhibitors. Thus, in rodent 
models of T1 and T2DN, treatment with DPP4 inhibitors has been found to decrease renal 
injury markers such as albuminuria, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress (Tanaka et al 
2014). Even clinical data suggest nephroprotective effect of SG LT2 and DPP4 inhibitors as 
reduced urinary albumin excretion have been observed in T2DN tr ials with both these agents. 
(Scirica et al 2013).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_377565] a declining 
renal function, reduced urinary albumin excretion has been foun d in patients with moderate 
renal impairment on top of RAAS blockade for up to 1 year (Sjös tröm et al 2015). 
Although a causal relationship is debated, changes in albuminur ia over time predicts mortality 
and both cardiovascular and renal outcomes significantly better  than glucose status and blood 
pressure control in patients at a high cardiovascular risk (Sch mieder et al 2014). 
The combination of DPP-4 and SGLT2 inhibition has therefore bee n proposed as a promising 
future option for T2DM patients with CKD (Schernthaner et al 20 14). 
Rationale for study design, doses and control groups   
This study will be performed as part of the clinical developmen t program for dapagliflozin for 
treatment of T2DM. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy,  safety and pharmacodynamics 
of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin in combination with saxaglip tin in CKD patients with type 
[ADDRESS_472672] inadequate glycemic 
control, defined as HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤11.0%, and renal impairmen t (eGFR ≥25 to ≤75 
ml/min/1.73 m2).  
The pharmacodynamic effects of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin ha ve previously been studied 
in patients with renal impairment. Saxagliptin 2.5mg once daily  significantly reduced UACR 
and HbA1c (Mosenzon et al 2014, Nowicki et al 2011, Kohan et al  2014) and dapagliflozin 
reduced UACR and HbA1c albeit the effect on HbA1c was not stati stically different from 
placebo (Kohan et al 2014). All these doses were well-tolerated  in this population and the 
saxagliptin dose of 2.5 mg is currently in the approved label f or treatment of subjects with 
moderate or severe renal impairment. Dapagliflozin 10mg once da ily was chosen because the

33(127) overall safety has not been different from 5mg once daily and t he long term albuminuria 
lowering effects are thought to be more robust. Because the ant i-glycemic effect of 
dapagliflozin vanes with decreasing GFR, HbA1c is the primary e ndpoint in the dapagliflozin 
+ saxagliptin arm and secondary in the dapagliflozin arm. 
Patients will be randomized to 24 weeks treatment with dapaglif lozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 
mg plus saxagliptin 2.5 mg or matching placebo. The study will be an international multi-
centre study at approximately 100 centres in North America, EU & ROW. It is planned to 
randomize a total of 450 patients (150 patients per treatment a rm). The study is powered to 
detect a difference of 0.42% in mean HbA1c and 35% difference i n UACR between active 
treatment and placebo following [ADDRESS_472673] inadequate glycemic co ntrol on their existing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
This double-blind, randomized phase II/III study requires a pla cebo group to determine 
efficacy of dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin in  a specific patient segment in 
order to discriminate effects caused by [CONTACT_377610] m effects caused by [CONTACT_209790]. All patients in the study are protected from harm by r escue criteria, which call for 
withdrawal from the study if the patient shows evidence of inad equately controlled disease. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_094]-enrolment anti-hypergly cemic therapy 
(long/intermediate-acting and mixed insulin regimen, metformin- based regimen, sulfonylurea 
(SU)-based regimen, thiazolidinedione (TZD)-based regimen, and other regimen.  
Any patients on metformin treatment need to have a dose suitabl e according to local 
guidelines and investigator’s judgement for the targeted CKD se gments (i.e., eGFR – 25-75 
ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_472674] formula or specific formulas for Ja panese and 
Taiwanese see 5.2.1). The study consists of a 2-week screening period, a 4-week single-blind 
placebo lead-in period, a 24-week double-blind,  placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 3-
week follow-up (FU) period. The study drugs are taken once dail y in the morning. The main 
efficacy assessments will be performed at regular intervals and  will include HbA1c, UACR, 
weight, waist circumference, FPG, seated BP and heart rate. Dur ing the double-blind 
treatment period, HbA1c and urinary glucose values will be blin ded to the Investigator and to 
the Sponsor. These values will be provided to the Investigator after the study has been 
completed. FPG value will be reported as an un-blinded value th roughout the study. The main 
safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and w ill include physical 
examination, vital signs, orthostatic reaction, renal function (change in s-creatinine), safety 
laboratory test, and AE monitoring. 
1.2 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment  
Risk category 
Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin have global market approval and h ave been administered to 
thousands of T2DM patients. Details regarding potential risks a ssociated with administration

Date 18-Sep-2017 
34(127) of dapagliflozin once daily and saxagliptin once daily are prov ided in respective Investigator’s 
Brochures. 
Considering dapagliflozin’s and saxagliptin's mechanism of acti on, the previous clinical 
experience with these compounds, the study’s design features (i ncluding the inclusion, 
exclusion, and discontinuation criteria), and the planned safet y procedures, participation in 
this study presents a minimal, and thus acceptable, risk to the  individual patients that will be 
included.  
Potential risks 
Details regarding potential risks associated with administratio n of saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for each medication.  
Dapagliflozin:  
Inhibition of SGLT2 results in increased urinary glucose excret ions, which is commonly 
believed to increase the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs ). In some of the global Phase III 
studies, events of UTI were reported in a slightly higher propo rtion of dapagliflozin-treated 
patients than the placebo group. Increased urinary glucose excr etion may also lead to an 
increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_377566]. In global Phas e III studies, the proportions of 
patients treated with dapagliflozin who reported AEs that match ed a predefined list of Medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) preferred terms t hat were indicative of genital 
infection were higher than those seen for placebo. 
Based on the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin and results o f animal and clinical studies, 
there may be a potential risk for this compound to cause hypovo laemia or electrolyte 
imbalance. Severe hypovolaemia can cause hypotension, reduced r enal perfusion and, in worst 
cases, acute renal failure. As a precaution, patients who, in t he judgment of the Investigator, 
may be at risk for dehydration or volume depletion due to co-ex isting conditions or 
concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics, should have ca reful monitoring of their 
volume status. In patients already receiving dapagliflozin who develop conditions that may 
cause hypovolaemia or electrolyte imbalance, decisions to inter rupt or discontinue 
dapagliflozin therapy and management of patients should be base d on clinical judgment. 
Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormali ties of hyperphosphatemia 
were reported in dapagliflozin vs. placebo but the clinical mea ning of this is unclear. 
Hepatic laboratory markers were assessed in all the clinical st udies with dapagliflozin. In the 
pooled analyses, the proportion of patients with elevated liver  function tests was similar in the 
dapagliflozin and comparator groups and no clinically meaningfu l or consistent mean changes 
from baseline in liver function tests were observed in the dapa gliflozin and placebo groups 
across the Phase IIb and III clinical studies. One patient had a SAE reported as drug-induced 
acute hepatitis that was later diagnosed as most comparable wit h autoimmune hepatitis. 
There have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis, includin g diabetic ketoacidosis, in 
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus taking dapagl iflozin and other SGLT2

35(127) inhibitors, although a causal relationship has not been establi shed. Dapagliflozin is not 
indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes me llitus. 
 
Patients treated with dapagliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with 
ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malai se, and shortness of breath, 
should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose leve ls are below 14 mmol/ (250 
mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinuation or tempor ary interruption of 
dapagliflozin should be considered and the patient should be pr omptly evaluated. 
 
Predisposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta-cell fu nction reserve resulting from 
pancreatic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreati tis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin 
dose reduction, reduced caloric intake, or increased insulin re quirements due to infections, 
illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be u sed with caution in these 
patients. 
 
No study procedure will put patients at a risk beyond those ord inarily encountered during the 
performance of routine medical examinations or routine tests. 
Saxagliptin:  
Prior to approval, saxagliptin was evaluated in 6 pi[INVESTIGATOR_377567], randomized, double-blind 
controlled trials. The majority of adverse events (AEs) reporte d in clinical studies have been 
of mild intensity and few have required treatment discontinuati on. Post approval, the 
cardiovascular safety of saxagliptin was evaluated in [ADDRESS_472675] of care, saxagliptin neither r educed nor increased the risk of 
the primary composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarcti on (MI), or ischemic stroke 
(Scirica et al 2013). However, in subgroups analysis, increased  risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377568].  
Joint pain (arthralgia) was reported during post marketing use of saxagliptin, as well as other 
m e di ci n es  f rom  th e  s am e  m e di ci n e  g rou p  (D P P 4  i n h ibi tors ).  P a ti e nts experienced joint pain 
which could be severe in some cases. Some patients experienced relief of symptoms when the 
medication was discontinued.  Some patients experienced recurre nce of symptoms when 
restarting the same or another DPP4 inhibitor medication. 
 
Protection against risks 
This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place  so as to monitor and 
minimize any of the potential health risks to participating pat ients. In order to ensure the 
safety of all patients participating in this study, [COMPANY_008]  will conduct a real-time review of 
all safety information from all ongoing clinical dapagliflozin studies as they become available. 
Safety signal detection will include the integration of all ava ilable sources of safety 
information, including clinical study data, AE reports, pre-cli nical data, epi[INVESTIGATOR_377569], to identify and characterize un recognized safety risks or changes 
Clinical Study Protocol

36(127) in those which are currently expected Adverse Drug Reactions. A ny information that may 
affect the benefit-risk profile of dapagliflozin will be immedi ately communicated to relevant 
Health Authorities and appropriate actions will be taken regard ing the clinical program as 
needed. Thus real-time, active safety surveillance will be cond ucted during the entire duration 
of this study. In addition, all dapagliflozin studies are subje ct to a carefully designed patient 
risk management plan that includes the temporary and if necessa ry permanent discontinuation 
of investigational product (IP) in individual patients in whom a potential health risk or a 
laboratory abnormality of clinical concern has been identified.  
Potential benefits to patients 
All patients will receive counselling on dietary and life-style  modifications. Global phase II 
and phase III studies have established the effect of dapagliflo zin and saxagliptin therapy on 
glycemic control. This phase II/III study will evaluate these e ffects of dapagliflozin and 
dapagliflozin together with saxagliptin in T2DM patients with C KD. In addition, dapagliflozin 
is expected to help decrease body weight (or prevent weight gai n) as well as help lower BP 
especially in patients with elevated baseline BP. Patients are also expected to receive some 
benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when pa rticipating in study procedures, 
which includes at least [ADDRESS_472676]. 
Conclusion 
Considering the pre-clinical and clinical experience with dapag liflozin and saxagliptin and the 
precautions included in the study protocol, participation in th is study presents a minimal and 
thus acceptable risk to patients who meet the inclusion and non e of the exclusion criteria and 
consent to take part in the study.  
1.3 Study Design  
This is an exploratory phase II/III study in patients with CKD (eGFR= 25-75 
mL/minute/1.73m2), type 2 diabetes mellitus with micro- or macroalbuminuria (ur ine 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 30-3500 mg/g). The study is randomized, double-blind, 
placebo controlled and parallel group designed, multi-national,  multi-centre study to evaluate 
pharmacodynamics of dapagliflozin 10 mg once daily (od) and dap agliflozin 10 mg once daily

The sections and tables listed below define the lack of glycemi c control criteria for initiation 
of open-label rescue medication. 
Protocol-Defined Lack of Glycemic Control Cr iteria for Initiation of Open-Label Rescue 
Medication 
Pre-specified glycemic criteria (see Table 1 below), based upon  central laboratory FPG and 
confirmatory, repeat FPG, have been established during the 24 w eek treatment period, starting 
at Week 4 and up to Week 24 visits, to determine eligibility fo r open-label rescue medication 
initiation/titration. Table 1 Lack of Glycemic Control Criteria for Initiation of Ope n-Label Rescue 
Medication 
Visit Label Central Laboratory FPG 
From Week 4 to Week 12 (excluding week 12)  FPG > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)  
From Week 12 to Week 24 (excluding  Week 24)  FPG > 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)  
 
Patients with a central laboratory FPG value meeting the lack o f glycemic control criterion at 
a pre-specified visit will be scheduled for a follow-up visit ( within 3 - 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory FPG value and review the patient’s gl ucose meter readings. If the 
repeat central laboratory FPG value still meets the criterion, the patient will receive rescue 
medication. 
Irrespective of study visit number, patients who meet rescue cr iteria in the treatment period 
must first complete the Week 24 visit procedures (within 5 days  whenever possible) before 
being rescued to ensure that important trial endpoint measureme nts are collected. 
Followin g completion of the Week 24 “Rescue” visit, rescued patients wi ll be administered 
open-label rescue medication in addition to their blinded study  medication. Rescued patients 
will then continue in the treatment period according to their o riginal visit schedule. Patients 
who received a first rescue medication, who subsequently fulfil  lack of glycemic control 
criteria, may have other rescue medications added or substitute d, according to Investigator 
judgment, without repetition of rescue visits.

study (i.e., investigational product and assessments – see Section 3.11), without prejudice to 
further treatment.  A subject that decides to discontinue inves tigational will always be asked 
about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events.  If  possible, they will be seen and 
assessed by [CONTACT_39595](s).  Adverse events will be followe d up (See Section 6); << diary 
cards, questionnaires (e.g., for patient reported outcomes) >> and all study drugs should be 
returned by [CONTACT_423]. 
All patients who discontinue study drug will be asked to remain  in the study for FU and 
complete all scheduled study visits through Week 27. At the tim e of discontinuation the Week 
24 (Visit 9) procedures will be performed. Patients will then c omplete all scheduled study 
visits and procedures. Patients unable or unwilling to return f or scheduled visits as part of 
follow-up will have the opportunity to receive follow-up via te lephone calls placed by [CONTACT_377615]. The only e xception to this procedure is 
when a patient withdraws consent for all study procedures or lo ses the ability to consent freely 
(i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the trea tment of either a psychiatric or 
physical illness).

3.11.2  Withdrawal of the informed consent 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (inves tigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. 
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any adverse events (AE).  The Investigator will follow up AEs o utside of the clinical study.  
If a subject withdraws from participation in the study, then hi s/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be repl aced.

throughout the study. Every effort will be made to ensure that the patient continues to return to 
the clinic for study visits and to avoid “lost to follow -up” during the conduct of the study. The 
study staff should make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_1962] w ho fail to return for study visits 
by [CONTACT_377616], patient’s health professionals, and any other means that 
comply with country and local laws and regulations. After the f irst missed visit, patients who 
are considered temporarily lost to follow-up will have [ADDRESS_472705] patient s. 
 
3.12 Discontinuation of the study 
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], tr ial subjects are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:

4. STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES  
4.1 Study flowchart details 
At Visit 1 patients will be screened for an HbA1c (HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤11.0%), eGFR level 
(eGFR 20-80 mL/minute/1.73m2,) and micro- or macroalbuminuria (UACR 30 – 3500 mg/g). 
Patients who meet these criteria will be enrolled and further e xamined for all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. At Visit 2 (start of lead-in visit), patien ts will be examined for lab panel. If 
the eGFR value is 25-75 mL/minute/1.73m2 at Visit 1 or Visit 2 and all other inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria are met, the patients will enter  a 4-week single-blind placebo 
lead-in period. At Visit 3, patients who meet all of the inclus ion and none of the exclusion 
criteria at Visit 1 and 2 spaces will be randomized to the 24-w eek double-blind placebo-
controlled treatment period. The prescription of anti-diabetic and anti-hypertensive drugs, 
(including diuretics) should be kept constant throughout the en tire 4-week lead in period. At 
randomization, patients will be stratified according to pre-enr olment anti-hyperglycaemic 
therapy. 
After either completion of the treatment period or permanent pr emature discontinuation of 
study medication, patients will enter a 3-week safety and susta ined efficacy follow-up period 
without study medication. The follow-up visit (Visit 10 (FU)) p rovides the opportunity to 
further evaluate changes in physical signs, symptoms or laborat ory parameters that may be 
related to dapagliflozin with/without co-administration of saxa gliptin. The total planned study 
duration from Visit 1 to the safety follow-up (Visit 10) will b e 33 weeks. 
Summary scheme for inclusion based on HbA1c, eGFR and UACR

average of the three BP and pulse readings will be used. 
5.2.6 Other safety assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-monitored blood glucose and hypoglycemic events 
The patients will be asked to check their blood glucose when th ey develop symptoms 
suggestive of hypoglycemia and to record specific symptoms in a  hypoglycemia/blood 
glucose diary. Any results collected in the diary will be revie wed by [CONTACT_377626]. The investigator is responsible for questioning the pati ent about all symptoms reported 
in the diary and for determining if they meet the clinical defi nition of hypoglycemia. Only 
symptoms and/or blood glucose values that meet the definition o f hypoglycemia should be 
reported on the hypoglycemia eCRF pages see Section 6.3.8. Gluc ometers will be provided by 
[CONTACT_38227]. 
Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_377627] a hypoglycemic 
event. Hypoglycemic events must be recorded in the diary anytim e a patient experiences 
either of the following: 
x Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (regardless of blood glucose  value by [CONTACT_330951]) 
x Blood glucose value by [CONTACT_25877] <63 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L) (reg ardless of 
symptoms). 
x Data to be collected for each hypoglycemic event: 
x Date and time of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (start and stop) 
x Whether symptoms were present, and list of symptoms 
x Possible contributing factors 
x Whether a finger stick value was obtained, and if so, the plasm a glucose value

x Time of last meal and its contents 
The patient diary will be reviewed and added to the patient’s s ource record. A new diary for 
the next period will be handed over to the patient if needed 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatic events (Hepatic Adjudication Committee) 
An independent Hepatic Adjudication Committee, blinded to the t reatment of the patients, will 
determine the probability that drug-induced liver injury (DILI)  is the cause of liver-related 
abnormalities, including, but not limited to: 
x Hepatic events timely related to death (within 30 days before d eath) 
x AST and/or ALT >3x ULN and TB >2x ULN (within 14 days of the AS T and/or 
ALT elevation);  
x AST and/or ALT >10x ULN 
A separate Adjudication Manual will define and describe the pro cedure for the handling, 
reporting and classification of these cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Asymptomatic bacteriuria 
The following is presented to assist in the classification and management of asymptomatic 
bacteriuria in studies with dapagliflozin. It is not intended t o supplant investigators clinical 
judgement. 
During enrolment, treatment and follow up of patients in this s tudy, the investigator may 
discover a patient with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the 
presence of ≥105 colony forming units/mL of bacteria, in a prop erly collected voided urine 
specimen, without signs or symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_377580] (UTI). 
Asymptomatic bacteriuria is prevalent among diabetic women, and  is associated with pyuria 
in 70% of cases. Neither guidelines from the US (Nicolle et al 2005, US Preventative Services 
Taskforce 2008 (USPSTF 2008)) nor 
Europe (European Association of Urology 2014 (EAU 2014)) recomm end screening for, or 
treatment of, asymptomatic bacteriuria in non-pregnant diabetic  patients. In this study, the 
central laboratory will report urinary dipstick test results fo r haemoglobin but will not 
routinely report the results of urinary dipstick tests for leuk ocyte esterase as a screening test 
for pyuria in surveillance urine examinations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Microscopic Haematuria 
In the event that haematuria is observed during a patient’s par ticipation, the spon sors 
recommend standard of care in diagnosing the cause of the haema turia. This section presents 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D1690C00023Edition Number 6.0

83(127)references and an example of standard of care evaluation of mic roscopic haematuria. Local
standards of care should be followed.
Patients with repeated reports of microscopic haematuria in [ADDRESS_472718] of care. The American
Urological Association defines microscopic haematuria as three or more red blood cells per 
high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two or mor e properly collected 
urinalysis specimens (Grossfeld et al 2001). These Best Practic e guidelines have been 
evaluated by [CONTACT_377628] a study of 772000 patients (Jung et al 201 1).
Patients who show microscopic haematuria that is accompanied by  [CONTACT_377629], red 
blood cell casts, or dysmorphic red blood cells in the sediment  should be evaluated for the 
presence of primary renal disease and need to be referred to a nephrologist (AUA, Grossfeld 
et al 2001).
Patients who lack other explanation for their haematuria, or wh o have risk factors for 
significant urologic disease, will need a urological evaluation  and should be referred to an 
urologist. Risk factors for significant urological disease incl ude unexplained microscopic
haematuria as well as smoking history, occupational exposure to  dyes or chemicals (such as 
benzenes or aromatic amines), visible haematuria, age >40 years , previous urologic history, 
history of irritative voiding symptoms, history of UTI, analges ics or phenacetin abuse, history 
of pelvic irradiation, or cyclophosphamide use (Greenwood M 192 6). Results from any 
procedure or investigations should be reported on the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Volume Depletion
The risk of electrolyte abnormalities, volume depletion, and im paired renal function is 
enhanced when two diuretics are used in combination. For this r eason, caution should be 
exercised when administering dapagliflozin, which has a modest diuretic effect, to patients 
who are taking loop diuretics. These patients should have caref ul monitoring of electrolytes, 
volume status, and renal function. Loop diuretic dose adjustmen ts should be made if clinically 
indicated.

x Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
x Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with norm al activities) 
x Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activi ties) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_255737] 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious .  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE un less it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE w hen it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.

Adverse Event, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you  consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’  
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other me dication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study proc edure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes’.  
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is foun d in Appendix B to the CSP. 
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_377630]: “Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?”, or revealed by [CONTACT_167613] n will be collected and recorded 
in the CRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis  is known and there are other 
signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis,  the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.

If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated  with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associate d laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible  the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaem ia versus low Hb value). In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant dete riorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s). 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical find ing at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an  AE.

6.5 Overdose 
Overdose is defined as >100 mg for dapagliflozin or >40 mg for saxagliptin per day. 
Dapagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 500 mg per day in single dose testing 
in healthy volunteers and up to 100 mg per day in repeat dose t esting for 14 days in healthy 
volunteers and patients with T2DM. If an overdose is suspected,  monitoring of vital functions 
as well as treatment as appropriate should be performed 
x An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis /symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module. 
x An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the  Overdose CRF 
module. 
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the cours e of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZe neca representatives 
immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_472727] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive m edication. Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should  be reported and handled as

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY [CONTACT_76383] 
8.1 Statistical considerations 
Multiplicity due to the two active treatment groups will be con trolled by a Bonferroni 
adjustment, such that statistical significance will be determin ed according to a two-sided alpha 
level of 0.025. Within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 1 0 mg treatment group the 
control of the alpha level in the testing of both co-primary en dpoints (the percent change in 
urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to 24 we eks and the change in HbA1c 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require that each achieves stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints.  Within the dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha 
level for the primary endpoint (the percent change in urine alb umin-to creatinine ratio (UACR) 
from baseline to 24 weeks) will require the achievement of stat istical significance at the 0.025 
level for a claim of superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of 
secondary endpoints. Parallel sequential testing strategies wil l be used for comparing each 
active treatment group to placebo for the secondary endpoints.

to detect a difference of 0.42% in mean change from baseline in  HbA1c between 
saxagliptin/dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo and, sepa rately dapagliflozin treatment 
group and placebo at significance level of 0.025, using a two si ded alpha and assuming a 
standard deviation (SD) of 1.0%. Assuming 5% of the subjects do  not have a post-baseline 
assessment, a total of 450 subjects (150 subjects per treatment  group) need to be randomized.  
The estimated sample size of 142 subjects per group will also yi eld 92% power to detect a 
35% difference in UACR for each comparison at an alpha level of  0.025, assuming a SD = 
80%.  Based upon existing pooled data for dapagliflozin in trea ting patients with eGFR <60 
ml/min/1.73 m2on ACEi/ARB the minimal detectable difference for this study is  0.27% for 
HbA1c and 21% for UACR
The significance level used to infer statistical significance f or comparisons of primary and 
secondary endpoints will be 0.025, representing a two sided alp ha level. Within the 
saxagliptin 2.5 mg + dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the co ntrol of the alpha level in the 
testing of both co-primary endpoints (the percent change in uri ne albumin-to creatinine ratio 
(UACR) from baseline to 24 weeks and the change in HbA1c from b aseline to 24 weeks) will 
require that each achieves statistical significance at the 0.02 5 level for a claim of superiority to 
placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparison of secondary  endpoints.  Within the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment group the control of the alpha le vel for the primary endpoint 
(the percent change in urine albumin-to creatinine ratio (UACR)  from baseline to 24 weeks) 
will require the achievement of statistical significance at the  0.025 level for a claim of 
superiority to placebo, and to proceed to a sequential comparis on of secondary endpoints.   
Parallel sequential testing strategies will be used for compari ng each active treatment group to 
placebo for the secondary endpoints.  In all analyses p-values will be represent two-sided tests, 
and will not be adjusted for multiplicity. 
8.3 Other statistical considerations
If superiority of is demonstrated within the saxagliptin 2.5 mg  + dapagliflozin 10 mg 
treatment group the for each of the two primary endpoints (HbA1 c and percent change from 
baseline UACR) at the 0.025 level and/or within the dapaglifloz in 10 mg treatment group the 
for the primary endpoints (percent change from baseline UACR) a t the 0.[ADDRESS_472738].  Superiority of a  treatment to placebo will be 
inferred if statistical significance is demonstrated and greate r improvement occurred with that 
treatment than placebo.

104(127)8.6 Methods for statistical analyses
Analyses on the variables shown below will only include measure ments obtained prior to or 
on the date of rescue medication for some analyses.  For other efficacy variables and 
exploratory variables, measurements after rescue medication wil l not be excluded from the 
analyses.
-Change from baseline in HbA1c (%)
-Change from baseline in FPG (mg/dL)
-Proportion of patients with HbA1c < 7%
Further details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis P lan (SAP).
8.6.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
The analysis of the change in HbA1C from baseline to Week 24 wi ll be based on a repeated 
measures model (RMM) including all scheduled time points follow ing randomization up to 
and including week 24. The analysis of percent change from base line in UACR from baseline 
to Week 24 will be conducted on the log-transformed UACR values  using RMM.  Separate 
RMM models will be used to compare saxagliptin/dapagliflozin wi th placebo, and to compare 
dapagliflozin 10 mg alone with placebo.  RMM represent a longit udinal repeated measures 
analysis using ‘direct likelihood’, and include patients in the  Full Analysis Set who have a
baseline measurement and at least one post-baseline measurement . Analyses on HbA1c will 
only include measurements prior to the administration of rescue  medication. Measurements 
made following rescue administration will not be included in Hb A1c analysis. 
The SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used for primary analyses.  The primary analysis 
models will each include the fixed categorical effects of treat ment, week, randomization C

well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement  and baseline measurement-
by-week interaction. (In UACR analyses the natural logarithmic transformation will be 
applied to baseline UACR values prior to analysis.)  An unstruc tured matrix for the within-
patient error variance-covariance will be used. The denominator  degrees of freedom will be 
calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method. A number of b ack-up models will be 
defined in the statistical analysis plan in case of non-converg ence of the preferred model or 
other issues.  
Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the mean chang e in HbA1c within each 
model for each treatment group as well as the difference in mea n change between the 
saxagliptin/dapagliflozin treatment group and placebo will be c alculated. P-value of the 
differences in Week 24 estimates between saxagliptin/ dapaglifl ozin and placebo will be 
calculated. For UACR, point estimates and 95% confidence interv als for the mean percent 
change in UACR within each treatment group will be obtained by [CONTACT_377634], and differences in mean percent change will be simil arly calculated. P-values of the 
differences in Week 24 percent change estimates between each tr eatment group 
(saxagliptin/dapagliflozin and, separately, dapagliflozin 10 mg  only) and placebo from each 
model will be calculated. 
8.6.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) 
Comparisons of the secondary efficacy endpoints between dapaglf lozin [ADDRESS_472743] for the primary UACR endpoin t is significant. Secondary 
efficacy endpoints will only be compared between saxagliplin/da pagliflozin and placebo will 
only be performed if each comparison of both co-primary endpoin ts is significant.  If 
statistical significance is achieved as prescribed above, then the secondary endpoints will be 
compared between that treatment (those treatments) and placebo in the order specified in 
Section 2.2. A sequential testing procedure will be employed fo r secondary comparisons in 
order to control the type I er ror rate at the 0.025 leve l.  Sta tistical comparisons between each 
treatment and placebo will be only performed for a given second ary endpoint if all previous 
sequential tests for that comparison are also significant. Othe rwise, the testing procedure will 
stop at the secondary endpoint that does not reach statistical significance.    
The secondary endpoints percent change from baseline in total b ody weight at Week 24, 
change from baseline in FPG at Week 24, change from baseline in  seated SBP at Week 24, 
and change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 (Dapagliflozin 10 mg) will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_377635], as described for the primary analyses.   
The secondary analyses of proportions for subjects with at leas t a 30 percent reduction in 
UACR from baseline to Week 24 and, separately, proportions for subjects with an HbA1c of 
less than 7 percent at Week 24 will be analyzed using a logisti c regression model with 
adjustment for randomization strata and baseline measurement.

12.1 Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) 
Life threatening 
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of de ath from the AE as it  
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the pr oduct would result in the patient’s  
death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in  a more severe form it 
might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without he patic failure). 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377602] a se rious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_255689]/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention 
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in decidin g whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediatel y life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability or incapacity but may jeopar dize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_377603]; medical 
judgement must be used. 
x Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requirin g iv hydrocortisone 
treatment 
x Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose r equiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine 
x Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm 

12.2 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question 
When making an assessment of causality consider the following f actors when deciding if there 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1690C00023 Edition Number 6.0 
Date 18-Sep-2017 
120(127) is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused b y the drug.  
x Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually  received the 
suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relatio nship to the 
administration of the suspect drug? 
x Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with  the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties? 
x De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopp ing or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug? 
x No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_377645], other drugs, other host or envi ronmental factors. 
x Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected dr ug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not n ormally 
recommend or support a re-challenge. 
x Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if perfo rmed) has confirmed 
the relationship. 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: 
x Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug? 
x Is there a known mechanism? 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the rel evant data, there is evidence for a  
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the ind ividual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to c onvey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available da ta including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insuf ficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not r elated’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION (IATA) 6.[ADDRESS_472755] Samples 
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classif ies biohazardous agents into 3 
categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infec tious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) i n the 46th edition (2005).  
Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  There 
is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-thr eatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus: 
x Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instructio n 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatiti s A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2.  They are ass igned the following UN

 1 Introduc tion and Background  
1.1 Rationale for the Study 
Approximately  4.8 to 6.4 million Americans, comprising 30- 40% of the U.S. diabetic 
population , exhibit symptomatic diabetic peripheral neuropathy  (PN) (Harris, Eastman et 
al. 1993; Martyn and Hughes 1997; Apfel  1999) . The prevalence may be as high as 50% 
in diabetics over 60 years of age. Up to 20% of the elderly population may be affected by 
[CONTACT_160603] (PN) (Harris, Eastman et al. 1993; Ric hardson and Ashton- Miller 
1996) ; and  epi[INVESTIGATOR_585305] 
(Richardson, Ching et al. 1992; Richardson and Hurvitz 1995) and decreased stability while standing (Geurts, Mulder et al. 1992) as well as  when exposed to external postural 
perturbations (Inglis, Horak et al. 1994). Consequently, there is a need for developi[INVESTIGATOR_585306]- effective interventions for improving mobility  and balance to manage fall risk  in the 
elderly (Rubenstein, Robbins et al. 1990; Studenski, Duncan et al. 1991; Province, Hadley et al. 1995) and  other clinical populations (Richardson, Ching et al. 1992; Richardson and 
Hurvitz 1995). Walkasins
®, a lower limb sensory prosthesis that replaces lost foot pressure 
sensation with vibrotacti le feedback around the lower calf, can address this need.  
 
A growing body of research has investigated the use of vibrotactile feedback to enhance 
balance control following short -term use. Vibrotactile displays have been used 
successfully by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Navy to provide navigational cues that allow blindfolded pi[INVESTIGATOR_585307] (Rupert 2000; Rupert 2000). Sensory substitution devices to aid balance have provided auditory (Chiari, Dozza et al. 2005; Dozza, Chiari et al. 2005; 
Dozza, Chiari et al. 2005; Dozza, Horak et al. 2007), electrotactile (Tyler, Danilov et al. 2003) , and vibrotactile feedback (Wall, Weinberg et al. 2001; Wall, Merfeld et al. 2002; 
Wall and Weinberg 2003; Wall, Oddsson et al. 2004).   More recent work has demonstrated the util ity of vibrotactile feedback to improve postural 
control in patients (Horak, Dozza et al. 2009; Wall, Wrisley et al. 2009; Horak 2010; Wall 2010; Wall and Kentala 2010). None of these technologies, however, have been based on the measurement of foot pressure , nor have they been intended to be worn on a 
continuous basis as a balance prosthetic device (Statler, Wrisley et al. 2007, Wall 2012). In addition, c urrent devices typi[INVESTIGATOR_1435] a lab  engineer on hand to ensure functionality.  
1.2 Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effects of Walkasins  use on clinical 
and subjec t-reported outcomes of balance and gait function, quality of life, social 
activity/participati on, pain, and medication use in persons with peripheral neuropathy who 
experience balance problems. The i ntent is to pool data from up to six sites for use in 
submission to CMS for Walkasins  HCPCS code application.  
 In addition, because peripheral nerve deterioration diminishes the quantity and quality of 
afferent feedback to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_68418], this chronic progressive disease process is associated with structural changes in the brain that include reduced cortical grey matter 
volume and decreased cortical thickness within the primary and secondary 
walk2Wellness Study   Confidential and Proprietary

Version 8.0  Page 6 of 38 07/30/2019  
 somatosensory cortices (S1 and S2) and their connected neural networks  (Selvarajah et 
al. 2014 ). Rocca et al. (2014) further  demonstrated that individuals with mild- to-moderate 
PN, as compared to healthy controls, exhibit less resting- state functional connectivity 
within the somatosensory network as well as between the somatosensory network and 
other brain networks, including those responsible for attention and motor planning. Long-term use of Walkasins, which increase movement -related afferent feedback from the 
lower -extremity to the central nervous system, thus hold great promise to induce beneficial 
changes to brain structure and function. We will , therefore , conduct an exploratory study 
in which up to ten subjects w ho are interested and eligible for MRI brain scans will 
complete such scans at baseline and after [ADDRESS_769590] expected realistic everyday use of Walkasins .  
 Over a 10 -week period of continuous Walkasins
 use, subjects will show a sustained 
improvement of their Functional Gait Assessment (F GA) of at least 4 (the Minimally 
Clinically Important Difference or MCID , Beninato et al. 2014) compared to their initial 
assessment. W e will specifically examine whether a linear multiple  regression model  and 
discriminant analysis  based on initial baseline assessment data can help predict those 
patients who show a sustained long- term improvement of their FGA ≥4. 
 Over the extended long- term use reflected at [ADDRESS_769591] that subjects who show a short -term improvement in their FGA 
(≥4) with Walkasins on during the initial assessment session (“responders”) will have a 
statistically significant sustained long- term improvement in their FGA scores compar ed to 
subjects who don’t show a short -term benefit  (“non -responders”) . We hypothesize that 
“non- responders” will require longer exposure to the Walkasins sensory stimulus and that 
they will show an improvement of their FGA by [CONTACT_2669] 4 at the 10- week assessment 
compared to baseline testing.

Version 8.0  Page 7 of 38 07/30/[ADDRESS_769592] results , Timed Up and Go  
(TUG) results , and patient -reported outcomes that will be examined for trends over time.  
We expect to see trends of increasing gait speed, increased 4-Stage Balance Test  times , 
and lower times in the Timed Up and Go assessment . We also expect to see trends of 
improvement in subject -reported outcomes  that reflect comments from a recent case st udy 
of a patient using Walkasins  on a long- term basis (> 12 months), including increased 
participation in social and physical activities, higher self -confidence in balance- related 
activities , and less interference of pain in activities of daily living.  
2.4 Rationale for the Selection of Functional Outcome Measures  
• Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) : The FGA is a reliable and valid measure of gait 
function related to postural stability and has been shown to be effective in classifying 
fall risk in older adults and predicting unexplained falls in community -dwelling older 
adults (Wrisley, Marchetti et al. 2004; Wrisley and Kumar 2010). It has also been validated in stroke survivors (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010) and patients with Parkinson’s disease (Leddy, Crowner  et al. 2011) ; and it has less floor and ceiling effect than the 
Dynamic Gait Index (Lin, Hsu et al. 2010). The FGA includes a 10- item scale where 
each item is scored from 0 to 3 (3  = normal, 2  = mild impairment, 1  = moderate 
impairment, 0 = severe impairm ent). The maximum score is 30.  An increase ≥ 4 is 
considered the MCID  for community -dwelling elderly individuals (Beninato et al. 2014).  
• 10-Meter Walk Test (10MWT) : The 10m -walk (Perera, Mody et al. 2006) is routinely 
done in rehabilitation and has excellent reliability in chronic stroke patients (Hiengkaew, Jitaree et al. 2012). In addition, gait speed has been found to be an 
important predictor of survival in older adults (Hardy, Perera et al. 2007), further 
emphasizing its importance as a clinical outcomes measure. Gait speed (10- meter 
walk using the middle 6 meters) will be assessed under two conditions: 1) instructed to walk at normal speed and 2) instructed to walk as fast as they can. A difference of 0.10m/sec is defined as the MCID (Perera, Mody et al . 2006).  
• 4-Stage Balance Test : The [ADDRESS_769593] protocol for balance function (STEADI, http://www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/[ADDRESS_769594] -a.pdf ). It includes four gradually more challenging postures the 
subject is exposed to:  1) Stand with feet side by [CONTACT_10167].  
2) Stand with feet in semi -tandem stance.  
3) Stand with feet in tandem stance.  
4) Stand on one leg.  
Subjects pass each level  if they can hold the stance for [ADDRESS_769595] the time for each of the tests.

Version 8.0  Page 8 of 38 07/30/2019  
 • Timed Up and Go  (TUG) : The TUG is also part of the CDC -recommended STEADI 
test protocol for balance function ( https://www.cdc.gov/steadi/pdf/STEADI -
Assessment- TUG -508.pdf ). From a seated position in a standard armchair, the subject 
is asked to  do the following :  
1) Stand up from the chair.  
2) Walk to a line on the floor [ADDRESS_769596] normal pace.  
3) Turn.  
4) Walk back to the chair at normal pace.  
5) Sit down again.  
The tester will record the time taken from the command “Go” until the subject sits down 
again.   
2.5 Justification for the Design of the Clinical Investigation  
In a recent study  at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System  (MVAHCS)  on short -term  
(a few hours) use effects of Walkasins  in individuals with peripheral neuropathy (PN) and 
balance problems , the study team  found an average increase in Functional Gait 
Assessment (FGA) score of 4.4±3.7 when subjects used Walkasins versus an increase of 
1.5±1.2 when they did not.  
 The main objective  of the current study is to show a long- term  (10 weeks) sustained 
improvement in FGA score ≥4 following Walkasins  use as compared to initial baseline 
assessment and to examine a potential relationship between initial baseline assessment 
data and long- term outcome . We believe  our finding of a short -term FGA change >[ADDRESS_769597] of two parts  for each leg: the leg unit and the foot pad (Figure 1). The 
leg unit wraps around the lower leg of the user a nd contains electronics for reading foot 
pad pressure signals, a microprocessor, and four vibrating motors that provide gentle tactile sensory cues to the front, back, medial, and lateral surfaces of the user’s leg. These cues reflect real -time foot pressure information at a location above the ankle where skin 
sensation is still present. The leg unit has a power button, two status LEDs, and a reset button (not shown in Figure 1). Power is supplied by a rechargeable internal battery. The foot pad is a thin c onsumable sole insert that can be cut to size to fit into a regular shoe. 
The foot pad connects to the leg unit through a physical cable.

Figure 1 . 
3.2 Regulatory Classification  
Walkasins  meet the regulatory definition of a non-significant  risk device because  they do 
not meet the definition for a significant risk  (SR) device .  
 
Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that:    
• Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Is for  a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or  
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. ( https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/  
UCM126418.pdf)  
 As a non -significant risk device, Walkasins  . . .
  
• Are worn on the foot and leg and are not intended as an implant , and they do not 
present a potential for  serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• Are not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life, nor do they present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; 
• Are not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, nor do they pr esent a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject in this regard;

Version 8.0  Page 10 of 38 07/30/2019  
 • Do not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject. (In the case study described below, the subject reported no adverse events during his long- term use of Walkasins.)  
3.3 Clinical Data Published to Date  
The f ollowing data from a study at the M inneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System 
(MVAHCS)  were  recently published by  a peer -reviewed journal.   Thirty -one subjects met 
inclusion criteria and were included for allocation. Twenty -seven of these subjects had a 
diagnosis of PN in their medical record, described as diabetic neuropathy (n = 14), idiopathic/unspecified neuropathy (n = 8), or neuropathies possibly related to alcohol dependence (n = 4) or b12 vitamin deficiency (n = 1). Exposure to agent orange was noted 
in the medical record of eight subjects.  
 No significant carryover effect based on sum of FGA scores across the three assessments was found (p = 0.92, [62]). Fig [ADDRESS_769598] OFF- then-ON. Larger changes in FGA score were seen when the device 
was turned ON, i.e., from Assessment #1 to Assessment #2 for the ON -then-OFF group 
and from Assessment #2 to Assessme nt #3 for the OFF -then-ON group. The ON -then-
OFF group maintained their FGA score during their device OFF treatment at Assessment #3 (Fig 4). The OFF -then-ON group showed an improved FGA score during their device 
OFF session at Assessment #2.  
 
 
 At Assessment #2, 10 of 15 subjects (67%) in the group wearing the device turned ON 
improved their FGA score by [CONTACT_585313] 5 of 16 (31%) in the group wearing the device turned OFF. The difference in proportion between the groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). At Assessment #3, 7 of 16 subjects (44%) in the group 
wearing the device turned ON improved their FGA score by [CONTACT_585314] 2 of 15 subjects (13%) in the group wearing the device turned OFF. The difference in proportion between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.063).

Version 8.0  Page 11 of 38 07/30/[ADDRESS_769599] treatments. Consequently, 17 of the 31 subjects (55%) improved their FGA score by [CONTACT_585315] 7 of 31 subjects (23%) when the device was 
OFF. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.001) and the effect size was near large (Hedges’ g
av = 0.79, [67]).  
 All outcomes showed statistically significant improvements after ON treatments with large effect size for FGA scores, medium for 4- Stage Balance and small for gait speed [67]. The 
average change in FGA score after ON treatment was 4.4 points versus 1.5 points during the OFF treatment. The difference was statistically significant (p<0.01) and the effect size was large (Hedges’ g
av = 0.82). After OFF treatment, only the FGA score showed a 
statistically significant increase although the effect size was small (Hedges’ g av = 0.24) 
compared to the ON treatment (Hedges’ g av = 0.82). No statistically signific ant changes 
were seen for gait speed or 4- Stage balance test after OFF treatment.  
 
The table below s hows the overall effects on outcomes following both the ON and OFF 
treatments combined for all subjects (i.e., between Assessment #1 and Assessment #3) 
following exposure to two balance training sessions, one with the device turned ON and one with the device turned OFF. After Assessment #3, [ADDRESS_769600] 0.13 m/s of their normal gait speed compared to Assessment #1. Fourteen of the [ADDRESS_769601] for longer than 30 s after

mean within -subject FGA score changed from 15.2 at Assessment #1 to 21.1 at 
Assessment #3. The change was statistically significant (p<0.001) and the effect size was large (Hedges’ g
av = 1.14).

(p<0.001) and the effect size was large (Hedges’ g
av = 2.51). The remaining 15 subjects 
who were still at high fall risk (FGA<23) after Assessment #3 did increase their FGA score from an average of 11.9 to 16.8. The change was statistically signif icant (p<0.001) and 
the effect size was also large (Hedges’ g
av = 1.11) although less than half the magnitude 
of the normal fall risk group’s effect size. Mean normal gait speed increased from 0.93 m/s at Assessment #1 to 1.02 m/s at Assessment #3 (p<0.005). The effect size was medium (Hedges’ g
av = 0.41). Fast gait speed increased from 1.35 m/s to 1.42 m/s (p<0.05) 
representing a small effect size (Hedges’ g av = 0.22). The [ADDRESS_769603] 
performance increased from 22.2 s at Assessment #1 to 27.6 s at  Assessment #3 
(p<0.001), a medium effect size (Hedges’ g av = 0.70).  
 A majority of patients in the current study improved their clinical outcomes of gait and balance function after a brief session with a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. These findings suggest new sensory balance cues provided to the lower limb can modulate the activity of relevant nerve afferents and become integrated into sensorimotor control of balance and gait within a single therapy session.  
 Figure [ADDRESS_769604] long- term Walkasins use data available where a patient is wearing 
the device as a sensory prosthesis on a continual/chr onic basis. Most of the improvement 
noticed in the FGA score had occurred after 2- 3 months of daily use. This patient continues 
to use the device and has nearly maxed out in several clinical outcomes including the FGA (maximum score is 30).

 3.4 Risks to Subjects  
• Use of device/administration of physical stimuli: The device being tested may distract 
the subject while walking and increase the risk of falling. To prevent falling  during the 
testing in the clinic/research site, a spotter will walk next to the subject to help him/her 
regain balance if a fall starts to occur.   
• There is a very low chance that the subject will find the vibration uncomfortable. If this 
occurs, the subject can decide if he/she wishes to end participation in the trial.   
• Use of medical records : The Sponsor and/or research site personnel  may use the 
medical records to obtain information related to the cause of subjects’ peripheral 
neuropathy or other medical history relevant to the study. There is a risk that study 
personnel may inadvertently see other information in subjects’ medical rec ords. The 
researchers  will obtain HIPAA authorization for use of subjects’ medical records.  
• There may be other unknown side effects that could occur . 
3.5 Approaches to Minimize Risks  
All efforts will also be made to minimize potential risks by [CONTACT_354062] : 
• Investigators and study personnel will include individuals who are experienced in research and trained in the study assessments.  
• Clearly defined inclusion/exclusion criteria ensure only appropriate subjects are enrolled. 
• Maintaining subject safety through practices such as spotting the subject during study assessments will help to ensure subjects’ physical safety.  
• Regular  monitoring and onsite visits to investigational sites  will help to maximize 
consistency among the sites.  
3.6 Device Labeling  
Each Walkasins  leg unit and foot pad carry a label comprised of the item serial number 
and company details as required by [CONTACT_2371].  In addition, the plastic bags in which the devices  
are packaged  bear the following label : 
Caution:  Investigational Device. Limited by [CONTACT_142193] ([LOCATION_003]) to Investigational Use.  
3.7 Device Accountability, Storage, and Return   
The Sponsor will ship the investigational device ( Walkasins) only to the Principal 
Investigator  (PI) or designee at each site. The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_585308] i n the Device Accountability Log.  
 Device accountability records must be maintained at the study site and made available to RxFunction personnel or designees. The devices returned to the Sponsor and those 
devices dispensed at the study site will be recorded i n the Device A ccountability Log. The

Version 8.0  Page 14 of 38 07/30/[ADDRESS_769605] explain in writing the reasons for any discrepancy  noted in device 
accountability.  
 
When t he study is complete, any unused investigational devices will be returned to the 
Sponsor , and a completed Inventory Accountability Report  (or equivalent) will be 
generated for the site. The Inventory Accountability Report (or equivalent) will document 
the disposition of all investigational devices including those that have been returned to the 
Sponsor. Use of any investigational device outside of the protocol without prior IRB, Sponsor, and /or regulatory authority approval is strictly forbidden and may cons titute 
grounds for removal of the Investigator/site from the study . 
 All unused investigational devices must be returned to the Sponsor when the study  is 
complete. All investigational devices or any remaining components that are associated 
with a clinical device malfunction/failure must be returned to the Sponsor.

4.2. Subject Recruitment Plans 
The study team will post fliers at various locations  to advertise the study, and information 
about the study will be provided to clinicians who may provide patient referrals . Site 
personnel will provide an overview of the study to potential s ubjects and screen them over 
the phone to determine their eligibility for and interest in the s tudy. Research sites may 
use other recruitment methods, subject to IRB review and approval.  
4.[ADDRESS_769607] will remain in the study until completion of the required follow -up 
period; however, a subject’s participation in any clinical study is voluntary , and the subject 
has the right to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefit. Reasons for 
withdrawing subjects include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Subject ’s death  
• Subject ’s voluntary withdrawal  
• Subject ’s withdrawal by [CONTACT_585317]  
• Subject  lost-to follow -up  
 The reason for subject discontinuation will be documented on the CRF and source 
documents  as appropriate. The Principal I nvestigator must also report all subject 
withdrawals  to his/her IRB as defined by [CONTACT_1201]’s  procedure.  
4.[ADDRESS_769608] to clarify whether he/she  wishes to withdraw from all components of the trial or 
only from the primary interventional component of the trial  (i.e., wearing th e Walkasins  
device). If the latter, research activities  for which the subject previously gave consent may 
continue (e.g., follow- up data collection activities  for adverse events such as falls) .

requirements . They will be asked at each visit to provide the calendar or an 
account /estimat e of the number of days they wear/have worn their Walkasins to help 
ensure compliance with the study protocol. In addition, researchers will also ask subjects 
to mark  falls on the same calendar to facilitate collection of this data point.  
4.[ADDRESS_769610] to answer questions to verify that he/she  understand s the study.  
 
After the consent discussion, all subjects will sign and personally date the Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved forms indicating their consent to participate in the study and to allow the study team to use their data (explained in the consent and HIPAA documents). 
The signed consent document will be stored in the subject’s medical record, per local site requirements, and a copy of the signed consent form will be given to the subject.  
 
When a consent form is not signed or properly dated before the procedure, the Investigator 
must inform the local IRB and the Sponsor of this deviation, per the IRB’s  requirements. 
The Sponsor has the responsibility to inform the regulatory authorities  as required . 
5.3 Screening Visit  
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the trial at the time they sign the consent form and HIPAA authorization. After enrollment into the study, subjects will be tested to determine whether they can perceive vibration from the Walkasins leg unit. (Subjects who are unable to feel the vibration of the device will be excluded from continued participation in the study.)

Version 8.0  Page 17 of 38 07/30/2019  
 Subjects who can feel vibration from the Walkasins leg unit will then complete a medical 
history form to assess common health issues related to neurological, musculoskeletal, 
and cardiopulmonary disorders as well as other systemic diseases and information on falls. 
 They will also undergo a brief assessment of their functional gait that includes the following 
tasks: 
• Gait with Narrow Base of Support: Subjects will walk on the floor with arms folded 
across the chest, feet aligned heel to toe in tandem. The number of steps taken in a 
straight line are counted for a maximum of 10 steps.  
• Gait with Eyes Closed: Subjects will walk at thei r normal speed for 20 feet with their 
eyes closed.  
• Gait Level Surface: Subjects will wa lk 20 feet at their normal speed (time f or 20’). 
• Gait with Horizontal Head Turns: Subjects will walk [ADDRESS_769611] screening form. Subjects who are interested and eligible for t he MRI 
will be scheduled for an MRI visit  (Visit 1A) as well as a separate visit to assess the acute 
effects of Walkasins  (Visit 1B) . Subjects who are eligible for the study bu t uninterested 
and/or ineligible for an MRI will be scheduled only for the visit  to assess the acute effects 
of Walkasins.  
5.4 Baseline Visit: 1A  
Structural and functional MRIs will be acquired using the following sequences:  
 Structural MRI Acquisition: We will acquire three- dimensional 1 mm isotropic T1 MPRAGE 
(TR=2530 ms, TE=3.04 ms, TI=800 ms, flip angle=10°, FOV=256x256x220 mm) that will be averaged during post -processing and 1 mm isotropic T2 (SPACE) images (TR=4000 
ms, TE=406 ms, flip angle=90°, FOV=260x228x176 mm). T1 and T2 images will be used for co -registration of individual par ticipant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
data into a standard stereotaxic space and for ascertaining changes in cortical thickness, cortical and sub- cortical brain volumes using Freesurfer (Patenaude et al. 2011).  
 Functional MRI Acquisition: Functional network organization will be evaluated with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs -fMRI). Echo planar imaging data will be 
acquired with slices in an oblique 30- degree orientation relative to main magnetic field to 
optimize sign al in ventral frontal regions (TR=2000 ms, TE=30 ms, flip angle=90°, 
FOV=220x220 mm, 3.4x3.4x3.5 mm2 voxels). We will collect one 13- minute scan to 
maximize test -retest reliability (Birn et al.). During resting- state scans, participants will be 
instructed to keep their eyes open, relax, and remain awake. Preprocessed time- series 
data will be extracted from spherical regions of interest (10 mm) and cross -correlated with 
every voxel in the brain to establish functional connectivity maps for relevant neural

squares in FSL with thresholding set at Z=2.33 and cluster correction of p<0.05.  
5.5 Baseline Visit : 1B 
Subjects who meet all the eligibility requirements during the screening visit will return for the baseline visit.  
 They will begin by [CONTACT_585318]:  
• Concomitant Medications Log: Study staff will review the subject’s current medication list and record the medication names, indications, dosages, etc . in REDCap Cloud.  
• Activities -Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Questionnaire : Powell and Myers (1995) 
developed the Activities -specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale to detect levels of 
balance confidence in elderly persons. The ABC scale is a one- page questionnaire 
that asks questions about balance confidence when performing 16 different tasks.  
• Vestibular Activities of Daily Living Scale (VADL) : The VADL was developed to assess 
self-perceived disability in individuals with vestibular impairment. It evaluates the 
effects of vertigo and balance disorders on independence in everyday activities of daily living . (
https://www.sralab.org/rehabilitation- measures/vestibular -disorders -activities -
daily-living -scale ) 
• Falls Efficacy Scale -International (FES -I): The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES -
I), a 16- item questionnaire,  measures an individual’s  “fear of falling” or “concerns about 
falling .” It is suitable for use in research and clinical practice. ( https://sites . 
manchester.ac.uk/fes -i/) 
 Next, subjects will be assessed using the monofilament test and vibration (tuning fork) 
test. Then subjects will don the Walkasins device, and their baseline scores on the FGA, 
10MWT, TUG, and 4- Stage Balance Test will be assessed.  (If subjects score >22 on the 
FGA, the accepted cut -off score for high risk fallers, they will be excluded from continued 
participation. )  
 Then  subjects  will complete the following self -reported outcome measures : 
• Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9): The PHQ -9 is a concise, self -admin istered tool 
for assessing depression. It incorporates DSM -IV depression criteria with other leading 
major depressive symptoms into a self -report instrument that is  commonly used for 
screening and diagnosis.  (http://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/  
practice- settings/assessment/tools/patient -health.aspx)  
• Pain Interference Short Form 6b:  The PROMIS Pain Interference instruments (adult 
and child) measure the self -reported consequences of pain on re levant aspects of a 
person’s life and may include the extent to which pain hinders engagement with social, cognitive, emotional, physical, and recreational activities. The Pain Interference short form is universal rather than disease- specific. ( https://cde .drugabuse.gov/instrument/  
0a47fbff -5f72-2281 -e050 -bb89ad4358ae)  
walk2Wellness Study   Confidential and Proprietary
_____________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version 8.0  Page 19 of 38 07/30/2019  
 • Pain Intensity Form 1a:  The PROMIS Pain Intensity instrument assesses how much a 
person hurts. The Pain Intensity short form is universal rather than disease  specific. 
(https://www.assessmen tcenter.net/documents/PROMIS%20Pain%20Intensity%20S
coring%20Manual.pdf ) 
• Ability to Participate Short Form 8a:  The PROMIS Ability to Participate in Social Roles 
and Activities assesses the perceived ability to perform one’s usual social roles and 
activities . Items are worded negatively in terms of perceived limitations, but responses 
are reverse -coded so that higher scores represent fewer limitations (better abilities). 
The measure does not use a time frame (e.g. over the past seven days) when 
assessing abil ity to participate in social roles and activities.  (https://www.assessment 
center.net/documents/PROMIS%20Ability%20to%20Participate%20in%20Social %20
Roles%20and%20Activities%20Scoring%20Manual.pdf ) 
• Satisfaction with Participation in Social Roles Short Form 8a:  The PROMIS 
Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities item s assess satisfaction with performing 
one’s usual social roles and activities (e.g., “I am satisfied with my ability to participate in family activities”).  (https://www.assessmentcenter.net/documents/PROMIS%  
20Satisfaction%20with%20Participation%20in%20Social%20Roles%20Scoring%20Manual.pdf  
 Subjects will then be randomized by [CONTACT_331858] (Han et al. 2009) to one of two study  
groups  to balance the two groups during the baseline assessment with respect to the FGA 
score, age, and use of an assistive device. (N ormal use  of an assistive device  is permitted, 
but not during any clinical assessment .) 
 Subjects randomized to Group A will initially be trained on the Walkasins  Learning Protocol  
(a set of standardized standing and walking balance exercises ) and  tested with Walkasins  
turned on ; then following a 60- minute break, Group A subjects  will be trained  on the 
Walkasins  Learning Protocol  and tested with Walkasins  turned off.  The second group 
(Group B) will initially be trained  on the  Walkasins  Learning Pro tocol  and tested with the 
Walkasins  turned off ; then following a 60- minute break, Group B subjects will be trained 
and tested with the Walkasins turned on.  (See Figure 5 below for protocol design .) 
 During testing, subjects will complete trials of the FGA, [ADDRESS_769613]. (A trained member of the study team will conduct these assessments at the research sites.)  
 When s ubjects have completed the clinical assessments and subject -reported outcome 
measures,  the researchers will train the subjects on how to use the device at home (e.g., 
how to charge the device and what to do if they encounter any problems). The subjects will then leave the site with the device for use at home  and a calendar on which to mark 
their daily use of Walkas ins
 as well as any fall events .

5.7 Follow -up Visits   
Subjects  will be assessed at the research site at Weeks 2, 6, 1 0, 26, and 52 , following the 
assessment schedule above. (Subjects will wear their Walkasins devices [turned on] for 
all functional assessments during the follow -up visits.) All the assessments are the same 
as those completed during the baseline visit, except that at Weeks [ADDRESS_769617] s information 
concerning the subjects’ experience with their Walkasins.  
 
Between in- person visits, study sites will contact [CONTACT_585319] 10 and 26 (e.g., Weeks 14, 18, 22) and between Weeks 26 and 52 (e.g., Weeks 30, 35, 40, and 45) to remind them of study requirements and to collect follow -up 
information regarding health changes, adverse events, pain scores, device usage, and device functioning. If subjects report adverse events and/or falls during these contacts, site personnel will record the details on the appropriate CRFs in REDCap Cloud.  
 Subjects’ levels of physical activity or inactivity while wearing the device will also be measured through an internal step counter in Walkasins. At each scheduled follow -up visit, 
the step data will be directly downloaded from the Walkasins. (This is a hardwired connection with the processor in the device and downloading counters in the memory for “load- cycles” [steps] and how many times the vibrator motors have been active. It will be 
downloaded to a company laptop and later entered in REDCap Cloud. There will be no 
subject identifiers on the laptop other than the subjects’ ID numbers and the corresponding counts.)  If subjects encounter any issues with their Walkasins during the at -home trial, they may 
call the customer service number at RxFunction, Inc. (Subjects will receive a contact [CONTACT_585320]’s customer service number on it.) They will be instructed to call the number and tell the RxFunction representative that they are participating in a research

 study. (They will not be required to give th eir name [CONTACT_585331].) RxFunction, Inc., will assist subjects in troubleshooting their devices and may 
ask for the subject’s ID number or a serial number for the device. If the problem cannot be resolved during the phone call, RxFunction, Inc. will inform the study designee at the site and provide the serial number; the designee will ship or provide new Walkasins devices to the subject.  If acceptable to the participating institution,  RxFunction may also ship the 
device directly to the subject with his or her permission.  
 Subjects who complete an MRI at baseline will be scheduled  for an additional MRI visit at 
Week 26. Unscheduled visits may occur for device replacement  or other reasons  as 
needed.

available on the website of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute  
(https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health- topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/study -quality -assessment- tools ). Therefore, we 
plan to recruit up to 25 subjects (at each site) who must pass the eligibility  criteria to enter 
the study (20/0.8=25).  
6.3 Control of Systematic Error/Bias  
Potential subjects may be recruited from the Investigators ’ usual patient load or from 
individuals who initiate contact [CONTACT_585321] a recruitment flier  or being 
referred by a clinician . All individual s having signed the Informed Consen t Form and 
meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be  eligible for randomization in the study. The 
reasons for exclusion (i.e., for subjects  who sign an informed consent form but are not 
randomized) will be indicated on th e appropriate CRF in REDCap Cloud . Thus , 
consecutively eligible subjects will be randomly allocated into the study, minimizing 
selection bias.  
 To control for inter -observer variability, the Sponsor will provide training to the research 
teams.

 6.4 Interim Analysi s  
No formal interim analyses are planned for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_585309].  
6.5 Analysis Plan  
The outcome measures of this study include changes in subjects’ FGA scores  and 
10MWT , TUG , and 4- Stage Balance Test  times . Using a within -subject parametric 
statistical model, we will compare baseline measures from the first study visit to post -
training outcomes .  
 
We expect that subjects who show a short -term improvement in their FGA (>4) with 
Walkasins  on during the initial assessment session will also have a statistically significant 
sustained long- term improvement in their FGA scores compared to subjects who do no t 
show a short -term benefit. We will use regression analysis to investigate trends in changes 
over time in the different outcomes.  
6.[ADDRESS_769620]-hoc analysis will be conducted at 10 weeks  on clinical outcomes betw een 
short -term “responders” vs. “non -responders .” The recent short -term study found that [ADDRESS_769621] 4 (responders) when 
using Walkasins. We hypothesize that “non- responders” who do not show immediate 
short -term improvement of their FGA score require longer exposure to the Walkasins  
sensory stimulus and that they will show an improvement of their FGA by [CONTACT_2669] 4 at the 
10-week  assessment compared to baseline testing.  
6.7 Exploratory Analysis of MRI D ata  
Statistical analysis related to MRI data will be performed using IBC SPSS Statistic 19 for Windows with alpha set at p<0.05. Repeated- measures analysis of variance with time 
(baseline, 24- week follow -up) will be used to examine potential changes in brain structure 
and function associated with long- term Walkasins usage. Separate models will be used 
for each dependent variable, which will include cortical volume and cortical thickness of the somatosensory network, as well as the strength of resting-sta te functional connectivity 
within this network. Effects of covariates, including age, sex, and average daily Walkasins 
use, will also be explored. Using linear regression analysis, we will also investigate 
whether observed changes in structural and functional brain outcomes are predictive of functional improvements associated with Walkasins usage over the same  time period.

8 Safety and Adverse Events 
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can , therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product whether it is related to the study product. Elective procedures for a pre -existing condition are not considered AEs.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  An im portant medical event that may not result in death, 
be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based 
upon appropriate clinical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and/or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
walk2Wellness Study   Confidential and Proprietary
_____________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version 8.0  Page 26 of 38 07/30/2019  
 If the adverse event meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse 
event.  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body 
structure or a body function  
• An important medical event that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) :  An adverse device effect is defined as any adverse effect 
that is related or whose relation to the study device is unknown.  
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect  (SADE) : Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of 
the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances had been less opportune.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) : Unanticipated adverse device effect 
includes  any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or 
death caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
8.2 Classification of the Event’s Relationship to the Device 
Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an investigational product or device caused or contributed to an AE is primarily determined by [CONTACT_585325] t able below . Determination sh ould be 
based on assessment of temporal relationships, biologic plausibility, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, and presence (or absence) of a more likely cause.  
  Definitions for determination of the relationship include the following:  
 
walk2Wellness Study   Confidential and Proprietary
_____________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
Version 8.0  Page 27 of 38 07/30/[ADDRESS_769625] relationship between the AE and the 
study device.  
Probable  The AE is likely related to or caused by [CONTACT_19911]. There is no 
other likely explanation  for the event.  
Possible  The AE could be related to or caused by [CONTACT_19911]; however, 
there is no evidence establishing a link/relationship. The subject’s 
condition or concomitant therapy could have caused the AE.  
Unlikely  It is improbable that the AE is related to the study device. There is no 
evidence that the study device caused the reported event (e.g., the AE 
can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s condition or other 
cause/concomitant therapy or the temporal sequen ce between the 
study intervention and the AE is such that the relationship is 
improbable).  
Unrelated  There is no relationship between the study device and the AE.  
8.[ADDRESS_769626] during the 
study. All adverse events (AEs) reported by [CONTACT_423], observed by [CONTACT_737], and/or documented in medical records will be recorded on the adverse event CRF , 
whether believed by [CONTACT_585326]. Beginning with study enrollment, any new event/experience that was not present 
at baseline or worsening of an event present at baseline is considered an adverse event.  
 All adverse events will be followed until they are adequately resolved or stabilized. Serious 
adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects will be collected and monitored

9  Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
9.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The Sponsor ’s designee will monitor the study over its duration according to the pre-
specified monitoring plan. RxFunction will employ centralized monitoring as often as feasible to verify site compliance with the study protocol as well as G ood Clinical Practice 
(GCP) standards.  Although centralized monitoring will be the company’s primary method 
of site monitoring, RxFunction will conduct onsite monitoring visits as necessary and will notify sites at least one week in advance of an onsite visit.   
 The study monitor may  inspect all study documents and records that are maintained by 
[CONTACT_737]/site, including medical records (office, clinic , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , for the subjects 
in this study. The Investigator/site will permit access to such records. Source documentation must be available to substantiate proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedures, adequate reporting and follow -up of adverse events, 
accuracy of data collected on case report forms, and device information.  
 The Investigator and/or research coordinator will be available for monitoring visits. It is expected that the Investigator will provide the study monitor with a suitable working environment for review of study -related documents.  
9.[ADDRESS_769629] be available to respond to reasonable requests and queries made during t he quality assurance assessment process  or 
regulatory inspections .

 9.3 Protocol Deviations  
It is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that there are no deviations from the protocol 
in full compliance with all established requirement s of the IRB. The Inv estigator will not 
deviate from the protocol for any reason except in cases of medical emergencies when the deviation is necessary to protect the life or physical well -being of the subject.  
 
All deviations must be reported to the Sponsor  within five business /working  days  of their 
discovery . In subject -specific deviations from the protocol, the Protocol Deviation CRF will 
be completed. The occurrence of protocol deviations will be monitored by [CONTACT_16015]. Investigators will inform their IRB of all protocol deviations in accordance with their IRB ’s reporting policies and procedures.  
 
If an Investigator does not comply with the Investigator Agreement or protocol, the Sponsor will notify the Investigator of the site’s non- compliance. Continued non-
compliance may result in further escalation in accordance with the Sponsor’s or its designee’s standard operating procedure (SOP).  
9.4 Criteria for Suspending/Terminating a Study Center  
RxFunction reserves the right to stop the enrollment of subjects at a study site  at any time 
after study initiation if enrollment is significantly slower than expected or if the center has 
multiple or severe protocol violations without justification or fai ls to follow remedial actions.  
 
Possible reasons for suspending/terminating a study center include:  
• Failure to obtain IRB approval  
• Failure to obtain written Informed Consent  
• Failure to report SAE s/UADE s to RxFunction within two business days  of knowledge 
• Failure to complete case report forms in a timely manner  
• Loss of (or unaccounted for) investigational product inventory

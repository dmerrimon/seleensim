Catheter 
Placement  During catheter placement, an MNeuro clinical field specialist will be available 
to support the accurate assembly, placement, priming and testing of the system 
prior to beginning study therapy.  
Fluoroscopy is required for catheter placement and as such it is expected to be 
performed in an IR/OR with preservative free saline available from the site to adequately prime the system.  
Consent may be obtained prior to aneurysm securement to allow for catheter placement immediately following clippi[INVESTIGATOR_605817] i
n the same IR/OR session.  
Alternatively, consent may be obtained following aneurysm securement to ensure the patient continues to meet I/E criteria prior to enrollment or if 
applicable due to LAR availability.   In this scenario, the subject must be brought back to the IR/OR in a separate session.  T he catheter must be placed   
≤48 hours from ictus.  
Neurapheresis 
Therapy  The study catheter can remain in -dwelling for up to 72 hours (± 4hr) in treated 
subjects during which study therapy can be completed .  Neurapheresis therapy 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163490] five (n=5) 
treated subjects enrolled under this protocol, will  have a maximum of 36 hours 
(± 4hr) of Neurapheresis therapy (pump time)  allowed during the 72 hours (± 
4hr) of catheter in -dwelling. 
 
Following positive DSMB review of the safety data from the first  five subjects, 
the remaining up to n=9 treated subjects (for a study total of N=30 Treated 
Subjects) will have no limit on maximu m therapy time and instead be limited 
only by [CONTACT_837793]-dwelling time of 72 hours (± 4hr). 
 
If the DSMB does not agree that it is safe to remove the Neurapheresis therapy 
limit after review of data from the first ten subjects, the maximum of 36 hours ( ± 
4hr) of Neurapheresis therapy (pump time) will remain in place for the 
remaining  subjects.  
Neurapheresis 
Surveillance  Following aneurysm securement and prior to initiating study  therapy, a head CT 
is required to establish safety for  beginning study therapy as well as provide a 
baseline to which the follow -up CTs may be compared.  This may be done 
following catheter placem ent but needs to be done in a department scanner.   
Subjects will be monitored regularly during study therapy according to 
institutional SOC for Neuro ICU monitoring with additional protocol 
requirements as defined below.   Protocol required neuro monitori ng should 
begin following catheter securement. The catheter can remain in -dwelling for up 
to 72 hours (± 4hr ) in Treated Subjects during which study therapy can be 
performed .   
• Intracranial pressure ( ICP), Glasgow coma score ( GCS ), Lumbar 
pressure and Peripheral checks performed hourly (± 1hr) while the 
catheter is in -dwelling  
• CSF Sampling every 8 hours while the catheter is in- dwelling  
• Venous blood sample will be taken at 36 hours and 72 hours or end of 
catheter in -dwelling (± 4hr) 
To ensure the pressures are accurately obtained, the system will be paused 
temporarily for completion of each study-required neuro check.  If the lumbar pressure reads below 4.4 mmHg (6.0 cmH2O), the Investigator will be notified 
for review of clinical symptoms and syst em data prior to re-starting therapy 
unless a pre- defined treatment plan has already been directed by [CONTACT_737].  
If the ICP recorded at a study -required neuro check is higher than the lumbar 
pressure at the same neuro check.  The system should remain paused until the 
ICP is equal to or lower than lumbar pressure for at least two consecutive neuro 
checks and the Investigator has approved restarting the system.  
Additionally, at 36 hours and 72 hours or end of catheter in -dwelling (± 4hr), a 
head CT will be required. The CT s must be taken using a department scanner 
and will be used to compare to the baseline CT and document the amount of 
blood removal from the basal cisterns for the primary endpoint.  
Additional data related to the clinical status of the subjects will be collected 
throughout study therapy such as the development of complications or study 
adverse events.  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163491] but will be required to terminate under the following conditions: 
• Brainstem herniation  
• Lower extremity paralysis  
• Subdural spi[INVESTIGATOR_626858]  
• Subdural hematoma or hygroma  
• Abnormal gram stain  
• Re-bleeding event requiring intervention e.g., re-coiling, re- clip  
• Subject previously extubated requires new or re-intubation 
• ICP is greater than Lumbar pressure at five consecutive study- required 
neuro checks  
• Subject requires inversion (such as Trendelenburg position) 
 
If study therapy must be terminated early (prior to 72 hrs of catheter in-
dwelling), a head CT within (± 4hr) of catheter removal must be obtained to 
document the final amount and location of blood within the basal cisterns to allow for comparison to baseline.  
 The subjects ’ EVD should be clamped upon beginning study therapy and remain 
closed unless ICP goes above [ADDRESS_1163492] of care, subjects will 
continue on the prescribed medical and physical therapy regimen as directed by 
[CONTACT_837794].

2.  Introduction  
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( aSAH) is a catastrophic neurological condition occurring 
as the result of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm. There are roughly 30,[ADDRESS_1163497]- aneurysm securement,

                                                                          Page 11 of 54 
 
ranging from vasospasm2,3,4  and stroke to hydrocephalus5 resulting in  the need for permanent 
shunting of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF).  T he lasting effects of these complications  can be 
devastating, possibly resulting in permanent dis ability and even death.  Thus, there remains a 
significant unmet need to reduce complications and improve outcomes for these patients. 
Other common complications of SAH include the following;6,7,8 
• Re-bleeding of the rupture  
• Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) 
• Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) 
• Seizures and epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  
• Cardiac dysfunction  
• Systemic inflammatory response syndrome  (SIRS ) 
• Cerebral edema  
The treatment  for aSAH has evolved from an established standard  of care  (SOC)  craniotomy to 
clip the aneurysm , to less invasive image guided techniques of endovascular coil placement to 
pack and exclude the aneurysm  from circulation .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_837742], 
the cited c linically significant comorbid state  remains unchanged regardless of the therapeutic 
technique.  It is posited that this state of transient  compromised  cerebral circulation , is related to 
spasmogenic substances  e.g., cytokines, generated during the lysis of hemorrhagic  cells9 that then  
taint the CSF.  Early removal of blood and blood products (e.g. hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and 
downstream inflammatory proteins)  from the CSF has been shown to reduce the incidence of 
vasospasm, stroke, hydrocephalus and shunting, and result in a shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]10.   
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT study uses an  extracorporeal  investigational pump and filtration system with an  
investigational double lumen catheter for the rapid removal of red blood cells ( RBC’s ) post SAH . 
The system removes the  hemorrhagic CSF, filters out RBCs and lysed by-products and returns the 
filtered CSF to the subarachnoid space  (SAS)  via the same catheter .  Minnetronix Neuro 
(MNeuro) calls this tailored process of the filtration  and return of CSF “ Neurapheresis™ ” Therapy 
which is based on blood plasma filtration or “Apheresis.” The active removal of degrading RBC’s  
and their released cytotoxic by- products can be accomplished more efficiently  with Neurapheresis 
Therapy than with a standard, passive ventricular or  lumbar drain  (LD)  which are often  indwelling 
for up to 10 days.

4.1 Objective  
The objective of this study is to further demonstrate safety and characterize effectiveness of the 
Neurapheresis™ System  (extracorporeal system and catheter ) to remove red blood cells (RBCs) 
and lysed blood by-products from hemorrhagic cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) following aneurysmal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).   
4.2 Scale and Duration 
The Study will enroll N=30 “Treated” subjects, as defined by [CONTACT_760] .  The study will be 
performed  at up to [ADDRESS_1163505] assessments and data 
collection at enrollment, during catheter placement and  Neurapheresis procedure, 2 days (±1 
days) , at Neuro ICU discharge and 30 days (±3 days) post removal of the catheter .

5.6 Informed Consent  
The Sponsor will provide to each center, an FDA approved Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
template which may be edited to include center specific language or compliance requirements.  
The Sponsor and Institutional Review Board (IRB) must approve any changes to the form prior to 
use for consent of a patient.  A central IRB, Western IRB (WIRB), will be utilized for this study. Each enrolled subject must also consent to data transfers affected by [CONTACT_2373]; the center may use their own HIPAA consent form to document this data transfer. 
Informed Consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a patient voluntarily confirms their willingness to 
participate in the study after being informed of all risks and requirements.  Informed C onsent is 
documented by [CONTACT_3553] a signed and dated ICF.  Once the patient or their legally authorized 
representative (LAR) s igns and dates the ICF, the patient is considered enrolled in the study and 
becomes a study subject.  
Study enrollment without consent must be reported by [CONTACT_837801], to the IRB and the FDA.  Any 
violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities as appropriate.  
The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall:  
• Process of obtaining Informed Consent must be documented in the Subject’s m edical r ecord  or 
study binder,  
• Be conducted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_837769] ,  
• Include a description of all aspects of the clinical study that are relevant to the patient’s 
decision to participate throughout the clinical study, 
• Avoid any coercion of or undue influence of patient  to participate,  
• Not waive or appear to waive patien t’s legal rights,  
• Use native language that is non -technical and understandable to the patient  or his/her legal 
representative,  
• Provide ample time for the patient or LAR to consider participation and ask questions if 
necessary,  
• Ensure important new information is provided to new and existing S ubjects throughout the 
clinical study . 
The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_837802] C onsent process.   
If a LAR provides signatory authority, the subject shall be notified of the informed consent and 
study participation as soon as his/her medical con dition allows.   The original signed ICF will be 
retained by [CONTACT_71657] a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written information must be given to the subject or LAR signing the form.  
If new information becomes available that can signif icantly affect a subject's future health and 
medical care,  that information shall be provided to the  affected  subject(s) in written form via an 
amended informed consent form or other format as requested by [CONTACT_3904].  Further, i f

re-bleed , infection, CSF leak, changes in intracranial pressures, cognitive defects or poor 
neurological outcomes, other SAH complications and complications from associated  interventions 
(e.g., IA therapy, angiography) and death.   
The Study protocol does not prevent SOC for the management of SAH patients and utilizes well 
established techniques for lumbar puncture for diagnostic purposes, therapeutic applications or 
interventions.  Only Investigators trained in the management of SAH patients , the associated care 
pathways and/or placement and management of lumbar drains are included in this study.  Further, Investigators are trained on the Clinical Protocol to further minimize subject risks.

PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163517] inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria for the study.  Testing that is outside of SOC, cannot be performed until after a subject has been enrolled (i.e. written informed consent obtained).  Once the subject has been enrolled and it has been determined that screening criteria are met, the subject can be prepared for 
catheter placement.  If instead it is determined that a subject no longer meets study criteria after 
completing all screening assessments, they are to be withdrawn immediately and classified as an “Intent to Treat” subject.  Enrollment data collected to that point and the reason for study exit should be entered into the case report forms for submission to the sponsor.  
A screening CT is required to assess I/E criteria and is expected to be a SOC test for the diagnosis 
and treatment planning of aSAH.  If a subject has been transferred from another institution at which a CT was obtained, a new screening CT is not required provided that an electronic copy of the CT can be obtained from the referring institution.  It is expected that the volume of any 
identified mass lesions as noted in the study exclusion criteria will be calculated  using the standard 
of care formula
 used by [CONTACT_837805] . The formula should be based on the 
estimated volume of an ellipsoid (L × W × H × 0.52 (where 0.52 is an approximation for π/6).  
 Volume = A x B x C / 2 
• A = greatest hemorrhage diameter in the axial plane  
• B = hemorrhage diameter at 90º to A in the axial plane  
• C = originally described as the number of CT slices with hemorrhage multiplied by [CONTACT_837806], but can simply be substituted with the craniocaudal diameter of the hemorrhage where there is access to multiplanar reformats  
 A venous blood sample is also required for screening and to establish baseline values for certain inflammatory markers (platelets and white blood cells including neutrophils and lymphocytes).  Sample amounts should be based on site specific laboratory requirements for completion of tests 
including a Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differentials and a Comprehensive Metabolic 
Panel (CMP).   Current laboratory certificates are required by [CONTACT_837807] e upon request.  
7.2 Pre-Neurapheresis  Imaging (CT) Requirements  
As aneurysm securement (especially clippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) may change the amount of blood in the subarachnoid space, a CT is required following aneurysm securement but prior to beginning 
Neurapheresis.  This C T will serve as the Baseline CT (pre- Neurapheresis CT) which , along with 
the screening CTs, will be compared to the post- Neurapheresis CT s.   The Baseline CT is expected 
to be taken in a department scanner using optimal metal artifact reduction  settings  at the 
conclusion of aneurysm securement or following catheter insertion but prior to initiation of Neurapheresis therapy .  The baseline CT must be reviewed to determine safety, via intracranial 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163518] for the following criteria:  
• no evidence of re -bleeding;  
• no increasing mass effect ;  
• no effacement of the basilar cisterns ;  
• continued communication between the ventricles and subarachnoid space  
 
In addition to the CT requirements above, study therapy cannot begin for at least [ADDRESS_1163519].  
7.3 Heparinization/Anti- Platelet Guidance/Aneurysm Stability  
If Heparin is to be administered as a center SOC for a coiling procedure, study subjects must have 
a baseline Activated Clotting Time (ACT) drawn prior to administration of the initial heparin 
bolus.  An additional ACT must be checked prior to the Neuraphe resis catheter insertion. When 
the ACT reads baseline ±[ADDRESS_1163520]’s must be recorded on the case 
report form and are considered to be source documentation if not captured elsewhere in the medical record.     
If a subject requ ir
 es an additional platelet aggregation inhibitor e.g., Integrilin as part of the coiling 
procedure, the Investigator may wait to insert the Neurapheresis catheter but must initiate catheter 
insertion within the window of 48hours post ictus  and, coagulation is deemed safe to proceed.  
Subjects who are enrolled and do not meet these criteria of time or coagulation should be withdrawn and are classified as “Intent to Treat subjects”.  Documentation of adequate coagulation metrics is a protocol requirement reg ardless of method used to secure the aneurysm. 
 P
rior to proceeding with catheter insertion, the Investigator uses professional judgement to 
determine if the Subject and aneurysm is stable.  If stability is in question, the Investigator may wait to insert the catheter but insertion must still fall within the 48 hour from ictus time frame.   
7.4 Catheter Insertion  
The Investigator should be mindful of a history of lumbar or thoracic stenosis or any existing spi[INVESTIGATOR_837772].  Initial insertion of the investigational catheter is to be timed to be as close as possible to completion of the initial treatment/securement of the SAH but no later than [ADDRESS_1163521]-bleeding event.  Ideally, the catheter should be inserted 
immediately after  the coiling or clippi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]; see the previous Section for guidance 
concerning Heparin and anti- platelet administration.   Insertion of the Neurapheresis catheter is 
expected to have  a similar pain profile as that of lumbar drain  insertion and should be treated 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March 11 , 2020    
   
 
 
                                                                          Page 28 of 54 
 
accordingly.  It is recommended that adequate local anesthetic and sedation/analgesia is in place at 
the time of catheter insertion .  An MNeuro CFS  will be onsite to support the catheter placement 
and system prep.  
 The I nvestigator ma y choose the position which affords the most technical comfort level for 
insertion e.g., lateral decubitus  or prone ; there is no protocol requirement for positioning, but the 
position of the subject must be documented on the Neurapheresis CRF.  If the catheter placement 
occurs immediately following a clippi[INVESTIGATOR_124502], a C- arm and an OR table that can 
accommodate portable fluoroscopy  will be needed .  Continuous lateral  fluoroscopy is 
recommended during guidewire insertion to ensure that there is no loopi[INVESTIGATOR_837773].  Elapsed time to place the 
catheter is a required data item.  
Catheter insertion and system set up are to be performed according to the Instructions For Use (IFU).  While highlights of the insertion are included in this protocol, the current IFU should be referenced prior to and/or during each procedure.  Investigators delegated to perform catheter placement are required to acknowledge their review and understanding of the IFU prior to being 
approved to place the catheter.  The investigational catheter is expected to be inserted under 
fluoroscopic guidance using the t ools provided by [CONTACT_1034], however if the subj ect anatomy is 
unusual, use of different delivery tools e.g., guidewires, and access needles may be allowed.    Documentation on the case report forms will be required. 
To minimize t
 he risk of infection  and nerve damage,  insertion and placement of the catheter is 
limited to two ( 2) discrete events.  If the catheter cease s to function effectively e.g., positional 
migration , kink or clot, the Investigator may remove the catheter once and replace it with another 
catheter .  Subjects must be transported to an interventional procedure room  for catheter 
replacement; re -insertion may not  be facilitated at the bedside  with a C -arm.  The catheter change -
out is be performed according to the IFU.  If a catheter change out is needed , it is required that the 
system disposables are also replaced to mitigate the risk of infection e.g., meningitis.  Reconnecting to an existing  system would result in a protocol deviation.    
7.4.1 Catheter Insertion Highlights 
• Soak and flush catheter in preservative free saline prior to insertion 
• SOC patient prep, positioning and anesthesia for lumbar puncture 
• Insert epi[INVESTIGATOR_837774] (skin nick

• Remove the needle stylet and observe for CSF drainage , advance slowly until CSF is 
returned   
• A 5ml CS F sample to be taken from the needle 
o 3ml submitted for Cell counts with Differential and Chemistries  
o 2ml for biomarkers (cytokines) which must be stored in a -80o freezer until 
shipped to the core lab  
• An additional level or re -positioned attempt can be made if no CSF is returned 
• Do not perform excessive attempts to avoid potential complications such as CSF leakage, spi[INVESTIGATOR_837776]

• Remove epi[INVESTIGATOR_837777] 
• Using an OTW technique, advance catheter over the guidewire (with tension on the end of 
the guidewire to prevent further advancement  
• Upon reaching the guidewire tip, advance both the wire and catheter together until the catheter proxi mal inlet holes rest within the lumbar cistern (approximately L2-L3) 
• When the catheter is in position remove the guidewire  
   
If there is significant difficulty  in gaining access, placing or positioning the catheter, abort the 
procedure and dress the wound per SOC .  Those Subjects who have the procedure aborted due to 
an inability to gain access or obtain an acceptable position are classified as an “ Attempt to Treat” 
subject and are followed according to the protocol through [ADDRESS_1163522] em assembled and prepped either prior to 
or while the catheter is being placed  to minimize IR/OR time for the subject.  However, if the 
system is not prepped completely by [CONTACT_837808], Investigators or center staff should carefully join the male and female ends of the catheter together to form a sterile 
loop to avoid CSF leakage while waiting to connect the catheter to the system.  Do not overtighten 
the catheter hubs. The figure below demonstrates how to properly connect the catheter to maintain 
sterility of the catheter hubs.   
 
Figure 7: Temporary C onnection of the Catheter Male and Female End s 
Upon connection of the catheter to the system a flow test is required to ensure the connections are 
secure, the system has been appropriately set up and a flow loop has been established (refer to the IFU for proper system assembly and details on the required flow test).  F ollowing completion of a 
successful flow test, the catheter can be externally secured to the subject.  
7.4.2 Guidance- Securing the Catheter /Dressing the Wound 
Investigators are required to use a fixation device to  secur e the catheter  to the subject to eliminate 
catheter movement and pullout.  C ommercially available device s (StayFix by [CONTACT_837809]) will 
be provided by [CONTACT_837810].  The fixation device contains a dressing but the choice of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_11978] o intment is discretionary per the Investigator.  Center personnel may 
also shave any excess hair from around the insertion site to assist with skin preparation for the  
application of the fixation device.   Other institutional SOC surgical tape may be placed over the 
StayFix if preferred, however not underneath the StayFix. 

PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163523]’s abdomen or torso for easy access.   
 An ongoing dialogue with the MNeuro CFS  will assure that the exteriorized catheter is properly 
positioned to optimize system functionality , however, guidance is provided below .  
 
• Use the protocol required Stay -Fix device to dress the puncture wound site.  Ensure that 
the orientation of the cath eter and application of the dressing afford the least amount of 
bend/stress on the catheter (see Figure 8).  The catheter should be positioning snugly over 
the blue support pad before securement.  
  
 
 
Figure 8: Catheter Positioning within StayFix  
 
• On smaller patients, a single coil with the catheter is to be created  and may be secured 
with surgical tape . 
o While not required, previous Investigators preferred to cover the StayFix  and 
single catheter coil with Tegaderm™ or OpSite™.  
• For proper oversight of system functionality, it is imperative that the bifurcation (Y joint) and catheter luer hubs a re visible at all times.  
o As such, they should not be hidden under the bed sheets or t aped to bed rails   
• It is necessary and appropriate to have a lengthy “tail” on the catheter.   
o When positioning the tail , it is recommended to tape the catheter to the torso, with 
a loop of coiled tubing to act as strain relief (see Figure 9).   
o Ensure pl acement of the catheter does not create a pressure point if the subject 
should roll over or move . Chux or gauze may be placed beneath the catheter hubs 
to further protect the connections.  
• A second StayFix device may be used to further secure the coiled tubing to the patient’s 
abdomen (Figure 9).

The Sponsor will track change outs of the disposables and the rationale for each action.  Change-
outs dictated by a component behavior may require return of the affected component to the Sponsor for analysis for product development purposes.   
Change out of the OTB system disposables may be facilitated at the bedside; it is not necessary to 
return to the IR/OR,  subject transfer is left  to the discretion of the Investigator.  
When changing the system disposables,  Investigator will  disconnect the catheter from the system 
and join the two ends (male→female) forming a sterile loop that maintains the sterility of the 
catheter ends ( Figure 7) .  A sterile field should be established to connect the filter and flow 
assemblies and to facilitate priming of the system.  The MNeuro CFS  will guide center personnel 
in the catheter disconnection, component assembly, handing, and reconnection as  needed based on 
the components being replaced.   The IFU should also be referenced during this time for detailed instructions on disposable component replacement.

the system will be trained in the applicable information, techniques and troubleshooting.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_21869], Investigators and applicable site staff should refrain from making medical decisions 
based on any data point or trend displayed on the Neurapheresis system interface and instead 
continue to reply on SOC devices or data.  
The study catheter may remain in -dwelling for up to 72 hours (± 4hr) in treated subjects during 
which  study therapy can be completed.  Neurapheresis therapy will be incrementally extended 
during the study such that, the fi rst five (n=5) treated subjects  enrolled under this protocol will 
have a maximum of 36 hours (± 4hr) of Neurapheresis therapy (pump time) allowed during the 72 
hours (± 4hr) of catheter in -dwelling.

treated subjects (for a study total of N=30 Treated Subjects) will have no limit on maximum 
therapy time and instead be limited only by [CONTACT_837813]-dwelling time of 72 hours (± 
4hr). 
If the DSMB does not agree that it is safe to remove the Neurapheresis therapy limit after review 
of data from the first five  subjects  enrolled under this protocol , the maximum of 36 hours (± 4hr) 
of Neurapheresis therapy (pump time) will remain in place for the remaining  subjects. s.   
The sponsor will notify FDA, the IRB and clinical sites of the results from the DSMB review.   
The start of catheter indwelling time is the time of catheter securement completion .  The end of 
catheter indwelling time is marked by [CONTACT_837814] a total of 72 -hours 
(±4hrs).  Center personnel must document required catheter times in the case report forms and 
medical record source as applicable.   
Neurapheresis therapy start  time is documented when study therapy is initiated.  Therapy end is 
captured as the time the  pump is stopped to allow for catheter removal.  Study therapy will not be 
continuous for the 72- hours of catheter in -dwelling.  Pausing of therapy may be required for SOC 
activities and potential fluctuations in the clinical status of the subject.   The protocol also requires 
pausing of study therapy at the study required neuro checks and for study required CTs. 
7.5.1 Neurapheresis Therapy Rates   
Neurapheresis therapy will commence slowly at a nominal flow rate of 0.5mL/min.  to 
accommodate the volume of hemorrhagic CSF pooled in the lumbar cistern.  An increase of flow 
shall not occur until [ADDRESS_1163527] the flow rates to continuously optimize the Neurapheresis therapy based on system pressures.  The MNeuro CFS will be present while the system is in auto mode for system oversight.  During study therapy, the waste rate will be 
generally maintained within a range of 12- 15 mL/hr  as determined by [CONTACT_737].  However , 
at any time  the Investigator may choose to manually adjust the system waste rate based on subject 
status.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163528] meets any of the criteria below, Neurapheresis should be stopped immediately (if not 
previously stopped) and the subject should be scheduled for catheter removal.  
Change(s) in Subject conditions th at require Neurapheresis termination are:  
• Brainstem herniation  
• Lower extremity paralysis  
• Subdural spi[INVESTIGATOR_837779] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March 11 , 2020    
   
 
 
                                                                          Page 33 of 54 
 
• Subdural hematoma or hygroma  
• Abnormal gram stain  
• Re-bleeding event requiring intervention e.g., re-coiling, re- clip  
• Subject previous ly non-intubated /extubated  requires new or re-intubation  
• ICP is greater than Lumbar pressure at  five consecutive study- required neuro checks 
• Subject requires inversion (such as Trendelenburg position) 
As the MNeuro CFS will be on site during Neurapheresis therapy, the sponsor will be notified 
immediately if any subject has the Neurapheresis procedure terminated due to reasons above.  Source documents may be requested for the Sponsor to adequately review the termination. 
The Investigator may  pause the system or terminate  the procedure at any time.  The Subject also 
has the right to terminate the procedure at any time.   If study therapy must be terminated early, a 
head CT within (± 4hr ) of catheter removal must be obtained to document the final amount and 
location of blood within the basal cisterns to allow for comparison to baseline.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163529] (CFS)   
MNeuro clinical field specialists or their trained representatives are responsible for training and 
directing the applicable site  staff in the placement, assembly , priming, replacement and removal of 
all components of the Neurapheresis System . The MNeuro CFS is also responsible for the general 
operation and trouble-shooting of the investigational system  under guidance from Investiga tors 
and site staff to confirm the system does not present any care concerns and  is functioning properly. 
The attending MNeuro CFS  or representative will not practice medicine, alter data or make any 
clinical suggestions based on collected data or observed data trends.  
During the Neurapheresis procedure, the MNeuro CFS  is also responsible for addressing any 
system alert states.  System data includes but is not limited to, inlet and return pressure(s), flow 
and waste rates, processed volume etc.  System data collected during a Neurapheresis procedure 
will be recorded on the LabView Software and is saved to the PC hard drive and retrieved to USB 
pen drives.  The MNeuro CFS will also help the site staff document the lumbar pressure from the system during the s tudy-required neuro checks.  
If the system experiences an issue e.g., pump failure, filter clot, catheter kink or obstruction, 
breach of sterility etc.., MNeuro CFS or r epresentative will facilitate replacement or removal of 
the affected component after  discussing  “next steps” with the Investigator.  
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163530] SAH intracranial pressure management.  
Study Investigators should consult with the MNeuro CFS  to coordinate the EVD maintenance with 
the N eurapheresis S ystem  waste control rate.  Investigators are asked  to clamp  the EVD and open 
if ICP goes to ≥20mmHg while the Neurapheresis system is operating .  The Investigator has the 
medical discretion to  open the EVD at a lower pressure limit as clinical status for a specific subject 
may require .  Alternatively, the Investigator may increase the therapy waste rate to manage an 
increasing  trend in ICP with the Neurapheresis system rather than open the EVD.  If the EVD is 
opened, it should be set to a pressure of 20 mmHg.  Also, the Investigator may reduce the system 
waste rate or pause the system if unusually low ICP or clinical symptoms indicate continued 
drainage at the current rate may be unsafe.

                                                                          Page 34 of 54 
 
Brain herniation is a known risk for intracranial hemorrhage patients, including aneurysmal 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, as the blood can create excess pressure in the brain.  Likewise, 
herniation is a known risk of lumbar drainage as it may lead to cranial pressure changes.  
SAH patients with increased risk for herniation may include those with:  
• CNS infection or abscess;  
• Excessive cranial edema/swelling that increases mass effect ; 
• Hydrocephalus or other complication that could compromise CSF communication; 
• Other mass effect (tumor, hematoma, etc.) that may lead to high intracranial pressure 
(ICP) ; 
• A sustained negative pressure change between intracranial and lumbar pressure d ue to 
high ICP or low lumbar pressure. 
During Neurapheresis therapy , the protocol requires measurement of both lumbar pressure  and 
ICP for assessment of subject status administered hourly ( ±1hr).  This should be performed at the 
same time as the study required neurological assessments. Centers will not be deviated for 
obtaining ICP measurements at a greater frequency if that is the center SOC.  ICP is to be captured 
on the applicable CRF.  It is acceptable to have the attending critical nursing staff obtain the 
measurements if that is the SOC of the center’s critical care unit.  
 To ensure accurate pressure measurements, t he system  will be paused, and the inlet pressure 
sensor will be level ed to the lumbar region of the subject.  The lumbar pressure will then be 
recorded.  The site staff will use their normal process for leveling and record ing the ICP 
measurement . The system will remain paused if the lumbar pressure falls below 4.4 mmHg (6.0 
cmH2O), and the Investigator will be notified to review clinical symptoms and system data prior 
to restarting.   Alternatively, if the Investigator has pr e-defined and documented a treatment plan, 
the system may be re-started according to the plan and on-going communication with the Investigator maintained to ensure adequate oversight of subject safety.   If during any pressure check the ICP recorded i s higher than the lumbar pressure  taken at the same 
neuro check, the system will remain paused until the ICP is equal to or lower than the lumbar CSF pressure for at least two consecutive neuro checks AND the Investigator has approved restarting the system.    If the ICP remains higher th an the lumbar pressure for five  consecutive study-
required neuro checks, then therapy will be terminated, and the site should prepare to gather the end of treatment data.  
 
In cases where the Neurapheresis procedure is terminate d e
 arly, the protocol required ICP 
measurements are to be continued  until the catheter has been removed.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163531] status to be administered hourly (±1 hr).    
Peripheral neurological checks will include assessment of leg strength and sensory changes to 
identify potential adverse events such as subdural spi[INVESTIGATOR_626858]. Centers will not be deviated 
for performing assessments at a greater frequency if that is the cent er SOC or if additional 
assessments are administered.  Assessments are to be captured on the applicable CRF.    It is 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163532] the assessments if that is the SOC of 
the center’s critical care unit.  T he Investigator may reduce the system waste rate or pause the 
system if clinical symptoms indicate continued drainage at the current rate may be unsafe. 
 
In cases where the Neurapheresis procedure is terminated early, the protocol required neurological 
assessments are to be continued until the catheter has been removed.  
Neurological monitoring is required hourly during study therapy  and similar to standar d practice, 
this monitoring is intended to identify changes to neurological status that may be suggestive of 
neurological decline. Note that the protocol requires that study therapy be stopped if herniation is identified, regardless of whether the Investigator believes the herniation to be related to study therapy.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163533]’s status.  Specifically, GCS will be captured each hour while 
the subject is intubated.   
 
GCS should be captured noting that the subject is intubated (t) and it would be expected that the 
highest score for an intubated subject will be 10(t) due to inability to provide a verbal response.  
Further, Neurapheresis is required to be paused in an intubated subject if the motor component of the GC S drops below 6.  Neurapheresis can begin upon improvement in the motor component 
score back to [ADDRESS_1163534] who was previously extubated/non-intubated requires new or re-intubation,

7.5.8 Additional Testing Requirements During Neurapheresis 
At 36 hours (± 4hr) and 72 hours (± 4hr) or end of catheter in -dwelling (whichever comes first) , a 
venous blood sample and CT are required.  Timing should be aligned with a study require neuro 
check for efficiency.  The [ADDRESS_1163538] and the 72 hour (end of catheter in- dwelling) CT must be 
obtained using a department scanner at optimal m etal artifact reduction  settings as it will be used 
for primary endpoint analysis.   The 72 hours (±4hr ) or end of catheter in -dwelling  CT can be 
obtained after catheter removal to minimize the risk of compromising sterility of the fluid loop.  
However, if it obtained prior to catheter removal, steps to maintain sterility during patient transport 
should be followed as described in 7.5.9 below.  
The venous blood sample should be submitted for a Complete Blood Count (CBC) with 
Differentials and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) to allow for comparison to pre-therapy 
values.   
7.5.[ADDRESS_1163539] during the Neurapheresis procedure , ensure that the 
Sponsor’s r epresentative is present  and the system is stopped for transport.  Care should be taken 
to protect the integrity of tubing connections during transport.  If possible, transport the system 
connected to the Subject, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_837780], remove the tubing and filters from the 
mounting bracket and place the components on the bed.  If a system disconnect is required, 
connect the two catheter ends to one another (male→female) keepi[INVESTIGATOR_837781] , see 
Figure 7.  If sterility is compr omised when connecting, the ends of catheter should be cleansed 
with Betadine for three minutes per AANA guidelines or SOC at center  for sterile line technique 
when reconnecting to the N eurapheresis System .  
 The patient may sit up, stand, or move from their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837782]. Center personnel should work with the MNeuro CFS to position the system cart in such a way to minimize strain on the catheter and tubing and allow proper movement of the pat ient. The 
system should remain connected to the patient, and depending on the type of movement, the system may continue running.

An image of the catheter position  prior to removal is required showing proximal (lumbar cistern) 
and distal catheter (thoracic anatomy) locations.  It is preferable that this is captured by [CONTACT_837815] -procedural images captured during catheter placement,  but X-ray 
capture of the image is acceptable it better accommodates work flow at the center .   
 It is recommended that t he Investigator employ the following steps for catheter removal and  be 
mindful of any analgesic requirements for catheter removal. It is likely that removal of the 
Neurapheresis catheter will have the same pain profile as the removal of lumbar drains so the 
Investigator may want to consider analgesic coverage per their professional discretion . The steps 
to removing the catheter are outlined below and are not exclusive of the SOC  for spi[INVESTIGATOR_837783].  The IFU should also be referenced for more detailed information on 
catheter removal.  
 
• Stop pump 
• Turn flow assembly  stopcocks such that the flat aspect of the stop -cock is toward the 
subject.  
• Disengage catheter from the flow assembly  stopcock  
• Join male and female catheter ends together to form a sterile loop  
• Obtain image of final catheter position  
• Remove dressings and any sutures  or fixation mechanisms used to  retain catheter  
• Gently pull catheter until it exits the subject  
• Hold pressure on site until dressing  and/or stitch  is applied  
• Have Subject lie flat or on their side for 30 minutes 
• Watch for signs of headache or Dural  CSF leak.   If a headache occurs or a blood patch is 
required to seal a leak, complete an Adverse Event CRF.  
Upon removal, follow the steps to return the investigational catheter to the  Sponsor.  Confer with 
the MNeuro C FS to ensure proper packaging and documentation for return, in addition to making 
the appropriate annotations in t he study Device Accountability Log.  
 In the event of a Subject death during Neurapheresis, the Technical Representative will work with the center to obtain the catheter in a timely fashion.  
7.[ADDRESS_1163541]-Neurapheresis  Surveillance Schedule  
7.6.1 2 Day (±1 day) Follow-up Data  
The first surveillance metric w ill occur at 2 days (±1 day) according to  Table 11. It is expected that 
the Subject will still be in the Neuro ICU at this point.  Along with the clinical status and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837784], requirements for this visit include a CT, venous blood sample, GCS and de-identified laboratory and other applicable SOC source documents. Data should be collected from SOC source documents and transferred to the CRFs however, if source documents are not 
available, completed study worksheets can be signed by [CONTACT_837816].  
 
A protocol required CT is requested at this follow -up to document the status of any subarachnoid 
blood remaining following Neurapheresis.  Care should be taken to obtain the CT at the same 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163542] can be 
obtained bedside for appropriately equipped investigational sites.  
 
Additionally, a protocol required venous blood sample is to be taken at the 2 day follow-up and 
sent for analysis. (CBC with Differentials/CMP) with associated laboratory reports provided to the 
sponsor. As CSF cultures should be followed for [ADDRESS_1163543] sample, it is expected that additional CSF analysis laboratory reports woul d be included with the 2 day follow-up data. Any 
SOC imaging studies (CTs, TCD, etc.) and associated reports completed since catheter removal should be submitted. The medical record and clinical status should be reviewed for adverse events and reported on the appropriate case report form as applicable. Finally, non -adherence to the visit 
requirements will result in a protocol deviation.   
7.6.[ADDRESS_1163544] aneurysm securement from the 
Neuro ICU (critical care unit). Discharge may be a change in location (i.e. to a stepdown unit, main hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13334], rehabilitation facility or home) as dictated by [CONTACT_837817].  Alternatively, Neuro ICU discharge may be based only on clinical status (i.e. the point at which the subject no longer meets the institutional definition for critical care monitoring).  If the 
date of discharge from clinical status is different than the date of change to physical location, sites 
are expected to use the earlier of the two dates for the discharge date.  Sites are asked to discuss 
institutional discharge criteria with a sponsor representative to ensure discharge data is collected at the appropriate time.  
Data should be collected  at the time of discharge and include the following assessments that may 
not be SOC are required.  See Table 11 for detailed requirements; GCS and Modified Rankin 
Scale (mRS).  
As CSF cultures should be followed for [ADDRESS_1163545] sample, it is expected that laboratory reports after the 2 day follow -up will be submitted with this discharge follow- up data.  
Additionally, any SOC imaging studies (CTs, TCD, etc.) and associated reports completed since 
the last study visit should be submitted. The medical record and clinical status since the last study 
visit should be reviewed for adverse events and reported on the appropriate case report form as applicable. Finally, non- adherence to the visit requirements will result in a protocol deviation.
  
 
7.6.3 30 Day (±3 day) Follow-up Data  
The final surveillance metric will occur at 30  days ( ±3 days ) post removal of the Neurapheresis 
System catheter according to  Table 11.  It is highly likely that the S ubject will not be  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_837785] -up and as such a return to the clinic is recommended to properly perform the 
required neurological assessments. (GOSE, mRS, Barthel, MoCA).  If the subject refuses to or is unable to return, this follow -up may also be completed as able by [CONTACT_837818] a 
last option.   
The medical record and clinical status should be reviewed for adverse events and reported on the 
appropriate case report form as applicable. Finally, non- adherence to the visit requirements will 
result in a protocol deviation.

8. ADVERSE EVENTS  (AEs)  
The Study will not track all -cause AEs or AEs related to SOC or the SAH clinical pathway e.g.,  
re-bleed, deep vein thrombosis, skin breakdown etc.  Study required event reporting is limited to 
AEs directly related to the investigational catheter, investigational system or Neurapheresis 
procedure, or study required element (such as CSF sampling) .   In cases where the event may have 
an attributable dual causality i.e., SAH clinical path or the Neurapheresis procedure, the center 
should report the eve nt.   
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event ( AE): Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinical signs in subjects, users or other persons, deemed  related to the investigational 
device (catheter and/or placement acce ssories), Neurapheresis procedure, or study required 
element (such as CSF sampling).  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): Adverse event as defined above that  
a) led to death,  
b) led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in: 
1) a life -threatening illness or injury, or,  
2) a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 
3) in-patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
4) medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body function,  
c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated wit h, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or  welfare  
of subjects” (21 CFR§ 812.3(s)).  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) that occur in subjects enrolled in the clinical trial 
should be reported under the IDE program (812.150) to FDA and all reviewing institutional review 
boards (IRBs) and investigators within [ADDRESS_1163548](s) .  
8.2 Reportable Adverse Events  
The table below  outlines the protocol required reportable Adverse Events.  Other events should 
also be reported if they are deemed  by [CONTACT_837819],

9. DEVIATIONS FROM THE PROTOCOL  
An Investigator must not make any changes to or deviate from the protocol , except to protect the 
life and physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. An I nvestigator shall notify the Sponsor 
and the reviewing IRB  of any deviation from the protocol  to protect the life or physical well-being 
of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the 
clinical investigation.  Such notice shall be given as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_1163549] 
be documented and reported to the S ponsor  using  the appropriate case report form.  Sites are  also 
required to report deviations to the IRB  per local requirements.   
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions (including notification, center re-training, or discontinuation) 
will be put into place by [CONTACT_1034]. 
9.[ADDRESS_1163550] a hypothesis based statistical endpoint due to the feasibility 
nature of the investigation.  The following analysis populations and definitions will be used to 
analyze the PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT data.  
10.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis populations will be used to perform the endpoint analyses.   
 Safety Population:  
This population includes only subjects that were classified as Attempt to Treat or  Treated Subjects 
and will be used to analyze all pre- defined safety endpoints.  
Treated Population:  
This population includes only subjects classified as Treated Subjects and will be used to analyze 
all pre -defined efficacy endpoints, including exploratory endpoints.  
PI[INVESTIGATOR_383078] -XT Study Protocol Revision Date: March [ADDRESS_1163551] 16 hours, however, this amount of therapy time is not considered a complete treatment as absolute  blood cl earance would not be expected.  Th is study is expected to generate 
foundational data for development of the Neu rapheresis treatment curve (e.g.  time or volume 
needed to clear blood from the subarachnoid cisterns and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). 
 
Primary Endpoints:   
1. Mean  reduction of cisternal blood via CT post study therapy  
a. Pre, [ADDRESS_1163552] -Neurapheresis CTs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_837820].  The core lab 
will utilize a three (3) member team for independent review of the primary 
endpoint with agreement of at least two (2) reviewers required.  
b. Mean volumes will be compared using a paired t-test with an alpha level of .05. Pre blood volume wil l be compared to both the 36-hour and post- Neurapheresis 
blood volumes separately to support creation of the therapy curve.  However, the Pre to Post Neurapheresis comparison will be the primary endpoint measure.  
c. An analysis of variance may be considered based on results from exploratory sub-
groups analyses  
2. Proportion of subjects with Neurapheresis Catheter, System or Therapy related serious adverse events  
a. Events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_837821] (Number of subjects with related 
SAEs/Number of subjects in the Safety Population) 
 Secondary Safety Endpoints:   
• Proportion of subjects with successful catheter placement  
o This only includes the subjects in whom catheter placement was attempted  
(Number of subjects with catheter attempted/Number of subjects in the Safety Population) 
• Proportion of subjects with device or study therapy related adverse events

growth was identified on CSF culture within [ADDRESS_1163554] 
has physiologic symptoms of infection and treatment was administered 
specifically for that infection.  
o CNS infection events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_837823] (Number of subjects meeting CNS infection definition/Number of 
subjects in the Safety Population) 
 
Secondary Efficacy endpoints:   
• Mean  reduction of RBCs and total protein by [CONTACT_837789] 
o This calculation utilizes the pre- Neurapheresis sample (first CSF sample taken 
either at the time of needle insertion or after catheter placement, whichever 
laboratory value is greater) as compared to the post -Neurapheresis sample (last 
CSF sample taken prior to catheter removal)

available d uring on- site monitoring visits or audits and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
12. SUSPENSION OR EARLY TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION  
MNeuro  reserves the right to terminate the study at any stage.  MNeuro will exercise this right 
only for valid scientific, safety or administrative reasons and , reasons related to protection of 
Subjects.  Investigators  and their associated IRB will be notified in writing in the event of study 
termination.  
Possible reasons for premature study termination include, but are not limited to:  
• The occurrence rates of AE/  UADE that present a significant or unreasonable risk to subjects 
enrolled in the study 
• An enrollment rate far below expectation that prejudices the conclusion of the study  
• A decision on the part of Minnetronix to suspend or discontinue development of the device or 
therapy application. 
13. COMPLIANCE  
13.1 Statement of Compliance  
This study will be conducted in accordance with 21CFR § 812, International Conference on

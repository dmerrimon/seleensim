DESCRIPTION:   
Patients undergoing major intra- abdominal surgeries, such as pancreatectomies, face the challenge of 
postoperative pain control, return of bowel function, and postoperative ileus. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_885991]; however, it is utilized  rarely at our institution, because it is an  invasive 
procedure with risks and potential complications.  
 
Several studies have demonstrated improved patient rehabilitation after abdominal surgery in which 
patients received perioperative intravenous (IV) infusion of lidocaine. As an adjunct to multimodal 
analgesia,  IV lidocaine infusion in colectomy patients has been shown to decrease postoperative pain, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], postoperative ileus, and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a n IV lidocaine infusion will provide clinical benefits to pancreatectomy patients with regard 
to analgesia and return of bowel function.  
 
Different titrations of the IV lidocaine infusion for postoperative analgesia have been reported without 
side effects of local anesthetic toxicity  (8).   
 
Research Plan  
 
1. Specific Aims  
 
The objective of this study is to see if perioperative IV lidocaine infusion improves postoperative 
analgesia and return to bowel function in patients undergoing open and laparo scopic 
pancreatectomies. If analgesia is improved and return of bowel function is expedited in this patient 
population, then a standardization of practice will be implemented to improve patient outcomes and reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
 
2. Background an d Significance  
 
The analgesic properties of local anesthetics have been well documented in the literature  (1, 2). 
Proposed mechanism for systemic analgesia include antinociceptive effects by [CONTACT_886009], pain modulation in the CNS by [CONTACT_886010], and antiinflammatory properties (17).   Intravenous infusions of lidocaine have been used in several types of surgeries, including orthopedic, breast, abdominal, and gynecological surgeries. Intra- abdominal 
surgeries  involving bowel resection have shown the most favorable outcomes in improved analgesia 
and improved rate of return of bowel function (3, 4, 5 ). Significant evidence  also demonstrates that 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_885992] a variety  of open and laparoscopic intraabdominal cases (6, 7) . However, routine use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_885993]. Based on this known information, an intravenous lidocaine infusion protocol is being proposed to assess post- operative pain control and improved return to bowel 
function in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic pancreatectomies.  
 
3. Progress Report  and Preliminary Studies  
 
Lidocaine infusion during pancreatic surgery, to date, has not been studied. A few trials in cooperation 
with [CONTACT_886020] have taken place, since January 2015., the patients demonstrated subjectively 
improved pain control in the rec overy room and decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. Plasma lidocaine 
levels  measured in 8 patients averaged 2.26 ug/ml (range 1.2 – 3.3 ug/ml), and they were  consistently 
below toxic leve ls and no side effects were noted nor reported by [CONTACT_102].  
 
4. Research Design and Methods  
 Study Design or Overview  –  
 [ADDRESS_1239421] (ERP) will be utilized as outlined below:

hours  
• IV or PO hydromorphone will be used for breakthrough pain  
 Diet:  
• Soft, low residue diet evening of POD #0 
• Advance to low fat diet excluding raw vegetables and fresh fruit at 0700 on postoperative day 1 
if patient without nausea.  
• If patient is diabetic, advance to diabetic diet excluding raw vegetables and fresh fruit at 0700 
on postoperative day 1 if patient without nausea.  
 Activity:  
• Out of bed greater than 1 hour, including 1 or more walks and sitting in chair within 2 hours of 
reaching the surgical floor 
• Day after surgery and until discharge, out of bed greater than 6 hours, including 4 or more 
walks and sitting in chair  
• All meals out of bed  
   
Intraoperative lidocaine infusion protocol  
  On the day of surgery, the patient will be randomly assigned to either the lidocaine 
infusion (2 grams of lidocaine in 500cc D5W)  study group (n=25 patients) or the control group  (n=25 
patients) who will receive  500cc of D5W infusion with no lidocaine.  P harmacy will handle 
randomization of patients . The patient, the surgeon, the anesthesiologist and the postoperative  
nursing staff will be blinded to which group patients were assigned . The infusion bag will be dispensed 
by [CONTACT_886011] “ Lidocaine  Infusion Study” with t he 
corresponding IRB number.  
 
 The anesthesiologists assigned to the case will begin with a bolus infusion of lidocaine, 
1.5 mg/kg  (max 100 mg of lidocaine)  at the time of  anesthesia  induction, followed by a continuous 
infusion set at 1.5  mg/kg/hour  form the IV bag labeled “Lidocaine Infusion Study”  
 
 Actual body weight will be utilized in the dosing of lidocaine with a limit of 100mg of 
lidocaine bolused and maximum infusion rate not to excide 3mg/min. Patients with BMI >[ADDRESS_1239424] a lidocaine level drawn  before leaving the 
PACU.  
 
Intra -op and PACU s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_241491]  
 
• If unstable  arrhythmias  are noted in the OR /PACU , the infusion will be stopped and a 
plasma lidocaine level will be drawn.  
• If symptomatic bradycardia and significant hypotension  refractory to treatment, 
consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119].  
• If significant intra- operative hemorrhage ( 1 body blood volume), con sider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_269831].  
• If the patient requires ICU admission after  surgery due to intraoperative complications , 
the infusion will be stopped at the end of surgery.  
• If the patient in the PACU demonstrates sudden changes in mental status, convulsion, or 
coma, the infusion will be stopped and a lidocaine level will be drawn.  
• If mortality or major complications were to occur during the study, the cases will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_255038] -investigators to determine the cause and if poor 
outcome is related to the study. All such  cases will also be reported to IRB.  
 
Baseline Assessments  
 
1. Pain at rest and with coughing via a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) – completed on the 
day of surgery in preop holding area  
2. Quality of Recovery (QoR -15) questi onnaire – completed at the time of consenting or 
preop on the day of surgery.  
Assessment  and management in the PACU  (day of surgery)  
 
1. Pain scores via a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) will be assessed in the PACU at rest and 
with coughing at the time of PACU arrival and at 30 minute  intervals  (Appendix A ). (15)  If the 
patient is too somnolent  upon arrival i n the PACU  and unable to participate, then the findings 
are to be documented as such  (i.e., unable to participate) .  
2. Upon arrival to PACU and at 30 minutes, patient’s level of consciousness will be 
assessed via the Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale (RASS)  (Appendix B).  
3. Upon arrival to PACU and at [ADDRESS_1239425] Score  (Appendix C). 
4. Fentanyl use will b e avoided in the PACU .

7. Incidence of nausea/vomiting and administered treatment in PACU will be noted.  
8. PACU length of stay (defined as the time from PACU admission until discharge criteria 
are meet as per PACU nurse evaluation and documentation).  
9. At time of the patient meeting discharge criteria in the PACU, lidocaine  infusion will be 
stopped and lidocaine  plasma levels will be drawn in all patients in order to keep the PACU staff 
blinded.

Nurses will also  rate the patients’ average pain  on a scale  from 0 to 10 (0=no pain; 10=worst 
pain ever experienced) in the past 12 hours, or since their time of surgery if it  is POD #0.  
3. The current level of  consciousness will be evaluated using the RASS score.  
4. At 24 hours fro m the time of arrival to PACU, the patient’s quality of recovery will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_886013] a validated 15 -question Quality of Recovery 
(QoR – 15) questio nnaire.  
5. At [ADDRESS_1239427] Scale will be 
obtained.  
6. Need for nasogastric (NG) tube during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885996].  
 
Return of bowel function  During the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] , the time to first flatus  and first bowel movement will be noted as per 
progress note of the surgical team. The surgical team is specifically instructed to ascertain these 
recovery milestones every morning during clinical rounds.

Strengths  – The study focuses on a  patient population that frequently has difficulties with  
postoperative pain control,  delayed return of bowel function and ileus , which are often exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438] . This study will determine if incorporating lidocaine infusions will be of help to this patient 
population. Also, the proposed study has been previously perform ed on similar surgical procedures  
with demonstrating improved postoperative analgesia and  without any adverse outcomes (8, 9, 10) . All 
drugs and personnel required for this study are readily available and in place at Mayo Clinic . 
 Limitations  – Even though highly unlikely, the potential for local anesthetic toxicity exists. During the  
patients’  intraoperative course, EKG, blood pressure , and pulse oximeter will be closely monitored for 
any potential signs of arrhythmias. If there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_886005] a nesthetic toxicity, the infusion will 
immediately be discontinued, the anesthesiologist taking care of the patient will be unblinded,  and a 
serum level of lidocaine will be drawn at that time  if appropriate . Close monitoring of the patients will 
also continue to take place in the PACU, as is the standard of care.   
  
5. Human Subjects  
Detailed Description: All human subjects will meet the criteria aforementioned and will be 
undergoing open or laparoscopic total and subtotal pancreatectomies .  
Population:  Patients who are scheduled to undergo either open or laparoscopic pancreatectomy 
will be given the opportunity to provide an informed consent for this study. Patients will be 
selected without regard to race or gender. We plan to enroll 50  patients who will meet inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.   
Research Materials: Data elements will be obtained from the patients’ medical record and entered 
into REDCap database   
Recruitment of Subjects:  Patients will be recruited at the surgeon’s office, during their pre -
oper ative visit.  The prospective candidates for the study will be approached by [CONTACT_886018]. Patients will be given information regarding the drug, the potential benefits,  and 
complications of being enrolled in the study.  Patients will be given adequ ate time to review the 
consent form, ask questions, and make an informed decision to either participate or decline.  
Potential Risks: Even though highly unlikely, the potential for unknown local anesthetic toxicity exists . Early  or mild  sign and symptoms  of toxicity include  sudden  dizziness,  confusion,  tinnitus,  
metallic  taste,  and numbness  or tingling  of fingers,  toes,  or lips. Thes e signs and symptoms  may  
progress to convulsions,  unconsciousness,  sudden hemodynamic  instability,  cardiac  arrhythmias,  or 
cardiac  arrest.  To date, there are no documented cases of morbidity or mortality associated with IV 
lidocaine analgesia.  
Every participant in this study will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_16831] . During their 
intraoperative course  and in the PACU,  EKG, blood pressure and pulse oximeter will be closely 
monitored for any potential signs of arrhythmias. If there is any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_886006], then the infusion will immediately be discontinued and a serum level of lidocaine will be 
drawn  at that time. The study team members will become unblinded to determine the relatedness 
of side effects to the study drug.  
Protection:  The patient will be enrolled into a randomization table and a number will be assigned 
to them. The randomization assig nments will be handled through REDCap database  by a research 
pharmacist . Only study team members will have access to this project in the database. All study -
related regulatory documents will be stored electronically on the Department of Anesthesia 
research  drive. The access to this research folder is limited to study team members and information 
backed up by [CONTACT_111212]’s IT department to secured servers.  
Benefits:  Patients undergoing pancreatectomies often have decreased bowel function, difficult to 
contr ol post -operative pain, and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959]. The study focuses to reduce these 
factors and improve patient outcome. The potential risks are minimal to none. Numerous previous studies have not demonstrated adverse outcomes to the patients.

Protocol #: 15-[ADDRESS_154831] Title:  A comparison of Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136402] a soft cast technique for the treatment of pediatric hand 
and foot burns, a prospective study  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steven Moulton, MD 
Version Date: 3/30/16 
 
I. Hypotheses : Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136403], 
decreasing the risk of yeast infection, and decreasing pain 
associated with multiple dressing changes. 
II. Specific Aims:  
1) To examine the efficacy of Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136404]. 
2) To evaluate Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136405] a soft cast technique comparing 
healing time, yeast infection rates and pain levels at time 
of dressing change. 
 
II. Background and Significance : 
There is currently no gold standard dressing when it comes to treating hand or 
foot burns, specifically in the pediatric population. Our institution currently utilizes 
a soft cast technique  (SCT) on all of our hand and foot burns. The SCT 
provides optimal positioning of the wounded hand or foot, allows for a moist 
wound environment, and offers protection of the injured extremity as the wound 
heals. Our current SCT uses triple antibiotic ointment (TAO)   impregnated 
Adaptic gauze, kling or kerlex, cast padding, gypsoma plaster, soft cast material, 
and coban. This dressing is applied  two to three times during the first [ADDRESS_154832] material, and coban for the 
remainder of treatment time or until OR is indicated for surgical debridement and 
grafting of wounds..  
 
A review of the current literature demonstrates silver sulfadiazine (SSD) to be 
the most frequently used dressing for burn wound treatment in many clinics 
nationwide.28 The use of SSD is associated with once to twice daily painful 
dressing changes and wound exposure that “may lead to disruption of newly 
formed epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], wound colonization, subsequent wound infection and 
deepening of the burn”.23, [ADDRESS_154833] is the reduction in

experienced include: occasional drying out of the adaptic gauze leading to a 
painful dressing removal and interruption of the newly epi[INVESTIGATOR_136406]. 
 
Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136407], a new soft silicone dressing produced by [CONTACT_136430], combines Safetac 
technology with a silver compound to provide a broad spectrum of antimicrobial coverage. The 
safetac technology “protects the wound and the skin. It prevents an outer dressing from sticking to 
the wound, therefore minimizes trauma and pain”.[ADDRESS_154835] infection, and decreasing pain associated with dressing changes. 
 III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:  
A review of current literature found studies comparing SSD to other silver type dressings, SSD to 
Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136408], and silver type dressings to topi[INVESTIGATOR_70337]. Search results failed to return 
articles on the soft cast technique for the treatment of burn wounds or the use or efficacy of Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136409]. According to the literature, many silver containing products including SSD, Acticoat (silver 
rayon mesh), and Aquacel Ag (hydrofibre with silver ion) are indicated for partial to full thickness 
wounds, suggesting silvers ability to penetrate deeper burn injuries to promote wound healing.1 
Many studies found the silver type dressings to be associated with shorter healing time when 
compared to SSD and antibiotic impregnated gauze.  
 
One important component of a burn dressing is “the creation of a moist wound-healing 
environment, the prevention of crust formation, and the physical protection of the wound against 
mechanical disturbances”.[ADDRESS_154836] infections rates to be higher among 
children in the 1-16 year old age range, contributing this finding to “a higher sensitivity for Candida 
infections during childhood”.[ADDRESS_154837] when 
compared to SSD in one clinical trial.28,5 According to a study by [CONTACT_136431],“silicone –based non-
adherent dressings are especially beneficial in reducing pain during dressing changes in children.”3

wound bed and periwound skin and have been described as ‘atraumatic’”.[ADDRESS_154839] infection rates.

IV. Research Methods  
 
A. Outcome Measure(s):  
Primary outcomes utilized in this study include overall wound outcome, measured in length of 
days to re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_136410], clinical assessment and wound 
progression photographs. Secondary outcomes include number of patients requiring surgical 
debridement, presence of infection based on odor, rash, deep red appearance or puritis. These 
wounds will not be cultured,  patient pain level with dressing change based on the FLACC 
(Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability) scale, parents perceived level of pain, pain level at 
home based on family reported pain and pain medication use. We will also assess cost 
effectiveness of dressings including the number of clinic visits, number of soft casts, and the 
cost and amount of dressings used over the course of treatment. 
 
B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:  
Patients to be included in this study will be all Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136411] 31 days and 18 years with newly diagnosed partial to deep partial or full 
thickness hand or foot burns, including bilateral or unilateral injury. Each injured extremity will 
serve as a separate data point. Exclusions include age > [ADDRESS_154840] clinic 
visit based on burn wound severity and age using RedCap. The randomization scheme in 
RedCap will be independently created by a statistician. Parental consent and or patient assent 
will be obtained prior to initial dressing. Burn severity will be clinically determined by [CONTACT_136432] a 10 point burn severity classification 
scale in regards to the following parameters: 1) Superficial first degree- wound appears pi[INVESTIGATOR_136412], involves epi[INVESTIGATOR_136413], no blisters present,dry; 2) Second degree, superficial partial 
thickness- burn involves epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + dermis, red or bright pi[INVESTIGATOR_136414], blanches, moist appearing; 3) Second degree, majority superficial partial thickness, 
minority superficial- burn involves majority (>/= 66%) superficial partial thickness, epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + 
dermis, red or bright pi[INVESTIGATOR_136415], blanches, moist appearing, 
minority (~33% or less) superficial first degree with areas of redness but no blistering; 4) 
Second degree, majority partial thickness, minority deep partial thickness- majority of burn(>/= 
66%) epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + dermis, red or bright pi[INVESTIGATOR_136416], moist, less than half of burn (~33% or less)  
is deep with pale pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]-white areas, may or may not have a marbled or mosaic         
appearance; 5) Second degree, deep partial thickness- involves epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + dermis, pale pi[INVESTIGATOR_136417], may have thin white moist eschar, may or may not have a marbled or mosaic 
type appearance, moist; 6) Second degree, majority deep partial thickness, minority superficial 
partial thickness- minority of burn (~33% or less)  involves epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + dermis, red or bright 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_136416], moist, majority (>/= 66%) of burn is deep with pale pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]-white areas having a 
marbled or mosaic appearance, may or may not have thin white moist eschar, skin buds may 
or may not be present; 7) Second degree, deep partial thickness with areas of full thickness- 
majority of burn(>/= 66%) involves epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] + dermis, pale pi[INVESTIGATOR_136418], may have 
thin white moist eschar, may or may not have a marbled or mosaic type appearance, moist, 
skin buds may or may not be present, minority of burn (~33% or less) demonstrates thin to 
thick area of eschar white, brown or black in color, may need skin graft to heal; 8) Third degree 
full thickness with minority partial thickness- majority of burn (>/= 66%) involves entire dermis + 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], thin to thick eschar that is white, brown or black in color, dry appearing, minority of 
burn (~33% or less) is pi[INVESTIGATOR_136419], with blisters and or swelling, blanches; 9) Third 
degree full thickness- involves entire dermis + epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], thin to thick eschar that is white, 
Protocol Template 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  Page 6   brown or black in color, dry appearing; 10) Fourth degree- third degree + muscle and or bone 
involvement. The provider and burn nurse will each give the patient a number and the severity 
will be determined based on the average of the 2 numbers. Any patient given a number 2, 3 or 
4, will be placed into the “partial thickness” category, any patient given a 5, 6, or 7 will be placed 
into the “deep partial thickness” category, and lastly, any patient given an 8 or 9 will be placed 
into the “full thickness” category for burn severity.  
 
Patients will be randomized into oneof two groups, Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136420], using 
RedCap and based on a random clinical trial excel spread sheet balanced by [CONTACT_136433]. A 
statistician will provide a randomization scheme for investigators to follow. Photographs will be 
taken prior to dressing application at the initial visit and each subsequent visit. Patient wounds will be dressed in either Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136407], kling or kerlex, cast padding, gypsoma plaster, soft cast 
material and coban for up to 21 days or until complete re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_136421]; the control, standard dressing of Triple Antibiotic Oinment 
impregnated adaptic gauze, kling or kerlex, cast  padding, gypsoma plaster, soft cast material 
and coban for 10-[ADDRESS_154841] their wound severity assessed by [CONTACT_136434]: 
1=0% healed, 2= 20% healed; 3=40% healed; 4=60% healed; 5=80% healed; 6=100% healed.  
This will be established by [CONTACT_136435]. This will be recorded 
in RedCap.```````  
 
A member of the nursing team  will also complete a  questionnaire at each follow up visit to 
indicate pain level with dressing change based on the FLACC scale, parents perceived level of 
pain during dressing change, parental reported pain level at home, use of  home pain 
medications, type of home pain medication- narcotic vs non-narcotic, clinical assessment of 
yeast rash including odor, visible rash, use of fluconazole, ease of dressing application, and 
amount and type of product used in dressing change. 
 
D. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools:  
A photography release will be distributed and signed by [CONTACT_136436].  
 
A nursing questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_136437]. 
 
Local wound care including cleansing, wound measurement and dressing change will be 
performed by [CONTACT_136438][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
Although punch biopsy with histological analysis is considered the ‘gold standard’ in assessing 
burn wound depth, it is invasive and time consuming.[ADDRESS_154842] 
frequent and rapid method. 18 Due to the time sensitive nature of the proposed trial and in order 
to avoid delaying wound care and initial dressing application, a 10 point clinical assessment 
scale has been created, as listed above for use in determining initial burn wound severity. 
Patient wound depth will be clinically determined by [CONTACT_136439].  
 
The wound will also be assessed by [CONTACT_136440]: 1=0% healed, 2= 20% healed; 3=40% healed; 4=60% healed; 5=80% 
healed; 6=100% healed.  This will be established by [CONTACT_136441]. This will be recorded in RedCap.

The overall risk for this study is minimal, with no foreseen adverse reactions. The risk of a silver 
allergy or adverse reaction to silicone is very rare. 
 
E. Potential Scientific Problems:  
Limitations to the proposed study design include varying diagnostic opi[INVESTIGATOR_136422], provider or nurse bias based on dressing preference, and 
possible uneven trial groups. 
 
F. Data Analysis Plan:  
Analysis Plan: Demographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized and compared 
between the two treatment groups using chi-squared and two-sample t-tests for categorical 
and continuous data, respectively. For analysis of the primary outcome, time to wound healing, 
we will use Kaplan-Meier  curves, the log-rank test and a Cox proportional hazards model to 
determine the difference in days to re-epi[INVESTIGATOR_136423]. Patients that require surgical intervention will be censored at the time of surgery. 
Logistic regression will be used to analyze the secondary outcomes, need for surgical 
debridement and occurrence of yeast infection. Pain level outcomes and pain medication use 
will be compared using two-sample t-tests and chi- squared tests. Cost effectiveness outcomes 
will also be analyzed. 
 
1. Sample size: A statistical power analysis was performed to estimate power, based on 
results reported in A Soft casting Technique to Manage Pediatric Hand Burns: Less Pain, 
Greater Gain.[ADDRESS_154843] deviation of 0.3, alpha of 0.05 and 50 subjects per group there is over 90% power to 
detect a difference of [ADDRESS_154844] that our 
proposed sample size of 100 burns will be adequate for the main objective of this study. 
 
 
G. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:  
To demonstrate that Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_136424] a soft cast technique improves wound 
healing in pediatric partial to deep partial thickness hand and foot burns by [CONTACT_136442], decreasing the risk of yeast infection, and decreasing pain associated 
with dressing changes.

1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Atrial fibrillation (A fib) is the most common arrhythmia.1 Lifetime risk of A fib is one in five to one in three 
individuals.2 Increased overall time spent in A fib (Afib burden) and recurrent AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_374473], stroke, poor quali ty of life, and mortality. [ADDRESS_468822] poor quality of life13 and report poor commu nication and guidance 
while experiencing AF epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( IRB00230621) . Mobile health technologies, including smartphone 
applications (“apps”) and wearable devices have tremendous potential to bridge this gap and enable 
delivery of risk factor modification pro grams to patients with A fib at scale. By [CONTACT_374489] A fib management program, we will be able to increase access to guideline directed A fib care at 
scale and ultimately improve the quality of the service we provide to our patients as well as  improve  
health outcomes.  
             We co -designed the Corrie Virtual  Atrial Fibrillation Management Program “Corrie VCare A fib” on 
the platform of Corrie Health in an inclusive manner together with patients, their health partners and 
clinicians in a way that meets their needs ( IRB00230621). This comprehensive and multi -component 
program aims to empower patients to a) take an active role in learning about A fib management options, 
starting and adhering to evidence -based ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014] b) help build new healthy habits for risk factor

 modification c) guide them during A fib epi[INVESTIGATOR_374474] d) provide peer support for emotional health.  
 
We aim to 1) evaluate the Corrie VCare A fib intervention in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_374475] [ADDRESS_468823] size, 
feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study measurement proced ures. Findings from this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_374476] a larger  
randomized clinical trial  powered for health outcomes, including measures to mitigate attrition rates 2)  
estimate  the prevalence of Afib risk factors 3)  characterize sleep symptoms and cardiovascular  stress, as 
one of the core risk factors for Afib, sleep apnea is under characterized specifically in this population.   
        
2. Objectives (include all primary and seco ndary objectives)  
 
The primary objective of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_374477]:   
 
Primary outcome: Retention rates at 3 months (number of individuals who continue study participation 
(defined by [CONTACT_374490], Coaching  call participation or follow up survey completion) divided by [CONTACT_374491] [ADDRESS_468824] 60% at 3 month  will be considered acceptable. 
(https://www.cvdigitalhealthjournal.com/article/S2666 -6936(22)[ZIP_CODE] -0/fulltext#figures )  
 
As part of feasibility objective  will also evaluate : 
a) screen failure rates (number of individuals who are eligible for enrollment di vided by [CONTACT_374492] (meeting inclusion criteria),  
b) recruitment rates (number of individuals who are eligible for participation in study divided by [CONTACT_374493]) as well as n umber of individuals 
who are enrolled in a study per month,  
 
The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate feasibility of implementing study procedures, 
measurement tools and collecting study data. We will evaluate secondary objectives by [CONTACT_66567] :  
 
a) Completion rates for study interventions (e.g. survey completion rates, coaching call completion rates  
b) App engagement ( Total number of interactions in the smartphone app and overall amount of time 
spent using the smartphone app per participant, collected via the Corrie Health Platform User Analytics) , 
rhythm check log rates, vital sign log rate)  
c) User satisfaction – System Usability Scale modified for Corrie Afib  
 
We will conduct exploratory analysis of the results of the followin g effectiveness measurements as well 
as metrics that may be relevant to  heterogeneity  of treatment effects  and intervention’s mechanism of 
action :

3. Backgroun d (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
Our study team has conducted inclusive design sessions (Human Centered Design Sessions) in 
collaboration with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Equity with support from American Heart Association 
to identify challenges that diverse group of patients and thei r health partners with A fib face in everyday 
life and similarly challenges that clinicians face while managing Afib (IRB00230621). Guidance with 
evidence based A fib care, peer support, A fib epi[INVESTIGATOR_374480]. These 
challenges are in line with well established gaps in care suggested in literature.  
 
In order to bridge the gap in A fib care and provide access to guideline recommended Afib management 
to patients, we have designed virtual A fib care model “ Corrie VCare A fib” on Corrie Health platform. 
Program leverages digital health technologies, namely Corrie Health patient facing app, Clinician 
Dashboard,  FDA approved wearable devices providing data generation ( Apple Watch, Bluetooth enabled  
blood pressure cuffs (Omron ) and Itamar Watch PAT home sleep apnea testing. The role of the industry 
collaborators  is hardware and software donation and advice on technology best practices. There is no 
expectation for data sharing . 
 
The app, Corrie, is the same platform  used in IRB0009 9938, QI project (IRB00148849), Human Centered 
Design Studies (IRB00266731 and IRB 00230621). App owners will have access to limited PII and PHI 
(name [CONTACT_320945]). Core app functions include: 1) medication tracking; 2) CPAP use tracking via patient 
logs 3 ) vital signs and heart rhythm and physical activity tracking; 4) patient education; 5) summary 
report for care team; 6) assistance in organization of care, 7) connecting with care team and Johns 
Hopkins nurse -led patient coaching 8) access to already establ ished social media patient led support 
groups.  
 
Furthermore, one of the core risk factors for atrial fibrillation is sleep apnea. Sleep is an essential period 
for cardiovascular system as during this time heart rate and blood pressure are  reduced allowing 
restoration and recovery of cardiovascular system.30 In patients with sleep disorders, such as  sleep apnea 
however, sleep  is a significant source of cardiovascular stresses related to periods of hypoxemia,  changes 
in intrathoracic pressure and surges of sympathetic activity during arousals .31 However true prevalence 
and characterization of sleep apnea is lacking in patients with atrial fibrillation.  By [CONTACT_374504] (at baseline for individuals in intervention arm and at 
follow up in control group) as well as deploying sleep characterization questionnaires we will be able to 
bridge this gap and chara cterize sleep among patients with sleep apnea (detailed sleep apnea testing and 
treatment plan is uploaded in Section 20.2 as part of Corrie VCR program document.

General Overview:  
 
We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], parallel arm randomized clinical trial in a convenience sample of 100 patients 
with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( diagnosed not more than 12 months prior to randomization)  who 
presents for evaluation (Afib at Johns Hopkins Outpatient Cardiology Clinic , Johns Hopkins Bayview 
cardiology or electroph ysiology clinics , or Medical Pavilion at Howard County electrophysiology clinic ). 
We will evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy of multi -component Corrie VCare AF Program in 
addition to usual care vs usual care alone.  
Given proven benefits on card iovascular outcomes with [ADDRESS_468826], BP cuff, scale, Nurse -coach 
for Corrie Afib  (guidance document uploaded in Section 20.2) and contextual motivational messages  
(document uploaded in Section 20.2) , voluntary access to public patient led Facebook AF support 
group ( https://www.facebook.com/groups/AtrialFibrillationSupportForum )  
 
 
Enrollment, Randomization and Measurements:  
 
1. The list of patients in the cardiology and electrophysiology outpatient clinics at Johns Hopkins 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (JHH) , Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center (JHBMC) , and Medical Pavilion at Howard 
County (MPHC)  will be reviewed daily by [CONTACT_374505]. Furthermore, flyers will be placed 
at JHH and JHBMC cardiology outpatient clinician work rooms to increase visibility of the study 
and allow clinicians to refer patients to the study. Patients who meet the incl usion criteria (see 
below in section 5) will be entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) dataset.  
2. Study team members will subsequently screen patient charts for exclusion criteria.  
3. Before approaching eligible patients for consent, study tea m members will ask the attending 
physician of the patient to obtain permission from patients for study team to approach them. 
Study team members will also assess whether treating clinicians deem Corrie VCare A fib program 
safe for patients  
4. Patients will be approached in the outpatient clinic either before or after their scheduled clinic 
visit. Once patients are approached, further questions will be asked to screen for exclusion 
criteria including visual, motor, and/or auditory impairment limiting digital hea lth technology use 
(precludes meaningful use of intervention technology).  
5. Research team member will provide patients with  detailed information and consent form to 
review prior to starting further discussion.  
6. Confirmation about having as much time as neces sary will be done by [CONTACT_374506] a repeat of information  
7. Patients will be given the opportunity to ask any questions of research team before considering 
consenting to participate in study.  
8. After con sent is obtained, patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_374507] (JHH vs JHBMC  vs MPHC ) and practice (Cardiology vs Electrophysiology)  to the VCare 
Afib  program along with usual care or usual care alone. Usual care is defined by [CONTACT_374508].

 9. We will use a web -based tool for randomization using variable -sized blocks (2 -6). We will 
minimize bias by [CONTACT_374509].  
10. Once ra ndomization arm is determined, a study team member will inform each patient of their 
allocation.  
 
11. Individuals randomized to the Corrie Afib Virtual Program will receive onboarding from a study 
team member.  Patients will receive step by [CONTACT_374510] h ow to download the Corrie Afib 
app onto the phone, use Apple Watch device, blood pressure cuff [Omron Blood pressure cuff 
(FDA cleared)], which will be paired with the smartphone via Bluetooth and scale. They will also 
be instructed on the use of  one-time  Itamar Watch PAT home sleep apnea testing  (Detailed 
description of sleep apnea testing and treatment is uploaded in Section 20.2 as part of the Corrie 
VCare Afib Program description document) . We will ask patients to keep WatchPAT on for the 
entire night. For a study to be considered acceptable, we will require a minimum recording 
duration of [ADDRESS_468827] questions about technology use. They will also be able to submit feedback or questions 
regarding app use directl y via the app. Patients will be encouraged to start using the app 
immediately ; they will be able to receive education and log medication use and CPAP wearing 
time via the app as soon as the a pp is downloaded. Patients will be instructed to record single 
lead (Apple watch) ECG twice a day and when they experience symptoms concerning for Afib.  
12. To promote privacy of health information, a login will be required to access the app (created 
upon onboarding). Additionally, the iPhone will be set to password protec ted mode / face ID 
activated.  
13. After obtaining consent, app permissions will be given. In order for an app to access any 
information on an iOS smartphone, the app must ask the user for permission and only if that 
permission is granted, can the app access t hat information. This is inherently enforced on all apps 
by [CONTACT_374511]. In our case we only will ask for permissions to access:  
• Relevant digital health data from iOS HealthKits, in particular: physical activity, blood 
pressure and heart rate.  
• Photos to store an insurance card or other cards like a stent card. Even if the access -
permission is granted, it is limited to the images specified by [CONTACT_28024].  
• Display notifications, such as an alert to take medications . 
• Send email function to allow users t o send a PDF of their consent form or a PDF of 
relevant health info (e.g., medication list, progress report) to their care providers. No app 
is allowed to read any data from the mail app.  
Participants will be given the option to take a photo in which they are identifiable using the app 
and can specify authorization for internal or external use via the standard media consent form.  
14. All patients in the Corrie VCare A fib program will receive weekly check -in calls from Johns 
Hopkins Cardiology Nurse (Stephney Bl air or Courtney Eddy) – Corrie Afib coach to guide patients 
with individualized risk factor modification. If during conversation with the Corrie Afib health 
coach patients report concerning symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath and more, 
the health coaches will follow study Standard Operating Procedure Protocol to handle the 
different scenarios (attached in supplementary documents in Section 20.[ADDRESS_468828]

 their clinicians, call 911 or go to emergency room when experiencing symptoms or abnormal vital 
signs.  
15. Patients in the Corrie VCare AF program will also receive messages tailored to their risk factor to 
facilitate lifestyle modification. Tex t messages  which will be sent as push notifications via an app. 
Corrie Message Bank has been developed by [CONTACT_374512],  
American Heart Association’s Care Pathway messages and patient generated messages. 
(Attached as supplemental document  in Section 20.2 ). There are slight modifications in the 
message bank for Afib version compared to cardiac rehabilitation version  approved  by [CONTACT_1201] 
(IRB00308410 ) with addition of sleep apnea messages and modified physical activity messages. 
Patient specific risk factors will be reviewed by [CONTACT_374513]. 
Then based on patients’ goals for each risk factor mess ages promoting building healthy habits for 
patient preferred risk factor will be sent to them with patient desired frequency.  
16. Through the app patients in Corrie VCare AF program will be able to record ECG (using Apple 
Watch device), log CPAP wear times, record their vital signs, symptoms and perceived triggers. 
They will be able to alert their clinician via app and receive guidance for epi[INVESTIGATOR_374481]. 
They will also be able to alert health partner (pre -specified in the app) that they are experiencing 
Afib epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. App will alert patients that if they are experiencing medical emergency, they should 
call 911.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will  be administered for non -FDA 
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations are 
changed.  
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  
 
1. The Corrie app is available on iPhone platforms. In discussion with an FDA -consultant, 
because the functionality of the app is as an organizational and navigational tool for patients, 
it does not require pre -approval from the FDA before use with patients. It falls within th e 
category of mobile apps for which the FDA is exercising enforcement discretion.  
2. Apple Watch, Itamar Watch PAT, and Omron blood pressure cuff all have received FDA 
clearance and are safe for patient use (see supplementary documents).  
 
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable.  
b. Secondary outcome variables.  
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis.  
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
 
In this two -arm, parallel group RCT we will evaluate feasibility (primary outcome) of a [ADDRESS_468833] difference in quality of life measured 
by [CONTACT_374515] ~ 19 points with 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_468834] 10% difference in AF burde n, previous 
studies have shown 7.6% point reduction in AF burden with [ADDRESS_468835] 10% difference in AF burden  from 
baseline to follow up in the intervention group .

Version 4 Dated:   01/[ADDRESS_468836] implemented the following interventions to further minimize the risk  (1) We will exclude 
patients who are not deemed  fit for study participation by [CONTACT_238949] (2) We will only enroll 
participants in the study who have significant comorbidities (see exclusion criteria)   (3) We will 
provide nurse led weekly check -ins with patients to guide them accordingly if thei r vitals are not 
within normal range or if patients report concerning symptoms. The guide for these check -ins has 
been compi[INVESTIGATOR_374485] .  
 
Risks also include patient relaying on study clinician during the A fib epi[INVESTIGATOR_374486]. To minimize this risk, we will have disclaimer that if patients are experiencing medical 
emergency, they should call [ADDRESS_468837] benefit. Moreover, the data 
that they contribute as a research participant could help others in the futu re.

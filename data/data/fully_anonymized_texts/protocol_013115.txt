Background:
Accurately quantifying food intake is vital to promoting health and reducing chronic disease risk. Food 
intake encompasses energy intake, nutrient intake (macronutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, minerals), 
and intake of various food groups (e.g., fruits, vegetables); thus, it reflects the nutritional status of 
individuals. Nutrition affects disease risk, including risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_139430],[ADDRESS_468679] the [LOCATION_002] (US). Nonetheless, accurate assessment of food and 
nutrient intake has remained challenging, despi[INVESTIGATOR_374385]. Self-report methods, 
namely food records, are a mainstay of nutritional research,[ADDRESS_468680] been comprehensively outlined.10 As a result, there remains a 
significant need for methods that are sufficiently accurate to provide users, clinicians, and researchers 
with data to guide health promotion efforts. 
The PortionSize™ app was designed by [CONTACT_374389]. PortionSize relies on users capturing images of their food selection 
and waste. Food intake data are immediately provided since the user relies on built-in tools, including 
templates, to estimate portion size within the app. Although the PortionSize app provides users (and 
clinicians and researchers) with real-time information about food intake, it comes at the cost of 
increased user burden since the user must identify foods in their images and estimate portion size. This 
differs from other food photography-based methods that our laboratory and other groups have 
developed, including the Remote Food Photography Method© (RFPM) and SmartIntake® app. For 
example, when using the RFPM and SmartIntake app, users only need to capture images of their foods 
with the app; identify any foods that are not identifiable from a wrapper, container, or logo; and the app 
sends the images to the researchers for analysis. Indeed, based on our research, participants view 
SmartIntake as less burdensome and more preferred compared to PortionSize 11, and we expect that 
this could negatively affect peoples’ use of PortionSize over time.  
To reduce PortionSize’s user burden, we aim to utilize machine learning, image recognition, and artificial 
intelligence for nutrition tracking. However, before we can incorporate these technologies into 
PortionSize, they first need to be validated. Therefore, we aim to test the validity of Nutrition AI 
technology, currently embedded in the Openfit® app, to identify foods and to estimate portion size 
(food volume) using automated methods. When using the Nutrition AI in Openfit, if the user believes the 
automated identification of the food and/or portion estimate needs correcting, adjustments can be 
made manually. However, this user burden is likely to be low and will also be explored in the current 
study. Therefore, the primary aims of the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_58780]: 1a) test the validity of Nutrition AI at 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218
Approved April 8, 2022
2identifying foods, 1b) test the validity of Nutrition AI at quantifying the amount of food provided, and 
1c) assess user satisfaction and usability of Nutrition AI in Openfit among adults in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana. Openfit is not currently designed to assess plate waste, though Nutrition AI has the potential 
to assess plate waste and ultimately food intake. Therefore, the secondary aims of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_374386]: 2a) test the validity of Nutrition AI to identify plate waste and, 2b) test the validity of Nutrition AI to 
quantify the amount plate waste, and 2c) to assess user satisfaction and usability of the Nutrition AI in 
Openfit to assess plate waste, among adults in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. From this data we can calculate 
food intake (food plated – plate waste). 
Primary Hypotheses:
1a) Nutrition AI will correctly identify ≥70% of foods plated with automated methods, and 
≥80% after user correction. 
1b) Compared to weighed values, energy estimates (kcal) of foods plated, from Nutrition AI, will 
be: 
i. Within error margins of 20% without user correction (automated)
ii. Within error margins of 15% with user correction (semi-automated)
Secondary Hypotheses:
2a) Nutrition AI will correctly identify ≥60% of plate waste with automated methods, and ≥80% 
after user correction.
2b) Compared to weighed values, energy estimates (kcal) of plate waste, from Nutrition AI, will 
be:
i. Within error margins of 20% without user correction (automated)
ii. Within error margins of 15% with user correction (semi-automated)
Methods
Study Design
For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], using a convenience sample, we will recruit up to 25 adults to use the Nutrition AI 
technology in Openfit to identify and estimate portion size of foods provided and simulated plate waste, 
and food intake in a laboratory setting at Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) and/or 
Louisiana State University (LSU). Laboratory members within the Ingestive Behavioral Laboratory will 
also test the ability of Nutrition AI to identify foods and to quantify foods provided, plate waste and food 
intake, in the laboratory. Meals will be simulated, and participants will not consume the foods provided. 
Participants and Recruitment
We will recruit up to 25 adults 
- Inclusion criteria include:
oMale or female, age 18-62 years
oSelf-reported body mass index (BMI) 18.5-50 kg/m2 
Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218
Approved April 8, 2022

3- Exclusion criteria include:
oAny condition or circumstance that could impede study completion
oUnfamiliar with or not able to use an iPhone
NOTE: PBRC and LSU employees (vulnerable populations) will be targeted and invited to participate. The 
consent form will explicitly specify that if a PBRC or LSU employee chooses not to participate, there will 
be no impact on their employment.
Procedures
Written informed consent will initially be obtained. We will then obtain:
- Demographics (self-reported): DOB, race, ethnicity, sex, employment, income, marital status,
education level (Lifestyle, Demographics, and Health Questionnaire)
- Anthropometrics (self-reported): height, weight, BMI
On being deemed eligible, participants will receive training on how to use the Openfit app housing the 
Nutrition AI technology. Subsequently, participants will be randomly assigned to one of five study 
menus (5 participants per menu) of differing calorie levels (see Table 1). Participants will use a provided 
smartphone to identify foods and quantify the amount of food plated (e.g., an apple) and simulated 
plate waste (e.g., half an apple) with Nutrition AI. Within each study menu, participants will be served 
two meals of a similar calorie level. These two meals will be served during the same study visit. To 
ensure we are testing the validity of the Nutrition AI across differing portion sizes, each meal (e.g., the 
chicken meal), will be tested across two different study menus where the amount of food provided and 
plate waste differs. The amount of plate waste will be assigned randomly using an exponential 
distribution, with the minimal being 0% remaining (i.e., no waste) and the maximum being 74%12. On 
average we will aim for ~5% plate waste across tests to reflect average plate waste in free-living 
conditions13. 
These tests will be conducted via Openfit in a laboratory-based setting at PBRC or LSU. Simulated food 
provision and plate waste will be covertly identified and weighed, and participants will not eat the food 
provided. During the study visit, tasks completed by [CONTACT_374390]. Data 
will be accessed from the iPhone at study completion. Consent, training, and testing will span up to ~2 
hours.
Near the end of the visit, participants will complete the Computer System Usability Questionnaire 
(CSUQ) 14. The CSUQ is a standardized, reliable, and valid questionnaire originally designed to evaluate 
computer programs that has been used to quantify the usability of mobile phone apps. Participants will 
also complete a user satisfaction survey to quantify satisfaction and ease of use of Openfit for tracking 
dietary intake.

II. Nutrition AI with user correction (semi-automated)
Statistical analyses
For a food identified through the Nutrition AI to be considered an exact food match, the name [CONTACT_374394] a close match to the food served. For example, a fruit cocktail 
identified as a fruit salad is an acceptable match15. Proportions will be used to assess whether the 
percentage of food items plated that were correctly identified by [CONTACT_374392] a criterion method (human rater). Descriptive data will also 
be used to describe the frequency at which food plated and plate waste were correctly identified. 
Mean error and Bland-Altman analysis16 will be performed to determine errors in estimation of energy 
intake and food group servings from the Nutrition AI compared to estimations from the criterion 
measure17.

				Protocol	Summary	Form														 
Rev. 14 – 4/27/[ADDRESS_677801] of a grant does not provide a suitable lay summary. About 30% of American adults experience daily chronic pain, which is defined as pain persisting [ADDRESS_677802] the expected time of healing that does not resolve with treatment. In addition to considerable suffering, chronic pain is associated with mental illness (including depression, anxiety) and the risk of substance use disorders. Non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_522560]’t provide a full response. As a result, opi[INVESTIGATOR_522561], which has the risk of misuse or addiction. Alternatively, patients may resort to other substances of abuse (such as alcohol or cannabis).   Our goal in this study is to investigate TEST (Transcranial Electric Stimulation Therapy) for chronic pain. TEST is similar to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in that an electrical stimulus is delivered to the brain. However, the dose of stimulation used for TEST is lower than ECT, and we expect that a seizure will not be generated with TEST (although general anesthesia is required). A previous publication has shown that TEST is effective for treatment resistant depression, without effects on memory that can accompany ECT.    We propose to investigate the feasibility of TEST in subjects with chronic pain. This will be an open-label study where subjects (n=12) are administered 8-[ADDRESS_677803] to be exhaustive.  Chronic pain non-cancer pain (CNCP) can be difficult to treat, although it affects up to 30% of adults in the [LOCATION_002]. While there are non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_522562], such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants, many patients experience only a partial response. For example, with anti-depressant treatment about one in three patients with neuropathic pain will experience a moderate effect on pain relief (Sarto et al, 2010). Anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_522563] a high incidence of side effects (Wiffens et al, 2013).  Thus, novel treatment approaches are needed for chronic pain.

Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) has been in use for decades. The main indications for ECT are treatment resistant depression and refractory catatonia. For these disorders, the efficacy is close to 50-90%. In the past, ECT was used for chronic pain and studies from the 1950s and 1960s reported that ECT alleviated this condition. However, these studies are limited to case reports and studies lacking an appropriate control group. The largest and most recent case series included 21 patients with primary chronic pain who had been refractory to pain treatment (Bloomstein et al, 1996). The patients were treated with ECT (between 5 and 14 treatments). In nine of the [ADDRESS_677804] (Bloomstein et al, 1996). To our knowledge, the remainder of the literature on ECT for chronic pain is limited to case reports of < [ADDRESS_677805], except that the dose is approximately 1/8th the dose delivered in ECT. A recent study showed that TEST is helpful for treatment resistant unipolar and bipolar depression (Regenold et al, 2015; please note that TEST was referred to as ‘NET’ in this publication). This proof-of -concept trial enrolled [ADDRESS_677806]. The mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores declined significantly with TEST, from 20.3 to 8.6 (p = 0.001). Response and remission rates were 73% and 55%. Cognitive testing was done using the Mini-Mental State Exam and the Autobiographical Memory Inventory-Short Form. The results showed that memory was not affected by [CONTACT_522571]. In this publication, TEST was delivered at 1/8th the usual ECT dose for 7 seconds. Please note that a sister study is currently being performed at NIMH (in collaboration with our group here at NYSPI) by [CONTACT_522572]. This protocol will use the same parameters as those used by [CONTACT_522573] (2015), as delineated in the procedures section. The goal of this study is to investigate TEST for chronic pain. Like ECT, TEST will provide widespread stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate (ACC) (Blumenfeld et al 2003 and Lee et al 2016). Imaging studies show that the emotional and cognitive perception of pain are modulated by [CONTACT_522574]. Using a meta-analytic, data-driven approach, two studies have shown that the ACC and mPFC regulate pain processing (de la Vega et al 2016 and Lieberman et al 2015). Thus, we will investigate whether the stimulation of these brain regions with TEST has an impact on chronic pain.  This is a preliminary, open label feasibility study in adults with CNCP. Subjects will be recruited from the pain clinics of Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Given that this is a feasibility study, it is open to participants with chronic pain caused by a wide range of disorders. Please note that chronic pain, independent of the original etiology, has been shown to involve the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate. Thus, in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the procedure is open to patients with different primary causes of pain who suffer with chronic pain. Subjects will be admitted to the research unit at NYSPI. They will receive three treatments weekly for a total of 8-9 treatments, using the dosing from the previous study of refractory depression (Regenold et al, 2015). Ratings of pain, mood, and memory will be obtained before and after the TEST sessions, and weekly for [ADDRESS_677807] sessions.

Specific Aims and Hypotheses Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis or primary research question(s) being examined.  There should be one hypothesis for every major study procedure or intervention.  For pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], it is important not to overstate the study's objectives.  If there are no study hypotheses, describe broad study goals/aims. Specific Aim 1: We will determine the feasibility of administering NET to participants with chronic pain. Like ECT, NET will be delivered three days a week for three weeks (for a total of 8 to 9 sessions). We will recruit 6 subjects with a diagnosis of chronic pain, defined as pain lasting more than 6 months, that has not remitted with pharmacotherapy, with no other known treatment (examples include chronic postoperative pain, low back pain, musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia, visceral pain and neuropathic pain, including complex regional pain syndrome). Our hypothesis is that NET will prove to be safe and tolerable in this patient population and will show preliminary efficacy, defined a priori as a decrease in pain of at least 30%.  Specific Aim 2: We will determine the preliminary efficacy in 6 patients with chronic pain (using the same criteria as above) who have comorbid major depression. We will use the same inclusion criteria and the same outcome measures as Aim 1, obtained before and after the NET sessions. Our hypothesis is that NET will be safe, tolerable, and will have preliminary efficacy on symptoms of major depression in addition to chronic pain (improvement of at least 30%).  Specific Aim 3: We will develop the most appropriate anesthesia regimen for NET. In the past, NET has been delivered using the same anesthesia regimen as ECT. However, since no seizure is elicited with NET, the patient is likely to require only brief sedation rather than general anesthesia for the procedure (as is standard for ECT). Whereas it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_522564]/circulatory support and post-ictal confusion, we will determine optimal dosing strategies for NET. We hypothesize that NET participants will require only minimal sedation without neuromuscular blockade.

Gender, Racial, and Ethnic Breakdown: We expect to enroll 50% women; 50% white, 25% black; 25% Hispanic/Latino Description of subject population: Participants with refractory chronic pain with at least 3 months duration with a diagnosis of chronic postoperative pain, low back pain, musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia, visceral pain or neuropathic pain, including complex regional pain syndrome  Suicide Risk Management Plan This section will include all information regarding the Suicide Risk Management Plan.     This study involves no delay to treatment, no medication taper, all participants receive active treatment. Participants are asked to not change their medication while admitted to the research unit. They can change medications during the follow-up phase. The The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) will be used at screening, administered by a study physician. Any participant reporting suicidal ideation or behavior (defined as any answer of ‘yes’ to questions 1, 2 or 6 on CSSRS) to any member of the research team will be evaluated Drs. Martinez, Wai, or Castillo. If the patient is an active suicide risk, 911 will be called and/or the participant will be escorted to the Emergency Department. If the participants is not an active risk, they will be provided with referrals for outpatient treatment. If the participant has outpatient treatment in place, their clinician will be notified. [CONTACT_329398], Wai, or Castillo will follow up with the participant until their clinical care is in place.   The C-SSRS is done at screening. After this, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is acquired during the inpatient stay and during the follow up period. The BDI is a self-report measure. The BDI will be used to assess risk and any of the following criteria will trigger a clinical assessment by a psychiatrist regarding suicide risk: 1) an answer of “yes” to question 9 (thoughts of killing self); 2) a score higher than 16; 3) an increase in BDI score of 10 points or more from the baseline BDI (obtained on scan day) even if the total score remains below 16. Please note that the follow up assessments include a phone call with a study psychiatrist. As mentioned above, the psychiatrists are Drs. Martinez, Wai, or Castillo. Participants will be advised that they can call the lab to speak with a psychiatrist when the link is sent. A research assistant will check the responses on the day that they are sent to check the responses.

In addition, explain procedures for managing subjects who are withdrawn from the protocol. For treatment studies: To minimize risks to subjects, operationalized drop-out criteria should be defined so that subjects who worsen, or in some cases, fail to improve, are removed from the study and offered standard care.  The threshold for drop-out should consider the level of risk associated with non-improvement for the specific disorder, the availability of alternatives, and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_220305].  For example, emergence of suicidal intent, or psychosis, should prompt immediate clinical evaluation and withdrawal from the study. Participants will be discontinued if they have two seizures. In the event that they have one seizure the TEST dose will be lowered to 1/10th of the standard ECT dose (from 1/8th). The seizure will be discussed with the participant, including the plan to reduce the dose. If a participant decides to continue, this will be documented in their chart. If a participant has a seizure at 1/10th dose, they will be discontinued from the study.

Describe the delay, by [CONTACT_348797], before a participant can receive treatment of known efficacy or standard care routinely offered in the community. There is no delay to treatment.  Clinical Treatment Alternatives Describe what other treatment or assessment options are available to subjects who do not participate in research. The alternative is for subjects to not participate and to continue their usual care.  Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences "Risk" is a broad term used to convey the potential for harm, burden, and inconvenience related to research participation.  Use this section to provide a comprehensive description of foreseeable physical, psychological, social, interpersonal, and economic risks introduced by [CONTACT_53775].  Include the source of the information.  Consider both the probability and magnitude of harm and its impact.  Describe the foreseeable harms associated with the research (untoward effects of a medication) and those related to delay to individualized treatment.  Include data from the literature, and local data, if available, on risk rates and subject experiences with research procedures. Describe

Rev. 14 – 4/27/[ADDRESS_677816] of risks/categories of risk, and in general put the list in the order of significance or level of risk, the most significant risks should be listed first.  Risks of TEST: Previous experience with TEST is limited to patients with major depression, as describe by [CONTACT_522573], 2015. In this publication, TEST was delivered at 1/8th (which is the same as 1/16th age) the usual ECT dose for 7 seconds. Please note that a sister study is currently being performed at NIMH (in collaboration with our group here at NYSPI) by [CONTACT_522572]. This protocol will use the same parameters as those used by [CONTACT_522573] (2015), as delineated in the procedures section. Although not intended, a seizure is possible with the delivery of TEST. We do not expect a seizure to occur, as we are using the lower dose of TEST (reported in Regenold et al, 2015). If a seizure occurs, the subject will be monitored as though they have received ECT. Following this session, they will be informed of the seizure and asked if they would like to be removed from the protocol or continue. If they chose to continue, the dose will be lowered by 25%. If another seizure is elicited, they will be monitored appropriately and then removed from the protocol. Based on the previous publication by [CONTACT_522573] (2015) we do not expect a seizure to occur. Nonetheless, participants will be informed of this possibility and the need to stop the study. The anesthesia medications include glycopyrrolate, methohexital sodium, and succinylcholine. The risks of glycopyrrolate include anti-cholinergic effects (dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], increased body temperature, fast or irregular heart rate, blurred vision, constipation, drowsiness, dry eyes, dry mouth, flushing, and light sensitivity). The risks of methohexital sodium include drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, chills or shivering, coughing, hiccups, muscle twitching, or mild skin rash or itching. The side effects of succinylcholine include jaw rigidity, hypotension, muscle fasciculation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and salivary gland enlargement. Rare side effects include a severe allergic reaction, malignant hyperthermia, transient residual weakness due to prolonged succinylcholine activity (due to pseudocholinesterase deficiency, which is exceedingly rare [approximately 1 per 2000 to 5000 people] but would make succinylcholine last longer than 3-5 min), myoglobinuria/myoglobinemia, and arrhythmias. Other risks of TEST include: 1) An adverse reaction to anesthesia is a rare but potentially severe complication. This is related to the anesthetic agents and neuromuscular blockade. This is mitigated by [CONTACT_522578], the appropriate monitoring, and clinical management should a reaction arise. 2) Blood pressure changes are common but are usually transient and manageable. Both hypertension and hypotension may occur, and subjects will be monitored for these issues. Cardiovascular complications are not common but possible. These include arrhythmias and/or ischemia. This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_522579]. 3) Pulmonary complications such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499], bronchospasm, transient and even life-threatening decreases in blood oxygen saturation are possible during general anesthesia for any procedure. In this study, this risk is specifically mitigated by [CONTACT_522580], active pulmonary infection, recent or persistent COVID-19 infection, evidence of low blood oxygen saturation levels (SpO2 < 95%) at baseline, known history of airway difficulty, and morbid obesity. Given the transient need for ventilatory

Rev. 14 – 4/27/[ADDRESS_677817].  4) Dental and oral trauma is possible, though not common. This includes dental fractures, lacerations, and prosthetic damage. This risk is mitigated by [CONTACT_522581]. 5) Pain and discomfort is seen with ECT, but we expect this to be less likely with TEST. This can be addressed with ibuprofen if needed.  6) A prolonged seizure is not expected, but possible. The anesthesiologist will administer methohexital or propofol, as is standard for ECT in the event of a prolonged seizure. This decision will be made by [CONTACT_522582].  7) Skin burns are uncommon and typi[INVESTIGATOR_14105]. They can occur when there is poor contact [CONTACT_522583]. Skin burn risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_522584].  8) Additional potential risks include short term memory loss and difficulty learning.   The risks of drawing blood include bruising, bleeding, or (rarely) infection (phlebitis). These risks are avoided by [CONTACT_522585].  The risks of the questionnaires include boredom, becoming tired, or finding questions uncomfortable. These risks are reduced by [CONTACT_522586], letting participants take breaks as needed, and clarifying that these assessments can be stopped if needed.   Methods to Protect Confidentiality Describe the data management plan and the methods you will employ to protect subject privacy and the confidentiality of research data.  The section should detail how information will be collected, recorded, coded, stored, transmitted, and as applicable, shared with other investigators so as to minimize risks related to breach of confidentiality.  Confirm that identifiers are removed, to the extent possible, from research data, and explain if there are links between subject identity and research data, or if the data are anonymous.  Also, indicate where the data are stored, who is responsible for data safekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and who has access to subject identity and codes, if any, which cross-link research data and subject identity.  Confirm that identifiable data are not collected, stored, or transmitted by [CONTACT_2319], fax, on removable drives, laptops, or via the internet without proper protections, e.g. encryption. Participants divulge information, for example, regarding drug use, which is sensitive and may have adverse social consequences if released. We deal with issues of confidentiality by [CONTACT_522587], storing signed consent forms in a locked safe, and try to the best of our ability to maintain confidentiality. Data are kept on a password protected computer, and if there is any electronic transmission concerning the study, it will use numeric identifiers rather that participant names. Further, we will use HIPAA-compliant platforms to questions about participants and to sign this consent form (Redcap and Qualtrics). We also point out to prospective participants that we cannot assure that their drug histories and other personal records might not become known. Those who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_522569]. 14 – 4/27/[ADDRESS_677818] conform with NY State reporting requirements (e.g., child abuse). In addition to a discussion of this topic, the information is clearly stated in our consent forms. Participants in other studies have understood this and have agreed to participate under these conditions. We are collaborating with the lab of Bashar Badran, PhD, at the Medical University of South Carolina, who will model the electrical field generated by [CONTACT_522571]. To accomplish this, MRI scans will be sent to MUSC. The MRI scan files do not contain PHI and the scan itself is not considered PHI (per Rachel Marsh, PhD, director of the MRI core. The consent form makes this clear to participants. It also says that participants are not required to agree to have their MRI shared in order to participate. In this case, a note will be included in their file and the MRI will not be sent. Some participants completed the study prior to this collaboration. Thus, I will call these three participants to discuss the option of allowing us to share their MRI scans. If they agree, consent will be obtained either through RedCap or by [CONTACT_478306] a consent form addendum (along with a return envelope).    Will the study be conducted under a certificate of confidentiality?   ☐  Yes, we will apply for the Certificate of Confidentiality ☐  Yes, we have already received a Certificate of Confidentiality ☒  No Direct Benefits to Subjects Describe only benefits to individual subjects that are likely to accrue during the study itself. Do not include subject compensation or treatment to be provided at the end of the study, as these do not figure into the IRB's risk/benefit considerations.  Do not describe diagnostic and evaluation components unless subjects receive clinical feedback. Do not describe the anticipated scientific benefits of the research.  Some studies offer no direct benefit to subjects. This study is not designed to benefit participants directly  Compensation and/or Reimbursement If compensation or reimbursement for expenses will be offered to subjects, please describe and indicate total amount and schedule of payment(s). If transportation is reimbursed, state if receipts are necessary for reimbursement.  Include justification for compensation amounts and indicate if there are bonus payments.

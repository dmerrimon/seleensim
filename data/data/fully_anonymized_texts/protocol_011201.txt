11.ABSTRACT
Briefly summarize the purpose and procedures of the proposed research  (200 words or less) .  
In this cluster randomized effectiveness trial,  pediatric primary care practices will be recruited  from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics’ national Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) practice- based research network, as well 
as the client databa se of the Physician’s Computer Company (PCC) – an Electronic Health Record (EHR) vendor. Up to 
[ADDRESS_173568] 1-2 pediatric clinicians to receive in -person training in M otivational Interviewing (MI), behavioral 
therapy, billing and coding, and study procedures. Usual Care practices will select 1-2 pediatric clinicians to receive billing / coding and study protocol training only, via telephone and webinar; they will be offered in- perso n MI training 
at the close of the trial. Up to 450 parents of overweight or obese children (BMI > 85
th percentile for age and gender) 
between 3 and 8 years of age at baseline that are patients of participating Intervention arm clinicians will be enrolled. 
Over 24 months, these parents may receive up to 4 in-person, MI- based counseling sessions with a trained pediatric 
clinician  and up to  6 telephone counseling sessions with an MI- trained Registered Dietician (RD ). There will be no 
study- specific contact [CONTACT_150315] – they will continue to 
receive usual care. EHR and billing data for all 3-8 year old children  within all participating practices (estimated to be 
approximately 36,000 children  in total) will be extracted by [CONTACT_150316] z- score among 3 groups: 1) all eligible children (n = up to 450  in the 
Intervention arm) , 2) all eligible children whose parent actively participates in the trial (a subset of up to 450 eligible 
children in the Intervention arm ), and 3) all 3- 8 year old children in all participating practices (n  = ~36,000).     
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 4 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/[ADDRESS_173569] (32%) of all US children are overweight or obese1, with greater prevalence among children who are 
minority, lower income, or live in rural areas1-4.  Most obese children remain so as adolescents and adults5, facing health 
complications including diabetes, liver disease, asthma, heart disease, and cancer6. Childhood obesity is linked to lower 
health -related quality of life, behavior problems, depression, low self-esteem, and difficult peer relationships7,8.  With 
some recent fluctuation, rates of overweight and obesity among all children remain 2-3 times higher than 30 years ago1,9.
Expert g
uidelines for obesity treatment involve a four- stage approach. Stage 1 (prevention -plus) involves healthy eating 
and activity and can be implemented with brief counseling at routine primary care visits; Stage 2 (structured weight 
management) adds specific eating and activity goals and increased monitoring and can take place in primary care or 
specialty care settings; Stage 3 (comprehensive intervention) adds more frequent and structured visits with members of the multidisciplinary team (behavioral counselor, dietician, activity specialist) in a specialty care setting; and Stage 4 (terti ary 
treatment) adds options for medication, severe dietary restriction, o r surgery
10.  
Pediat
ric clinicians can play a crucial role in treating childhood obesity: as trusted  professionals, they provide the majority 
of pr imary care to children in the US , routinely monitor growth, and have frequent contact [CONTACT_150317]11-13. Treatment efforts in pediatric primary care offer an important opportunity to address weight problems at an 
earlier age, and to monitor obesity- related behaviors and outcomes over time14,15.  Recent reviews indicate that to date, 
there has been limited research on effective treatment interventions in primary care16,17. One recommended approach that 
builds on existing capacity of pediatric pr imary care and uses clinicians to deliver the intervention is M otivational 
Interviewing (MI)  - a patient- centered clinical counseling style used by [CONTACT_150318]18,19. In fact, MI is a recomm ended approach to implement Stage 1 and Stage 2 of pediatric obesity treatment (see 
above)10.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], few pediatric clinicians receive training in MI  (though many have a strong interest in receiving 
additional training in this area) , and many report feeling unprepared to use it and ineffective when they do use it to counsel 
their overweight o r obese patients20-22. 
13. PROTOCOL
Please answer ALL the questions below using as much space as necessary  to provide a clear, detailed description 
of your research protocol.  
a.Describe the purpose, major research questions and hypotheses of the proposed study.
The proposed study builds upon our prior efficacy trial – Brief Motivational Interviewing to Redu ce Body Mass Index 
(BMI2): AAP IRB protocol # 07 RE 01 – which showed statistically and clinically significant reductions in BMI 
percentile in overweight and obese children 2- 8 years old whose parents received the intervention versus usual care over 2 
years. We now propose a randomized trial that compares the effectiveness of an enhanced version of the BMI2 
intervention – referred to as BMI2+ throughout this application – versus usual care in pediatric primary care practices 
across the US. Similar to BMI2, the BMI2+ intervention involves training pediatric clinicians and registered dietitians  (RD) 
in Motivational Interviewing (MI) , and subsequent delivery of up to 10 MI- based counseling sessions to parents of 
overweight or obese youth, 3-8 years old  at enrollment , over 2 years. Enhancements include: 
•Provision of MI counseling by [CONTACT_150319], supervised, and located in the University of Michigan
Center for Health Communications Research
•Use of a study dashboard, which provides study clinicians, parents, RDs, and study team  members at the
University of Michigan  a graphical user interface for securely accessing content
•Analyses of population level effects, in addition to effectiveness for study patients

ate that at 2 -year follow- up, children of parents  that enroll and participate in the intervention, as well as the 
broader population of children of all eligible parents in Intervention arm practices , will show a net mean decrease in BMI 
z-score and BMI percent ile compared to children in Usual Care arm practices.

Pleas
e refer to Data Flow diagrams (Attachment G.1) and the Protection of Data grid (Attachment G.2) for further 
information about the steps below.  
Please s
ee section 14, Participant Identification, Recruitment and Selection, for recruitment details .   
     Step 1 : 
 Practice / clinician  enrollment  and consent   
•PROS staff will send the C linician Eligibility Survey (Attachment B) and Study P articipation Form
(Attachment C) to interested PCC clients by [CONTACT_6968], fax, and / or US mail / express courier (FedEx/UPS).
•After  v
erify ing that interested clinician s are eligible to participate based on their responses to the Clinician
Eligibility Survey (Attachment B ) and Study Participation Form (Attachment C) , PROS staff will send an
enrollment packet containing the Clinician Obesity Experience Survey (Attachment D), C linician Consent
Form (Attachment E), Individual Investigator Agreement ( IIA-see below  for a description ), and PROS
intake forms via email , fax, and / or US mail  / express courier (FedEx/UPS) to clinicians. The PROS
intake forms are standard PROS forms and are therefore not included as an attachment in this application .
The IIA is an IRB pre-approved form and process, and also not included as an attachment in this
application. Clinicians will be asked to complete and return all  forms in the enrollment packet to PROS;
all materials except the Data Use Agreement (DUA) and Data Transfer Agreement (DTA) - see below  -
must be received by [CONTACT_150322].
○ PROS r
equires e ach participating clinician  and study coordinator to complete the National
Institutes of Health  “Protecting Human Research Subjects ” online course, and to provide their
certification date and number on an AAP -endorsed Individual Investigator Agreement (IIA) .  The
IIA must be completed before the practice can be randomized .
○ All RD
s will complete the Michigan online Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible
Research and Scholarship (PEERS) prior to initiating patient contact.
•A Data Use Agreem
ent (DUA) ( Attachment F.2) between the AAP and each practice,  as well as a Data
Transfer Agreement (Attachment F.5 ) between the University of Michigan and each practice, will be
included in the enrollment packet .
○ The DU
A allows for the transfer of a HIPAA limited dataset  at baseline, the end of the intervention
period, and the end of the study as a whole from the EHR vendor – PCC (the “data transfer agent”)
– to the data coordinating center at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (see Attachment F.1)
○ The DT
A is used in conjunction with parent HIPAA authorization to allow for the free exchange of
study- related and clinical information between the practice and RDs / researchers at the University
of Michigan  during the study  (see Attachment F.1)

Page 8 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/[ADDRESS_173577] be received by [CONTACT_150323] (see Step 3 below).    
•Should any pa
rticipating practices have their own local IRB, approval from those IRBs would also be
obtained; procedures for this are in place as part of the PROS network.
Step 2:
  Practice randomization 
•Once a p
ractice completes enrollment, PROS staff will send [CONTACT_150543] (RStat) – the study
biostatistician – or his designee a spreadsheet containing PROS practice ID and practice characteristics
(including the estimated percentages of patients by [CONTACT_55494]) as reported on the PROS intake
form .
•[CONTACT_150544]
han – blinded to practice name – will pair match practices based  on estimated percentages of
patients by [CONTACT_55494]  (as reported on the PROS intake form).
•Within 
pairs, one practice will be randomly assigned to t he Usual Care  arm and the other practice to the
Intervention arm.
•[CONTACT_150544]
han will securely transfer the spreadsheet, with assigned study arm  included, to  PROS staff.
•PROS 
will inform each participating clinician about th eir practice’s assigned study arm.
Step 3:
   Baseline  EHR and billing  data collection 
•PROS  will 
send signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_150233] (Attachments F.2 and F.3) to PCC staff  assigned to this
project ; this is done so that PCC has  documentation that the practice has agreed to allow them  to send
practice EHR data to The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].
•PROS 
staff will securely transfer a spreadsheet linking  the name [CONTACT_150522]’ s assigned study arm  to PCC.
•PCC will  d
evelop a query and conduct an initial data extraction for up to 25 practices (to allow for
replacement if a practice drops out before the clinician training sessions begin in fall 2017, and achieve a
final sample size of 18 practices) .
○PCC 
will extract a HIPAA limited dataset that contains all IRB approved EHR and billing data
elements (listed in Attachment G.2, #5 ) for all children in a ll participating  practice s that are at
least 3, but less than 8, years of age on the date  of the baseline data pull , regardless of who their
primary care provider is . PCC will extract data for the previous 24 months for all of these
children.
○PCC 
will prepare a separate file that links the  IDs of each participating clinician with their
practice’s  ID and study arm assignment. This will allow CHOP to identify clinicians that are
participating in this study and link them with their practice’s assigned study arm . This is needed
so that CHOP can identify children whose parents are eligible for recruitment.
•Once the data are extracted but before sending to the data coordinating center at CHOP, PCC will perform
a series of pre- transmission steps (defined in Attachment H.1) to ensure that the HIPAA limited dataset
does not include any unauthorized protected health information (PHI).
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 9 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  •PCC will securely transfer the data to CHOP
•Withi n a
pproximately one week of data transfer, [CONTACT_150545] ndmeier or his assigned designee at
CHOP will review the data to confirm that only allowable PHI elements are included.  If unauthorized
data are  included, the steps outlined in Attachment I.1 will be taken.
Step 4
:   Define cohort of patients whose parents are eligible to participate 
•CHOP 
will clean all growth data  using an established method23, and subsequently note out of range,
erroneous height and weight values.
•CHOP 
will then apply remaining inclusion and exclusion criteria ( described in section 13b) to generate a
list of children within each of the 18 practices whose parents are eligible to participate in the study . At the
end of this process, each eligible child in all participating practices will be linked with a study clinician –
if a child did not have their most recent well -child visit with a study clinician, they are not eligible to
participate (Intervention arm) or be a part of the comparison cohort (Usual Care arm). However,
they would contribute data towards the population- level a nalysis in Study Aim # 3.
Step 5:
   Refine cohort of patients who se parents are eligible to participate in the study (Intervention arm  
ONLY) 
•CHOP will se curely  transfer to PCC a list of unique IDs for children in Intervention arm practices whose
parents are eligible to participate in the study and whose clinician completed the in -person MI training
(see Step 6). This list will contain patient study ID, clinician ID (corresponding to the clinician that CHOP
assigns to that child in step 4), and practice ID.  Note that study IDs for children within Usual Care
arm practices will NOT be sent back to PCC because families of these children will NEVER be
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], although their EHR data will be used for outcomes analysis.
•For eac
h Intervention arm practice, PCC will add a “BMI2+ eligible flag” for each eligible child  within
the practice’s EHR system . PCC will help each practice use that flag to generate a list of eligible patients
with accompanying data , on the practice’s server,  that includes :
opatient first and last name
[CONTACT_150523]
•Partic
ipating clinicians in that practice will be asked to review the list of patients and make further
exclusions within the list  based on their clinical judgement within 2 weeks . During t raining (see Section
13c, step 6), clinicians will be instructed to exclude only those patients who may not benefit from the
intervention, such as  those with social circumstances that may not be captured by [CONTACT_14578] (e.g.,
homelessness, a recent death in the family, etc.).
•PCC w
ill securely copy the list from each practice’s server back to a PCC server  at the end of the 2- week
period.
•Using 
the lists of patients that have been reviewed by [CONTACT_75872], PCC will create a fully identified
contact [CONTACT_150324] s whose
parent  is eligible to participate  (removing parents of children excluded by [CONTACT_150325]) :
opatient study ID
opatient first and last name
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 10 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  opatient age (in months)
oaccount id
oparent / guardian  first and last name

oparent / guardian email address
oparent / guardian  postal  address
opatient primary language
oname [CONTACT_150525] ( corresponds to the clinician that CHOP assigns to
that child in Step 4 )
opractice ID, name , address, and phone number
•Once the d
ata are extracted but before sending it to the University of Michigan , PCC will perform a series
of pre- transmission steps (defined in Attachment H.2) to ensure that the fully identified contact [CONTACT_150327] (PHI).
○ The Business Associate Agreement (BAA) between PCC and the University of Michigan allows for
the transfer of patient contact [CONTACT_3031], without HIPAA authorization, for the purposes of study
recruitment (see Attachment F. 6)
•Within a
pproximately one week of data tran sfer, [CONTACT_150546]  will review the data to confirm that only
allowable PHI elements are included.  If unauthorized data are included, the steps outlined in Attachment
I.2 will be taken.
Step 6:   T
raining  (Intervention arm)  
•Study Coordinators (in participating practices)
Study coord
inators will be trained in all study procedures via telephone 
•Clinicians  in participating practices and Registered Dieticians (RDs)  at the University of Michigan
A core elemen t of our intervention will be a 2.5 da y, interactive, in-pers on train ing session  for clinicians  and 
RDs to enh ance their con fidence, skills, an d clinical e f fectiveness for p rev ention  and  treatment  of pediatric 
obesi
ty. T his training  session offers 11 ho ur s of face -to-face tr aining  in M otivat ional I nte rviewing (MI), 1 
hour of face-to-face training i n behavioral t herapy , and additional training in billing and coding for pediatric 
obesity and the study protocol. B efore parent recruitment  can begin, all participating clinicians (n=1- 2 per 
practice) and the study coordinator within a practice must complete study training.   
All training sessions will be conducted by [CONTACT_978] (PI), with assistance from PROS and University of Michigan 
staff, p
lus outside experts. Ideally, clinicians and RDs will be trained simultaneously, at the same in-person 
training sess
ion. However, RDs may be trained separately at the University of Michigan, if this is logistically 
more feasible.  Clinicians 
will select one of two identical training sessions to participate in; if they cannot 
participate in either one, they may be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_150234]. 
  
Over 25 ye ars, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_150235] a curriculum that includes a mix of didactic and e xperiential 
activities, teaching MI sk ills with real time constructive feedback. Core MI techniques include the u se of 
reflective
 l
istening, allowing the client to interpret information, agenda setting, rolling with resistance, 
building discrepancy  and  eliciting self-m otivational s tatements or “change talk.”  Rather than positioning MI 
as an entirely new counseling model for clinicians and RDs, we will show participants how to integrate this 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 11 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  approach into their current counseling “culture.” For clinicians,  we will demonstrate ho w to integrate the MI 
approach within the “culture” of anticipatory guidance whereas for RDs, this entails integrating MI within the 
“culture” of dietary therapy and nutrition education.  
Each part
icipant  will have one st andardized, role -played patient en counter that is videotaped  during the 
training session, with scoring using the One Pass system. One Pass is a MI fidelity assessment and supervision 
tool; it requires raters to listen to a clinical encounter only once before providing feedback24. While 
preliminary feedback will be given immediately to the participant, they will also receive a consultative phone 
call from an MI trainer at the University of Michigan several weeks later, during which they will discuss the ir 
performance in greater detail . 
A second s
tandardized patient encounter with feedback from a University of Michigan MI trainer will occur 
over the phone, and be audiorecorded, approximately [ADDRESS_173578] the option of 
seeing encounters showing both clinicians  and RDs.  
A smaller
 portion of training time will focus on behavior therapy techniques specifically related to pediatric 
obesity, such as strategies to help parents make the changes they choose (versus prescribing particular  
changes). Key strategies will include tips for parents to set and implement gradual goals, and reinforce and 
manage their child’s changes in behavior and the child’s self -monitoring of their own behavior.  
Remain
ing time in the tr aining session will be used to review the study protocol (including obtaining verbal 
parent consent  and HIPAA authorization, documentation of consent and HIPAA authorization in the EHR, 
scheduling / documentation of MI counseling visits , etc. ). Participants will also  receive training from experts 
on options for coding and billing for obesity- related services, and review current recommendations for obesity 
treatment in primary care.  
Maintenance of Cer tification (MOC) and Continuing M edical Educa tion (CME)  credit  
Clinicians in the Intervention arm will have the opportunity to earn MOC points and CME  credits in several 
ways.  All MOC and CME activities will be administered by [CONTACT_17901] , and have already 
been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_150328]’s Office of Continuous 
Professional Development. We will submit more detail about this QI project in a future amendment  
1)For part
icipating in the 2.5-day training workshop, clin icians can earn:
•American Board of Pediatrics Part II MOC: 18.75 points
AND
•Live activity CME:  18.75 AMA PRA Category 1 CME credits
2)Clini
cians can choose to complete an optional 18-month quality improvement project to earn:
•American Board of Pediatrics Part IV MOC:  1 Performance in Practice activity or 25 points,
depending on year of recertification
AND
•Performance Improvement CME: 30 AMA PRA Category 1 CME credits
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 12 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  Their performance on up to three Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) metrics 
related to the assessment and treatment of pediatric overweight and obesity will be determined by [CONTACT_150329]. At the end of each time period, 
PCC will generate clinician -specific feedback reports directly within the practice EHR (for those that chose 
to enroll in the optional QI study), and also securely transfer a copy of each report to the study team at the 
University of Mic higan. Each clinician will then participate in a one on one telephone call with a study team 
member at the University of Michigan to review and discuss their results. During the call, the study team 
member  will help the physician brainstorm about ways to improve performance. 
MOC dat
a will be kept separate from all research data, and will not be used for research analyses.  Upon 
completion of the feedback calls , feedback reports and any notes from the feedback calls will be sent to the 
University of Michigan  MOC office for management per MOC procedures, and will *not* be kept by [CONTACT_150330].  
Opting i
n for voluntary MOC / CME is independent from, and not covered by, informed consent for the 
research study.  
Step 7:  
Training  (Usual Care  arm ) 
Clini
cians will be trained in all study procedures via phone and webinar. Intervention arm t raining sessions on 
coding and billing for obesity- related services, as well as review of current recommendations for obesity 
treatment in primary care, will be videotaped  and made available to all Usual Care arm clinicians  via a n 
emailed  YouTube link or a study dashboard link and passcode. For the latter, clinicians will be given access to 
a specific link via the dashboard interface that houses these videos (see Step [ADDRESS_173579] graphical user interface (GUI); they will not be able to access any of the Intervention arm 
components of the study.   
In-person training in Motivational Interviewing and Behavioral Therapy will be offered to participating clinicians in Usual Care arm practices after the intervention period  has concluded.   Training will be identical 
to sessions described above in Step 6, with the following exceptions: 1) the length of the training session wil l 
be reduced to 1.5 days since study protocol and billing / coding training will have been completed at the start 
of the trial (see above paragraph) and 2) there will be no standardized patient encounter with feedback over 
the phone [ADDRESS_173580] the opportunity to earn MOC points and CME credits as follows.  
For part
icipating in the 1.5-day training workshop, they can earn: 
•American Board of Pediatrics Part II MOC: number of point s to be determined

Page 13 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  Step 8: Activate study dashboard  
The study team at the University of Michigan has created a study dashboard. The dashboard is not a physical 
storage repository, but instead provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to access content that is 
securely stored on a server at the University of Michigan. Its primary function is to allow RDs located at the 
University of Michigan to schedule, track, deliver, and document their counseling calls with enrolled parents 
during the intervention period. It also provides users with access to study- related content as described in the 
table below.  
*Interven
tion arm clinicians can see parent responses to survey questions, but only those that are directly
relevant to MI counseling / clinical care. Parent responses to research -based questions will only be viewable by
[CONTACT_150331]. of Michigan study team members (s ee attachments K and L : baseline parent surveys)
Access to spec
ific clinical, research and study procedures content via  the dashboard is restricted to up to f ive 
types of users:  1) RDs, 2) study clinicians in the Intervention arm, 3) participating parents in  the Intervention 
arm, and 4) Univ. of Michigan study team members. User authentication is required, and each user can only 
access the specific content that they have permission to view  (see table above).  5) Note that Usual Care arm 
clinicians , and  office staff  in both arms , may also be able to access content via the dashboard interface , but 
only for the purpose s of viewing billing and coding training videos (see step 7 above).   Content Use Access  Storage  Covered by

Step 9: Paren
t recruitment and  enrollment (Intervention arm only)  
See step
s 1-2b ( Parents: Intervention arm only ) in Section 14b for a complete description of this process. 
Step 10a: MI co
unselin g sessions delivered by [CONTACT_150333] (RD) (Intervention arm only)   
RDs cent
rally trained, supervised, and located at the University of Michigan Center for Health 
Communications Research will deliver up to [ADDRESS_173583] approximately 30 minutes. All cal ls will be recorded to 
facilitate the provision of ongoing feedback by [CONTACT_150334].   
•First MI counseling session  (after cons ent and HIPAA authorization have been obtained – see secti ons 15
and 17)
oAt the start of the call, the RD will remind the parent that the call will be recorded and that
summary notes from the call will be shared with their child’s clinician
oApproximately [ADDRESS_173584] will email
the parent a link to the baseline extended survey (Attachment L) . Up to [ADDRESS_173585] / last name  [CONTACT_150526]’s doctor’s office by [CONTACT_150335] (fax machine located in limited
access location) . The study coordinator may upload these notes into the EHR so that the clinician
can easily view them.
•Counseling calls #2-[ADDRESS_173586] will remind the parent that the call will be recorded and that
summary notes from the call will be shared with their child’s clinician
oThe RD will review  the content of the last session, discuss progress on previous goals, and ask
parents what they want to focus on this time.
oThe RD will use the Counseling Guide (Attachment M) to guide their discussion with the parent,
and the MI counseling that they provide. They will use the GoalCheck question to determine
progress towards past goals , and the GoalArea question to help parents select  one or more goals
that they would lik e to address during that call. Each goal has a corresponding subset of questions
which help elucidate current habits and behaviors within that area, readiness to change,
confidence to change, and desired timeframe for initiating change.
oThe RD will work with the parent  to schedule their next counseling call.
oDuring or after the call, the RD will create Summary Notes for the parent and Physician Summary
Notes for the clinician via the study dashboard.
oThe University of Michigan study team will send the RD Counseling Session Notes, RD-generated summary notes for the child’s study clinician [‘Physician Summary Notes ’], RD
counseling session  date, and patient first / last name [CONTACT_150527]’s
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 15 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  doctor’s office by [CONTACT_150336]. The study coordinator may upload these notes into the EHR so that 
the clinician can easily view them.      
Step 1 0b:  M
I counseling sessions deli vered by [CONTACT_75872]  (Intervention arm only)  
Clinician
s will deliver up to [ADDRESS_173587] 
approximately 15 minutes.  
Step 1 0c:  
Parent withdrawal from the study (Intervention arm only)  
Parents can withdraw from the study at any time. The parent can withdraw by  [CONTACT_150337], 
the RD, or by [CONTACT_115864] – study Principal Investigator – directly. If a parent withdraws, 
his/her 
study-r elated counseling sessions with clinicians and RDs will end, he/she will no 
longer receive surveys, 
he/she will no longer have access to the study dashboard, and all contact [CONTACT_150338]. We 
will 
continue to securely store and analyze all data that the parent has provided up to the date of 
withdrawal, and will continue to extract their HIPAA limited data through 
the end of the study as a whole, 
as permitted in the Data Use Agreements (s ee Attachment F.1). 
If 
a parent withdraws by [CONTACT_150339], the University of Michigan study team will 
electronically transmit to PCC their child’s study ID an d practice ID. PCC will update a corresponding 
status flag in
 the EHR, and an automatic email notification will be sent to the practice study coordinator. 
If a parent withdraws through the study clinician, the study coordinator will update the correspondi ng status 
flag in the EHR and inform the study team at the University of Michigan by [CONTACT_150340] (fax machine located in limited  access location within 
the Center for
 Health  Communications Research).  
Step 1 1:  EHR 
and billing data collection at the end of the intervention period , and linkage with parent survey  
responses, RD clinical counseling  notes , and full contact [CONTACT_3031]  
•After the conclusion of the 2-year intervention period, PCC  will extract a HIPAA limited dataset 
containing all IRB approved EHR and billing data elements for all children in all practices that w ere at 
least 3, but less than 
8, years on the date of the baseline data pull. PCC will extract data for the previous 4 
years (which include s the
 2 years prior to the baseline data pull and the 2-y ear intervention period) for 
each child.
•Once the data are extracted but before sending it to the data coordinating center at CHOP, PCC will 
perform a series of pre-t ransmission steps (defined in Attachment H.1) to e nsure that the HIPAA limited 
dataset does not include any unauthorized protected health information (PHI).
•Once Statistical Lead o
r his designee at CHOP receives an email from PCC that data is ready to transfer, 
he or his designee will send  the designated PCC staff member a unique link to the CHOP secure file 
transfer website, along
 with information on how to upload data to the website.
•PCC will securely transfer the data to CHOP.
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 16 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  •Within approximately one week of data transfer, Dr, Grundmeier or his assigned designee will review the 
data to confirm that only allowable PHI elements are included.  If unauthorized data are included, 
the 
steps outlined in Attachment I.1 w ill be taken.
•If no unauthorized PHI is included, the CHOP team will clean all growth data.
•CHOP w ill
 securely transfer the cleaned HIPAA limited dataset (containing all IRB approved EHR and 
billing d ata
 elements for all children in all practices that met eligibility criteria on the date of the baseline 
data pull) to 
the study team at the University of Michigan.
•The study team at the University of Michigan will m erge the H IPAA limited d atafile from CHOP (see 
above bullet point) with parent survey data, R D clinical counseling notes, 
and full contact [CONTACT_3031], v ia 
study ID.
•The study team at the University of Michigan will look for evidence of potential adverse events in the  
merged dataset, focusing on growth data and other obesity-r elated measures . Though highly unlikely, a  
potential adverse event could be detected AFTER the intervention period has ended if, for example, the 
only evidence of  excessive weight loss is found w ithin the EHR (note this is the first time that the study 
team at 
the University of Michigan has access to the EHR data). Note that parents who withdraw during 
the intervention period will not be included in this 
review because we will no longer have permission to 
re-identify their child’s HIPAA limited dataset. A description of adverse event detection and reporting 
DURING the trial is provided in section 20 of this application.
•If there 
is any evidence of a potential adverse event within the dataset, the PI (study PI) will immediately 
contact [CONTACT_2252]’s doctor,  the 
AAP project manager, and the AAP IRB. Re taining full contact 
[CONTACT_150341] 5 is therefore necessary in  order to ensure the safety of our patient 
populations, and the study 
team’s ability to identify the child and inform the clinician should a potential  
event be 
detected.
•After the study team at the University of Michigan has completed their review of the merged dataset and 
adverse events ( if any) are appropriately addressed, they will:
oReview all clinical counseling notes to scrub any potential identifying content: for example,
[Johnny] would become [index child] or [father] or [brother] or [male relative/friend] or [boy] or 
[man]; Springer Park would become [park]; Lincoln school would become [school]; names of 
cities, 
streets, towns would become [city]; [street]; [town]. Any other geographic references will 
be similarly de-identified.
oDelete a ll co
ntact information received in Step 5 from the dataset and all servers at the University 
of Michigan.
•[CONTACT_150546]
 or his designee will sign an attestation letter (Attachment H.3) stating  that all identifiers 
within clinical counseling notes and all contact [CONTACT_150342], and send that 
letter
 to [CONTACT_150547] at the AAP.
Note that
 there is no way 1) any c hild in the Usual Care arm and 2) ineligible children in the 
Intervention arm ca
n be re-i dentified, as the University of Michigan will never receive p arent 
contact [CONTACT_150343].
It is extremely unlikely that children in the Intervention arm whose parents have opted out, refused 
to pa
rticipate, not been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or withdrawn from the study would b e re-i dentified, as the 
University
 of Michigan will delete all contact [CONTACT_150344]
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 17 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/[ADDRESS_173588] monthly during the intervention period , [CONTACT_150546] or 
his designee at the University of Michigan will si gn an at testation letter (Attachment H.4 ) stating 
that all such contact [CONTACT_150345], and send that to [CONTACT_150547] at the 
AAP.    
Children in the Intervention arm whose parents have provided consent and HIPAA authorization 
to link their HIPAA limited medical data with their survey  responses, full contact [CONTACT_3031], and 
RD clinical counseling  notes  will be re -identified.  However, as described in Step [ADDRESS_173589] 
informatio n will be deleted from datasets and study servers at the University of Michigan.   
Step 12:  EHR and billing data collection at the end of the study  as a whole  
•At the end of the study as a whole – estimated to occur approximately 1 year after th e conclusion of the 
intervention period – P CC will extract a
 HIPAA limited dataset from all participating  practices containing 
all IRB approved EHR and billing data elements for all children that were 
at least 3, but less than 8, years  
on the date of the baseline data pull. P CC 
will extract data for the previous 5 years (which includes the [ADDRESS_173590]-i ntervention) for 
each child.
•Once the data are extracted but before sending it to the data coordinating center at CHOP, PCC will 
perform a series of pre-t ransmission steps (defined  in Attachment H.1) to ensure that the HIPAA limited 
dataset does not include any unauthorized protected health information (PHI).
•Once Statistical Lead o
r his designee at CHOP receives an email from PCC that data is ready to transfer, 
he or his designee 
will send the designated PCC staff member a unique link to the CHOP secure file 
transfer website, along with information on how to upload data to the website.
•PCC will
 securely transfer the data to CHOP.
•Within approximately  o
ne week of data transfer, Dr, Grundmeier or his assigned designee will review the 
data to c
onfirm that only allowable PHI elements are included.  If unauthorized data are included, the 
steps o
utlined in Attachment I.1 will be taken.
•If no unauthorized PHI is included, the CHOP team will clean all growth data.
•CHOP will securely transfer the cleaned HIPAA limited dataset (containing all IRB approved EHR and 
billing  data
 elements for all children in all practices that were at least 3,  but less than 8, years on the date 
of the baseline data pull) to
 the s
tudy team at the University of Michigan.
•The study team at the University of Michigan will create a full study analytic dataset by [CONTACT_150346] (see above bullet point) with parent survey responses and scrubbed 
RD clinical counseling notes [per Step 11] collected 
during the intervention period, via study ID. S ee 
section 16e, “final analytic dataset”, for a description of the content of this dataset, and how it will be 
stored.
•At the end of the study as a whole, the study team at the University of Michigan will send a fully 
deidentified version of the aforementioned a nalytic dataset – removing study 
ID and all dates – and send  it 
to the AAP / PROS ongoing secondary analyses.

population etc. that you plan to use.   Please include copi[INVESTIGATOR_150236], surveys, interview questions, etc.
as appendices, and label each clearly so the IRB knows which questions, tool, etc. go with which re search activity.  If
a draft of one of these documents is provided, it should be clearly labeled as such and a final version must be
submitted before data collection begins.
Clinicians  
All clinicians will complete an eligibility survey (Attachment B) that captures information about their previous training 
in Motivational Interviewing , as well as their current work schedule [< half time (less than 6 sessions per week) vs > 
half time  (at least 6 sessions per week )]. This survey will be distributed to clinicians by [CONTACT_150347]. We will also survey all participating clinicians  about their current 
practices for obesity treatment  (Attachment D); we will do this twice – once at baseline and again after the 2-year 
intervention period concludes – to capture any changes in usual care. The baseline survey will be included in the 
enrollment packet  (described above in Section 13c, Step 1), and the post- trial survey will be sent by [CONTACT_150348] (as fillable PDFs) , US mail /express courier  (FedEx/UPS),  and / or deployed using Qualtrics. We will incorporate  
items from the AAP Periodic Survey of Fellows that have been valida ted to assess clinician practices for obesity 
prevention and treatment in primary care.  
As d escribed above in Section 13c (steps 6 and 7 ), each clinician will have one standardized, role- played patient 
encounter that is videotaped during the MI training session . This encounter will be  scored  using the One Pass system.

Procedur
es for EHR and billing data extraction are described above in Section 13c. 
Parents 
All p artic
ipating parents (Intervention arm only) will be asked to complete two surveys at study baseline – 1) a brief 
survey (Attachment K) completed shortly after study enrollment that asks parents to grade how their child is doing with 
respect to different eating, screen time, and physical activity behaviors and 2) a longer  survey (Attachment L) 
completed shortly before, or during, their first telephone counseling session with an R D that asks about their child’s 
daily intake of fruits, vegetables, specific drinks, and snacks, participation in sports, use of TV, and video/computer 
games . Links to these surveys will be emailed to enrolled parents by [CONTACT_150350]; 
parents log on to the study dashboard to complete these surveys. The surveys are designed to enable parents to explore and identify discrete behavior change goals that can be addressed by [CONTACT_150351].  
During al
l RD- delivered  telephone counseling sessions (except the first one ), RDs will use the  Counseling Guide 
(Attachment M ) to guide their discussion with the parent, and the MI counseling that they provide.  They will use the 
“GoalCheck” question to determine progress towards past goals, and the “GoalArea” question to help parents select one or more goals that they would like to address during that call.  Each goal has a corresponding subset of questions which help elucidate current habits and behaviors in that goal area, readiness to change, confidence that they can 
change, and when they will start implementing that change.  
At the 
conclusion of the 2- year intervention period , parents in the Intervention arm will be asked to complete a Follow-
up survey (Attachment N ) that captures their feedback regarding the perceived impact of the intervention on their 
child’s and family’s lifestyle behaviors (including weight, eating, and physical activity), as well as their satisfaction 
with clinic ian and RD counseling sessions.  Links to this survey will be emailed to parents by [CONTACT_150352].  Note that study clinicians and RDs will never be able to see these survey responses from the 
follow-up survey.  
e.Describe other important information related to your protocol, if any.
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 20 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  14. PARTICIPANT IDENTIFICATION, RECRUITMENT, & SELECTION
a.Describe how potential participants will be identified (e.g., advertising, individuals known to investigator,
record review, etc.). Explain how investigator(s) will gain access to this population, as applicable.
Practices and clinicians  
Potent
ial practices and clinicians will be identified through two mechanisms  that will be utilized simultaneously : 1) 
Physician’s Computer Compa ny (PCC) client database and 2) the well -established AAP Pediatric Research in Office 
Settings ( PROS ) research network .   
Parents (Intervention Arm only) 
Eligible
 parents will be identified after PCC extracts each practice’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) and billing data 
at study baseline; securely transmits it to the data coordinating center at CHOP ; CHOP cleans growth data,  applies 
study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and determines the cohort of eligible parents within each participating practice; 
and study clinicians make further exclusions to the list of eligibles (see Section 13c, steps 3-5).  
b.Describe the recruitment process, including the setting in which recruitment will take place and who will
conduct recruitment.   Provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_150237] (e.g., ads, flyers, website postings,
recruitment letters/emails, and oral/written scripts).
Practices and clinicians  
Recrui
tment through PCC 
Step 1:
    Recruitment materials  (Attachment s O and P ) will be sent to leadership at PCC. 
Step 2:     
PCC staff will utilize their normal business channels, as well as direct conversations with practices as 
needed , to inform their clients of the study. Clients may receive information about the study  at PCC -
sponsored conferences; small gifts (including pens, water bottles, and thumb drives) may accompany this 
information. 
Step 3:     
Clinicians interested in participating in the study will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_150353] .  
PCC and / or PROS staff may follow- up with practices if they do not initiate contact.  
Recruitment using PROS membership database  
Step 1:
    PROS study staff wi ll send recruitment materials ( attachment s B, C, O, and P ) via email , fax, or US 
mail/express courier (FedEx/UPS) to the contact [CONTACT_150354].  The contact [CONTACT_150355] 5 times ; if no response is received, contact [CONTACT_150356]. 
We will 
utilize these two recruitment methods simultaneously, and it is therefore possible that some practices will receive 
recruitm ent information / materials from both PCC an d PROS . 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 21 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  Parents (Intervention Arm only)  
Step 1:
    Up to 50 parents per practice (Intervention arm only) can enroll in the study. 
After 
all participating clinicians within a n Intervention arm  practice have completed in -person training, 
and after the study coordinator in that practice has completed study protocol training via telephone (both 
described in Section 13 c, Step 6), a n introductory letter (Attachment Q ) and study information sheet 
(Attachment R) will be sent by [CONTACT_150357], on practice letterhead and on  
behalf of the practice, to all eligible families in that practice  via US mail  and email . Eligible families will 
include those identified as such by [CONTACT_137108] (Section 13c, Step 4) and not excluded by a study clinician 
(Step 13c, Step 5). The introductory letter describes the purpose of the study, provides a number to which 
parents can send a text message if they wish to actively enroll (RDs will follow -up with a n “invitation” 
phone call), and provides opt -out information. The study information sheet provides more detailed 
information about the study, and includes all required elements of informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization. 
Step 2 :    P
arents will be recruited in one of two ways. 
Step 2a
:  Within 2 weeks of sending the introductory letter , RDs located in the centralized call center at the 
University of Michigan will call all eligible parents , except those who opted out of the study / refused to 
participate based on information provided in the introductory letter described above in Step 1, or did so at 
their child’s doctor’s office (see below).  
The RD 
will review the study information sheet and obtain verbal consent and HIPAA authorization as 
described  in Section 15d. T he RD will then activate that parent ’s study dashboard account, document their 
consent  and HIPAA authorization via  the dashboard , and provide them with  a link to the account , as well 
as a unique access code,  via phone and / or email. Parents will be encouraged to reset their account 
password at that  time.  
If a par
ent opts out of the study, refuses to participate  during the RD “invite call” , or cannot be reached 
after [ADDRESS_173594] monthly during the intervention period, [CONTACT_150546] or his designee at the 
University of Michigan will sign an at testation letter (Attachm ent H. 4) stating that all such contact 
[CONTACT_150345], and send that to [CONTACT_150547] at the AAP.     
Approxima
tely weekly , the University of Michigan study team will electronically transmit to PCC study 
ID and practice ID  for children whose parent: 
→ enrolled  and provided consent and HIPAA authorization  via UMich
→ opted out / refused to participate via UMich
→ could not be contact[CONTACT_150358] ; an 
automatic email notification will also be sent to the practice study coordinator.  
If a par
ent has already provided consent and HIPAA authorization at their child’s doctor’ s office (see Step  
2b below) , the RD will use the “invite call” as an opportunity to schedule the parent’s first RD counseling 
session.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 22 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  Step 2b :  After all participating clinicians within an Intervention arm practice have completed in -person trainin g, 
and after the study coordinator in that practice has completed study protocol training via telephone (both 
described in Section 13 c, Step 6), e ligible parents  may  be approached by [CONTACT_150359]’s clinician  during an 
office visit. Once the clinician opens the patient’s chart in the EHR, he/she will see one or more clinical 
alerts that indicate:  
→eligible  but not y et enrolled
→ enrolled and provided consent and HIPAA authorization
→ opted out / refused to participate
→ could not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]
→ withdrawn (see section 13c / step 10c)
If the pa
rent is eligible to participate but has not yet been enrolled by [CONTACT_150360]. of Michigan study team, 
the clinician will review the study information sheet and obtain verbal consent and HIPAA authorization 
as described in Section 15d. The clinician will document consent and HIPAA authorization by [CONTACT_150361].  The study coordinator will then alert the study team at the 
University of Michigan by [CONTACT_150362].  
If the pa
rent has already provided consent and HIPAA authorization as described above in Step 2a,  the 
clinician does not need to obtain consent and HIPAA authorization. 
If the pa
rent has opted out or refused to participate during an “invite” call with an RD (described in Step 
2a above), a clinical alert will appear in the EHR indicating that the clinician should not  discuss the 
study with the parent.

Use of study IDs 
Unique identifiers will be utilized in place of practice, clinician , and  / or patient names whenever possible.  
•The study statistician will only receive practice IDs (NOT names) for the purposes of randomization
•The data coordinating center at CHOP will only receive clinician and patient study IDs (NOT names) for
the purposes of identifying eligible childr en at base line.
•The crosswalk between clinician  study  ID and name  [CONTACT_150528] [CONTACT_150372].  The study team at the University of Michigan needs this in order
to communicate effectively with participating Intervention arm practice s.
•The crosswalk between patient study ID  and parent contact [CONTACT_3031]  (for eligible Intervention arm
parents only) will be created by [CONTACT_150373] (allowed by [CONTACT_150374] F.6) and intervention delivery  (allowed by [CONTACT_150375] R) . As described in Section 13c  / step 11, all clinical notes will be de -
identified and all contact [CONTACT_150376]. The final

Page 33 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  18. DATA ANALYSIS
Identify primary research questions and provide a brief overview of the analyses (data sources and variables to be 
used).  Detailed statistical plans are NOT needed.   
All variables will be examined for out of range values, distributional qualities, and missing values.  There is no “one size 
fits all” solution to violations of distributional assumptions or universal approaches to addressing missing data issues, but 
as they arise, the experienced data team will meet to discuss available transformations as needed for violations of 
distributional assumptions, and appropriate (if any) imputation methods for missing data.  Any imputations or transformations to the raw data will be carefully documented and be made transparent in any analysis or presentation.  Tables comparing intervention versus control groups will be created to assess effectiveness of randomization, and will 
help determine which additional variables should be included as additional covariates in multivariable analyses.  
Analysis of Primary Outcome (AIM 1  –effectiveness among patients of study clinicians trained in MI):   The primary 
outcome is BMI z- score at [ADDRESS_173601] used in prior projects (
https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/Calculator.aspx ).  A Generalized Linear Mixed Model 
(GLMM) will be the primary analytic approach where BMI z- score at 2 years is the primary outcome, and a 2 level 
primary indepe ndent variable “TX”: Usual Care=0, MI Training=1, along with baseline BMI z score as a covariate. 
Potential covariates include: days since baseline, sex, age, and ethnicity. The study employs a nested cohort design, with practices assigned to condition, as  such, outcome variables at the individual level are correlated. To control for cluster 
randomization effects (i.e. this induced correlation) we will utilize SAS/PROC MIXED. For all mixed analyses, practice 
will be treated as a random effect with TX condit ion nested in practice. Various autocorrelation structures will be tested, 
although simple unstructured (un) or variance components (vc) will be used for the random practice effect.  [CONTACT_150550], our chief statistical consultant, is an expert in mixed models and will guide these analyses for our study analyst. Key 
potential effect modifiers include age, race, and gender and on the provider level, pediatrician vs. family practitioner.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Outcome (AIM 2  – effectiveness among patients of study clinicians trained in MI and whose 
parent actively participates in the intervention ): Although the primary intention to treat analyses described analytically 
above for Aim [ADDRESS_173602] this secondary aim.  
Analysis of Sub- AIM 2a  – dose -response : To further investigate how exposure to the intervention influences change in 
BMI, we will investigate the dose response relationship. Dose can be computed by [CONTACT_150385]/duration values associated 
with each CPT code. Dose will be classified in several ways (no exposure versus any exposure) and by [CONTACT_24975]/amount of 
exposure (PCP only, RD telephone only, and PCP and RD telephone). Within the latter groups we will further categorize 
patients as above and below threshold which for PCPs is [ADDRESS_173603] the TX variable in the regr ession equations with an ordinal variable corresponding to the number of intervention 
sessions actually received, both among the intervention group only, and then including the control group with ordinal score of zero.
 
Analysis of AIM 3  – population level effects : To assess the effect of the intervention on the primary outcome  at the 
population level, we will employ a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) approach, similar to the analytic plan for AIM I, where BMI z- score at 2 years is the primary outcome, and a 2 level primary independent variable “TX”: Usual 
Care=0, MI Training=1, along with baseline BMI z score as a covariate. Data from all age-eligible children in all 
participating practices will be included in the analysis.

783, 280). The actual revenue generated can be determined by [CONTACT_150386]. For example at U of M a [ZIP_CODE] epi[INVESTIGATOR_150244] $74.26 from BCBS and $19.07 from Medicaid whereas for a [ZIP_CODE] we 
receive $108.47 from BCBS and $30.[ADDRESS_173605], which is only reimbursed by [CONTACT_150387], 
is billed at $35 per 15 minutes. We will obtain the payo r rates for all potential obesity -related counseling services  for each 
major p ayer of our practices. Revenue generated will be compared between groups using mixed effects regression as 
noted above for BMI z.  
RE-AIM analyses and their associated metrics are described below. During grant years 4 and 5 we will continue to 
monitor inte rvention implementation (physician and RD counseling rates), reach (parental uptake of MD and RD 
counseling), and impact (BMI Z) in the initial intervention group as well as the UC group practices that will receive the 
MI training  in grant year 4.  This wi ll enable us to determine both long term adoption patterns among the original 
intervention group as well as document initial implementation among the UC practices. All of these metrics are captured using the data collection instruments described above.  
RE-AIM ME
ASURES  
Dimension  Definition  Metrics  
Reach  The absolute number, proportion, and 
representativeness of individuals who are 
willing to participate in a given initiative, 
intervention, or program.  Number and proportion of patients recruited per 
practice and arm; Representativeness of the 
participants determined by [CONTACT_150388].  
Effectiveness  The impact of an intervention  Change in BMI z score at 2 year follow -up. 
Adoption  The absolute number, proportion, and 
representativeness of settings and 
intervention agents (people who deliver the 
program) who are willing to initiate a 
program.  Number and proportion of eligible clinic sites 
that agree to participate in the program.  
Representativeness of delivery agents 
(clinicians ) participating in the program 
compared to other PROS and overall AAP 
membership  
Implementation  At the setting level, implementation fidelity 
to the various elements of an intervention, 
including consistency of delivery as inten ded 
and the time and cost of the intervention. At 
the individual level, implementation refers to 
clients' use of the intervention strategies.  Process indicators such as billing patterns from 
EHRs; Monitoring fidelity to MI including  
review of a random selection of calls scored by 
[CONTACT_150389], and tracking forms completed 
after each encounter; Uptake of MI by [CONTACT_150390] -trial EHR data 
Maintenance  The extent to which a program/policy 
becomes institutionalized or part of the 
routine org anizational practices and policies. 
In addition, maintenance can be applied to 
the individual -level outcomes 6 + months 
after the most recent intervention contact.  Individual:  BMI Z will be monitored in both 
Intervention and U sual Care arms through years 
4 and 5 
Organizational:  Clinic billing records in Int and 
UC practices monitored throughout the study 
assess if MI strategies are still being employed.  
Attrition Analyses . We will compare baseline characteristics of children lost to follow -up (defined as no follow up BMI 
data at least one year from the baseline value) with cohort members to examine selective or differential attrition. For 
instance, did children with higher levels of BMI disproportionately drop out of the program before follow-up 
height/w eight assessments? Selective attrition (i.e., do cohort members differ from drop outs for the entire sample) will be 
considered as a threat to external validity, i.e., generalizability. Presence of differential attrition (difference in drop outs 
between tr eatment groups) will be reported as a threat to internal validity.

Page 35 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  19. BENEFITS & INCENTIVES
Describe the benefits to the individual.  State if there are no direct benefits to individual participants.  If subjects 
will receive compensation or other incentives to participate, describe the incentive, including the amount and 
timing of all payments.   
Clinician s 
•Durin
g the practice recruitment phase, clinicians interested in learning more about the BMI2+ study may
receive small gifts (e.g., pens, water bottles, and thumb drives) at PCC- sponsored conferences
•Participating clinicians  will attend an in -person training workshop with all expense s paid . This will occur prior
to parent recruitment for Intervention arm clinicians,  and will be offered to Usual Care arm clinicians after the
conclusion of the 2- year intervention period.
•Board certified pediatricians in both arms will be eligible to receive optional Maintenance of Certification
(MOC) Part 2 points and live activity CME credit s upon completion of the in-person training workshop.
•Intervention arm clinicians will be  eligible to receive optional MOC Part [ADDRESS_173606] with repeated feedback
cycles.
•Participating clinicians in both study arms will receive training in billing and c oding for obesity- related
services (in -person for Intervention arm clinicians, and via recorded webinar for Usual Care arm clinicians).
•Intervention Arm practices will be reimbursed $2000 for the research work that is required for being in this
study. Specifically, they will receive $50 0 after participating clinicians (n=1 -2) and the study coordinator
complete training, another $500 approximately 1 year after the baseline data pull , and $1000 upon completion
of the 2-year trial. Usual Care practices wi ll receive ½ of this amount ($250  after completion of study protocol
training, $ 250 approximately 1 year after the baseline data pull , and $500 at the end of the 2- year trial), since
they will not need a study coordinator and will not be asked to help enro ll or provide MI counseling to eligible
parents. On a practice -by-practice basis, the clinicians  will decide how to distribute the total remu neration.
•Pediatric clinicians and RDs may experience benefits of in -depth MI training beyond the proposed study
period, as MI counseling is applicable to a wide range of health behaviors.
•A less tangible benefit to individual clinicians is that the results of this study could impact training, policy, and
reimbursement of obesity care in pediatric primary care practices.
Study coordinators  
•Study coordinators in participating Intervention arm practices may receive small gifts (such as pens, water
bottles, etc…) as a token of appreciation throughout the study
Parents / children  (Intervention Arm only)  
•Parents an
d families may benefit from information on healthy eating, physical activity, and screen time habits.
•All telephone MI counseling sessions with Registered Dieticians (RDs) will be provided free of charge.
•Parents will receive education materials on the study dashboard free of charge  (Attachment J) .
20. RISKS
Describe the potential risks to the subject and precautions that will be taken to minimize them.  Consider the range 
of risks, including physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic.    
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 36 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  Risks to participating clinicians and parents, and to the children of participating parents, will be minimal.  
Clinicians  
•There m
ay be inconveniences to clinicians in both arms for the time spent completing surveys.
•There may be inconveniences to clinicians in the Intervention Arm for the time spent delivering MI counseling to
enrolled parents, and to study coordinators for the time spent completing study procedures.
•Practice staff may experience some risk of discomfort among parents who are uncomfortable discussing weight
issues in their family.
Parents / children  
•There i
s a minimal risk of loss of confidentiality, including potential disclosure of a child’s personal health
information (PHI). As described in Section  16b, we will implement numerous safeguards to avoid any potential
breach of such information.
•There may be inconveniences to parents in the Intervention arm for the time spent completing surveys and
participating in the MI counseling sessions.
•Parents may be required to pay co -pays for clinician -delivered MI counseling sessions, depending on their
insurance plan.
•Parents might experience discomfort discussing their own or their child’s weight issues and lifestyle behaviors;the MI training offe red to pediatric clinicians is designed to help allay this potential discomfort.
•A theoretical risk for children during the trial is excessive weight loss and / or disordered eating. Although there
was no evidence of this in our prior study, our Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor these
potential adverse reactions. Every 6 months, during a telephone counseling sessio n, RDs will ask four questions
that elicit information about disordered eating behaviors and excessive weight loss. The f our questions are:
1) Are you w
orried at all that your child binge eats or loses control over how much he or she eats?
2) Are you worried at all that your child is too thin or losing too much weight?3) Are you worried at all that your child is preoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_150245]?
4)Are you worried at all that your child is overly restrictive with what he or she eats?
Clinic
ians will also ask these questions as needed throughout the 2- year intervention period (based on their 
clinical judgement).  
The RDs a
nd clinicians will probe positive responses to any of these 4 questions to determine the existence of 
clinically meaningful disordered eating or excessive weight change.  Disordered eating or excessive weight change 
warranting referral  for additional screening or treatment will be considered a potential adverse event.    
If there is any evidence of a possible adverse event, the following steps will be taken: 
1)The RD or clinician will c ontact the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_173607]. Kendrin Sonneville – 
lead RD on t he 
University of Michigan study team – will call the study coordinator or clinician at the 
relevant practice within 
2 days to  alert them of this event.
2)the PI w
ill contact [CONTACT_65746] p roject manager, the AAP IRB, the University of Michigan IRB,  and t he 
study DSMB.
3)The DSMB
 will assess the relationship of the adverse event as not related, possibly  related, or 
definitely related
 to the intervention using standard criteria for clinical trials. Serious adverse events 
are h ighly unlikely in this minimal risk trial, in which no medications are administered. Should they 
occur, the funder will be notified.
4)Clinicians w
ill utilize the follow-up / referral plan that they have in place in their practice.
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Page 37 of 41 Form Date: 11/7/16  5)Approximately 1 month after alerting the practice to a potential adverse event (see step 1 above), [CONTACT_150551] will call the study coordinator or clinician to ensure that the referral was made.
21. ALTERNATIVE TO THE RESEARCH
Describe any  alternatives available to the s ubject s. 
Children of parents  participating in the study, of those who decline to participate, and of those who withdraw from the 
study will continue to receive the current standard of medical care from their  clinician s. However, it should be noted 
that HIPAA limited datasets that contain EHR and billing data for all age-eligible children  in a practice will be utilized 
for study analyses, regardless of whether their parent is participating in the study or not.    
22.RESEARCH RELATED COSTS
Describe any costs that will be incurred as a result of the research procedures that are over and above what 
would be incurred by [CONTACT_150391] (e.g., additional diagnostic tests, additional patient visits, drugs, etc.),  
and indicate who will be respo nsible for payment for them .  
Parents may be required to pay co -pays for clinician -delivered MI counseling sessions, depending on their insurance 
plan.  These costs will not be covered by [CONTACT_5051].  
Practices in the Interventio n Arm are required to identify at least 1  study coordinator to facilitate execution of the study 
within the practice and communication with study team members at AAP/PROS and the University of Michigan . The 
$[ADDRESS_173608], although practices can choose how to allocate those funds.  
Clinicians in the Intervention Arm will not be able to see patients, and will not be reimbursed for their time, during the 
in-person training session.  This is clearly stated in the clinician consent form (Attachment D).

Introduction  
This consent  form describes  a research study  and what to expect if you decide to participate.   You are 
encouraged  to read  this consent form carefully and ask any further  questions  before making your  decision 
about whether or not to participate.  This study  is being conducted  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ken Resnicow  – Professor  of Health 
Behavior and Healt h Education at the University  of Michigan S
chool of Public  Health – and the American 
Academy  of Pediatrics  (AAP)  / Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS) Network.  It has been approved  by 
[CONTACT_150402] (IRB). 
We are recruiting  up to 2 clinicians from each of 18 pediatric  primary  care practices acros s the US to 
participate  in this study. You are being asked  to participate  because your  practice uses the Physician’s  
Computer  Company  (PCC) Electronic  Health  Record system. 
Purpose of Study 
The overall  goal  of this study  is to test the effectiveness  of Motivational  Interviewing  – a patient‐centered 
behavioral  counseling  approach  – delivered  by [CONTACT_150403] 3‐[ADDRESS_173613] 2 years.      
Main  Outcomes  
Data collected during this study  will be used to study the effectiveness  of the intervention  versus usual  care 
on body  mass  index (BMI), and will answer two overarching  questions:    
•Can visits with MI‐trained  clinicians and RDs help  parents reduce their  child’s BMI?
•If some  clinic ians in  a practice are trained  in MI, is there an overall effect at the practice level on child
obesity?
Practice Inclusion Criteria 
Pediatric primary  care practices that utilize the PCC Electronic  Health  Record system.  Practices  randomized  
to the Intervention  arm must also  assign a member of their office staff as study  coordinator  for this project. 
Practice Exclusion Criteria 
Practices are ineligible if a comprehensive  weight loss program and / or access to a Registered  Dietitian is 
offered at the practice. Making referrals for either of these services is not an exclusion  criterion.   
Clinician Exclusion  Criteria 
Clinicians  are ineligible if they received > [ADDRESS_173614] 10 
years, and / or previously  participated  in the American  Academy  of Pediatrics’  BMI2 (Brief Motivational  
Interviewing  to Reduce Child BMI) or HLS (Healthy Lifestyles  Study)  studies.

Release of Relevant PHI Agreement
My practice has an agreement with the AAP to participate in the IRB-approved “Population 
Effects of Motivational Interviewing on Pediatric Obesity in Primary Care (BMI2+)” study. This 
agreement authorizes PCC to release and transfer relevant PHI from my practice for the 
purposes of this research project.
I understand that this project will encompass the following activities:
•Throughout my participation in the BMI2+ Study, PCC will extract HIPAA-limited
clinical data for patients 3-8 years of age and this data will be delivered securely to a
study team at the Children's Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].
•If my practice is randomized to the intervention arm of the study, PCC will extract a
fully identified contact [CONTACT_150465] (PHI) for patients

purposes of recruitment.
•All necessary legal agreements are in place to ensure the protection of privacy of my
practice and all of our patients.
•PCC will extract only the information required for the completion of this project.
•PCC will make every effort to make the data extraction process invisible to me and my
staff.
•If our office has any questions, we will contact [CONTACT_150466] ([PHONE_3363] or

Revised: June 1, [ADDRESS_173644],  and  can be cheap. It can be a fun family experience!  However,  
like anythin
g else, the key is finding the right  balance between meal splurges and  healthy 
eating. It can be hard to find healthy options when you’re  eating out, and eating  too many 
unhealthy  options can lead to health  problems.   
Eating on the go 
It can be easy to make healthy choices  at a fast‐food restaurant,  the mall,
 or even the cafeteria!  
Most cafeterias  and  fast‐food places offer healthy choices that  are also  tasty, like grilled chicken 
or salads. Be mindful of portion sizes and  add‐ ons that are high in  saturated  fat and  salt,  like 
dressings,  sauces, or cheese sauce.  
Here are some pointers that may help  when eating  out:  
•Go for balance. Choose meals that contain a balance of lean proteins  (like fish, chicken,
or beans),  fruits  and  vegetables,  and whole grains. A turkey sandwich  on whole wheat
bread with  lettuce and  tomato is a healthier choice than a cheeseburge
r on a white bun.
•Watch portion sizes. The more  we are served, the more  we eat. Because most
restaurant  portions are way larger than the average serving size, we end up eating  way
more  than we need when we eat out. Think about  asking
 for half  portions, sharing  an
entrée with  a friend, or taking  leftovers home. Teach your kids  that it’s ok to leave food
on your plate, you can always take it home to eat at the next meal.
•Drink water or low‐fat milk. Regular  sodas, juices,  and  energy  drinks contain a lot of
sugar, but don’t give you much else. Stick  with  water or mil
k at meals.
•Look for healthy choices.
oA single slice of veggie pi[INVESTIGATOR_150289]‐grain bread
oA small hamburger  on whole‐grain bread or wrapped  in lettuce
oA bean burrito
oA baked potato
oA side salad
 with  dressing  on the side
•Modify menu  items. You can make items healthier just by [CONTACT_150486].
oAsk for sauces and  salad  dressing  on the side.
oUse salsa and  mustard instead  of mayonnaise.
oOrder  baked, broiled, or grilled lean meats including  turkey, chicken, or seafood.
oSubstitute  fries and  other less health
y sides with  salads, vegetables,  or fruit.
oWhen ordering  coffee drinks or smoothies,  use nonfat  or low‐fat milk  instead  of
whole milk  or cream.

Revised: April  26, [ADDRESS_173647] kids  aren’t eating  enough fruit.  
How can you get your  kids to eat more fruit?  
1.Eat together.  If you snack  on fruit  in front of your kids, they’re  more  likely to meet their
fruit  requirements.  Kids are
 notorious  for wanting to eat what others around them eat.
Be the fruity role model!
2.Keep trying. Many children  reject new foods because they’re afraid,  not because they
don’t like the taste. Don’t give up. You may need to offer a new fruit  10 times or more
before they’ll accept  it.
3.Don’t force kids  to finish a fruit  they
 may not like. Encourage  them to try just one bite
this time!
4.Slice or peel fruit. Your kids  may be more  likely to want sliced fruit  than whole fruit.
They  may like it better  peel
ed than with  the skin  on it.
5.Use stickers. If you stick  a popular cartoon character  on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_150291], you may find
your child more excited about eating  it.
6.Let them pi[INVESTIGATOR_150292]. Allowing them to pi[INVESTIGATOR_150293].
7.Involve them. Kids often  want to eat something  they  prepared on their own. Depending
on their age, kids  can help  with  slicing, peeling, or cutting fruit  up. There are kid‐friendly
knives,  choppers,  and
 slicers to make  this activity safer  for them.
8.Mix it up. Offer fruit  in a variety of forms, textures,  and shapes. Experiment  with  frozen,
freeze‐dried, canned, fresh  and dried fruit, as well  as 100% juice.
9.Make fun no‐cook creations.  Think of ways to make fruit  a little more  exciting. Make
homemade  popsicles,  smoothies,  and apple pi[INVESTIGATOR_150294]  (peanut butter spread on a round
apple slice topped with
 raisins).
10.Pi[INVESTIGATOR_150295]. Depending  on where  you live, you may be able to pi[INVESTIGATOR_150296] a
local farm. Sometimes  the excitement  of a new food can be an adventure  for everyone.
11.Grow your own. Getting
 kids  outside in the garden,  and teaching  them how their food
grows can interest them in trying something  new.
12.Add it to meals. Kids love pancakes,  cereal, oatmeal,  frozen yogurt. Add the fruit  on top!
13.Try to offer fruit  at most meals and snacks.
Serving  Size 
Children need 1‐2 cups  of fruit  per day, depending  on their age and activity level. One serving is 
equal  to:  
•1 cup of fruit
•1 cup of 100% fruit  juice
•½ cup dried fruit
What can you try at home to get your kids  to eat more  fruit?

while riding bikes, or when playing  at the park.  
The Many Benefits of Exercise 
Everyone  can benefit  from regular
 physical activity. Kids who are active will:  
•Have stronger muscles and bones
•Have a leaner body
•Decrease  the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_150297] 2 diabetes
•Lower blood pressure  and blood cholesterol  levels
•Have a better outlook on life
•Sleep better
•Be better able to handle physical and emotional  challenges
•Have better academic  performance
Three Kinds of Exercise 
There are
 three types of exercise – endurance,  strength,  and flexibility.  If you’ve ever watched 
kids  on a playground,  you’ve seen the three
 kinds  of exercise in action:  
•Endurance . Running away from the kid who is “it”.
•Strength.  Crossing the monkey bars.
•Flexibility.  Bending  down  to tie their shoes.
Endurance  
Endurance  develops when kids  regularly get aerobic activity. During  aerobic ex ercise, the heart 
beats faster and a person breathes harder. When done regularly and for extended  periods of 
time, aerobic activity strengthens  the heart and improves  the body’s ability to deliver oxygen to 
all its cells. Some examples  of endurance  activities include:  
•Basketball
•Bicycling
•Skating
•Soccer
•Swimming
•Running/track
•Jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_150298]
•Climbing (rock walls, trees,  structures)
•Dance
•Hockey/lacrosse
Strength 
It is not recommended  that kids  ages 2‐8 lift weights. Instead, kids  can do:  
•Push‐ups
•Stomach  crunches
•Pull‐ups
•Gymnastics
•Martial  Arts
•Yoga
Flexibility  
Stretching  exercises help improve flexibility.  When you are flexible, your muscles and joints 
bend and move easily through their full range of motion.
 Kids get chances every day to stretch 
when they: 
•Reach for a toy
•Practice a split
•Do a cartwheel
•Bend  down  to tie their shoes
Cutting Down on Screens 
One of the best ways to get kids
 to be more  active is to limit the amount of time spent  in 
sedentary  activities,  especially  watching  TV or other  screens. The American  Academy  of 
Pediatrics  recommends  parents:  
•Put limits  on the time spent  using media, including TV, social media, and video games.
•Limit  screen time to 1 hour  a day or less
•Keep TVs, computers,  and video games out of c
hildren’s  bedrooms
How Much Exercise is Enough? 
It’s up to you to make sure that your kids  get enough activity. Kids should get 60 minutes or 
more  of moderate  to vigorous  physical activit
y daily. Young children  should not be inactive for 
long periods of time – no more  than 1 hour unless  they’re sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. School‐age children  should 
not be inactive for periods  longer than 2 hours.  
The National Association  for Sport and Physical  Education  offers these activity guidelines:   
Age  Minimum  Daily Activity  Comments  
Toddler  1 ½ hours  30 minutes planned  physical 
activity and 60 minutes 
unstructured  physical activity 
(free play) 
Preschooler   2 hours  60 minutes planned  physical 
activity and 60 minutes 
unstructured  physical activity 
(free play) 
School age  1 hour or more  Break up into bouts of 15 
minutes or more 
Raising Healthy Kids 
Combining  regular  physical activity with  a healthy diet is the key to a healthy lifestyle. Here
 are 
some tips for raising  healthy kids: 
•Help your kids  participate  in a variety of age‐appropriate  activities
•Establish a regular  schedule for activity
•Make being active a part of daily life, such as taking  the stairs instead  of the elevator
•Embrace a healthier lifestyle yourself
, so you’ll be a positive role model for your family.
•Keep it fun! Physical  activity shouldn’t  feel like a chore or a punishment.
•Team  sports can be great for building friendships  and learning about teamwork.  But,  try
not to limit your child too soon to just one activity. Let them develop  a variet
y of skills
and try a lot of different activities.
•Try not to get wrapped up in winning, professional  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1520],  and scholarships.  Let kids
learn to love sports without pressure!
BMI 
Revised: April  26, [ADDRESS_173649] are very familiar wi
th things like TVs, tablets, and 
smartphones.  Chances are they’ll  want to spend  a lot of time using those devices, too.  
TV, interactive  video games,  and the Internet can be a great source  of education  and 
entertainment  for kids. It’s easy to let them spend  too much time watching  tv or on small 
screens. However,  kids’ bodies and minds  are still growing at this age. It’s important  for them to 
get plenty of exercise and lots of unstructured,  sc
reen‐free playtime.   
Screen time is any time that is spent  looking at or interacting  with  any device  that has a screen. 
It can even include things like doing like homework  on the tablet or researching  a school project 
on the computer.  It can also  include less productive  things, like watching TV or playing
 video 
games. But,  too much screen time can have unhealthy  side effects. That’s why it’s wise to 
monitor and limit the time your kids spend  playing  video ga
mes, watching  TV, and using the 
Internet.  
How much is too much? 
Parents should place consistent  limits  on the use of any media.  
•Preschoolers:  0‐1 hour  a day of age‐appropriate  shows.
•Kids and teens: 0‐2 hours a day on screen time,  including TV, social media, and video
games.
•For kids  of al
l ages, screen time should not replace time needed for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], eating,
playing, studying, and interacting  with family and friends.
Tips for Reducing  Screen Time  
•Try a weekday ban. Schoolwork,  sports activities,  and joy responsibilities  make it tough
to find extra family time during
 the week. Record  shows  or save video games for
weekends,  and you’ll have more  family togetherness  time to spend  on meals, games,
and physical activity during the week.
•Make sure kids have a variety of free‐time activities,  like spending time with  friends  and
playing
 sports.
•Turn off all screens during  family meals and at bedtime. Keep devices with  screens out
of your child’s bedroom after  bedtime and don’t allow a TV in a child’s bedroom.
•Don’t allow your child to watch TV while doing homework.
•Treat screen time as a privilege that kids  need to earn, not a right  that they’r
e entitled
to. Tell them that screen time is allowed  only after  chores and homework  are
completed.
•Set a good example. Limit your own screen time.
•Come up with  a family TV schedule.  Make it something  the entire  family agrees on. Then
post the schedule in a visible place so that everyone  knows which  programs  are OK to
watch and when.
Video and Interactive  Computer  Games 
•Look at the ratings.  Video games do have ratings to indicate when they  have violence,
strong  language,  sexual  th
emes, and other content that may be inappropriate  for kids,
or content you’re  not comfortable  with your kids  seeing.
•Preview the games. Play them yourself  so you know that your children  will be seeing.
Internet Safety 
•Become  computer  literate. Learn how to block objectionable  material.
•Keep the computer  in a common  area. Keep it
 where  you can watch and monitor your
kids.
•Share an email account with  younger children.  You can monitor who is sending them
messages.
•Teach your child about internet safety. Discuss  rules for your kids  to follow while they’re
using the Internet,
 such as never revealing personal  information,  including address,
phone number, or school.
•Bookmark  your child’s favorite sites.  Your child will have easy access and be less likely to
make a typo that could lead to inappropriate  content.
•Spend  time online together.  Teach your kids  appropriate  online behavior.

Vegetables  
Vegetables  provide many of the vitamins  and minerals we need for good health. Veggies are
 
naturally low in calories, and the fiber in them helps us feel full. And, as an extra bonus, you can 
eat as many as you want!  
Choosing variety is important  when it comes to vegetables:  Dark green vegetables  (like broccoli, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_87957], and kale) provide different nutrients  from orange vegetables  (lik
e squash, carrots, and 
sweet potatoes).  While fresh generally taste best, canned, dried, and frozen vegetables  can be 
great alternatives.  It’s best to choose ones that have been packed in water  or natural juice, 
rather than those with  added sugar or salt.  
Serving  Size 
Children need 1 ½ ‐ 2 ½ cups  of vegetables  per day, depending  on their age and activity level.  
1 serving is equal  to:  
•1 cup of raw vegetables
•1 cup cooked vegetables
•1 cup vegetable  juice
•2 cups
 raw leafy greens
How can you get your  kids to eat more vegetables?  
•Have chopped veggies in
 the refrigerator  as a ready‐to‐go snack for you and the kids.
•Have your kids  cut, slice and prepare their own veggies to experiment  with  different
types of preparation.
•Try different dips for your raw veggies like hummus,  tzatziki,  mustards,  nut butters or
guacamole.
•Pack vegetable  sticks in your child’s lunchbox.  Many kids  like carrots and peppers.
•Try vegetable  kebabs  wit
h your dinner
•Top your pi[INVESTIGATOR_150300],  green pepper, or onion.
•Add veggies to your eggs like a frittata, quiche or omelet.
•Shred veggies and bake them into morning  muffins.
•Add veggies to your stews, soups, pasta, and rice dishes.
•Try the same veggies raw, steamed,  baked to see which  your child  likes best. For
example, th
ey may not like steamed broccoli, but love it raw.
•Try new veggies mixed into a dish or with  other veggies. Then try them separate to see
which  they  like better.
•Try to offer vegetables  with  most meals and snacks.

Whole Grains 
Breads and cereals are good sources of fiber, carb
ohydrates,  protein, and a wide range of 
vitamins  and minerals.  This  food group should form the main source  of energy in your diet. 
Grains  are an important  part of a healthy diet,  providing  nutrients and energy for a child’s 
normal  growth and development.   
There are two types of grains: whole grains  and refined grains. Refined grains  have had
 the 
outer parts of the grain kernel removed.  When the outer part is removed,  so are many of the 
nutrients.  Whole grains  are the best choice because they  contain more  fiber, vitamins, and 
minerals.  Both  kids and adults  should aim for at least half of their daily serv ings to be from 
whole‐grain sources.  
What are the health benefits of whole grains? 
•Whole grains  help  control blood glucose (the sugar in your blood)
•Reduced risk for diabetes
•Reduced risk for heart disease and stroke
•Keep you regular
What are some examples  of whole grains? 
•Oatmeal
•Whole wheat  bread
•Brown rice
•Whole grain barley
•Bulgur
•Popcorn
•Quinoa
•Whole wheat  pasta
•Whole wheat  ready‐ to‐eat cereals.
Why is whole‐grain bread healthier  than white bread? 
Bread is made out of flour that comes from grain kernels. A grain kernel has three
 parts.  In 
whole grain bread,  all part of the grain kernel are used. But
 in white bread, only one of the 
three  parts of the kernel is used. Removing  the other two parts leads out important  nutrients,  
including vitamins, minerals,  healthy fats,  protein, and fiber.  
When you’re buying  packaged  bread in the supermarket,  be sure to look on the label for 
“whole grain” or “whole wheat.” Those are
 the breads that are best for your kids.  
Serving  size 
Children need 4‐6 servings  of grains per day, depending  on their age and activity level. One 
serving is equal  to:  
•1 slice of bread
•1 cup of ready‐ to‐eat cereal
•½ cup cooked rice
•½ cup cooked pasta
•½ cup cooked cereal
How do I include more whole grains in my kid’s  diet? 
•Replace white bread,  whit
e rice and white pasta with  a whole grain variety
•Add barley  or bulgur in soups, stews, casseroles,  or stir frys
•Instead  of using refined pancake, muffin, or waffle mixes, use a whole wheat mix or
make your own.
•Trade out the crackers in your pantry for whole grain crackers
•Eat whole grain ready
‐to‐eat cereals
•Add whole wheat flour or oatmeal  when making cookies or sweets
•Have popcorn as a snack
•Use whole corn meal for corn breads and muffins
What can you try at home to get your kids to eat more  whole grains?

Parent Stu
dy Information Sheet 
What is the purpose of this research study?  
Our office is participating in an exciting new study about 
eating, physical activity, and screen time behaviors in chil-
dren. We are approaching you because your child is 3 to 8 
years old and has a body mass index (BMI) > 85th percen-
tile.  
Who is doing this study?  
Our practice is one of 18 around the country that are 
working with researchers at the American Academy of Pe-
diatrics (AAP), the University of Michigan, and the Chil-
dren’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_150306]. The 
study has been approved by [CONTACT_4707] 
(IRB) at the AAP. An IRB is a committee that protects the 
rights and welfare of human subjects involved in research.
What am I being asked to do for this study?  
If you agree to participate, you will be asked to do the fol-
lowing during the 2 -year study:  
•Allow a dietitian at the University of Michigan to call or
email you for study -related purposes. A dietitian is an
expert on diet and nutrition.
•Complete several surveys, including:
Two surveys at the start of the study (15 -30 minutes
each) that  ask questions about your child’s diet, physical
activity, and screen time habits.
One follow -up survey at the end of the study (5 minutes)
that asks questions about how the study went for you
and your child.
•Have up to four 15 -minute office visits with your child’s
doctor. You may be charged a co -pay for these visits, de-
pending on your insurance.
•Have up to six 30 -minute telephone visits with a dieti-
tian. These sessions will be recorded. You will not be
charged for these visits.
•Schedule yearly well -child visits for your child.What are the potential harms or risks if I join 
this study?  
There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. To pro-
tect you, all files will be secured, either using password 
protection and firewalls (if information is digital) or 
locked cabinets (if the information is on paper). A fire-
wall protects a computer from  being used by [CONTACT_150497]. Only those involved in the study, as well 
as your child’s doctor, will have access to your data. 
You may be uncomfortable talking with your child’s 
doctor or a study dietitian, or answering survey ques-
tions, about your child’s weight and lifestyle habits. 
You do not have to talk about anything or answer 
questions that make you uncomfortable. You may be 
charged a co -pay for office visits with your child’s doc-
tor.  
What are the potential benefits if I join this 
study?  
If you join the study, all telephone visits with dietitians 
will be free of charge. You’ll get materials and activities 
to help you and your family improve eating, physical 
activity, and screen time habits, if you wish.    
Will I be paid to be a part of this study?  
No, families will not be paid for their participation. 
How can I join this study?
If you would like to take part, please text “XXX” to the 
following number (XXXX), or let your child’s doctor 
know at the next office visit. A dietitian from the Uni-
versity of Michigan will also reach out to you by [CONTACT_150498] 2 weeks.  
What will happen if I choose to not take part 
in the study?
This study is completely voluntary and you can choose 
to join or not, and can stop at any time. Your decision 
will not affect the care your child receives.

About the BMI2+ Study  
The Brief Motivational Interviewing to Reduce Child BMI ( BMI2+) study is a randomized 
controlled trial testing  the effectiveness of clinician and dietician  behavioral counseling on 
weight  outcomes. 1-2 clinicians in your practice are participating in this national study.   
BMI2+ is a collaboration between the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the University of 
Michigan , Physicians Computer Company (PCC), and the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] 
(CHOP).  This study is funded by [CONTACT_572], Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Grant # 
1R01HL128231.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_150310], PhD, at th e University of Michigan.  
What to Expect as a Non -Participating Clinician : 
•At baseline, PCC will extract EHR and billing data for all  children 3 -8 years old in your
practice, and securely transfer a  HIPAA -limited dataset to the data coordinating center at
CHOP. The dataset will contain patient and clinician study ID numbers – NO names will be
included.
•The study team at CHOP will then generate a list of children whose parents are eligible to
participate in the study. A parent can only participate if their child’s  most recent well -child
visit was with a study  clinician.
•Many patients in your practice will never be contact[CONTACT_150511] -- only those
whose last well -child visit was with a study clinician will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].
•At the end of the [ADDRESS_173660] EHR and billing data for all children 3 -8 years  old in your p ractice , and  securely
transfer a HIPAA limited dataset to the data coordinating center  at CHOP .
•CHOP will then clean the data and securely transfer it to the University of Michigan  for
analysis .
•Therefore , your patients’ data may be extracted to meet the analytic requirements of the
study.
Wha t will y ou ne ed to d o? 
Nothing! P ractice usual care an d dat a extractions will occur behind the scenes, w ith n o

Waiver of Informed Consent Version_ 4.1.[ADDRESS_173668] FORM  
45 CFR 46.116(d)

PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:   [INVESTIGATOR_150307], PhD   
PROTOCOL TITLE:   Population Effects of Motivational Interviewing on Pediatric Obesity in 
Primary Care (BMI2+) 
IRB #  (if known) : 
Per federal regulation s (45 CFR 46.116(d) ) a consent procedure which does not include, or which 
alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent may be approved by [CONTACT_150520]. In order for the IRB to grant this waiver, the regulations require that ALL  four of the 
following conditions be met.  Please be specific in explaining why each statement is true for this research. 
1.The resea
rch involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.
We are r
equesting:
1) an alt
eration of written informed consent / HIPAA authorization for all participating parents in
Intervention arm practices.
Note t
hat all participating clinicians in both study arms will provide written informed consent.  
2.The wa
iver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare  of the subjects.
We beli
eve that the alteration of written informed consent / HIPAA authorization will not affect
the rights and welfare of the subject for the following reasons:1)The parent study information sheet (Attachment R ) includes all required ele ments of
informed consent and HIPAA authorization
2)The parent study information sheet will be sent via email and US mail to the parent for their
record , and provided again after verbal consent / HIPAA authorization should they so desire
3)A trained Registered  Dietician or study clinician will use a script (Attachment s S.1  and S.2 )
to review the study information sheet  with  the parent, answer any questions the parent has,
and verify (by [CONTACT_150521] / or study dashboard) that the parent hasconsen ted to be in the study and has provided HIPAA authorization.
3.The resea
rch could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.
This r
esearch could not be practicably carried out without the alteration of written informed
consent / HIPAA authorization because Registered Dieticians (RDs), located in the central call
center at the University of Michigan, will enroll eligible Intervention arm parents over the phone.
Waiver of Informed Consent Version_ 4.1.13 Page 2 Study clinicians will also enroll and obtain consent / HIPAA authoriz ation from eligible 
Intervention arm parents ( albeit in person), although we do not expect that this will occur 
frequently.       
4.Wheneve
r appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information
after participation.
At the 
end o f the study, we will provide the participating practices with the results so that they
can share them with the families in their practices, as appropriate.

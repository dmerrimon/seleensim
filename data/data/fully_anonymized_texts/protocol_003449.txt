Title of Study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group, Placebo-Controlled Study to
Assess the Efficacy and Safety of Intercostal Nerve Block with Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338306]: To be determined.
Study Center(s): Up to 30 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe.
Publications (Reference): None.
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intercostal nerve block using liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338307].
Secondary Objectives:
The secondary objectives are to evaluate additional efficacy parameters, characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK)
profile of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338308], and further assess the safety
profile of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study conducted to
investigate the efficacy and safety of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (total of 266 mg in 20 mL) divided into three equal
doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL volume per nerve and administered to each of three
nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above, and nerve below) compared with saline placebo nerve block.
After completing screening procedures, eligible subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy will be
randomized 1:1 to receive either liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309]. Study drug will be administered in a blinded
manner after the posterolateral thoracotomy is completed (i.e., just prior to the surgical site closure). The use of
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (other than fentanyl), acetaminophen/paracetamol, ketorolac or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics other than the study drug will not be permitted intraoperatively, except for
emergency use to treat an AE.
At all US sites only, subjects will have a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump established prior to the
completion of the surgery. The PCA pump will not be loaded at this time . All subjects will be required to remain
in the study site for a minimum of [ADDRESS_418159] rescue medication will be intravenous (IV) fentanyl 100 mcg, which will be administered once via bolus
only. At this time, the PCA pump should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or hydromorphone only) for subjects
at the US sites only.

Postsurgical Rescue Medication (Cont.)
Second Rescue Medication
For the US sites only, the second rescue medication will be PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or
hydromorphone). The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either of the following recommended doses:
(1) on-demand morphine boluses of 1.5 mg with a lockout interval of 6 minutes and an initial maximum hourly
dose of 15 mg, or (2) on-demand hydromorphone boluses of 0.2 mg with a lockout interval of 10 minutes and an
initial maximum hourly dose of 1.2 mg. A continuous infusion (background or basal rate) of morphine is not
permitted. The recommended bolus doses may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]; however,
adding a basal rate is prohibited.
For the European sites only, the second rescue medication will be intramuscular (IM) administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]
(morphine) up to10 mg every [ADDRESS_418161] is tolerating oral (PO) medication, PO immediate-release oxycodone may
be administered (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
Subjects who do not achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen will be withdrawn from the study and
followed for safety only.
Postsurgical Assessments
Subjects will be evaluated for pain intensity using the numeric rating scale at rest (NRS-R) at baseline and 1, 2, 4,
8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and [ADDRESS_418162] for rescue pain medication, and on Day 12
(seeAppendix 1 ). Subjects also will be evaluated for pain intensity with activity (defined as pain intensity with
cough) using the NRS with activity (NRS-A) at baseline and 24, 48, and 72 hours following surgery and on
Day 12 (see Appendix 1). Note: At time points when the pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS-R will be
conducted before the NRS-A. Additionally, if chest tube removal or a PK blood draw coincides with pain
intensity assessment(s), the pain intensity assessment(s) must be conducted before the other procedures.
Neurological assessments will be conducted at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36,
42, 48, 60, and 72 hours after surgery (see Appendix 2 ). The cardiac assessment (i.e., ECG recordings) will be
started at baseline (approximately 1 hour prior to surgery) and continue for a total of 72 hours. The sensory
function assessment (i.e., cold test) will be conducted at baseline, when the subject wakes up after surgery, and at
2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and [ADDRESS_418163]’s sensitivity to cold has returned in two
consecutive evaluations (see Appendix 7 ).
The overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire will be completed at 24, 48, and 72 hours following
surgery (see Appendix 3 ). The subject's overall satisfaction with postsurgical pain control will be assessed at
72 hours following surgery, on Day 12, and on Day 30 using a 5-point Likert scale (see Appendix 4 ). A wound
healing assessment will be performed on Day 12 (see Appendix 5 ). Predefined, treatment-emergent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
related AEs will be assessed at 72 hours after surgery (see Appendix 6 ). Adverse events will be recorded through
the Day [ADDRESS_418164]. If a cardiac or neurological event occurs during the study that the Investigator
believes may be associated with high levels of systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an unscheduled PK blood sample should be
collected at the time that the event is noted.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained from subjects at specific sites at
baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after the end of surgery. Placebo
samples will be collected to maintain the treatment double-blind but will not be analyzed. (Note: At time points
when the PK and NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS pain intensity assessments will be conducted
before the blood draw.)

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
7.1. Indication
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338321] a single dose administration
without the use of indwelling catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_338322]. It is indicated for use as an analgesic injected into the surgical site for postsurgical
pain relief. This study will explore the safety, efficacy, and PK profile of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338323] a new route – intercostal nerve block.
Intercostal nerve blocks provide excellent analgesia for chest and upper abdominal surgery
including thoracotomy. As with many other regional techniques, the advantages of ICNBs
include superior analgesia, improved pulmonary mechanics, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing effects such as
reduced central nervous system depression and avoidance of urinary retention. However,
supplemental systemic analgesia is always necessary ( Ho AMH 2012).
Effe
ctive postsurgical pain control is a critical element in subject recovery following surgery,
as the majority of subjects may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster subject
mobilization, shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of
Anesthesiologists Task Force on Pain Management 1995).
7.2. EXPAREL (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469])
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40501]-acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of
action after local administration, usually reported as less than 8 hours. EXPAREL®(Pacira
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, [LOCATION_004]) is a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469].
It consists of microscopic spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam drug delivery system),
organized in a honeycomb-like structure comprising numerous non-concentric internal aqueous
chambers containing a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40502] a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. Each chamber is
separated from adjacent chambers by [CONTACT_40562]. The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], cholesterol,
and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338324] a complex mechanism involving reorganization
of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of
time. A small amount of extra-liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., not bound within the DepoFoam
particles) enables EXPAREL to have a similar onset of action to standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].
EXPAREL was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for administration into the surgical site to
produce postsurgical analgesia. The active ingredient (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and inactive ingredient
(DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in FDA-approved products:
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338325], a well-characterized anesthetic/analgesic, with more than
35 years of use in the US.
DepoFoam, a liposomal extended-release formulation contained in the marketed products
DepoCyt® (1999) and DepoDur® (2004). The form of DepoFoam used in each of the
three products – DepoCyt, DepoDur, and EXPAREL – has a slightly different mixture of

7.3. Summary of Human Experience with Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338326] 21 clinical studies and 1 observational follow-up study to investigate
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Across these studies, over 1300 human subjects received liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338327] 9 mg to 665 mg administered by [CONTACT_40564]: local
infiltration into the surgical wound, subcutaneous, perineural, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873]. The product
generally has been well tolerated and, in active comparator studies, reported adverse events
(AEs) occurred at a similar rate as the corresponding bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40504].
Two nerve block studies have been completed. SKY0402-002 was a Phase 1 dose escalation
study conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. A total of 37 healthy subjects were administered liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338328] (24 subjects received liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] 12 subjects received bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974]). The incidence and types of adverse
events experienced were similar across treatment groups. All AEs were mild or moderate in
severity; those related to liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338329]. There were no serious
adverse events (SAEs), deaths, or discontinuations due to adverse events.
SKY0402-C-203 was a Phase 2 nerve block study in which three doses of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]
(155, 199, and 310 mg) were compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] (125 mg) in a bunionectomy. A total
of 38 patients received liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338330] 72 hours; a PK curve also was
defined.
In doses up to [ADDRESS_418197] nature of the efficacy results in both pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491] (SKY0402-C-316 and SKY0402-
C-317) was demonstrated across subgroups of patients with various prognostic features and
across demographic subgroups.
Following the NDA submission of EXPAREL (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469]),
numerous clinical studies were initiated in which liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338331] (including infiltration into the transversus abdominis plane
[TAP] and intraoperative wound infiltration or instillation); final results are not available at this
time.

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September [ZIP_CODE]. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN
9.1. Study Design
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled
study conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (total of 266 mg
in 20 mL) divided into three equal doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL
volume per nerve and administered to each of three nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above,
and nerve below) compared with saline placebo nerve block.
After completing screening procedures, eligible subjects undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy
will be randomized 1:1 to receive either liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309]. Study drug will be
administered after the posterolateral thoracotomy is completed (i.e., just prior to the surgical site
closure). Study drug administration will be performed in a blinded manner (see Section 11.5.1).
The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (other than fentanyl), acetaminophen/paracetamol, ketorolac, or other
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and local anesthetics other than the study drug
will not be permitted intraoperatively except for emergency use to treat an AE. At all US sites
only, subjects will have a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump established prior to the
completion of the surgery. The PCA pump will not be loaded at this time . All subjects will be
required to remain in the study site for a minimum of [ADDRESS_418198] rescue medication will be intravenous (IV) fentanyl 100 mcg, which will be
administered once via bolus only. At this time, the PCA pump should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]
(morphine or hydromorphone only) for subjects at the US sites only.
Second Rescue Medication
For the US sites only, the second rescue medication will be PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine
or hydromorphone). The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either of the following
recommended doses: (1) on-demand morphine boluses of 1.5 mg with a lockout interval of
6 minutes and an initial maximum hourly dose of 15 mg, or (2) on-demand hydromorphone
boluses of 0.2 mg with a lockout interval of 10 minutes and an initial maximum hourly dose
of 1.2 mg. A continuous infusion (background or basal rate) of morphine is not permitted.
The recommended bolus doses may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707]; however,
adding a basal rate is prohibited .
For the European sites only, the second rescue medication will be intramuscular (IM)
administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine) up to [ADDRESS_418199] is tolerating oral (PO) medication, PO immediate-release oxycodone
may be administered, as needed (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
Subjects who do not achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen will be withdrawn from the
study and followed for safety only.

and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and [ADDRESS_418201] for rescue pain
medication, and on Day 12 (see Appendix 1). Subjects also will be evaluated for pain with
activity (defined as pain intensity with cough) using the NRS with activity [NRS-A] at baseline
and 24, 48, and 72 hours following surger y and on Da y 12 (see Appendix 1). (Note: At time
points when the NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS-R will be conducted before
the NRS-A.) Additionally, if chest tube removal or a PK blood draw coincides with pain
intensity assessment(s), the pain intensity assessment(s) must be conducted before the other
procedures .
Neurological assessments will be conducted at baseline, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8,
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 hours after surgery (see Appendix 2). The cardiac
assessment (i.e., ECG recordings) will be started at baseline (approximately 1 hour prior to
surgery) and continue for a total of 72 hours. The sensory function assessment (i.e., cold test)
will be conducted at baseline, when the subject wakes up after surgery, and at 2, 4, 12, 24, 36,
48, 60, and [ADDRESS_418202]’s sensitivity to cold has returned in two
consecutive evaluations (see Appendix 7).
The overall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire will be completed at 24, 48, and
72 hours following surgery (see Appendix 3) .The subject's overall satisfaction with postsurgical
pain control will be assessed 72 hours following surgery, on Day 12, and on Day 30 using
a 5-point Likert scale (see Appendix 4). A wound healing assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_338368] 12 (see Appendix 5). Predefined, treatment-emergent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related AEs will
be assessed at 72 hours following surgery (see Appendix 6). Adverse events will be recorded
through the Day [ADDRESS_418203]. If a cardiac or neurological event occurs during the study
that the Investigator believes may be associated with high levels of systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an
unscheduled PK blood sample should be collected at the time that the event is noted.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained from subjects at specific sites at baseline,
15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after the end of surgery.
Placebo samples will be collected to maintain the treatment double-blind but will not be
analyzed. (Note: At time points when the PK and NRS pain intensity assessments coincide,
the NRS pain intensity assessments will be conducted before the blood draw.)
Unscheduled blood samples also may be collected during the study if a cardiac or neurological
event occurs that the Investigator believes may be associated with high levels of systemic
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].
9.1.1. Duration of the Study and Subject Participation
No more than [ADDRESS_418204] may participate in the study for a maximum of 64 days.

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September 201211. TREATMENTS
11.1. Treatment to be Administered
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (total of 266 mg in 20 mL) or placebo (preservative-free normal saline)
will be divided into three equal doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL
volume per nerve and administered to each of three nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above,
and nerve below) according to the randomization schedule. Study drug administration will be
performed in a blinded manner utilizing syringes masked by [CONTACT_338370].
Rescue Medication
Rescue medication should only be provided upon subject request.
First Rescue Medication
The first rescue medication will consist of IV fentanyl 100 mcg, which will be administered once
via bolus only. At this time, the PCA pump should be loaded with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine or
hydromorphone only) for subjects at the US sites only.
Second Rescue Medication
For the US sites only, the second rescue medication will be PCA-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] (morphine
or hydromorphone). The PCA pump will be programmed to deliver either of the following
recommended doses: (1) on-demand morphine boluses of 1.5 mg with a lockout interval of
6 minutes and an initial maximum hourly dose of 15 mg, or (2) on-demand hydromorphone
boluses of 0.2 mg with a lockout interval of 10 minutes and an initial maximum hourly dose
of 1.2 mg. A continuous infusion (background or basal rate) of morphine is not permitted.
The recommended bolus doses may be adjusted according to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338310]; however,
adding a basal rate is prohibited .
For the European sites only, the second rescue medication will be IM-administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]
(morphine) up to10 mg every [ADDRESS_418212] is tolerating PO medication, PO immediate-release oxycodone may
be administered, as needed (but not more than 10 mg every 4 hours).
Subjects who do not achieve adequate pain relief with this regimen will be withdrawn from the
study and followed for safety only.
11.1.1. Administration Technique
Immediately prior to closure, study drug (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309]) will be administered
under direct visualization by [CONTACT_338371]'s normal and usual technique. The volume to be
administered is approximately 6.[ADDRESS_418213] be equipped to manage subjects with any evidence of cardiac

Placebo will consist of preservative-free normal saline for injection and will be supplied by [CONTACT_338372]. Subjects in the placebo group will receive 20 mL of placebo.
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme
Subjects will be centrally randomized to receive 266 mg liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338309]
(normal saline for injection) in a 1:[ADDRESS_418215] or random code identifiers are to be reused
once assigned. The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (US and Europe).
11.3.2. Randomization Procedures
Once a subject is identified as being qualified for the study per the eligibility criteria (see Section
10.1 andSection 10.2) and is at the study site for surgery, the research pharmacist or designee
will contact [CONTACT_338373] a randomization assignment (4-digit
random code identifier). The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the
assignment is received.
11.3.3. Replacement of Subjects
Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug may
be replaced. Once assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace
those who withdraw will be assigned a unique subject number and randomized to treatment
according to the procedures outlined above.
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study
During the clinical development of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_418216] shown that

Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 33 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418217] bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 100 mg. Based on this experience, a similar
total dose was deemed appropriate for this study.
11.5. Blinding
11.5.1. Blinding Procedures
Liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338342]; therefore, to maintain the
double-blind study design, only unblinded study personnel who are NOT involved with
protocol-specific, postsurgical assessments may prepare the study drug. Staff members
conducting study-specific, postsurgical assessments and the subjects will remain blinded to the
assigned treatment throughout the study. If a subject experiences an SAE, Pacira will not
automatically unblind the subject’s treatment, unless it is necessary to manage treatment of the
SAE. Expedited SAEs will be unblinded by [CONTACT_40571].
Unblinded randomization assignments will be provided via a randomization system. At each
site, only the individual(s) who are identified in the randomization system to receive unblinded
randomization assignments will be responsible for preparing study drug.
Site surveys suggest that study sites will vary in their standard (and feasible) procedures for
preparing sterile study drug in a blinded fashion. Therefore, each site will be responsible for
providing their written blinding procedures for study drug preparation and transportation to the
operating room. This documentation will be made available to Pacira for review before the site
enrolls a subject into the study. Assignment of blinded and unblinded responsibilities regarding
the preparation of study drug should take into account that liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338343] a syringe for more than [ADDRESS_418218] occurred prior to administration.
The administration of study drug will be recorded in the operating room charts using the minimal
amount of information necessary to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating in blinded
procedures. No crossover will be permitted between the blinded and unblinded study site
personnel during the study period. The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated.
Blinded monitors will review case report forms (CRFs), clinic charts, and all other study-related
documents that do not disclose the allocation of study treatment. Care should be taken in
recording and review of operating room records to not record information in an unblinded
fashion. Pharmacy or any other clinic records providing unblinded information (e.g.,
randomization, study drug preparation, study drug accountability, study drug administration) will
be reviewed by [CONTACT_338374].

Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338302] 1
Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 34 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418219] safety warrants such unblinding. However, the Investigator should discuss the safety
issues with the Medical Monitor before attempting such unblinding, if possible. Any unblinding
will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira study team and the Investigator.
Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or
miscommunication among study staff) must be reported to Pacira immediately.
Only designated staff at Pacira will have the option to unblind treatment assignment through the
randomization system, which will be designed to document such a transaction and notify the lead
member of each functional group that such a transaction occurred.
Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the clinical study report with a full discussion of
the events leading to the decision to unblind.
11.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy and Medications
11.6.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Therapy
Prior medications

records demonstrating dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom drug was
administered, and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately. The unblinded
pharmacist or designee must retain vials containing used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_338347], as instructed by [CONTACT_40574], following confirmation of study
drug accountability data by [CONTACT_338375]. A record of drug return or destruction will be
maintained in the pharmacy binder and a copy provided to Pacira. Inventory records must be
readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_338376]/or appropriate regulatory
authorities at any time. A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability information, and
notice of return or destruction will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study. Only authorized
personnel identified on the Delegation of Authority and Accountability Log will have the ability
to access, prepare, and administer the study drug.

12.3. Pharmacokinetic Measurements
Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained from subjects at specific sites at baseline,
15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours after the end of surgery.
Placebo samples will be collected to maintain the treatment double-blind but will not be
analyzed. (Note: At time points when the PK and NRS pain intensity assessments coincide,
the NRS pain intensity assessments will be conducted before the blood draw.)
12.4. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints

The following safety assessments will be conducted:
Adverse events from the time of randomization through the Day [ADDRESS_418224].
Vital signs (resting heart rate and blood pressure) at screening, baseline, and 1, 12, 24,
48, and 72 hours after surgery.

30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72 hours after surgery (see Appendix 2).
Cardiac assessment (i.e., ECG recordings) started at baseline (approximately 1 hour prior
to surgery) and continued for a total of [ADDRESS_418225] to the T max.
Physician's satisfaction with wound healing on Day 12 (see Appendix 5).
12.6. Safety Endpoints
The following safety endpoints will be assessed based on the safety measurements conducted at
the specified time points:
Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and SAEs through the Day [ADDRESS_418226].
Change from baseline in vital signs (resting heart rate and blood pressure) at each

Summary of neurological assessments (proportion of subjects who are oriented, and
proportion of subjects who have any of the neurological events).
Change from baseline in ECG data closest to the T max.
Rating of physician's satisfaction with wound healing on Day 12.
12.7. Appropriateness of Measures
Endpoints selected for this study were based on validated methodologies and other well
established clinical measurements used in peer-reviewed studies in both the peer-reviewed
literature and at regulatory authorities.
The neurological and cardiac safety assessments are based on the known signs and symptoms
associated with systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338348]. The sensory function assessment is a standard
test to determine restoration of nerve function.

is defined as after the end of surgery.
Subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_192608] 72 hours after surgery; therefore, postsurgical analgesia
and collection of study data will take place under the supervision of site study staff.
13.1.1. Numeric Rating Scale Pain Intensity Assessments
Pain intensity will be assessed using the NRS-R and the NRS-A (see Appendix 1). To assess
pain intensity at rest (NRS-R), the subject will assume a resting position that does not exacerbate
his or her postsurgical pain. The subject will rest in this position for at least 5 minutes before
responding to the following question, “ On a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst
possible pain, how much pain are you having right now ?” The subject’s response will be
recorded.
The subject’s pain intensity will be assessed with activity (NRS-A), where the prescribed activity
will consist of a cough. The subject will respond to the following question, “ On a scale of 0 to
10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst possible pain, how much pain are you having right now ?”
The subject’s response will be recorded.
Note: At time points when the NRS pain intensity assessments coincide, the NRS-R will be
conducted before the NRS-A. Additionally, if chest tube removal or a PK blood draw coincides
with an NRS pain intensity assessment(s), the NRS pain intensity assessment(s) must be
conducted before the other procedures. If a blood draw and pain intensity assessment coincide,
the pain intensity assessment will be conducted first.
13.1.2. Overall Benefit of Analgesia Score Questionnaire
The OBAS questionnaire ( Lehmann 2010) will be completed at 24, 48 and 72 hours after surgery
(seeAppendix 3).
13.1.3. Neurological Assessment
A neurological assessment will be conducted at baseline, [ADDRESS_418228]'s orientation. Additionally, the subject will be asked whether s/he is experiencing any
numbness of the mouth, tongue, or lips; a metallic taste; problems with hearing; problems with
vision; or muscle twitching (see Appendix 2). For assessing the subject’s orientation, the
assessor should take into account what their normal expectation would be for a person at this
time postsurgically. For example, if the subject is able to be woken up and is still slightly
disoriented but in accordance with what would be expected for that time after surgery, then the

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September 2012answer would be “Yes”. If the subject is responding abnormally, then this would be marked
“No” and it would be recorded as an AE. If the subject answers “Yes” to any of the additional
questions on this assessment, the event will be recorded as an AE. If the neurological assessment
reveals a neurological event that the Investigator believes may be associated with high levels of
systemic bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], an unscheduled PK blood sample should be collected at the time that the
event is noted.
13.1.4. Cardiac Assessment (Electrocardiogram Recordings)
Digital 12-lead holter ECGs will be recorded using the Mortara Instrument Digital H12+™ ECG
continuous recorder (Mortara Instrument, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin), which will continuously
record all 12 leads simultaneously from baseline (approximately 1 hour prior to surgery) and
continue for [ADDRESS_418229]’s unique identification number and demographic information
will be recorded for each flash card. Without knowledge of subject treatment assignment, the
central laboratory will generate a 10-second, 12-lead digital ECG at each time point specified in
the protocol. If targeted ECG time points are artifactual and of poor quality, the central
laboratory will capture analyzable 10-second ECGs as close as possible to the targeted time
points.
Digital ECGs will be transmitted by [CONTACT_338378], EXPERT. Interval duration measurements will first be obtained by [CONTACT_338379] a computer screen
utilizing the method of Global Median Beat. The Global Median Beat is created by [CONTACT_338380], where one representative beat for each of the 12 leads is selected and superimposed,
creating a single superimposed (Global Median) beat. Trained analysts will then review for
correct interval duration measurement (IDM) caliper placement and adjudicate the pre-placed
algorithm calipers as necessary. A cardiologist will then verify the interval durations and
perform the morphology analysis, noting any T-U wave complex that suggests an abnormal form
compatible with an effect on cardiac repolarization.
On-screen measurements of heart rate (HR), PR, QRS, and QT interval durations will be
performed and derived variables RR, QTcF, and QTcB will be calculated using the following
formulae:
QTcB = QT/ RR
QTcF = QT/3RR
RR = 60/HR
Each fiducial point (onset of P wave, onset of Q wave, offset of S wave, and offset of T wave)
will be marked. The original ECG waveform and such annotations will be saved separately in
XML format for independent review.
Electrocardiogram changes in RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB will be examined at the time
closest to the T max.

14.1. Adverse Events
14.1.1. Definitions
Definition of Adverse Event (AE) :Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding),
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use in combination with
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.
Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.
The AE may involve any organ or system and can be represented by [CONTACT_338382] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_338383]. Any medically relevant and untoward
change after the subject is randomized, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating
condition (e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.
An AE that occurs after randomization and before the start of the study drug administration is
identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after administration of the study
treatment is considered a TEAE. All AEs must be recorded and reported accordingly, whether
they appear causally related to the study drug or not.
Adverse events will be followed until the outcome is known or until the end of the study.
Definition of Adverse Reaction: Any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.
Definition of Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.
A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. Suspected adverse reactions are a subset of all
AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.
Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 402-C-322
Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338302] 1
Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 46 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418238] is
randomized (i.e., PTAEs and AEs). For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through the
Day [ADDRESS_418239] be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered
related to study drug. Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses
(highest possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as
individual signs or symptoms. Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for
example, an AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of
nausea and the event of vomiting. If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on
the AE CRF, the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (removed – i.e., lined
through and initialed). Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as
their clinical corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).
All AEs will be followed through progression and regression of their severity. For example,
if an AE is reported as mild in severity but changes to moderate, the AE of mild will have an
outcome of changed AE characteristic and the AE will be re-entered. The AE with a moderate
severity must have the same start date as the mild event stop date. If the AE then becomes mild,
the AE with a moderate severity will have an outcome of changed AE characteristic and the AE
will be re-entered with a severity of mild; the start date of the mild AE must be the same as the
stop date of the moderate AE.
Any condition noted before the subject is randomized will be listed as Medical History and is
considered a pre-existing condition. If a pre-existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more
severe or more frequent), at any time after randomization, or after study drug administration, it is
considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre-existing condition (e.g., new high
blood pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset,
severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, action taken for
the AE, and the outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable.
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines :
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.
Moderate: An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday
activities.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal everyday activities.
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical
consideration on a case-by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:

Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 47 of 64 PCDoc #137099
CONFIDENTIAL 23 September 2012Not Related: A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE canbe
easilyruledout (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of
a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of
actual cause).
Related: There is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event (i.e .,there
isareasonablepossibility based on evidence to suggest that the drug
caused the event).
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events
The Investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a
case-by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:
Recovered/Resolved: The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE.
Recovered/Resolved
with Sequelae:The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition
as a result of the AE.
Not Recovered/
Not Resolved:At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an
undetermined outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered
resolved as a result of death.
Recovering/Resolving: At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in
frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected.
Fatal: The AE directly caused death.
Unknown: There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’s records
to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was
lost to follow-up).
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject due to an Adverse Event
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE.
None.
Medication.
Non-pharmaceutical therapy. (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the
CRF.)
Discontinued from study.
Other. (The specific action taken must be recorded.)

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September 201214.2. Serious Adverse Events
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of
either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Death1.
A life-threatening adverse event2.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3.
A persistent or significant incapacity4.
Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Medically significant5.
1Death: Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE. However, death,
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore, the
Investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects
who die during the study. If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown, the AE
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”
2Life-threatening: An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itself, does not represent an
SAE. It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” when it
requires inpatient care. Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the study. However,
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., prolonged
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.
4Persistent or significant incapacity: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct
normal life functions.
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medically
significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
14.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after randomization through the Day [ADDRESS_418240] information for Pacira Drug Safety/designee can be found in the regulatory binder.

Liposome Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338302] 1
Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 49 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418241], the SAE should
also be reported to Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered related to
study drug. The site would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the
event would be followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.

CONFIDENTIAL 23 September 201215. STATISTICAL METHODS
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study. A separate
SAP will be developed for the ECG results.
15.1. Study Hypothesis
The primary null hypothesis is:
H0:The means of the AUC of NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours are not
different between the liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338353].
The alternative hypothesis is:
HA: The mean AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours for the
liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338354].
15.2. Study Endpoints
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Efficacy Endpoints),
Section 12.4 (PK Endpoints), and Section 12.6 (Safety Endpoints).
15.3. Determination of Sample Size
A study population of approximately 180 subjects is planned with approximately 90 subjects in
each treatment group (liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338304]). The sample size was estimated based
on the results of a Phase 3 wound infiltration hemorrhoidectomy study of liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338355] (standard deviation) AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores
through 72 hours was 141 (101) and 202 (104) for the liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338353],
respectively. A two-group t-test with 0.[ADDRESS_418242] 97% power to
detect a difference in means of 61, assuming that the common standard deviation is 104, when
the sample size in each group is 90.
15.4. Analysis Populations
The following analysis sets are planned:
Safety: The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive study drug and will be based
on actual treatment received.
Efficacy: The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who receive
study drug in all three nerves and will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual
treatment received.
Pharmacokinetic: The PK analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who
receive liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338356].

Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 51 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418243] Dropouts and Discontinuations
For the calculation of AUC of NRS pain intensity scores through any of the time periods, the
following methods will be used for imputing missing data:
Missing scores before the first non-missing score will be replaced by [CONTACT_338384]. Missing scores after the last
non-missing score will be replaced by [CONTACT_338385]-missing score (last observation carried
forward). Linear interpolation will be used to replace missing scores between two non-missing
scores. Subjects who have no pain scores after surgery will have the missing scores replaced by
[CONTACT_338386].
Additional methods for dealing with missing data will be described in the SAP.
15.6. Statistical Analyses
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].
15.6.2. Study Compliance
The percentage of subjects in each analysis set and the percentage who fail to complete the study
(as well as the reasons for discontinuation) will be displayed by [CONTACT_1570].
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses
All efficacy analyses will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual treatment
received.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Measure
The primary efficacy measure in this study is the AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores
through 72 hours.
For the AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores through 72 hours, liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338357] (ANCOVA) with treatment as the main effect
and the baseline NRS-R pain intensity score as the covariate. Based on the model, the difference
between the treatment groups will be estimated along with the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals
(CI).
Handling of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medication
For the AUC of the NRS-R pain intensity scores, prior to analysis the windowed Worst-
Observation-Carried-Forward (wWOCF) imputation method will be applied. For subjects who
take rescue pain medication, their NRS-R pain intensity scores recorded within the window of
controlled type of rescue medication (6 hours for IV fentanyl or oxycodone, 4 hours for
morphine, and 2 hours for IV hydromorphone) will be replaced by [CONTACT_941] ‘worst’ observation.
The worst observation will be the highest score in the time interval from the end of surgery up to
the time prior to taking their first rescue pain medication. Note that NRS-R pain intensity scores
in the window that are higher than the worst value prior to rescue pain medication will not be

Document No. 040-[ZIP_CODE].002 52 of 64 PCDoc #[ADDRESS_418244] observation from all available measurements will be used instead.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Measures
The secondary efficacy measures in this study are:
Total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_338358] 72 hours.
Time to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_265388].
These efficacy measures will be analyzed using a hierarchical fixed-sequence stepwise testing
procedure. To protect the Type [ADDRESS_418245]
for a significant difference between liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338304], an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with treatment as the main effect will be used. Based on the model, liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338359] a two-sided 95% CI about the difference will be
presented.
The time from end of surgery to the first use of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_338360] [ADDRESS_418246] will be used to
compare liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338303].
[IP_ADDRESS] Tertiary Efficacy Measures
Continuous Measures of Efficacy
For the AUC of pain intensity scores, missing data will be imputed as described in Section 15.[ADDRESS_418247] and the baseline value as the covariate will be used. Based on
the model, liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338361]-sided 95% CIs about
the differences will be presented.

15.6.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated from the PK analysis set, using plasma drug
concentration-time profiles, where appropriate, by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis.
Actual sampling time will be used for all calculations of the PK parameters. If there is any doubt
in the actual time a sample was taken, then the scheduled time will be used.
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the PK parameters.
15.6.5. Safety Analyses
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All summaries of AEs will
only include TEAEs. Events that start prior to the start of study drug administration will be
identified in listings only. Incidence rates of TEAEs and the proportion of subject prematurely
withdrawn from the study due to a TEAE will be shown for each treatment group. Incidence
rates will also be displayed for each treatment group for study drug-related TEAEs and by
[CONTACT_926]. Incidence rates of SAEs will also be shown for each treatment group. All incidence
rates will be categorized and displayed by [CONTACT_6657].
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics for each vital sign for baseline and change from baseline at each time point
will be summarized for each treatment group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurological Assessments
The proportion of subjects who are oriented at each time point will be summarized for each
treatment group. The proportion of subjects who have at least one of the neurological events will
be summarized for each treatment group.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rating of Physician’s Satisfaction with Wound Healing
The physician’s satisfaction with wound healing will be summarized for each treatment group.
To test for significant differences between liposome bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338304], a Wilcoxon Rank
Sum test with treatment as the main effect will be used. Based on the model, liposome
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338362]-sided 95% CI about the difference will
be presented.

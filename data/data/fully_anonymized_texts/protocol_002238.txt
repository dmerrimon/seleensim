INTRODUCTION  
 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (OUD), involving prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_552791], is a public health emergency 
leading to unprecedented drug -related mortality in the [LOCATION_002] ,1-[ADDRESS_726654] naltrexone is also used for 
patients with OUD,  but it has even lower adherence.5 
Positive findings from preclinical and clinical studies provide a rationale for the use of cannabidiol 
(CBD) in the clinical trial proposed here. In animal models, CBD has behavioral effects suggesting that 
CBD may offer benefit in relapse prevention for p atients with OUD. These effects include the 
attenuation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_552792] -seeking behavior, stress -induced 
drug-seeking and reductions in anxiety - and impulsivity -like behaviors.6,7 Moreover, a Phase 2, 
randomized, do uble-blind, placebo -controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_552793] a single dose of CBD (400 or 800 
mg) decreased cue -induced opi[INVESTIGATOR_552794].8,[ADDRESS_726655] can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] –related deaths by [CONTACT_1541] a medication 
that will prevent relapse to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], which puts individuals with OUD at risk for death from an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211].  
STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The overall goal of the proposed work is to perform a study on the effects of ATL5 in patients with 
OUD, receiving medication -assisted treatment with buprenorphine (transmucosal formulations, e.g., 
buprenorphine + naloxone)  or methadone . ATL5 is CBD, extracted from hemp, at a 10% strength 
(softgel capsules with 100 mg/ml of CBD per capsule).  
Primary Objective : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CBD (600 mg/day) and its 
pharmacokinetic interaction with buprenorphine metabolism in the study population.  
Based on prior work, CBD is expected to be well -tolerated and safe in patients with OUD8,9, but 
safety signals (vital signs and laboratory test results) will be assessed. Because CBD inhibits 
cytochrome P450 isozymes including CYP3A,[ADDRESS_726656] a drug -drug interaction 
between CBD and buprenorphine, whereby [CONTACT_552816]/norbuprenorphine concentration ratio.  [Note:  Intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity 
only slightly affect human methadone N –demethylation.]  
Secondary Objective : To determine the extent to which CBD (600 mg/day) reduces cue - induced 
craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
CBD is expected to reduce cue -induced opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506] (secondary outcome). Other outcomes 
are also expected to be affected: spontaneous craving  and negative affect.  
 
METHODOLOGY  
General Experimental Design: This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study 
of ATL5 (CBD) (600 mg/day, [300 mg twice daily] ) as adjunctive therapy to buprenorphine or 
methadone for patients with OUD, who are receiving inpatient behavioral therapy, including 
cognitive behavioral therapy.  
Endpoints: The primary endpoint will be safety and tolerability of CBD in these patients, and it will 
be assessed via measurement of adverse events. Pharmacokinetic analyses will evaluate potential 
drug-drug interactions of CBD with buprenorphine metabolism. The secondary outcome measure 
will be cue -induced craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], assessed using the Desires for Drug Questionnaire (DDQ)16 
in the context of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_66148] -induction paradigm in the laboratory session before CBD dosing on 
Day 0 (baseline without CB D) to scores on Days 7 and 28 (after adjunctive treatment with CBD) ( see 
Criteria for Evaluation below).  
Other Outcome Measures : 
• spontaneous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506], assessed using the Penn Alcohol -Craving Scale, as modified to assess 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_218298]17 
• affect, assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule  (PANAS)18 
• anxiety assessed by [CONTACT_552817][INVESTIGATOR_73593] -Trait Anxiety  Inventory19 
• blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_552795]  
• Plasma levels of CBD  
• plasma levels of buprenorphine  
Participant Recruitment : Patients will be recruited from the Tarzana Treatment Center in the San 
Fernando Valley (TTC), where buprenorphine or methadone (as part of their treatment) and CBD (as 
part of this protocol) will be administered .a Tarzana Treatment Centers, Inc. is a community -based, 
private non - profit behavioral healthcare organization located in Southern [LOCATION_004] with several 
agency sites, including the one in the San Fernando Valley, where this protocol will be conducted. 
TTC delivers drug and alcohol use treatment, has been accredited by [CONTACT_552818] (JCAHO) since 1987, and has a workforce that includes 
physicians, psychologists, and nurses. TTC’s substance use treatment  approach includes residential 
programs that are overseen by a Program Director and are staffed by a clinical supervisor, operations 
supervisor, counselors, interns, nursing staff and 24/7 technicians. Groups and services include 
education group, process g roup, 12 -step, family group, mental health services and recreation skills.  
Cognitive -behavioral treatment is used in both individual and group therapy to address craving and 
relapse issues and in the treatment of mental health  problems.  
Randomization to Treatment : Up to 60  patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 
to receive CBD or placebo ( up to 30 patients per group ): CBD 600 mg/day (300 mg twice daily). 
Within each cohort, patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_552819] (either below 
or ≥ 2 ng/mL)  
Dosing and Testing Schedule : The study will comprise three periods: a 14 -day screening period 
while patients are stabilized on buprenorphine), a 28 -day treatment period (CBD 600 mg/day  or 
placebo) , and a 28 -day follow -up period after termination of treatment with medication.  
Laboratory sessions using a craving cue -induction paradigm will be conducted before dosing on 
Day 0 (baseline) and on Days 7 and 28 after adjunctive treatment with CBD.  
Note: Participants will all be maintained on buprenorphine or methadone, which are robust, effective 
treatment for OUD that diminish cravings, and helps to protect participants if relapse occurs. Thus, 
conducting cue reactivity tests in the presence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_552796]. Total scores > 70 on the Desire for Drug Questionnaire 
(scores ranging from 14 to 98) will be reassessed after participants remain in study visit area for [ADDRESS_726657] medication 
(CBD  or placebo) under supervision. Blood samples will be collected to determine plasma 
concentrations of CBD and its metabolites (7 -hydroxy CBD and 7 -carboxy CBD), buprenorphine and 
methadone and their metabolites as well as the endocannabinoids anandamide and  2-AG, which may 
contribute to the response to CBD and laboratory assessments of safety. Retention in treatment (this 
trial plus buprenorphine + naloxone ) will be assessed over the 28 -day medication (CBD or placebo) 
treatment period and weekly follow -up assessments for the subsequent month (28 -day follow -up 
period).  
Duration of Treatment and Dropout . Duration of inpatient treatment with buprenorphine or 
methadone (outside the scope of this protocol) is generally for about one month at the Tarzana 
Treatment Center (TTC), and buprenorphine or methadone is often continued after a client leaves TTC. 
The treatment phase of this study of CBD vs. placebo is 28 days. If a participant decides to stop taking 
buprenorphine or methadone and/or leave TTC before completing the 28 -day intervention described in 
this protocol, they will be withdrawn from the study and  will receive compensation for the portion of 
the study that they completed.  
Number of Patients Planned : Approximately up to 60 patients will be 
recruited.  
• The active treatment group will include up to 30 patients receiving CBD (600 mg/day).  
• The control group will include up to 30 patients receiving  placebo.  
  
a Because buprenorphine  or meth adone  will not be administered as a study medication and will be 
managed by [CONTACT_2299]’s X -waivered prescriber, study personnel will not directly adjust  doses of 
these medications if participants endorse withdrawal or craving symptoms. However, with 
participants’ consent, we will attempt to communicate this info to the participant’s clinician for 
consideration of dose adjustment . 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion (see Table 1 below) : Patients will be 21 -65 years of age 
and will meet criteria for current (over the 3 months before enrollment) OUD on the basis of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.[ADDRESS_726658] reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_552797] 60 days before evaluation and will be receiving a stable maintenance dose of 12 mg 
buprenorphine in a formulation including naloxone (buprenorphine/naloxone ratio of 4/1) or without 
naloxone or methadone for at least [ADDRESS_726659] for respi[INVESTIGATOR_552798]. A buprenorphine dose range of 12 mg daily is a usual 
dosage for residents at the TTC and was selected to produce substantial occupancy of mu - opi[INVESTIGATOR_264574]. A 16 -mg buprenorphine maintenance dose significantly decreases whole -brain mu - opi[INVESTIGATOR_552799] 80 ± 2% relative to placebo, with nonsignificant increases in receptor 
occupancy by 32 mg of buprenorphine.20 Occupancy of mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_552800] -based opi[INVESTIGATOR_552801].21 
Key Exclusion Criteria  (see Table 2 below):   
Patients will be excluded for physiological dependence on alcohol or a sedative -hypnotic drug, requiring 
medical detoxification, receiving medication -assisted treatment with naltrexone, and showing signs of 
acute opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801] (score of 5 on t he Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433], COWS).  
Because Cue -induced craving for opi[INVESTIGATOR_140299] a secondary outcome, participants will be 
screened to eliminate those who do not report sufficient craving in response to visual cues (pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]). 
Those who do not have a craving score of at least 50 (on a visual analogue scale with a maximum  score 
of 100) for at least one image within one category (groups of images may be separated into smoking 
cues, pi[INVESTIGATOR_552802], and injection paraphernalia). For example, for injection cues, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a 
needle and syr inge may elicit a craving response, though other images in the same group (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_552803]) do not elicit  craving.  
Exclusion criteria also include clinically significant medical conditions; and AIDS or current HIV 
seropositivity (as HIV positive individuals entering the Tarzana Treatment Center generally have 
medication treatment with antiviral and/or non -antiviral the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_552804]). Pregnancy and lactation also will be exclusion criteria. Because of evidence that CBD affects 
ovarian function, women with hormone values outside the normal range on a test battery will be 
evaluated with u ltrasound; those who have evidence of ovarian suppression will be excluded.  
Screening labs/tests will include direct bilirubin (D Bili) and liver function tests (LFT), baseline 
ECG, and pregnancy test for women. Parameters for exclusion include:  
a. AST or ALT greater than or equal to 3Xs  ULN.

Based on Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]® (CBD oral solution) label section 7, "Drug Interactions", we will exclude 
participants who are taking the following medications: strong a) inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 
(e.g., rifampin, due to the potential to decrease CBD plasma levels); and b) substrates of UGT1A9 
(e.g., diflunisal, propofol, fenofibrate), UGT2B7 (e.g., gemfibrozil, lamotrigine, morphine, lorazepam), 
CYP2B6 (e.g., bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], efavirenz) , CYP2C19 (e.g., clobazam, diazepam) due to potential to

ATL5 Softgel Capsules will be manufactured by [CONTACT_552822]., ([LOCATION_004], [LOCATION_003]) 
under cGMP conditions. They will be administered orally as indicated below.  
Dosage and Duration of Treatment : The planned study will evaluate ATL5 (300 mg, BID). The 
treatment period with CBD or placebo will be 28 days. Participants will be in the study for up to  10 
weeks, including follow -up evaluation after completion of the 28 -day treatment  period.  
Dose Justification : CBD will be tested at 600 mg  daily. This dose was  selected on the basis of safety 
data from human studies. In a previous clinical trial, doses of CBD as high as 50 mg/kg  (i.e., 350 mg for 
a 70-kg participant)  were  well tolerated .[ADDRESS_726662] been  used in humans  
without  toxicity  or serious  adverse  events .23-29 Forty -two subjects  received  200 mg of CBD four times 
daily (total 800 mg per day) for 2 to 4 weeks to treat schizophrenia without notable side effects .30 A 
review of 132 reports, which included animal and human studies, concluded that CBD was well -tolerated 
in humans, at doses of up to 1500 mg/day31fo 
Sixty subjects were dosed to date in a pediatric pharmacokinetic trial with doses ranging from 10 
mg/kg/day up to 40 mg/kg/day32; these doses were generally well tolerated, and no clinically  significant 
safety concerns were identified, even in adolescents. In addition, 24 adults received doses of 20 mg/kg 
CBD  (up to ~2000  mg as a single  dose)  (INS011 -15-043) in a study  evaluating  the effects  of food (fasting 
and a high -fat meal) on absorption of CBD. In that study, and in another that evaluated food effects on 
CBD absorption in 8 healthy adults (INS011 -16-093), there were no safety issues and very few adverse 
events.  
In a study of heroin -abstinent patients with OUD, 400 mg and 800 mg CBD were shown to be safe 
and well -tolerated when given with intravenous fentanyl .33 Specifically, Systematic Assessment for 
Treatment Emergent Events (SAFTEE) data were similar between CBD dose groups, and there was no 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_552809]. However, no study 
has yet evaluated the effect of CBD as an adjunctive therapy to buprenorphine  or methadone . Given the 
known safety and eff icacy of CBD, we will compare CBD to placebo to determine whether CBD reduces 
cue- induced  craving  for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]  (primary  outcome  measure)  and has other  effects,  such as relapse  
prevention in patients with OUD when used as an adjunctive therapy to buprenorphine  or methadone.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration : The reference therapy will be placebo, 
consisting of softgel capsules that match the active test medication in appearance. The placebo softgel 
capsule formulation is composed of polyoxyl 35 polysorbate 80, plurol - oleique CC 497, propylene 
glycol, capryloc apryol polyoxyl -8 glycerides, medium chain triglycerides and BHT, in the same 
relative proportions as the ATL5 Softgel Capsules. The softgel shell will be composed of caramel 
color, gelatin, glycerin a nd purified water.  
This formulation also will be manufactured by [CONTACT_552822]. under cGMP conditions.  
Safety Assessments and Monitoring : The following tests and procedures will be performed for 
safety monitoring throughout the study.  
a. Comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC with differential, and urinalysis    
      Key tests: AST, ALT and INR  levels  
      Sampling times: Days -7 to 0 (screening), Days 7, 14, 21 and 28 (treatment), and Days  
35, 42, 49 and 56 (follow -up). 
b. Assessment of  Sedation  
Instruments  and measures:  Observed  Observer’s  Assessment  of Alertness/Sedation  Scale  (OAAS)  and 
pulse  oximetry  
Assessment times: Days -7 to 0 (screening), and Days 1-28 (treatment),  
and Days 29, 30, 31, 33, 35, 42, 49 and 56 (follow up).  
c. Elect rocardiogram  
Safety parameters: evidence of arrhythmia, recent MI, and 3rd degree heart block 
Assessment times: Days -7 to 0 (screening) and Day 28 (treatment).  
d. Ovarian hormone  battery  
Hormone assays: estradiol, follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), 
prolactin, T3 uptake (THBR), thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (T4).  
If abnormality is seen, ultrasound will be obtained.  
Assessment times: Days -7 to 0 (screening), Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (treatment),  
and Days 35, 42, 49 and 56 (follow up).  
e. Suicidality  
Assessment: Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Assessment times: Days -7 to 0 (screening), and Days 7, 14, 21, and 28 (treatment).  
 
Interventions and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
a. Dosing will be stopped for slowed respi[INVESTIGATOR_552810] (O2 saturation <94% on room air for  2 
consecutive days with evidence of no response to dose  adjustment).  
b. Patients who become hypoxic (<90% O2 saturation on room air) or sedated (OASS scale 
score <4) will be referred/transported to the ED (call 911); CBD dose will be held until  medical 
assessment and stabilization, and if restarting medication is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_552823], the daily total study medication dose will be  halved.

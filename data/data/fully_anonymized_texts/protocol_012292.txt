Page [ADDRESS_231496] described in this proposal addresses an important 
evidence gap in the initial management of patients with a common condition; low back pain (LBP) with 
sciatica; a condition that can be disabling and costly for affected individuals and the healthcare system. 
Most patients with LBP and sciatica initially access healthcare in primary care settings. Practice guidelines

or MRI), opi[INVESTIGATOR_195017] [ADDRESS_231498] likely to 
benefit from early physical therapy (e.g, those with higher initial pain severity, etc.) which could inform shared decision-making for providers and patients in the future.  This project fits the current
 AHRQ  
Comparative  Effectiveness Research  Portfolio.  The project examines the impact of translation of new 
scientific information into clinical care, and develops evidence to inform clinical decision-making for an important priority condition. 
We will conduct a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness and costs associated with adding physical 
therapy to primary care management during the first 4 weeks of care for patients with LBP and sciatica. 
Patients with LBP and sciatica with a new consultation in primary care will be randomized to receive 
guideline-based primary care management with or without  early physical therapy.  Patients will be followed 
for 1 year.  Outcomes will include measures of disabili ty, pain, satisfaction, healthcare utilization and costs.  
Specific aims for the study are the following: 
1. Compare the effectiveness of two initial management strategies for a subgroup of patients with LBP and
sciatica.  We hypothesize that early physical therapy will result in greater improvements in disability and
pain over 1 year compared to a usual care strategy.
2. Compare utilization of specific healthcare procedures  [and healthcare costs] associated with two initial
management strategies for a subgroup of patients with LBP and sciatica.  We hypothesize that early
physical therapy will result in decreased utilization of MRI and injections over [ADDRESS_231499] by [CONTACT_195051].      
C.2  Overview of Approach
This study will be a pragmatic randomized trial comparing strategies for managing patients with a new 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_195018].  One strategy is usual care (UC) directed within primary care during the initial 4 weeks.  The other strategy is early physical therapy (EPT) with patients receiving 6-8 sessions in the initial 4 weeks.  We will examine patient-centered outcomes and subsequent healthcare utilization [ and costs ] over a 1-year follow-up period.  Based on our hypothesis that the first few weeks 
provide an opportunity to positively influence the clinical course of LBP with sciatica, the difference between 
strategies occurs in the [ADDRESS_231500]. Fritz has previously led successful clinical trials in this system. Patients visiting a primary care clinic with a chief complaint of LBP and sciatica will be potentially eligible. Eligible patients who provide informed consent will undergo baseline assessment 
followed by [CONTACT_97222] a treatment group (UC / EPT).  Both groups will receive first-line medication as 
needed and advice and education emphasizing remaining active and the inappropriateness of early imaging or specialist referral as recommended by [CONTACT_195052]/ACP guideline.
33The UC group will be managed within
primary care for the next 4 weeks with a stepped approach (ie, referral for additional care considered after 4weeks if symptoms do not improve).  The EPT group will be referred to physical therapy for 6-[ADDRESS_231501] satisfy all inclusion criteria: 
I.Symptoms of pain and/or numbness between the 12th rib and buttocks, which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_195019], are originating from tissues of the lumbar region.
II.Symptoms of pain and/or numbness primarily into one leg that have extended below the knee in the last
72 hours, an d correspond to a lower lumbar nerve root distribution (L4, L5 , S1)
III.Current symptoms present for 90 days or fewer
IV.Age 18 - 60 years
V.Oswestry disability score > 20%
VI.One or more of the following symptoms:
1.Positive ipsilateral or contralateral straight leg raise test (reproduction of symptoms at <700)
2.Reflex, sensory, or strength deficits in a pattern consistent with lower lumbar nerve root
These criteria will select patients meeting the operational definition of LBP and sciatica typi[INVESTIGATOR_195020].
Consistent with a pragmatic approach we will not require imaging studies because early imaging is not 
advocated by [CONTACT_21401]. Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: 
I.Any prior spi[INVESTIGATOR_195021], or any surgery to the lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_195022].Current pregnancy
III.Currently receiving treatment for LBP from another healthcare provider (e.g., chiropractic, massage
therapy, injections, etc.) or any treatment for LBP in prior 6 months
IV.Judgment of primary care provider of “red flags” of a potentially serious condition including caudaequina, major or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_195023], fracture, cancer, infection or systemic disease
These criteria will exclude patients who do not fit the sub-group with LBP and sciatica.  Patients with red flags may require early specialist referral. Patients who are pregnant comprise a separate sub-group requiring different management.

Research Strategy
Page 3 of 10
Subjects will be recruited into the study using procedures we are successfully employing in our ongoing 
LBP trial (R18HS018672 ). Recruitment will be conducted using the Utah Health Research Network (UHRN), 
a practice-based research network formed to promote collaboration between the University Health Sciences
Center and the Community Physician Group and facilitate clinical research.  [CONTACT_195074], UHRN Director, 
will assist in establishing the recruitment procedures through UHRN. Currently the UHRN includes [ADDRESS_231504] (IRB). The process uses the electronic medical record to identify patients with specific characteristics based on demographic information and ICD-[ADDRESS_231505] we will identify patients with a primary care visit (with no 
LBP visits in the past 6 months) with an ICD-9 code related to LBP and sciatica (722.1, 722.2, 722.52,722.93, 724.3, 724.4) between the ages of 18-60.  We performed a query of the EMR for a 12-month period(7/11
–6/12) to gauge the number of potentially-eligible patients based on these criteria and identified a total
of 1,[ADDRESS_231506] the patient sign an informed consent document approved by [CONTACT_195053].  Patients who do not enroll will be instructed to follow-up with their primary care
provider as needed.  Once consent is obtained baseline examination procedures will be performed by a
blinded research assistant.  After the baseline examination the patient will again meet with the coordinator to receive the advice and education intervention consistent with current evidence ( details below) then the 
coordinator will reveal the patient’s treatment group assignment. All patients will be advised to return to their primary care provider as needed, consistent with a pragmatic design. 
We will randomize individual patients instead of cluster
-randomizing to avoid the loss of statistical power 
resulting from the latter.77Randomization will be conducted using a blocked procedure [ stratified by [CONTACT_195054] ]  and conducted using a random permuted block procedure.
A random list of differing block sizes (2 or 4) will be generated prior to the study. Sequentially-numbered, 
sealed envelopes will be prepared containing the group assignment for each patient. The envelope will be opened by [CONTACT_195055].  Patients in the EPT group will be scheduled for physical therapy to begin within 3 days at [ a physical therapy clinic trained in the 
evidence-based physical therapy program.  We selected two physical therapy clinics that will provide good 
geographic coverage of the region.  Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195025]-up training as outlined below. ]
Consistent with a pragmatic study we will not use placebos to blind patients or attempt to balance provider 
contact.  At baseline the randomization assignment will not be revealed until the patient has completed 
procedures with both the primary care provider and study coordinator, reducing the potential for bias from
the primary care provider offering advice or making medication decisions, or in the delivery of the advice 
and education by [CONTACT_14676]. Follow-up assessments will be performed by a blinded research assistant.  Any occurrences of un
-blinding of the research assistant will be recorded. The primary care 
provider cannot remain blind to treatment received if a study patient returns for follow -up.  If a patient 
returns to the primary care provider the provider will base care decisions on the patient’s needs consistent with a pragmatic approach. [ It is possible that patients randomized to the UC group will eventually receive 
physical therapy, which could occur in a clinic trained in the evidence-based program. Our preliminary findings on the percentage of patients with LBP and sciatica who ever use physical therapy suggest this will not occur frequently. We will record the occurrence of patients in the UC group eventually receiving physical therapy and whether or not this occurs in a trained clinic. This will permit an exploration of the 
potential confounding impact should this occur with greater frequency than anticipated. ] This pragmatic
approach will preserve appropriate patient-provider communication and permit an examination of 
effectiveness and future healthcare utilization under the most realistic clinical circumstances possible. 
C.5  Baseline and Follow-Up Examination Procedures  (See Appendix A for paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_119605])
Baseline examination will consist of self-report questionnaires and a physical examination.  The physical
examination includes neurologic testing to confirm eligibility. The physical impairment index(PII)78 composed
of 7 measures of range of motion and strength, will be assessed. Each measure is graded positive (1) or
Research Strategy

negative (0) for a total score of 0-7 with higher numbers indicating more impairment. Each measure has 
excellent reliability and validity.78,79
Study data will be collected using web-based data collection via REDCap (Research Electronic Data 
Capture).  Data collection forms will require only modest modifications from our ongoing randomized trial
(R18-HS018672 ).  Our experience with web-based data collection is that patients find it easy to use and 
convenient, as reflected by [CONTACT_195056]. At baseline and each follow-up patients and researchers input data directly into REDCap.  If a patient is unable to directly input data using a computer paper forms are used and data are uploaded at a later time.   
Demographic Information 
Patients will provide information including age, sex, ethnicity, race, employment status, and general medical 
and LBP history. Patients will be asked about expectations for treatments including physical therapy, injections, and surgery prior to their group assignment.
[ADDRESS_231507] of treatment preference.
Primary/Secondary Outcomes and Potential Moderators 
Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW),81 a measure of LBP-related disability will be the primary outcome 
because functional ability is a primary concern for patients with LBP and sciatica.82 The OSW is a 10 -item 
scale scored from 0 -100 and higher numbers indicating greater disability.  We will use a modified version 
that replaces the sex life item with an employment/homemaking to improve compliance.83,84The OSW is 
widely used in research on non-operative management of patients with LBP with and without sciatica85 with 
responsiveness equal or superior to other disability measures.86,[ADDRESS_231508] reliability (ICC=0.90), validity, and responsiveness to change for 
patients with acute LBP, with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 6 points.83  A study of 
patients with LBP and sciatica reported an MCID of 8 points for the OSW.86
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) :  0-10 NPRS (‘0’ = no pain, ‘10’ = worst imaginable pain) will be used to 
assess pain intensity. We will use separate NPRS ratings of low back and leg pain.  NPRS have excellent test-retest reliability.
84Our prior research has found the NPRS responsive to change, with an MCID of 2 
points among patients with acute LBP receiving physical therapy.88A 2-point MCID is also reported for 
patients with LBP and sciatica.86[NPRS will be a secondary outcome and explored as a moderator.] 
EuroQol (EQ-5D): A generic quality of life instrument91 will be used to assess health outcomes on a scale 
that may be referenced to other disease conditions.92  The EQ-5D covers 5 domains: mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each domain has 3 response categories: “no problems”; “some problems”; or “inability or extreme problems.” Responses are combined to 5-digit health 
state classification. The EQ-5D yields a total of 243 possible health states.  Valuation of each health state is 
available.
93 The EQ-5D is reliable and responsive to change in patients with LBP94,95 and is commonly used 
in economic evaluation of interventions for LBP. 
Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ): assesses patients’ beliefs about how physical activity and 
work may affect their LBP and perceived risk for re-injury.98  The FABQ has two subscales; a 7-item work 
subscale (FABQW), and 4-item physical activity sub scale (FABQPA). Test-retest reliability of the subscales 
is high.98,99  Validity is supported by [CONTACT_195057].100-103[FABQ will be explored as a potential moderator.] 
Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS): a 13-item scale assessing the extent to which people catastrophize in
response to pain.106  Each item is scored from 0 -4. The PCS is reported as a total score, and is composed 
of three sub-scales: rumination, magnification, and helplessness. Pain catastrophizing plays an important 
role in the transition from acute to chronic LBP.102 [PCS will be explored as a potential moderator.]
Healthcare Utilization and Direct and Indirect Costs:  [We will collect both direct and indirect costs due to 
lost work productivity related to LBP over the 1 -year follow -up.] We will use a cost diary method integrated 
into the web-based data collection system to collect utilization and cost data.  Cost diaries offer advantages in terms of feasibility and validity as compared with patient-reported questionnaires for collecting cost data 
and provide information at regular intervals instead of relying on patient recall over a long time period, 
minimizing recall error.
109[We will collect cost and utilization data monthly via REDCap using the input 
options outlined below. ] The cost diary will be modeled on paper-based methods with high compliance 
(85%) for economic analysis in studies of patients with LBP.108,[ADDRESS_231509] and utilization data.
108
[Each monthly cost diary will ask patients if they have utilized healthcare resources in the past month 
specifically for LBP in 4 categories: 1) provider visits (traditional or complementary/alternative), 2) medications (prescription or over-the-counter), 3) interventions (injections, surgery, etc.), or testing (x-rays, MRI, etc.), and 4) lost time from work or decreased work productivity.  Conditional logic will be used to reduce response burden for patients not seeking any care.  Patients who are seeking care will be given 
follow-up questions to ascertain the number and nature of utilization in each category in the past month. ]
Follow-up examinations will be conducted [ADDRESS_231510]:
Satisfaction: Patient satisfaction with care for LBP will be measured at the 4-week follow-up using a 10-item 
instrument that has been validated and found capable of distinguishing different dimensions of satisfaction 
(caring, information and treatment effectiveness) among patients with LBP attending primary care.
111
Global Rating of Change:  will be completed at each follow-up using a 15-point scale112 that asks the patient 
to rate the degree of change in his or her condition from enrollment to the present..
C.6    Procedures for Treatment  (see Appendix C for copi[INVESTIGATOR_195026] )
Patients in both groups (UC or EPT) will continue to be managed by [CONTACT_29383]. Consistent
with a pragmatic study, decisions about medication or additional referrals will be recorded but not controlled.All enrolled patients will be recommended by [CONTACT_195058]-up in primary care as-needed ifunsatisfied with their progress. All patients will receive education on the favorable natural history of LBP
with sciatica and reassurance that imaging and specialist referrals are not indicated early in the course of
care.  Patients will also receive advice to resume normal activity as soon as possible without bed rest.  Theadvice and education will be provided by [CONTACT_195059]. Coordinators will be licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195027].  All patients will be given a copy of
theBack Book  (Appendix B ), a booklet developed to help modify beliefs and behavior of patients with
LBP.
113Messages are based on research demonstrating beneficial effects of remaining active.  Research
has found the  Back Book  to be well-accepted by [CONTACT_1962], and capable of shifting beliefs about recovery and
activity, particularly when delivered interactively.113,114 The study coordinator will review the Back Book  with
the patient and answer any questions.  Management common to all study patients therefore includes; 1)
education and reassurance of the favorable prognosis of LBP with sciatica, the benefits of staying active,
and the appropriateness of delaying imaging or referrals, 2) a copy of The Back Book  with a review of its
contents to reinforce key messages, and 3) ongoing primary care management as needed.
Usual Care (UC) Treat ment Group   
Patients in the UC group will be managed with a stepped care approach supported by [CONTACT_195060].[ADDRESS_231511] 4 weeks following the primary care visit.  Patients in the UC group will be recommended to follow-up with their primary care provider if unsatisfied with their progress after 4 weeks. 
At that time decisions on further treatments and/or referrals will be made by [CONTACT_195061].  
Early Physical Therapy (EPT) Treatment Group: 
Patients in the EPT group will receive the same education and advice intervention described above and will 
receive physical therapy during the initial [ADDRESS_231512] 4 weeks [in a clinic trained to 
provide the study treatment ] ([ADDRESS_231513] judgment).  Each session will include a brief assessment and treatment with centralizing exercises

Page [ADDRESS_231514] patients to monitor symptoms and perform exercises in a range to maximize 
centralization and minimize discomfort.  Patients will be provided handouts and instructed to perform assigned exercises at home every 4
-5 hours on days between sessions.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_195028] -lying with varied amplitude and velocity to promote centralization of 
symptoms and spi[INVESTIGATOR_195029].  If mechanical traction is used it will be applied using a 3D ActiveTrac device (Empi, Minneapolis).  We have used this 
device in prior studies and have access in our 
facilities.  Static mechanical traction is applied for a maximum of [ADDRESS_231515] Training and Fidelity Monitoring 
[We will train physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195030]. These two clinics (University Orthopedic Center and South Jordan 
Health Center) provide good geographic coverage and have the necessary equipment to perform study 
treatments.  There are [ADDRESS_231516] patient’s self-reported compliance with assigned exercises on the treatment form from each session (appendix C). These forms are uploaded into the web-based data 
collection system. The study coordinator will audit at least 20% of forms to identify any concerns regarding 
treatment fidelity during the study.  Off-protocol events will be recorded and feedback given to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  
C.[ADDRESS_231517] Retention Procedures
[We will use several strategies to enhance retention.  At the time of obtaining consent we will clearly outline 
the time that will be required of participants. We will clarify for participants that study-related treatments will 
not be billed to them or their insurance.  We will use reminder calls and e-mails for follow-up assessments. 
We will be in monthly contact [CONTACT_195062] e-mail during the follow-up period to obtain cost and utilization data, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_195031]. The 4-week follow-up is done in person because this contact [CONTACT_195063] a sense of connection to the project for all participants, particularly those in the UC group. Long-term follow-ups are completed 
electronically to reduce the burden of an in person meeting. Our experience in our ongoing trial suggests 
this balance of in-person contact [CONTACT_195064]-term follow-ups with frequent reminders and small gifts for completing assessments has been quite successful in retaining participants.  
C.8  Data Management and Quality Control Procedures
Data will be entered into REDCap, a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection 
and management of research and clinical trial data. REDCap provides secure and easy data manipulation with audit trails for reporting, monitoring and querying records, and an automated export mechanism to 
common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata) facilitating quicker time to analyses.  Periodically during 
the study data will be exported by [CONTACT_195065] (SDBC) at the University’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). The database will be maintained on a server supplied and maintained by [CONTACT_195066]. The SDBC, directed by [CONTACT_3252]-investigator [CONTACT_195075], will provide additional analyses to monitor progress, including rates of recruitment, retention and adherence to study protocols.    1.

Once a patient is enrolled, the Study Coordinator will create a patient profile in REDCap and the patient will 
receive a unique ID generated prior to beginning the study.  The patient profile will be identified by [CONTACT_195067].  Links between the ID and
patients’ identifying information will be maintained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_195033].  After a patient profile is created the patient and investigators are able to input data directly into REDCap. Once data collection begins, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_195034], recruitment and identify any issues that could impact the safety or ethics of the study (e.g, adverse events, instances of unblinding, etc.).  
C.[ADDRESS_231518]-hoc 
sensitivity analyses.  Intention
-to-treat principles will be used with all patients analyzed in their randomized
group regardless of compliance. We will compare compliance between groups and “per-protocol” secondary
analyses may be considered if non -compliance is high or disproportionate between groups.
Multiple imputation (MI) will be used to address missing outcome data.  MI incorporates baseline and follow -
up factors beyond the variable being analyzed into imputation models to account for dependence of missingdata on other factors.  We will use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to generate imputed values
116
involving 4 steps: 1) preparing the dataset by [CONTACT_195068], evaluating distributional assumptions with transformations as 
needed; 2) conducting the MI, with variance and covariance estimates based on observed data used to iteratively estimate maximum likelihood values for all subjects. Multiple replacement values for each missingscore are drawn randomly from the posterior distribution and perturbed with error; 3) analyses are doneidentically on all versions of imputed data; and 4) parameter estimates and tests are combined and adjusted for between-imputation variance to yield final results.  MI is valid if data are missing at random, meaning the 
probability of missingness is independent of the missing outcome values after accounting for predictor 
variables in the imputation model. Moderate violations of this assumption do not substantially bias MI results if the proportion of patients with missing data is low.  We will evaluate the assumption with importance sampling to evaluate implications of violations of the missing at random assumption after completion of the basic MI procedure.
117 If this approach suggests strong dependence of the results on the missing at random 
assumption further sensitivity analyses will be performed using formal pattern mixture models.118 Should 
sensitivity analyses indicate strong dependence of our results on untestable assumptions about missing data, this limitation to the interpretation of our results will be noted and conclusions appropriately qualified. Because this study involves procedures with minimal risk we will not plan interim analyzes to avoid inflating type I error rates. Treatment comparisons will be performed separately at each follow-up time to characterize treatment effects at critical junctures over the follow
-up.  The 4-week assessment will evaluate 
effects at completion of treatment; 6 month and 1 year assessments will evaluate intermediate and long-term effects respectively.  We now lay out the analysis for each Specific Aim.
Specific Aim #1:  “ Compare the effectiveness of two primary care management strategies for a subgroup of 
patients with LBP and sciatica.”
For the primary (OSW) and secondary (NPRS, EQ-5D) outcomes we will use longitudinal mixed effects 
models to compare mean change in the outcome from baseline to each follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months, and 
1 year) between the UC and EPT groups after controlling for the baseline level of the outcome [ and 
indicator variables to account for the different primary care clinics .]  An unstructured covariance matrix will 
be used to account for serial correlations in outcome measures within patients. Baseline adjustment

accounts for regression to the mean, increasing statistical power. [ Sensitivity analyses will be performed to 
examine the implications of possible clustering of outcomes by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_195035] a random effect term for the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195036] .] The primary 
analysis will compare mean OSW changes at [ADDRESS_231519] occurred by [CONTACT_195069].
Specific Aim #2:  “ Compare utilization of specific healthcare procedures and [healthcare costs ] associated 
with two management strategies and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the two strategies 
for a subgroup of patients with LBP and sciatica.”
Utilization outcomes evaluated during the year follow-up are: 1) advanced imaging (MRI or CT), 2) lumbar 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_195037], 3) emergency department visit, and 4) surgery (discectomy, decompression, laminectomy,
nerve ablation, fusion). Utilization rates will be summarized on a patient basis (proportions of patients) and as rates over time (total utilization including multiple events per patient), and compared between groups with 
logistic regression and survival analysis methods for repeated events respectively.
127We will compare 
numbers of patients missing work due to LBP between groups with similar procedures.  [ We will examine 
costs from a societal perspective, collecting both direct and indirect costs using cost diaries. As 
recommended, we will value cost data with standard unit prices132 based on University of Utah clinical 
research billing rates.  Lost work productivity will be costed using methods described by [INVESTIGATOR_4243].28,133Cost
diaries document work absence or reduced performance (as a percentage of normal) due to losing concentration, repeating tasks, fatigue, etc, at work due to LBP.  Lost productive time will be calculated asthe number of days of work absence (“absenteeism”) and the number of hours of reduced productivity (“presenteeism”) multiplied by [CONTACT_102]’s self-reported salary.
28Patients not employed outside the home 
(homemakers, students) will report absenteeism and presenteeism. Lost productive time will be based on 
average salary for age- and sex-matched individuals according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Sensitivity analyses will be used to examine the impact of differing methods of valuing direct and indirect costs. ]
[We will use parametric and non-parametric methods to compare costs between treatments.  As the mean is 
the most useful statistic to evaluate costs related to treatment implementation,
[ADDRESS_231520]-effectiveness (CE) analyses will be conducted. The short-term analysis will use direct and indirect costs over the first [ADDRESS_231521] data measured at 1-year.  Costs and 
effects will be measured in the same year; eliminating the need for inflation adjustment or discounts. Once 3parameters are computed: 1) mean differences in cost and effect between treatments, 2) variances for differences in costs and effects, and 3) covariance between effectiveness and cost difference, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or incremental net benefits summarizing the monetary value of the
intervention will be calculated.
[ADDRESS_231522] the uncertainties in costs and in effects, a gamma distribution will be adopted. ]
Specific Aim #3: “Evaluate moderators of improvement with early physical therapy.”
Moderators are baseline variables that interacts with the type treatment to predict outcomes.126We will pre-
specify potential moderators of improvement with early physical therapy based on theory or preliminary 
Research Strategy
Page [ADDRESS_231523] including; 1) symptom centralization at baseline (yes/no), 2) severe 
baseline disability (baseline OSW <40 or >40), 3) leg pain rated higher than LBP at baseline (leg NPRS >
LBP NPRS or leg NPRS < LBP NPRS). Mixed effects models described above will be extended by [CONTACT_195070].  The extended models will be used to provide separate estimates of treatment effects within each level of the moderator and to provide statistical tests of the dependence of treatment effects on the moderator.  To mitigate risk of low power in subgroup analyses, the NPRS, for which the study has high power to detect important differences, will serve as the primary outcome for evaluating moderators. We may explore different follow-up points or dependent variables, and may consider additional putative moderators if evidence 
emerges suggesting a potentially important variable that may provide information to patients and providers 
about types of patients for whom early physical therapy may be particularly beneficial (or unhelpful).       
C.[ADDRESS_231524] 90% of patients complete the OSW at 6 months, 110 subjects per group (total = 220) provides at least 86% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_231525] deviation of 16 points (treatment effect = 43.8% of [ADDRESS_231526] deviation).  MCID for the OSW has 
been estimated at 6-[ADDRESS_231527] 82% power to detect a treatment 
effect on the 1-year OSW change assuming the same standard deviation and 80% follow-up.  In addition, 
this sample size provides > 99% power to detect a clinically important difference of 2.[ADDRESS_231528] 80% follow-up. Our prior work with patients with LBP and sciatica indicate these estimates of effect are realistic.
52,72Our power calculations are slightly conservative 
as they assume no information will be obtained from patients with missing outcomes; we can expect slightly 
smaller minimum detectable effects (i.e. greater power) with MI .
C.[ADDRESS_231529] will include subjects from AHRQ Priority Populations including women, children (age 18-21),
and minority groups as they are represented in the population from which study subjects will be recruited.
Because this project is the first to examine the effectiveness and subsequent healthcare utilization resulting
from the management strategies described in this proposal, we are taking a pragmatic approach torecruitment instead of targeting the recruitment specifically towards priority populations. Once moreinformation is known about the effectiveness of these strategies, studies specifically examining translationinto priority populations such as individuals in rural regions, low income or minority groups will be possible.
C.[ADDRESS_231530] clinical studies, a primary concern is adequate recruitment.  While we believe our recruitment 
accrual estimate is realistic and obtainable, we will maintain a contingency plan in case accrual falls short of 
our estimates.  The UHRN practice-based research network includes primary care clinics that are not in our recruitment estimate because they are greater than 20 miles from Salt Lake City, but could be added if necessary.  Another potential limitation would be subjects’ ability to access physical therapy clinical sites for treatment.  We are able to use space in physical therapy clinics affiliated with the University of Utah system located throughout Salt Lake City and could train additional clinics to provide the study treatment in order to 
increase the likelihood that a subject will be able to access a clinic for treatment.

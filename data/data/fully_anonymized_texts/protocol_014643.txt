DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 65 1. PROTOCOL  SUMMARY 
1.1 Synopsis  
Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of viral 
pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel coronavirus has been designated severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 ( SARS -CoV -2), and the disease caused by [CONTACT_435650] 2019  (COVID-19). There were 59 confirmed cases o n January 5, 2020, 278 
cases on January 20, 2020, rising to more than 318,000 confirmed cases and 13,000 deaths as of 
March 22 , 2020 according to various international health reporting agencies. Currently there are 
no approved therapeutic agents available for coronaviruses.  
 
Study Design  
This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled trial to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249106]-19. The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to  approximately 100 sites  globally. 
The study will compa re different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm . There will 
be interim monitoring to introduce new arms and allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], efficacy, or safety. If one therapy proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm 
for comparison(s) with new experimental treatment(s) . Any such change would be accompanied 
by [CONTACT_435651].  Because background standards of supportive care may 
evolve/improve over time as more is learned about successful management o f COVID -19, 
comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent D ata and Safety Monitoring B oard (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to 
make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.   The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a “ recovered” 
status (per the primary objective) . The primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled 
in order to 400 recoveries.  An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup (those with baseline status of “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen” or “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care”)  is also of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, [ADDRESS_551781] a  study visit at Days 15, 22, and  29 as an outpatient. For discharged 
subjects, i t is preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory 
tests and OP swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research  as well as  clinical 
outcome data. However , infection control or other restrictions may limit the ability of the subject 
to return to the clinic.  In this case, Day [ADDRESS_551782] laboratory tests or collection of 
samples  and may  also be conducted by [CONTACT_648].  
 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 65 All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy, safety, and laboratory assessments. Safety 
laboratory tests and blood (serum and plasma) research  samples and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs 
will be obtained on Days 1 (prior to infusion) and Days  3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) . OP 
swabs and blood (serum only) plus safety laboratory tests will be collected on  Day 15 and 29 (if 
the subject attends an  in-person visit or are still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]).  
 The primary outcome is time to recovery by [CONTACT_2006] 29 (see table below for definition based on the ordinal scale).  A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment- related improvements in the 8 -point 
ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID -19, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_435617] a blinded sa mple size reassessment  (see section 9 for more details).   
 
Study Objectives  
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  
(OUTCOME MEASURES)  
Primary   
To evaluate the clinical efficacy, as assessed 
by [CONTACT_435652], of different investigational therapeutics as compared to the control arm. Day of recovery is defined as the first day on 
which the subject satisfies one of the following three categories from the ordinal scale:

oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care;  
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities 
and/or requiring home oxygen; 
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on 
activities.  
Recovery is evaluated up until Day 29.

2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Study Rationale  
COVID-19 is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_19538] a novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) and causes 
substantial morbidity  and mortality.  There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with 
SARS -CoV-2 or therapeutic agent to treat COVID -19. This clinical trial is designed to evaluate 
investigational therapeutics for the treatment of adult s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19. 
2.2 Background  
2.2.1 Purpose of Study  
Coronavirus (CoVs) are positive- sense , single stranded, enveloped RNA viruses, many of which 
are commonly found in humans and cause mild symptoms. Over the past two decades, emerging 
pathogenic CoVs capable of causing life-threatening disease in humans and animals have been identified, namely , severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (SARS- CoV) in 2002-[ADDRESS_551796] respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] (MERS -CoV)  in 2012.  
 In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee  (Wuhan, China)  identified an 
outbreak of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus RNA was quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel coronavirus has been designated as SARS -COV-2 and has 89% 
nucleotide identity with bat SARS -like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS- CoV ( 1). 
The human disease caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV-[ADDRESS_551797] (~80%) 
cases, COVID -[ADDRESS_551798] US COVID -19 death occurred on February 29, 2020.

agencies. As a result, on January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency 
Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID -[ADDRESS_551799] that these numbers will continue to rise (2 ).  
 Global efforts to evaluate novel antivirals and therapeutic interventions to treat COVID -[ADDRESS_551800] 
intensified. There is currently no vaccine to prevent SARS -CoV-2 infection or the rapeutic agent 
to treat COVID -19. Therefore, there is an urgent public health need for rapid development of 
novel interventions.   
2.2.2 Potential Therapeutics 
Remdesivir (GS -5734) is a broad-spectrum nucleotide prodrug that inhibits RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase activity among a diverse group of RNA viruses including filoviruses (e.g. 
Ebola, Sudan, Marburg), paramyxoviruses (e.g., RSV, Nipah, Hendra) and pathogenic coronaviruses ( 3-5).  Multiple nonhuman primate studies demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of 
remdesivir against Ebola virus (4, 5). Remdesivir was used in a randomized clinical trial for Ebola ( the PALM study) (6). While remdesivir was demonstrated to be inferior to investigational 
treatment with monoclonal antibodies MAb114 and REGN-E B3 in the PALM study, the lack of 
a control arm limits interpretation of the clinical efficacy of remdesivir . Studies in human airway 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_435623], including MERS- CoV ( 7). In mouse infection models, remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy 
against SARS -CoV and ME RS-CoV ( 7,8). In vitro studies with mouse hepatitis virus ( a murine 
coronavirus) found that remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication through interference with the viral polymerase, despi[INVESTIGATOR_435624] a viral proofreading exoribonuclease (9). In that study, coronaviruses that were partially resistant to inhibition by [CONTACT_435655], and fitness was impaired in the res istant viruses as 
compared to wild-type MERS-CoV. In a recent non-human primate study, therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated [ADDRESS_551801] inoculation with MERS -CoV provided clinical benefit with a 
reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions (10,11).  These nonclinical data suggest that remdesivir might be useful 
for the treatment of COVID -19 for which no medical countermeasures are currently approved, 
and support testing the e fficacy of remdesivir treatment in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103138] -19 
(12).  
2.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
2.3.1 Known Potential Risks  
Potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with having blood drawn, the IV cathete rization, possible reactions to remdesivir  (as noted in Section 2.3.2), and breach of 
confidentiality.  
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0

hematoma formation, and infusate extravasation; less frequent but significant complications include bloodstream and local infections. The use of aseptic (sterile) technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn or at catheter site less likely.  
 Risks to Privacy Subjects will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI). All attempts will be made to keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law. However, there is a ch ance that 
unauthorized persons will see the subject’s PHI. All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet or maintained in a locked room at the participating clinical site. Electronic files will be password protected. Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this trial will be allowed access to the PHI that is collected. Any publication from this trial will not use information that will identify subjects. Organizations that may inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating site for quality assurance and data analysis 
include groups such as the IRB, NIAID and applicable regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA). For more 
information about confidentiality and privacy see Section 10.1.3.  For each new therapeutic agent under investigation, findings from the preclinical and clinical studies will be briefly described in this section and a summary of the findings described in the Investigator Brochure (IB) will be in an appendix.

and multiple once daily doses of remdesivir 150 mg for up to 14 days. M ild (Grade 1)  reversible 
PT prolongation was also noted in some subjects but without any clinically  significant change in 
INR or other evidence of hepatic effects. The mechanism of these elevations is currently unknown. Based on these clinical observations, patients with ALT or AST >5 times the upper limit of normal will not be eligible for study enroll ment. R egular laboratory assessments will be 
performed in order to monitor hepatic function and PT . Any observed liver function- related 
laboratory abnormalities or possibly related AEs will be treated appropriately and followed to resolution.   
In nonclinical animal studies, toxicity studies found dose-dependent and reversible kidney injury and dysfunction. In clinical studies, no evidence of nephrotoxicity has been observed with single doses of remdesivir up to 225 mg or multiple once daily doses of remdesivir 150 mg for up to 14 days. A 150-mg dose of the solution and lyophilized formulations of remdesivir contains 9 g and 
4.5 g, respectively, of sulfobutylether- beta- cyclodextrin  (SBECD ), for which the maximum daily 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 65 recommended daily dose (based on a European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) safety review) is 
approximately 250 mg/kg. Because SBECD is renally cleared, subjects with moderate or severe 
renal impairment may have SBECD exposures greater than those with less severe r enal 
impairment or normal renal function. Based on this information, patients with  an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than  30 ml/min (including subjects requiring 
hemo dialysis  or hemofiltration ) will not be eligible for study enrollment. 
 Remdesivir is a substrate for CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. However, coadministration with inhibitors of these CYP isoforms is unlikely to markedly increase remdesivir levels, as its metabolism is likely to be predominantly mediated by [CONTACT_435656].  See IB for full 
discussion of clinical experience and risks.   There is the potential of the SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_551804] been self -limited and resolved after cessation of the

minimize the risk to subjects. While there may not be benefits for an individual subject, there may 
be benefits to society if a safe, efficacious therapeutic agent can be identified during this global

4.1 Overall Design  
This study is an adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435625]-19. 
The study is a multicenter trial that will be conducted in up to approximately 100 sites globally. The study will compare different investigational therapeutic agents to a control arm. There will be interim monitoring to allow  early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589], efficacy, or safety. If one therapy 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 65 proves to be efficacious, then this treatment may become the control arm for comparison(s) with 
new experimental treatment(s). Any such change would be accompanied by [CONTACT_435651]. Because background standards of supportive care may evolve/improve over time as more is 
learned about successful management of COVID-19, comparisons of safety and efficacy will be based on data from concurrently randomized subjects. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor interim data to make recommendations about early study closure or changes to study arms.   The initial sample size is projected to be 572 subjects to achieve 400 subjects with a “ recovered” 
status (per  the primary objective) . The primary analysis will be based on those subjects enrolled 
in order to 400 recoveries.  An additional analysis of the moderate severity subgroup (those with baseline status of “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen” or “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care”)  is also of public health importance. Hence, enrollment will be permitted until the date of April 20, [ADDRESS_551807] a study visit at Days 15, 22, and 29. For discharged subje cts, i t is 
preferred that the Day 15 and 29 visits are in person to obtain safety laboratory tests and OP 
swab and blood (serum only) samples for secondary research  as well as clinical outcome data. 
However , infection control or other restrictions may limi t the ability of the subject to return to 
the clinic.  In this case, these visits may be conducted by [CONTACT_648], and only clinical data will be 
obtained. The Day [ADDRESS_551808] laboratory tests or collection of samples  and may also 
be conducted by [CONTACT_648].   The primary outcome is time to recovery by [CONTACT_2006] 29 (see table below for definition based on the ordinal scale).  A key secondary outcome evaluates treatment- related improvements in the 8 -point 
ordinal scale at Day 15. As little is known about the clinical course of COVID -19, a n evaluation 
of the pooled (i.e., blinded to treatment assignment) proportion recovered will be used to gauge whether the targeted total number of subjects in the recovered categories of the ordinal scale will 
be achieved  with  a planned sample size of [ADDRESS_551809].  The analysis of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_435626],

primary form of contraception not including hormonal contraception from the time of screening through Day 29.  
8. Agrees to not participate in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID -19 or 
SARS -CoV-2 through Day 29. 
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 
1. ALT  or AST > 5 times the upper limit of normal.  
2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ) < 30  ml/min  (including patients receiving 
hemodialysis or hemofiltration).

5. Allergy to any study medication. 
 
5.2.1 Exclusion of Spec ific Populations  
Children and adolescents will not be included in this trial. Remdesivir has only been used in a 
small number of pediatric patients. Initial information about the epi[INVESTIGATOR_40270] -19 
indicates that the overwhelming burden of severe disease occurs among older adults, especially 
those with comorbidities.  Given significant gaps in knowledge in this population, and a low 
incidence of severe morbidity/mortality in children, the risk/benefits do not warrant inclusion of 
this population into this trial at this time.  
 In nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies, remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryo-fetal development when administered to pregnant animals. Embryonic toxicity was seen

regulations permit researchers to obtain consent from a legally authorized  representative (LAR). 
The study team will obtain consent from these vulnerable subjects using an IRB-approved protocol- specific process for consent using a LAR.  For subjects for whom a LAR gave consent, during the course of the study, if the subject regains the capacity to consent, informed consent must be obtained from the subject and the subject offered the ability to leave the study if desired. 
5.4 Lifestyle Considerations  
During this study, subjects are asked to: 
• Refrain from drinking alcohol through Day 15.  
• Avoid taking paracetamol (acetaminophen) through Day 15. (Other non- steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs or antipyretic drugs are acceptable) . 
• Avoid getting pregnant during the study from Day 1 through Day 29. 
• Avoid participation in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID -19 or SARS -
CoV-2. Co -enrollment for natural history studies of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 is 
permitted ; however, participation in both ACTT and natural history studies can only 
occur if the recommended blood collection volumes are not exceeded.

6.1.[ADDRESS_551825] Description  
Remdesivir is a single diastereomer monophosphoramidate prodrug designed for the intracellular 
delivery of a modified adenine nucleoside analog GS-441524. In addition to the active 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0

DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 65 ingredient, the lyophilized formulation of remdesivir contains the following inactive ingredients: 
water for injection, SBECD, and hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide. 
 The supplied matching placebo lyophilized formulation is identical in physical appearance to the active lyophilized formulation and contains the same inactive ingredients. Alternatively, due to limitations on placebo supplies, normal saline may  be given at an equal volume as a placebo in 
place of the lyophilized formulation.  
6.1.2 Dosing and Administration 
Subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_551826] 2 arms:  
• Remdesivir will be administered as a [ADDRESS_551827] is no longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], then infusions will no longer be given.  
o The total course should not exceed 10 calendar days even if an infusion was 
missed.  
• A matching placebo will be given at an equal volume at the same schedule.   
 The dose should be given the same time each day (+/ - 2 hours for medication scheduling). 
 Any dose that is delayed may be given later that calendar day . Any dose that is missed (not given 
that calendar day) is not made up. The treatment course continues as described ab ove even if the 
subject becomes PCR negative.   
 
6.1.3 Dose Escalation 
Not Applicable 
 
6.1.4 Dose Modifications 
There are no clinical safety or pharmacokinetic data available for remdesivir  in patients with 
renal and/or hepatic impairment. Given the benefit- to-risk ratio in patients with COVID -19, these 
subjects are excluded from the study.  
 If the eGFR  decreases to  an eGFR < 25 ml/min , the study infusion should not be given on that 
day. The infusion may be resumed on the next day if the eGFR  returns to ≥ 30 ml/min . If the 
subject’s renal function worsens to the point that they require hemo dialysis  or hemofiltration , 
study product will be discontinued.  If the ALT and/or AST increases to > [ADDRESS_551828] ≤ [ADDRESS_551829]´s signs and symptoms.

be documented on the appropriate study product accountability record or dispensing log. The Sponsor ’s monitoring staff will verify the participating site’s study product accountability 
records and dispensing logs per the site monitoring plan. Refer to the protocol- specific MOP for 
details on storing study medications.  
Destruction:  
After the study treatment period has ended or as appropriate over the course of the study after 
study product accountability has been per formed, used active and placebo vials can be destroyed 
on-site following applicable site procedures with a second staff  member  observing and verifying 
the destruction.  
Unused vials at the end of the study should be saved until instructed by [CONTACT_1034]. 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_551830]: Remdesivir  
The lyophilized formulation of remdesivir  is a preservative- free, white to off- white or yellow,  
lyophilized solid containing 150 mg or 100 mg of remdesivir to be reconstituted with 29 mL or 
19 mL (respectively) of sterile water  for injection respectively and diluted into IV infusion fluids 
prior to IV infusion. Following reconstitution, each vial contains a 5 mg/mL remdesivir concentrated solution with sufficient volume to allow withdrawal of 30 mL (150 mg of remdesivir)  or 20 mL (100 mg of remdesivir).  
 It is supplied as a sterile product in a single- use, Type 1 clear glass vial. In addition to the active 
ingredient, the lyophilized formulation of remdesivir contains the following inactive ingredients:

refer to the MOP.  
 
Placebo:  
The supplied matching placebo lyophilized formulation, 150 mg or 100 mg equivalent, is identical in physical appearance to the active lyophilized formulation and contains the same inactive ingredients. The lyophilized formulation of matching placebo is filled in a Type 1 clear glass vial closed with a  rubber stopper and aluminum seal with a plastic flip -off cap. Each single-
use vial contains sufficient volume to allow withdrawal of 30 mL or 20 mL of placebo following reconstitution.  Alternatively, due to limitations on placebo supplies, a matching placebo of normal saline may  
be given at an equal volume at the same schedule.  In this case, IV bags of study treatment (both 
the Active and the Placebo) will be covered to mask the slight color difference between the remdesivir solution and placebo to maintain the study blind.   Each of the study products will be labeled according to manufacturer specifications and include the statement “Caution: New Drug Limited by [CONTACT_12201].”  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_551831]: Remdesivir  
Ambient vials of the lyophilized formulation of remdesivir should be stored below 30°C. The 
lyophilized formulation needs to be reconstituted and then diluted into IV infusion fluids before use. After reconstitution, the total storage time before completion of admin istration (including 
any time before or after dilution) should not exceed 4 hours at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature (2°C to 8°C).  See MOP for additional information.

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
The study will randomize subjects  1:[ADDRESS_551834]. If additional arms 
are added to or dropped from the trial, randomization will proceed with an equal probability of assignment to each of the remaining arms.  Randomization will be stratified  by: 
• Site 
• Severity of illness at enrollment:  
o Severe disease: requiring mechanical ventilation , requiring oxygen, a SpO2 ≤ 94% 
on room air, or tachypnea (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ≥ 24 breaths/min). 
o Mild -moderate disease: SpO2 > 94% and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 24 breaths/min without 
supplemental oxygen.  
 The randomization procedure will be described in the MOP.   
6.[ADDRESS_551835]. Administration and date, and  time, will 
be entered into the case report form (CRF).  
 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Therapy prior to enrollment with any other experimental treatm ent or off- label use of marketed 
medications that are intended as specific treatment for COVID -19 or the SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(i.e., post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP]) are permitted but must be discontinued on enrollment. 
There is no waiting period between discontinuation of these treatments and infusion of study 
product. However, these prior treatments and their end date should be documented on the 
Concomitant Medication (CCM) form.  
 
Subject s who are taking another antiviral for a concurrent infect ion (e.g. oseltamivir for an 
influenza virus, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir for HIV, etc.) or immunosuppressive drugs for other medical conditions (tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis, hydroxychloroquine for lupus, etc.) may  
continue with the treatment.   
 
A subject  cannot participate in another clinical trial for the treatment of COVID -19 until after  Day 
29 (s ee exclusion criteria) .  
 
If the local standard of care per written policies or guidelines for treatment for COVID -19 or 
SARS -CoV-2 infection (i.e. , not just an individual clinician decision) includes lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 
(Kaletra) , hydroxychloroquine or other agents (e.g. those targeting the host immune response), 
then continuing these during the study is permitted, but may require additional safety monitoring 
as determined by [CONTACT_68071] . Additionally, there should be plans on how the 
concomitant drugs are stopped for additive toxicities (Section 6.1.4).  If the re are NO written 
policies or guidelines for local standard of care,  concomitant use of any other experimental

response.  
 
No clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies have been conducted w ith remdesivir . Final 
guidance about the drug and possible DDI should come from the IB and the protocol. Site PIs 
should review the prescription drugs that the subject is getting for pre-existing comorbidi ties and 
determine if these agents may lead  to antagonism or synergy with remdesivir and modify safety 
monitoring accordingly. 
 
There is no available data on potential interactions between remdesivir and other anti -SARS -
CoV investigational agents. Administering remdesivir concurrently with other agents may lead to antagonism or synergy or may have no effect.   Concomitant medications will be assessed only from [ADDRESS_551837]. Other antipyretics and/or analgesics that are not hepatotoxic 
may be used, such as NSAIDS.

that continued dosing is not in the best interest of the patient. In addition, a subject  in this clinical study may discontinue study drug at their request for any 
reaso n. Every effort should be made to encourage subjects to remain in the study for the duration 
of their planned outcome assessments. Subjects should be educated on the continued scientific 
importance of their data, even if they discontinue study drug.

8. STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND  PROCEDURES 
8.1 Screening and Efficacy Assessments  
8.1.1 Screening Procedures  
Screening procedures may be done over one to two calendar days (from Day -1 to Day 1). However, in many cases all t he screening assessments can be done in less than 24 hours. If that is 
the case, Day 1 pre-infusion baseline assessments, specimen collection and the initial infusion can occur on the same calendar day as the screening procedures.

Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 65  
After the informed cons ent, the following assessments are performed to determine eligibility and 
obtain baseline data: 
• Confirm the positive SARS-CoV- [ADDRESS_551842] result (per inclusion criteria) .  
• Take a f ocused medical  history , including the following information:  
• Day of onset of COVID-19 signs and symptoms. 
• History of chronic medical conditions including chronic oxygen requirement prior to onset of COVID-19. 
• History of m edication allergies . 
• Medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_435631] s taken in the 7 days prior to Day 1. 
• Ask if they are participating in another clinical trial or plan to enroll in another clinical trial in the next 30 days . 
• Women of childbearing potential should be counseled to either practice abstinence or use at 
least one primary form of contraception not including hormonal contraception from the time 
of screening through Day 29. Women should be confirmed to not be breastfeeding. 
• Note: If a wom an is either postmenopausal (i.e., has had ≥12 months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea) or s urgically sterile (i.e., has had a hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy 
(oophorectomy), or bilateral tubal ligation), she is not considered to be of 
childbearing potential.  
• Height and weight (height can be self -reported) . 
• Results of recent radiographic imaging (x- ray or CT scan) . 
• SpO2 . 
• Blood for screening laboratory evaluations if not done as part of routine clinical care in the 
preceding 48 hours: 
 ALT . 
 AST . 
 Creatinine  (and calculate eGFR ).  
• Any automated calculation by [CONTACT_435659].  The site should select a formula to be used for all 
subjects enrolled at the site for the duration of the study. 
• Urine or s erum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential). 
 
Clinical screening laboratory evaluations will be performed locally by [CONTACT_50821]. The 
volume of venous blood to be collected is presented in Table 3. 
 The overall eligibility of the subject to participate in the study will be assessed once all screening values are available.  Complete the Eligibility Checklist on day of enrollment as this form 
includes data needed to register all potential subjects in the Advantage eClinical system. The

of the ordinal scale and NEWS  and completing or recording a baseline physical examination that 
was done. 
8.1.2 Efficacy Assessments  
For all baseline assessments and follow-up visits, refer to the Schedule of Assessments (SOA) 
for procedure to be done, and details below for each assessment. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measures of clinical support , limitations and infection control 
The subject’s clinical status will be captured on each study day while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435618] [ADDRESS_551844] prior to infusion, as time 
permits.  The following measures are recorded  for the ordinal scale: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
• Oxygen requirement. 
• Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (via mask)  requirement. 
• High flow oxygen requirement . 
• Invasive mechanical ventilation  (via endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube) 
requirement . 
• ECMO requirement . 
• Ongoing medical care preventing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (COVID -19 related or other medical 
conditions). 
• Limitations of physical activity (s elf-assessed).  
• Isolated for infection control purposes.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Ordinal Scale  
 The ordinal scale is the primary measure of clinical outcome.  
 The scale used in this study is as follows  (from worst to best): 
• Death;  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen;

DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 65 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care 
(COVID -19 related or otherwise);  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care;  
o This would include those kept in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41348]/infection control, awaiting bed in rehabilitation facility or homecare, etc.  
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities  
 To determine a subject’s clinical status using  the ordinal scale: On Day 1, report the ir clinical 
status at randomization. On Day 2, report the period from randomization to midnight on Day 1. On Day [ADDRESS_551845] clinical assessment for the previous day (i.e., midnight to midnight; 00:00 – 23:59 (24- hr clock)). 
For example, on study Day [ADDRESS_551846] being death followed by [CONTACT_119927], mechanical ventilation, etc. The Day 2 measurement is assessed as occurring anytime in that 24-hour period (00:00 to 23:59).  
[IP_ADDRESS] National Early War ning Score (NEWS)  
NEWS  has demonstrated an ability to discriminate subject s at risk of poor outcomes. (Smith, 
2016). This score is based on 7 clinical parameters (see Table 2). The NEWS is being used as an 
efficacy measure. The NEW Score should be evaluated daily while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119818] [ADDRESS_551847] (EMR) using the last 
measurement prior to the time of assessmen t and a numeric score is given for each parameter 
(e.g., a RR of 9 is one point, oxygen saturation of 92 is two points). This is recorded for the day 
obtained ( i.e., on Day 3, the vital signs and other parameters  from Day 3 are used to obtain NEW 
Score for Day 3 ).

8.1.3  Exploratory assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Viral Load and/or Shedding  
As outlined on the SOA, OP swabs and plasma and serum will be collected on Day 1 ; and Days 
3, 5, 8, and 11 (while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]); and OP swabs and serum on Day 15 and 29 ( if attends an in- 
person visit or still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] ). Samples are stor ed as outlined in the MOP.  These assays are 
not developed yet, and the ability to test samples at one central lab is not clear. Therefore,  while 
viral load/shedding is thought to be an important endpoint, considering the limitations  above, it is 
listed as an exploratory endpoint.  
 OP swabs are preferred, but if these are not obtainable, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs may be 
substituted. Due to limited lack of swabs and other supplies at some sites and limitation s on 
personal prote ctive equipment  (PPE), the inability to obtain these samples are not considered 
protocol deviations and should be documented in the subject’s record.   If virology assays can be set up with enough numbers of specimens tested, these data will be 
submitted as part of the Clinical Study Report (CSR) . This may be submitted separately, as a 
supplemental C SR.  
 Samples collected for viral assessment may be probed for the emergence of antiviral resistance at a future date.  These data, if av ailable, may be submitted as a supplement report.  
 
The schedule of assessments ( SOA, Section 1.2) lists several research laboratory samples.  It is 
preferred that the se samples are collected and sent to the NIAID repository to be tested in one 
central laboratory.  Current US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance is 
these samples can be processed in a Biosafety Laboratory (BSL) 2 environment. However, 
institutions may impose restrictions on processing the samples (i.e., they may require BSL -3) or 
there may be restrictions on sending samples. In these circumstances, the following apply:

• If the samples can be processed but cannot be sent to the repository, the samples may be 
stored locally.  
• The sponsor may elect to have some or all of these samples run locally, pending confirmation of the assays to be used and the qualifications of the local laboratory. The 
sponsor will work with the site to determine when  this could occur and how these data can 
be imported into the study database.  
• If a BSL -3 environment is needed for processing these samples, these samples may be 
omitted.

 Blood for serum (for secondary research)  
• If the samples can be processed and but not sent to the repository, the samples may be stored locally.  
• If a BSL -3 environment is needed for processing these samples, these samples may be 
omitted .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Alternative Ordinal Scales  
Given the limited clinical data available for COVID -19, the best construct of ordinal scale is not 
known. Additional data may be used to construct different ordinal scales to test their utility in a treatment study.  These are hypothesis generating and will not be submitted as part of a final 
CSR. 
 
8.2 Safety and Other Assessments  
Study procedures are specified in the SOA. A study physician licensed to make medical diagnoses and listed on the 1572 will be responsible for all trial- related medical decisions.  
 
Physical examination :  
A targeted physical examination will be performed at baseline prior to initial infusion  on Day 1. 
The baseline physical examination can be one that is conducted from screening to Day 1. Post-baseline physical examinations will be done only when needed to evaluate possible adverse 
event (s) (i.e. any new signs or symptoms). No routine physical exam is needed for stu dy visits  
after Day 1 .

8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the severity of any pre- existing medical 
condition increases to severity level [ADDRESS_551852] many symptoms and abnormalities in vital signs and laboratory values . All Grade 3  and 4 AEs will be captured as 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 65 AEs in this trial. In addition, any Grade 2 or higher, suspected drug- related hypersensitivity 
reaction wi ll be reported as an AE  in this trial (see Section 7.1.1). 
 
8.3.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious (i.e ., is an SAE) if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death ; 
• A life -threatening AE; 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; or 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not meet the above criteria may be considered serious when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  “Life- threatening” refers to an AE that at occurrence represents an immediate risk of death to a 
subject. An event that may cause death if it occurs in a more severe form is not considered life-threatening. Similarly, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_178105] a SAE.  All SA Es, as with any AE, will be assessed for severity and relationship to study intervention. 
 All SAEs will be recorded on the SAE CRF . 
 All SAEs will be followed through resolution or stabilization by a licensed study physician (for IND studies, a physician listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_54720]-Investigator).  All SAEs will be reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_435661]  (for periodic 
review), and the IRB/IEC. 
8.3.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is any SAE  where a causal relationship with the study product is at least reasonably 
possible but is not listed in the IIB, Package Insert, and/or Summary of Product Characteristics. 8.3.4 Classification of an Adverse Event 
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689]- site investigator 
who is qualified (licensed) to diagnose AE information, provide a medical evaluation of AEs, 
and classify AEs based upon medical judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, 
physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.

Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 65 [IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
All AEs  and SAEs will be assessed for severity using the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, version 2.1 (July 2017).  
 
For AEs not included in the Table, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity. In 
addition, all deaths related to an AE are to be classified as grade 5 according to the DAIDS Table.   
  
• Moderate (Grade 2) : Events that are usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living  and 
causes  discomfort , but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
subject.  
 
• Severe (Grade 3) : Events that interrupt usual activities of daily livin g, or significantly 
affect clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Severe events are usually incapacitating. 
 
• Severe (Grade 4) : Events that are potentially life threatening.  
 
• Deaths (Grade 5):  All deaths related to an AE are to be classified as grade 5.  (per DAIDS 
Table).  
 
AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The start and stop dates (d uration) of each reported AE will be recorded on the appropriate CRF . 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Intervention 
For each reported adverse reaction, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_435632]: 
 
• Related  – There is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event, and 
the AE is known to occur with the study intervention or there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. 
 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study

Information on all AEs will be recorded on the appropriate CRF . All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed because of an AE should be grouped 
together and recorded as a single diagnosis. If the AE is a laboratory abnormality that is part of 
a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as the syndrome or diagnosis rather than 
the individual laboratory abnormality. Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start 
and stop date), severity, association with the study product, action(s) taken, and outcome. 
8.3.6 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigators Reporting of SAEs 
Any AE that meets a protocol-defined criterion as a SAE must be submitted within 24 hours of 
site awareness on an SAE form to the DMID Pharmacovigilance Group, at the following address:

8.4 Unanticipated Problems  
8.4.1 Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that meets the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
 Related to participation in the research (mean ing there is a reasonable possibility that the  
incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 
8.4.2 Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, all UPs  will be reported using the following 
timeline:  
 UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the Statistical and Data Coordinating Center ( SDCC )/study Sponsor within 24 hours of the investigator becoming 
aware of the event per the above describe SAE reporting process.  
 Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the SDCC/study Sponsor within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem. 
9. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS 
This study is intended to allow for two types of adaptations: 1) sample size re- estimation and 2) 
addition of new experimental arm(s). A brief summary is provided here. Details will be 
described in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP) .  
 
Sample size re- estimation : The target of 400 recoveries corresponds to a total sample size that 
depends on the proportion of subjects who recover by [CONTACT_2006] 29. This proportion will be evaluated on pooled (i.e., blinded) data to evaluate the total sample size required . A preliminary estimate 
based on a 70% recovery probability is 572 patients.  
 
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 65 Addition of new experimental therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: If additional data become available to add an 
experimental therapy, the sample size will be updated accordingly. Analyses of newly added 
arm(s) will be performed comparing concurrently enrolled control subjects. This approach was used in the recent PALM study in patients with Ebola virus disease [Mulangu 2019]. Principles 
of adding arms and addressing questions of “when, what and how” to add them will be developed to guide the study team in their decision-making and  will be outlined in a document 
on interim monitoring.  
9.[ADDRESS_551857] is the “common odds ratio,” which quantifies the shift in the severity distribution resulting from treatment. For an efficacious treatment, an odds ratio greater than 1 quantifies an improvement in disease severity; a value of 2 indicates a bigger improvement than a value of 1.25. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the odds of improvement on the ordinal scale is the same for the placebo and experimental treatment arms (i.e., the common odds ratio is 1). It is worth noting that, for large sample sizes, the test based on the proportional odds model is nearly the same as the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
9.2 Sample Size Determination  
 
Primary endpoint: The log- rank test will be used to compare treatment arms with respect to time 
to recovery. For the log-rank test, the two key determinants of power are the total number of events (i.e., recoveries) E and the treatment -to-control ratio of the rate of recovery, R. The 
number of events required for power 1−𝛽𝛽 to detect a recovery rate ratio of θ using a two- tailed 
test at alpha=0.05 is approximately 
𝐸𝐸=4�1.96+𝑧𝑧
𝛽𝛽�2
{ln(𝜃𝜃)}2, 
where 𝑧𝑧𝛽𝛽 is the 100 (1−𝛽𝛽)th percentile of the standard normal distribution. 
For 85% power, approximately [ADDRESS_551858] a 40% increase in the rate of 
recovery ( 𝜃𝜃= 1. 40) from remdesivir.  A recovery rate ratio of 1.40 is similar to, but slightly 
higher than the figure of 1.31 reported in Cao, Wang, Wen et al. (2020) for a lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir 
trial that used time to improvement by 2 categories as primary endpoint. A total of 400 recoveries is needed for a recovery ratio of 1.35 with 85% power. Table 4 provides power for 
various recovery rate ratio s.

Key secondary: A sample size can be computed using an (assumed) ordinal scale distribution for 
the placebo and the odds ratio representing clinical improvement. The odds ratio represents the 
odds of improvement in the ordinal scale for treatment relative to placebo [Whitehead, 1993]. 
The sample size to detect a given odds ratio for 1:[ADDRESS_551859] at level α 
is given by 
12�𝑧𝑧α/2+𝑧𝑧β�2
λ2(1−∑𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖3𝐾𝐾
𝑖𝑖=1), 
 
where λ is the log odds ratio, 𝑝𝑝 𝑖𝑖 is the overall probability (combined over both arms) of being in 
the ith category of the K ordinal outcomes, and 𝑧𝑧α/2 and  𝑧𝑧𝛽𝛽 are the 1−α/2 and 1−β quantiles 
of the standard normal distribution.  
 Table 5 displays five scenarios considered for outcome probabilities in the placebo arm for 
sample size determination. There is significant uncertainty with these assumptions given the 
limited data available. Table 5 shows a range of sample sizes for odds ratios ranging from 1.25 to 
2.5 for 85% power. For 90% power, increase the sample size by 17%. Table 6 displays the 
probabilities of being in different categories of the ordinal scale under an odds ratio of 1.75. A total sample size of 396 gives approximately 85% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_551860] at level α= 0. 05. The categories of the 8 -point ordinal scale are:  
 
• Death;  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring supplemental oxygen; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care 
(COVID -19 related or otherwise);  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical 
care; 
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 
• Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], no limitations on activities.  
 
Note that the data elements contributing to this scale will be captur ed separately, in order to 
facilitate different orderings or groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], as might arise if external data provide information about the clinical course of disease.

on those subjects enrolled in order to 400 recoveries. Subsequent analysis will be performed on 
all enrolled subjects.    
9.4 Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1 General Approach  
This is a double-blind placebo controlled randomized trial testing a superiority hypothesis with a two-sided type I error rate of 5%. Secondary hypotheses have been ordered according to relative 
importance, with one key secondary hypothesis highlighted. These will be described according to the appropriate summary statistics (e.g., proportions for categorical data, means with 95% confidence intervals for continuous data, median for time- to-event data).  
 A statistical analysis plan  will be developed and filed with the study sponsor prior to unblinding 
of study and database lock.   Unblinding of the study will occur after all subjects enrolled for [ADDRESS_551862], where stratification is according to 
baseline disease severity  (i.e. protocol defined mild/moderate vs severe disease). Deaths will be 
considered censored at Day 29. 
 
9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
 
1) The ordinal scale will be used to estimate a proportional odds model by [CONTACT_119935]. 
The hypothesis test will perform a stratified test to evaluate whether the common odds 
ratio for treatment is equal to one. The distribution of severity results will be summarized by [CONTACT_119936]. Efforts to minimize loss -to-follow-up will be 
considerable. However, small amounts of missing data may occur. In such cases, subjects without final outcome data will be excluded from the analysis. Sensitivity analyses will evaluate the impact of making different assumptions about missing observations. These analyses will be defined in the SAP.   
2) Differences in time -to-event endpoints (e.g., time to a t least  a one category improvement 
in ordinal scale) by [CONTACT_119937] -Meier curves and 95% 
confidence bounds. The same procedure will be used to compare time to at least a two category improvement.

DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 65 3) Change in ordinal scale at specific time poi nts will be summarized by [CONTACT_119938] (e.g., 
proportion who have a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-point improvement or 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-point 
worsening). 
4) Duration of event (e.g., duration of mechanical ventilation) will be summarized according to median days with quartiles.  
5) Binary data (e.g., incidence of new oxygen use) will be summarized as a percent with 95% confidence intervals. Comparisons between arms will be presented as differences in proportions with 95% confidence intervals. 
6) Categorical data (e.g., 28- day mortality or ordinal scale by [CONTACT_4475]) may be summarized 
according to proportions by [CONTACT_119939]/or odds ratios with confidence intervals.  
 Procedures for handling missing data, including informative censoring (e.g., a missing duration of oxygen use endpoint due to a death), will be described in the SAP.

by [CONTACT_435662]-19 or study intervention. AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA). AEs will be 
presented by [CONTACT_9313], duration (in days), start- and stop- date. Adverse events leading 
to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment- emergent AEs 
will be presented either in a table or a li sting.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_551864] deviation will be summarized. Categorical variables will be described by [CONTACT_119942] (with the corresponding sample size numbers).   
9.4.6 Planned Interim and Early Analyses  
Early analyses:  
A blinded sample size re- estimation will be conducted after approximately [ADDRESS_551865] recovered by [CONTACT_2006] 29, wh ich will provide important 
information about the number of patients needed to achieve 400 recoveries. Additionally, the 
number of deaths will be evaluated.  Additional early analyses include monitoring enrollment, baseline characteristics, and follow-up rates throughout the course of the study by [CONTACT_3476]. Analyses will be conducted blinded to 
treatment assignment.  
 
Interim analyses:  
A DSMB will monitor ongoing results to ensure subject  well -being and safety as well as study 
integrity. The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when 
there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference. More details about the interim

document for the DSMB.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will evaluate Grade 3 and 4 AE and SAEs by [CONTACT_2939].  Safety monitoring 
will be ongoi ng (see section 10.1.6) and evaluate safety results weekly.  This approach is less 
conservative than what will be used to test for early efficacy results because prov ing definitive

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_435634]-DeMets spending f unction that mimics O’Brien -Fleming 
boundaries: (3.71, 2.51, 1.99). The unblinded statistical team will prepare these reports for review by [CONTACT_4318].   
[IP_ADDRESS] Interim Efficacy Review  
The Lan -DeMets spending function analog of the O’Brien-Fleming boundaries will be used to 
monitor the primary endpoint as a guide for the DSMB for an overall two-sided type- I error rate 
of 0.05. Interim efficacy analyses will be conducted after the blinded sample size re -estimation 
of the primary efficacy endpoint at approximately 33%, 67%, and 100% of total information.  
 
Conditional power will be presented as an additional guide to the DSMB. Conditional power allows computation of the probability of obtaining a statistically significant result by [CONTACT_435663], incorporating and assuming a hypothesized treatment effect (e.g., the treatment effect assumed for sample size determination) thereafter. If conditional power is less than 20% under the original trial assumptions, consideration should be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].   The unblinded statistical team will prepare these closed reports for DSMB review and recommendations. Analyses will be presented with blinded codes for treatment arms to protect against the possibility that the DSMB report may fall into the wrong hands. A DSMB c harter 
will further describe procedures and membership. An additional document on statistical issues related to monitoring will be provided to the DSMB prior to interim analyses.

following subgroups: geographic region, duration of symptoms prior to enrollment, age, sex  and 
comorbidities . A forest plot will display confidence intervals across subgroups. Interaction tests 
will be conducted to determine whether the effect of treatment varies by [CONTACT_6496].  
9.4.8 Exploratory Analyses 
An exploratory analysis will compare treatment efficacy estimates according to the various 
scales outlined in section 8.1.3. Specifically, the probability of falling into category “i” or better 
will be compared between arms for each i.

Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0 
Adaptive COVID- 19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)   2 April  2020 
DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_551871] Research is the re- use of identifiable data or identifiable 
biospecimens that were collected from some other ‘‘primary’’ or ‘‘initial’’ activity, such as the data and samples collected in this protocol. Any use of the sample or data for secondary research purposes, however, will be presented in a separate protocol and require separate IRB approval. 
 
Each sample will be labeled only with a barcode and a unique tracking number to protect subject confidentiality. Secondary research with coded samples and data may occur; however, subjec t 
confidentiality will be maintained as described for this protocol. An IRB review of the secondary research using coded specimens is required.  The subject’s decision can be changed at any time by [CONTACT_154387]. If the subject subsequently changes his/her decision, the samples will be destroyed if the samples have not been used for research or released for a specific research project.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Sharing for Secondary Research 
Data from this study may be used for secondary research. All of the individual subject data collected during the trial will be made available after de -identification. The SAP and Analytic 
Code will also be made available. This data will be available immediately following publication, with no end date.   The investigator may request removal of data on individual study subjects from NIH data 
repositories in the event that a research subject withdraws or changes his or her consent. However, some data that have been distributed for approved research use cannot be retrieved.  
10.1.5 Key Roles and Study Governance 
The study is sponsored by [CONTACT_122830]. Decisions related to the study will be made by a protocol team that includes representatives from all countries, and separate networks within a country. 
10.1.6 Safety Oversight 
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol team oversight 
A subset of the protocol team will review blinded pools of AE data every 2 weeks to ensure no 
significant number of unexpected AEs (AEs that do not fit with the known course of COVID-19). If there are a significant number of unexpected AEs, the DSMB will be asked to review unblinded safety data in an ad hoc meeting.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Data Safety Monitoring Board 
Safety oversight will be conducted by a DSMB that is an independent group of experts that 
monitors subject safety and advises DMID. The DSMB members w ill be separate and 
independent of study personnel participating in this trial and should not have scientific, financial or other conflicts of interest related to this trial. The DSMB will consist of members with appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of the data from this trial.  The DSMB 
should be as broadly informed as possible regarding emerging evidence from related studies. The DSMB will operate under the guidelines of a DMID -approved charter that will be written at the 
organizational meeting of the DSMB. The DSMB will review SAEs on a regular basis and ad

 Overall  This version addresses the comments received from 
the US FDA, Japanese PDMA, DSMB, IRBs, and 
NIAID scientific review.  
 Improved clarity and 
brevity Multiple areas throughout the document were 
reworded to improve clarity (recognized after 
implementation) and edited to minimize redundant 
statements.  
1.[ADDRESS_551885] (OR 1.75) and the [ADDRESS_551886] some COVID-19 patients worsen between 2 
and 4 weeks of illness. We added Day 22 because of 
concerns that the peak illness may be missed.  There 
are also concerns if the more severe population will 
be discharged by [CONTACT_2006] 29.  
 Ordinal scale was 
increased to 8 
categories.  This addresses the concern raised by [CONTACT_435667] “Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179423]” is two separate 
populations – those still needing medical care and 
those kept in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435641].  
 Objectives and 
endpoints were put 
into table format  Multiple comments that the tabular form of 
objectives and endpoints (that was previously in 
Section 4) was much easier to read and understand.  
Protocol 20-0006 Version 3.0

DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 65  Added inclusion 
criteria for admission 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435642], but never 
stated in the inclusion criteria.

 Phase of study Changed to phase 3. After discussion with company, 
and new IB that outlines safety data of > [ADDRESS_551887] enrollment.  
8.1.2 Efficacy assessments 
more detailed  More detail is provided to facilitate these 
assessments. Also, each component that contribute to 
the categories will not be captured separately. This 
will allow the ordinal scale as structured, but also 
will allow  analysis of alternative ordinal scales.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Viral load in plasma 
and resistance  The assessment of viral load in plasma and detection 
of resistance was previously noted on the SOA, but 
never discussed in the text. This has now been added 
in this section.

 Improved clarity  Multiple areas throughout the document were 
reworded to improve clarity (issues that arose with  
implementation)  
 Flexibility  The pandemic has limited ability for people to be 
seen in followup due to infection control and 
restrictions on travel.  Additionally, staff at some sites 
have limited ability to go into rooms  due to limited

400 subjects with a “recovered” status (per the 
primary objective). Additionally, enrollment is 
permitted after the 400 recoveries up to April 20 to 
provide additional da ta about important subgroup s. 
 Primary Endpoint Given evolving data, the precise day of assessment 
of the primary endpoint is not clear. Modeling of the 
prior endpoint suggested if the day is chosen 
incorrectly, the power is significantly decreased. So 
the primary endpoint has been changed from a 
ordinal scale on a given day to days to recovery (the 
best three categories of the ordinal scale.   
 Key secondary 
endpoint  The prior primary endpoint has been labeled as the 
key secondary endpoint.  
 Inclusion Cr iteria #5  Given delays of PCR results in some sites (given 
number of tests and throughput within the lab), the 
PCR positive requirement has been written to allow 
flexibility if the PCR results are delayed.  
 Inclusion Criteria #6  Removed auscultation requ irement given challenges 
of accurate auscultation while in full PPE.   
 Exclusion Criteria #[ADDRESS_551890], the newly 
manufactured lot of remdesivir is in 100mg vials. 
Second, there is limited supply of placebo and the 
options for using saline with an opaque bag for the 
control infusion was added.

DMID/NIAID/NIH  CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_551893] (PREP Act) and the Declaration issued by [CONTACT_293368] U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under that Act. Under the PREP Act and the Declaration, covered persons (such as manufacturers, distributers, program planners, and other qualified persons who prescribe, administer or dispense study product) are immune from liability from the administration , or use of a covered countermeasure, such as Remdesivir . The PREP 
Act provides immunity for covered persons from liability, unless the injury was caused by [CONTACT_154389]. The Declaration invoking the PREP Act for COVID-[ADDRESS_551894] also established the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to 
provide compensation for serious injuries or death that occur as the direct result of the administration or use of certain countermeasures. Any requests for compensation must be filed within one year of the administration or use of the covered countermeasure. Requests for Benefits must be made to the Health Resources and Services Administration ’s (HRSA) 
Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/) by [CONTACT_154390] a Request for Benefits Form and all required medical records and supporting documentation. Additional information on filing a Request for Benefits is available on t he CICP’s website at 
http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/.  Compensation may then be available for reasonable and necessary medical benefits, lost wages and/or death benefits to eligible individuals for certain injuries in accordance with regulations published by [CONTACT_154391] (found at 42 CFR part 110).  
If an individual suffers a serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a 
covered countermeasure in this study, the individual, the individual’s legal or personal representative, the admi nistrator/executor of a deceased individual’s estate, or certain survivors 
may request benefits from the CICP.  A serious physical injury means an injury that warranted hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (whether or not the person was actually hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]) or that led to a significant loss of function or disability.

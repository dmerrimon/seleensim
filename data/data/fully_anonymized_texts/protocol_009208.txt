Background :   The rate of 30 -day rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692195] (HF)  is of great 
concern. Published studies have emphasized the need for adequate care after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692196] -discharge visits with providers.   The purpose of this study was to examine short -term (60 -day) 
health -related quality of life and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692197]® Health Guide 
System (HGS) deployed with American Heart Association  (AHA)  guideline -based HF protocols .  
Methods:  This was a feasib ility project of patients who were candidates for home care after a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10889].  The HGS system was delivered to patient homes. Protocols were deployed to the 
HGS for patients to assess key vital signs, and provide related educational content o n a daily, weekly, or 
monthly basis for [ADDRESS_938968] monitoring periods. Results:  Patients 
(n=26, 62% NYHA Class II) were enrolled , and  were primarily older women with HF and preserved 
systolic function .    Health status significantly improved  between baseline and end of study .  Utility scores 
and adherence were  high.  At 30 days, the all -cause and HF rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692198] 23% and 15%, 
respectively. Greater utility scores were correlated with improvements in health status.   A dherence and 
utility for those not rehospit alized were significantly greate r than for those rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. Conclusion: A 
telehealth system embedded with  AHA education information on HF themes  is feasible and  may be a 
useful  adjunct  to homecare after a HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Utility and adherence to the use of the system was 
associated with a lower rate of rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  A larger trial is warranted.

Introduction:   
      Heart failure  (HF)  is the most common DRG among elderly people and is associated with substantial 
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditures.  1;1  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_692199], the rate 
of 30- day rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692200].   
Of over 11 million Medicare Beneficiaries, 19.6% are rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_22318] 30 days and 34% within [ADDRESS_938969] become available to providers and patients on CMS’ Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692201].  As hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692202], transitioning 
patients to home from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692203].  Published studies have emphasized the 
need for adequate care after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692204] -discharge visits with providers . 3-5  
Unfortunately, there are many barriers that face patients after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] . Barriers  include the 
ability to see a provider within 7- 10 days, availability of transportation and confusion about complex 
medication regimens.   Since a growing number of discharged patients are elderly and home bound, home 
health care  has become a critical source of patient follow -up.  In the ir own home setting, patients should 
be followed in parallel to actual outpatient visits.  Skilled h ome care nursing becomes the “eyes” of the 
provider and, more recently, can be supplemented with  telemonitoring.  The telemonitoring field is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_499712], but studies to date have produced mixed results in reduction of readmissions, 
symptom management, and mortality for patients with HF.4-6 Irrespective of the type of monitoring 
system and whether implantable hemodynamic monitors are employed , outcomes were inconsistent .7;[ADDRESS_938970] not consistently allowed for assessment of health status and symptoms. The 
SPAN -HF trial failed to show any additional improvements to health status by [CONTACT_692231] a nurse -driven system.9;10 
     The purpose of this study was to examine short -term (60 -day) health -related quality of life and 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692197]-GE Care Innovations™ Guide (formerly  the 
Intel® Health Guide) deployed with American Heart Association g uideline -based HF  protocols for 
assessment of clinical status  and symptoms  and delivery of relevant patient education to enhance 
home -bound patients’ and caregivers’ understanding of and m anagement of HF .   
METHODS    
     This was a single center, unblinded, non- randomized feasibility study of telemonitoring with 
embedded patient education.  The University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692205] a large 
home care agency in Northeast OH. It was chosen as the site for implementing the study and was 
the source of referrals  and enrollment . This nurse -driven program was available to CMS 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_692206].  The study 
was approve d by [CONTACT_692232][INVESTIGATOR_692207] , Cleveland OH .  The trial was registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov   Protocol ID 
#AHA100602.  
5 
 
     All nurses from the home program had been trained in HF  by [CONTACT_692233] (N -HeFT ™) (www.NHeFT.org ).11  At the study initiation, a re fresher course on symptoms, 
signs and medical th erapy of HF  was administered.   Patients were consented following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692208] a HF  diagnosis and were home bound, thus they qualified for the home care nursing program. The 
Care Innovations Guide (Guide)  was delivered to patient homes with Ameri can Heart Association 
(AHA) HF  patient education content on many topi[INVESTIGATOR_692209]. Based on the patient’s health 
status, AHA- recommended HF  protocols were deployed to the Guide  for patients to assess key vital 
signs , health questions and provi de related educational content on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis for 60 
days. Patients and caregivers were trained in use of the Guide  and related peripherals (that included blood 
pressure monitors, weight scales, glucose monitors (for diabetics), and p ulse oximeters), response to 
scheduled sessions, and access of educational content and assessing vital signs independent of scheduled 
sessions.  Patient s and caregiver s could access the health education component and perform additional 
vitals assessments at any time.  
     Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of NYHA Class II -IV heart failure and had been 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692210] [ADDRESS_938971] to the Guide.  Patients who had a life expectance of < 6 months or 
were living in an extended care facility were not eligible.  
     Utility  was defined as days o f activity and interaction of the patient with the monitor / days of actual 
monitoring possible.  Adherence  was defined as the percent of actual completed sessions from the number 
of scheduled sessions offered .  Re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692211]. Health status was assessed by [CONTACT_692234] (KCCQ) pre and post monitoring periods. 12 Baseline medications were recorded;  however, 
medications were adjusted by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care provider as needed during the study period. Post

Guide  monitoring, patients and clinicians completed surveys on satisfaction with the use of the 
Guide with the embedded AHA HF protocols and educational content. 
The Intel-GE Care Innovations™ Guide  PHS6000 was used in this study  (See Figure 1 ).  It 
allows health care providers to remotely access vital sign measurements of patients at home. The 
Guide collects measurements captured on commercial ly available wireless or tethered medical 
devices designed for home use, stores and displays the collected information on the LCD screen, 
and transmits the information to a secure host server. Health care providers we re able review the 
transmitted information and select education and reminders to send to patients using software 
interface.  Patients we re also able to review the ir stored vital sign measurement information and review 
educational and motivational content deployed to the unit separate from their scheduled sessions.  
Analysis :  
     Percentages, means ± SD are presented.  A paired Student’s t -test was used to compare the KCCQ 
score at baseline and 60 days. We compared the change in KCCQ Clinical and Overall scores to 
compliance (completing scheduled sessions) and utility (days with activity per monitored days) using 
ANOVA and generalized estimating equations (GEE).  Medians (distributions) of compliance and utility 
were compared across rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692212]. Util ity scores were 
calculated using the days of recorded activity compared to the actual days of monitoring, i.e, how well 
and often the patients or caregivers used the system. Rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692213] -limit survival tables and te sted using log- rank test. SAS (SAS Institute, Inc.) version 9.1 was 
used.

RESULTS    
     Twenty six patients were consented and enrolled  within a 6- month period. All had been discharged 
home after a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a primary diagnosis of decompensat ed HF .  For 15% of the patients, the 
admission was for new onset HF .  Demographics are shown on Table 1.  Patients were older , and the 
majority  were women and had non- ischemic HF .  More than half of patients had HF with preserved 
ejection fraction (HF -PEF) and 80.8% had a history of hypertension.  At baseline, 62% were considered 
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II in the home care nurse’s assessment.  The mean  
left ventricular diastolic diameter ( LVIDD) was 4.85 + 1.27 cm and therefore, not dilated.  Although the 
mean blood pressure was 125 mmHg ± 22 mm Hg, the RVSP mean, 52 mm Hg ±  [ADDRESS_938972] patients were 
on loop diuretics, and only 7 (26.9%) received an aldosterone antagonist.  None of the patients were 
receiving angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and only 10 were on angiotensin converting enzyme 
(ACE) inhibitors. Of the 9 patients with EF ≤ 40%, only 6 we re prescribed an ACE inhibitor and none 
were prescribed an ARB.  There was no documentation of the reasons for not being on guideline 
recommended vasodilator therapy. Beta blocker therapy was prescribed with similar frequency as diuretic 
therapy. Baseline laboratory values are also depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] 1.  Renal function was relatively well 
preserved; however, the majority of patients were anemic.    
Health -Related Quality of Life  
     The KCCQ scores at baseline and 60 days are shown in Table 2.  KCCQ Clinical Summary score 
significantly improved ( p=0.039) and the Overall Summary score trended toward improvement ( p=0.077; 
Figure 1).  Patients scored high on the self -efficacy domain (1 -item) at baseline and approached a perfect 
standardized score of 100 at 60 days. Utility  scores were high, with a mean of 86.4% ±5.61 
(median=88.8) .  Mean patient adherence was also high at 73.4% ±31.7 (median=89.4)  (Figure 2).

 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692214] (50%) were rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_112167] 60- day follow -up period , four for HF  and nine  
for other reasons . Therefore, at 30 days , the all-cause and HF  rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692198] 23% and 15%, 
respectively. Mean days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692215] -up was 16 ± 5 days . Using generalized estimating 
equations, greater utility but not adherence scores were correlated with improvements in health status by 
[CONTACT_692235] ( p=0.013) and Overall Summary score ( p=0.0056). Less patient utili ty 
and adherence were associated with rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Median adherence and utility for those not 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (97.2% and 96.9%, respectively) were greater than for those rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (67.4% and 
82.2%: p=0.013, p =0.006, respectively; Figure 3).  
 DIS CUSSION  
     This pi[INVESTIGATOR_692216] . Health status, as shown by 
[CONTACT_692236][INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, all -cause 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692217] 20%, similar to those in the state of Ohio. 1  It is notable that only 6 
out of 10 patients with EF  <40% were prescribed ACE inhibitors in spi[INVESTIGATOR_692218].  This finding further reinforces the existing gap between Guidelines and clinical care.  
Nurses, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_692219], could not change medications without a physician’s order.  
     Clinical and overall health status measures were f ound to improve over the course of the study. 
Further, patients who had greater improvement in health- related quality of life were more likely to utilize 
the Guide  monitoring system. In addition, there was a statistically significant association noted betw een 
utility, adherence, and rate of rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  The findings of this study, although based on a small 
number of patients and requiring testing in prospective randomized controlled studies, highlights the 
potential for home monitoring with AHA guide line-based HF protocols and educational content to impact 
HF disease burden, progression and health care expenditures.  
[ADDRESS_938973] suggested that 
telemonitoring in ambulatory HF  patients can improve mortality by 17 to 47% during six to twelve 
months of follow -up, with similarly significant reductions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692220] m 7 to 48%. 8 
However, two recent multicenter randomized controlled trials failed to de monstrated benefit with 
telemonitoring for HF .  In Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes (TELE -HF), a telephone -
based interactive voice- response system that obtained symptom and weight information provided no 
significant benefit over usual care in all -cause rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_692221]. 4 Similarly, Telemedical 
Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure Study (TIM -HF) did not demonstrate a significant impact of 
remote monitoring by [CONTACT_692237] [INVESTIGATOR_692222].13 
 These studies highlight the complexity of home monitoring interventions. TELE -HF relied on 
patient -initiated communication: patients had to use a toll -free telephone system in which an automated 
voice then asked a series of questions to which patients had to respond by [CONTACT_692238]. Fourteen percent of 
patients assigned to the telemonitoring arm never used the automated call -in system, and only 55% were 
still regularly using the system by [CONTACT_484017]. Loss of adherence in the intervention arm 
highlights the need to make an intervention palatable to patients. Furthermore , nurses in TELE- HF were 
not empowered to change the medication regimen without physician consultation, adding a layer of 
communication or collaboration and delay. Home management of HF  ideally involves multiple 
components, of which monitoring is only one .  There needs to be timely transmission of data, receipt of 
the information by [CONTACT_692239], a feedback loop 
10 
 
to the patient and/or caregiver with directions, and sufficient patient and caregiver empowerment t o 
understand and implement the instructions. Monitoring alone may not have been sufficient to produce 
desired outcomes. Also, although telemonitoring promises to reduce the need for in- person follow -up, it 
may actually increase the workload involved. In the TELE -HF study, while there were only 25 patients 
per site on average, there were 884 incidents per site requiring responses. Managing the volume of 
information transmitted through a telehealth system increases the need for mid -level personnel with 
adequa te HF  training, expertise and licensure to provide HF  treatment independently of or in 
collaboration with the patient’s physician. Patient adherence to scheduled Guide  system sessions in our 
study was high, although the observation time was short .  It is possible that in our study, the addition 
of patient education embedded into the Guide , and accessed during and outside of scheduled 
sessions, encouraged better adherence and improved self management.  
     Patient education is essential in the management of HF and is strongly encouraged in 
Guidelines.  Accurate information and buy -in from patients and their caregivers can often 
prevent decompensation and even hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 14;[ADDRESS_938974] adequate breadth and depth and use both  words and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_692223].   The value of patient education in optimizing self -management has not 
been consistently assessed; further research is needed.  
Limitations  
Limitations of this study included that , due to available funding, the s tudy was limited to a very small 
patient sample size (25) from a single center enrollment in Northeast Ohio  with a short monitoring period 
(60 days). An additional limitation to the outcomes analysis was that the study did not have a control 
group for comparative purposes and was non-randomized.  Finally, the patients and/or caregivers were 
capable of self -selecting to choose to view or ignore the educational content that was provided within the  
protocols. Home care nurses, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_692224].  It is not known whether medication adjustments by [CONTACT_692240][INVESTIGATOR_602].  
Conclusions : This observational study showed the feasibility of adding AHA Heart Failure 
guideline -based  protocols and educational content within the Care Innovations Guide . As 
expected, this home -bound population of patients with HF were older and primarily women. In 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_692225], health care providers did not prescribe ACEI or ARB therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692226], although many patients had HF -PEF. Health -related quality of life, as shown by 
[CONTACT_692236][INVESTIGATOR_059]; however, all -
cause hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692227].  Clinical and overall health status measures 
improved during the study, and were a ssociated with greater patient utilization of the Guide .  In addition, 
there was a statistically significant association noted between compliance, utility, and rate of 
[ADDRESS_938975] the ability of trained, HF  mid-level provider nurses (licensed 
independent practitioners) to adjust medications and apply other management decisions based on 
recommended evidence- based national or local  guidelines or protocols.

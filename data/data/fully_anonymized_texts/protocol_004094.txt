Version: 3.[ADDRESS_619556] of Promogran Prisma™ on pain of split -thickness skin graft donor sites 
compared to standard of care alone – a pi[INVESTIGATOR_482245]: control and treatment. The control 
group will received standard of care (SOC) dressings at the split thickness skin graft 
(STSG) donor site and the treatment group will receive Promogran in direct contact [CONTACT_482256]. SOC at NYU Winthrop Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480304], but 
is not limited to, xeroform or semi -occlusive adhesive dressings. The primary outcome 
is to assess the feasibility of evaluati
ngPromogran in addition to SOC for the 
management of donor -site pain following STSG. The only difference between the two 
groups is the addition of Prisma in direct contact [CONTACT_482257].  
Objectives   The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of evaluating the use of 
a composite collagen, silver -oxidized regenerated cellulose matrix compared to the 
standard of care dressing on donor site pain for patients undergoing split -thicknes s skin 
grafting in preparation for a larger study.  
Methodology   This is a prospective, randomized, open -label, single -center feasibility study.  
Endpoint   The primary endpoint of this feasibility study is to evaluate if using Promogran in 
addition to SOC  is associated with a clinically meaningful difference in pain score (≥2 
points on the visual analog pain scale) between the treatment and control arms on 
postoperative day (POD) 1.  
Study Duration   Two years  
Participant Duration   Six weeks  
Duration  of  
administration  IP  One application  
Population   Twenty patients; 10 in the intervention group and 10 in the control group. All genders, 
≥18 years old, all demographics and geographic locations; scheduled to undergo STSG.  
Study Sites   Single site: NYU Winthrop Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482246]  20 participants  
Study compensation  $70. Two payments of $35 will be given to participants – one at enrollment and one at 
collection of the 10 -day pain diary.  
Description  of 
 Study 
Agent/Procedure  Promogran Prisma™ is a composite collagen -silver -oxidized regenerated cellulose 
dressing that is a sheet applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_482247].  
Reference Therapy  The control group will receive a standard of care dressing on the STSG donor site (i.e., 
non-adherent dressing)  
Key Procedures  Placement of either Prisma or standard of care dressing on the STSG donor site. Record 
daily pain score of the donor site for [ADDRESS_619557] -grafting. Return to clinic for weekly 
follow -up visits for 6 weeks.  
Study number: s19-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 2 
Version: 3.2  
Statistic al Analysis  Proposed sample size (10 patients in each arm, a total of N=20) is obtained from a 
recruitment and cost feasibility point of view. For the primary endpoint, the pain score 
at POD 1 will be compared between treatment groups using Wilcoxon rank -sum 
(Mann -Whitney) test. The secondary endpoint, time from randomization to donor site 
healing, will be compared between treatment groups using time to event approach via 
Kaplan -Meier method.  
SCHEMATIC OF STUDY DESIGN  
Total 20: Obtain informed consent. Screen potential subjects by [CONTACT_482258]. Perform physical examination and review medical, surgical, and medication  
Phase histories. Perform a urine pregnancy test for females of reproductive potential. Collect  
(Day -7 – 0) demographic data including: date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity and tobacco use.

2 INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Study number: s19-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 4 
Version: 3.2  
2.1 Background Information and Relevant Literature  
Split -thickness skin grafting (STSG) is the mainstay of therapy for the management of wounds that 
cannot be closed primarily or left open to close by [CONTACT_129108]. However, the wounds created 
by [CONTACT_482259] e often a source of pain and morbidity to patients. Multiple studies have compared various 
donor site dressings in attempt to decrease pain and morbidity1–4. This study will look specifically at 
the effect on patient -reported donor site by [CONTACT_472539] a collagen dressing. The addition of a composite 
collagen -silver -oxidized regenerated cellulose dressing (Promogran Prisma™) which has been cleared 
by [CONTACT_1622](510k) in direct contact [CONTACT_482260]. 
2.2 Pote ntial Risks & Benefits  
Risks involved with the procedures (i.e. surgical procurement of the STSG, use of advanced wound 
care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_482249]) are similar to risks in 
the standard treatment of wounds of t his nature (i.e. infection; allergic reaction; excessive redness, pain, 
swelling, or blistering). Procurement of the STSG will be performed under sterile conditions in the operating room under monitored supervision and adequate pain control by a trained anesthetist. There 
is no difference between the treatment and control groups in the way that the STSG is obtained. 
Standard risks associated with anesthesia will be explained to the patient in detail prior to the operation. Skin grafting can cause localized pain with associated local bleeding that will be controlled in the 
operating room.  
Benefits include decreased pain at the STSG donor site, decreased time to heal, and decreased 
occurrence of adverse events (e.g. wound infection). Even in the event that no  improvement is made to 
donor site pain or wound healing, information gained from the study will be used to help understanding 
and improve future treatment options for people undergoing STSG.

4 STUDY DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS 
4.1 Study Description 
This is a prospective, randomized, single -center feasibility study. Twenty patients will be randomized 
into two groups: control and treatment. The control group will recei ve standard of care (SOC) dressings 
at the STSG donor site and the treatment group will receive Promogran in direct contact [CONTACT_482256]. SOC at NYU Winthrop includes, but is not limited to, xeroform or 
semiocclusive adhesive dressings. Thrombin spray may be used for hemostasis. Patients are routinely 
followed in the outpatient wound clinic until wound healing occurs. Healing is defined as complete 
donor site epi[INVESTIGATOR_356893].  
4.[ADDRESS_619565] a clinically 
meaningful difference in pain score (≥2 points on the pain scale) between the treatment and control 
arms on postoperative day (POD) 1.  
Secondary aims include: 
1. Describe and compare the percent of patients healed between treatment groups  
2. Describe and compare weekly surface area between treatment groups  
3. Compare time  to complete donor site healing between treatment groups 
Study number: s19-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 5 
Version: 3.2  
4. Describe and compare adverse events between groups  
5. Describe and compare decreased use of narcotics and other pain medications between groups  
6. Describe and compare percent of granulation tissue at the donor site between treatment groups. 
Granulation will be reported in quartiles (0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, and 76-100%). 
5 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL  
Participants will be recruited from the NYU Winthrop Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482250], inpatient service, 
and other outpatient surgical services. Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_482261] -investigators 
of the study.  
5.1 Randomization: 
Randomization will be performed 1:[ADDRESS_619566] will be given to the study coordinator. Each block of 2 or 4 subjects will contain an 
equal number of the two groups: 1) SOC, 2) Promogran+SOC. SAS PROC PLAN will be used to 
generate this list.  
5.2 Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Patient ≥18 years of age  
2. Male or female  
3. Patient schedul ed to undergo STSG for any reason  
4. Patientis able to provide informed consent and has read and signed the IRB -approved informed 
consent form. 
5.3 Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Active infection or history of radiation to the donor site 
2. Patient has a known sensitivity to Promogran Prisma™ or silver 
3. Elevated INR >3.0 
4. Insensate at the donor site  
5. Chronic narcotic use (>6 months of daily use) 
6. Patient is currently pregnant and/or breastfeeding  
The target number of enrolled patients will be 20, with [ADDRESS_619567] six weeks. After consent and enrollment, patients in both the control and treatment 
groups will undergo STSG as scheduled. Promogran will be available in the operating room and applied 
by [CONTACT_67361] (study or non- study surgeon) directly to the donor site of patients randomized 
to the treatment group. Patients in the control group will receive SOC dressings per the attending surgeon’s clinical judgment. SOC dressings include a primary non -adherent dressi ng, a secondary 
gauze and transparent film or tape. The only difference between the two groups is the addition of Prisma 
in direct contact [CONTACT_482262]. 
Pain will be patient -reported using the v isual analogue/Wong- Baker pain rating scale (VAS), which is 
reported on a scale from 0- 10. Pain will be measured once at each of the following 12 time points: 
preoperatively, post -operatively (POD 1), and each subsequent postoperative day for ten days. Aft er 
day 10, pain will be recorded by [CONTACT_482263], until week six.  
Patients will be followed daily while inpatient and weekly while outpatient for six weeks. The number 
of study visits will be between [ADDRESS_619568] u d y n u m ber: s 1 9- 0 0 4 3 7   Pa ge 6

• Unexplained fever or chills  
• Death  
• Neurologic symptoms such as light headedness, headache  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea and vomiting 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Deat h 
• A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Impo rtant medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
in this definition.  
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any lifethreatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the following categories:  
• Mild: Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe: Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or 
incapacitating.  
7.3 Relationship to Study Agent 
For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s 
causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categories belo w.  
• Definitely Related: The relationship of the AE and the study device or the study procedure can 
definitely be established. 
• Probably Related: While a clear relationship to the study device or to the study procedure cannot be established, the AE is associ ated with an expected AE or there is no other medical 
condition or intervention, which could explain the occurrence of such an event. 
• Possibly Related: There is no clear relationship between the AE and the study device or study procedure; however, one cannot definitely conclude that there is no relationship. 
• Unrelated Related: There is no relationship between the AE and the study device or study procedure.  This may include but is not limited to the incident being an expected outcome of a

experienced.  
7.4 Expectedness 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_118631]. An AE will be 
considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study agent.  
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for med ical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All 
AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s 
assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring 
while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed 
to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deter iorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study. 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the 
event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46183] 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. 
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurrin g at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study.  
7.5 Unanticipated Problem Reporting 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of an UP 
report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the DCC/study 
sponsor. The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome; 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been  taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP.  
Study number: s19-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 9 
Version: 3.2  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline: 
• UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within 5 business 
days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor within 5 business days 
of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP 
within<insert timeline in accordance with policy> of the IR’s receipt of the report of the 
problem from the investigator. 
7.6 Reporting Procedure s – Notifying the Study Sponsor 
The study clinician will complete a SAE Form within the following timelines:  
• All deaths and immediately life -threatening events, whether related or unrelated, will be 
recorded on the SAE Form and submitted to the DCC/study sponsor within [ADDRESS_619571] information.  
• Other SAEs regardless of relationship will be submitted to the DCC/study sponsor within 72 
hours of site awareness.  
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory res olution or until the site investigator deems the event 
to be chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_15791]/study sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible.  
As a follow -up to the initial report, within the following [ADDRESS_619572] of 
the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP), and with applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
Data safety monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_162296].  Events that will be monitored 
are infection at donor site, increasing pain at donor site, and allergic reaction to dressing.  Monitoring will 
occur on a weekly basis once patients are enrolled.  There are no predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_482251].  
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION  
9.1Sample Size  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_482252]. As a result, no formal 
power computation was carried out. Proposed sample size (10 patients in each arm, a total of N=20) is obtained from a recruitment and cost feasibility point of view. The main aim of the study is to determine 
feasibility of the intervention, recruitment, randomization, retention a priori to a large full scale 
randomized clinical trial. No inferential decision will be made based on p -values; however the direction 
and size of the effect of the intervention on the outcomes observed will be critical for designing future 
randomized controlled trial where efficacy of the intervention will be determined.  
9.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study number: s19-[ZIP_CODE]   Page 10 
Version: 3.2  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean (standard deviation), median 
(Interquartile Range) based on the distribution of the continuous variables. Categorical variables will 
be presented as count (percentage).  
9.3 Primary endpoint 
Reducing pain at POD 1 was thought to be clinically important. Hence, the pain score at POD 1 will be 
compared between treatment groups using Wilcoxon rank- sum (Mann -Whitney) test. For demographic 
and other clinical covariates, we will test whether baseline characteristics are we ll balanced between 
two groups. If a baseline variable is not balanced or correlated with outcome (r>0.30), we will develop an ANCOVA model for POD 1 pain score and include it as a covariate in addition to baseline pain 
score and treatment groups.  
9.4 Sec ondary endpoints  
Time from randomization to donor site healing will be compared between treatment groups using time 
to event approach via Kaplan- Meier (KM) method. The log -rank test will be used to compare the KM 
curves. Adverse events will be summarized between groups using counts and percentages. Percent of patients healed, percent use of narcotics and other pain medication (ie amount of medication used) and 
percent of granulation will be compared between groups using Fisher’s exact test.  
All analyses wi ll be performed using SAS version 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute Inc.). Nominal P< 
values will be presented.  
10 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in 
a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, l aboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic n egatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x- rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, 
and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source 
documents. If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be collected on CRFs 
and what data will be collected from other sources. 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is 
left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item 
is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the 
incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO 
NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERR ORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the 
clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
Access to study records will be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator 
will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201]/EC, the sponsor, government 
regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).

11 ETHICS/PROTECTIONI OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21  CFR Part 50, 21 
CFR Part 56, and/or the ICH E6.  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials  will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must 
be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to be re -consented.  
Consent forms describing in detail the study agent, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study product. The informed consent is submitted with this protocol.  
11.1 Consent Procedures and Documentation 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be 
IRB-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will 
explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and 
potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the 
opportunity to carefully review the  written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The 
participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior 
to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document pr ior to any 
procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the 
participants for their records. The right s and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_341455].  
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be stored in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be thoroughly documented 
in the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard consent process (e.g. use of a translator, consent fr om a legally authorized representative, consent document presented orally, etc.) and the 
justification for such alteration will likewise be documented.  
11.[ADDRESS_619573] of 1996 (HIPAA). Study photos will be kept confidential by [CONTACT_482264] (e.g. patient face, tattoo). De -identifies photos will 
be kept on the secure NYU Winthrop hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482253].  
Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For

period. 
[ADDRESS_619575] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_482254]. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, le gible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58625] (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from sour ce 
documents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained and captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record. 
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications , and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into a local database kept and maintained at NYU Winthrop Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482255]. Access to the data system includes password protection and internal quality 
check s, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
12.1 Study Records Retention  
Study documents will be retained for the longer of 3 yea rs after close -out, 5 years after final 
reporting/publication, or [ADDRESS_619576] approval of a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated or 2 years after the investigation is discontinued 
and FDA is notified if no application is to be filed or if the application has not been approved for such 
indication. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is 
the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
12.2 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Manual of Procedures 
(MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, 
or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 • 5.1 Quality 
Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. 
It is the responsibility of the site PI/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identify and record 
deviations within 2 working days of identification of the protocol deviation, or within 2 working days 
of the scheduled protocol -required activity.

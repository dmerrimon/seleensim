I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885288] -occur, with over 60% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
dependent individuals meeting criteria for a lifetime anxiety disorder (Conway et al., 2006). 
Individuals with anxiety disorders are more likely to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Sareen et al., 2006) and have 
higher incident risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (Martins et al., 2009). Anxiety symptoms often 
precede opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (Ouimette et al., 2010), with anxiety reduc tion among the most commonly 
reported motives for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (Rigg et al., 2010). The co -occurrence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885289] (Carpentier et al., 2009) as well as poor 
treatment retention (Lejuez et  al., 2008) and worse drug use and anxiety outcomes (e.g., 
Compton et al., 2003; Lavie et al., 2009). However, there has been a paucity of research on 
treatment for co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885290].  Clinical trials testing 
behavioral tr eatments for anxiety disorders have consistently excluded participants with 
substance dependence (e.g., Barlow et al., 2000), and there are no published large -scale 
pharmacotherapy trials for this population. Few studies have examined integrated behavioral  
treatments for co -occurring substance dependence and anxiety disorders, with most focused 
specifically on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Hien et al., 2009; Mills et al., 2012), and 
one study of obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD; Fals -Stewart et al. , 1992). For other anxiety 
disorders, which are present in 60% of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent individuals and are the focus of the 
current application, published research has focused on alcohol dependence (Hesse, 2009), with 
no published studies to date for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885291]. Thus, research on optimal treatment 
approaches is needed to improve outcomes for this population.  
 
In recent years, treatment research in the anxiety disorders has begun to shift from a disorder -
specific approach (e.g., treating panic disorder on e way and social phobia another way) to a 
transdiagnostic approach that can be applied to any of the anxiety disorders or their combination 
(McHugh et al., 2009). Several lines of evidence have supported this development, including: (1) 
the recognition tha t efficacious behavioral treatments for individual anxiety disorders are highly 
similar (Chorpi[INVESTIGATOR_400189]., 2009); (2) the high lifetime co -occurrence of anxiety disorders with each 
other (>75%; Brown et al., 2001); (3) symptom and pathophysiological overlap  among anxiety 
disorders (Brown et al., 1998; Etkin et al., 2007); and, (4) the improvement of co -occurring 
anxiety disorders when treating the principal anxiety disorder (Craske et al., 2007). Studies have 
    2 supported the efficacy of transdiagnostic treatme nts for anxiety disorders (e.g., Craske et al., 
2011; Wilamowska et al., 2010).  
 
In attempting to address the treatment needs of populations with co -occurring substance 
dependence and other psychiatric disorders, one approach has been to integrate disorder -specific 
behavioral treatments based on similar disorder features and overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_885292], 
treating co -occurring disorders as if they were a "single disorder" (Weiss et al., 2011). Such 
integrated behavioral treatments have demonstrated evidenc e of superior outcomes for both 
disorders (e.g., Lydecker e t al., 2010; Mueser et al., 2013 ; Weiss et al., 2009). Using this model 
to integrate transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety disorders with behavioral therapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885293] i ncrease the efficiency of treatment and to improve outcomes for 
both disorders. Specifically, anxiety disorders and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]: (1) share a number of 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_885294], such as elevated  distress intolerance (McHugh et al., 2011); (2) are treated 
using similar core elements (e.g., functional analysis, skills for copi[INVESTIGATOR_885295] - or craving -
driven urges); and, (3) are characterized by [CONTACT_885337] (e.g., the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885296]; Rigg et al., 2010). The integration of behav ioral treatments for anxiety disorders 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_885297]. For 
example, stress reactivity (the emotional and physiological response to a stressor) is implicated 
as a risk factor for the deve lopment of anxiety disorders (McLaughlin et al., 2010) and substance 
dependence (Koob, 2009), and elevated stress reactivity is associated with worse treatment 
outcome for both disorder types (e.g., Abelson et al., 1996; Sinha et al., 2006). Thus, 
understa nding this shared vulnerability may be critical to the treatment of co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885298]. Studies indicate that elevated stress reactivity predicts poorer 
treatment response in substance -dependent patients (Sinha et al., 200 6, 2011); however, this has 
yet to be examined in those with co -occurring anxiety disorders. Given the potential link 
between stress reactivity and outcome for both disorders independently, examination of whether 
a treatment for their co -occurrence reduces  stress reactivity may provide insight into a 
mechanism of treatment change.  
 
This study seeks to extend and adapt transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety disorders into a novel 
integrated cognitive behavioral treatment ( ICBT) for co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885299]. Given the absence of treatment research in this population, this study has the 
potential to advance the field by [CONTACT_885338] a standard versus a 
novel behavioral treatment approach. From a public hea lth perspective, the development of 
treatments that target multiple disorders has the potential to enhance efforts to increase access to 
evidence -based treatments by [CONTACT_885339] (McHug h et al., 2009). An integrated treatment extending this transdiagnostic 
approach to include both anxiety disorders and co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885300], even if more than one anxiety disorder or substance dependence diagnosis is  
present.  
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent individuals and confer risk for poor 
response to treatment. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885301] a number of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_885302]. For example, anxiety is among the most commonly reported motives for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], 
and both disorders are characterized by [CONTACT_885340] (distress 
intole rance). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_885303], little is known about treating these co -occurring conditions. 
    [ADDRESS_1238606] an integrated cognitive 
behavioral treatment for co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885304] d anxiety disorders.  
 
Specific Aim 1.  To examine the feasibility and acceptability of an integrated cognitive 
behavioral treatment manual for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885290] (ICBT). We 
hypothesize that ICBT will be a feasible and acceptable treatm ent as assessed by [CONTACT_885341] -report of treatment satisfaction.  
 
Specific Aim 2.  To examine the efficacy of ICBT for the improvement of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885305] (IDC) . We hypothesize that 
patients will report greater pre-post reductions in interviewer -rated anxiety symptoms and 
less opi[INVESTIGATOR_885306].  
 
Specific Aim 3 . To examine the association between stress reactivity and  treatment outcome 
in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent patients. We hypothesize that: (a) higher levels of stress reactivity at 
baseline will be associated with more days of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885307] , and (b) 
reductions in stress reactivity from baseline to post -treatment will be greater in the ICBT 
group relative to the IDC group .  
 
Specific Aim 4. To examine the association between ovarian sex hormones, negative 
reinforcement bias, and treatment outcome in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -dependent patients. We hypothesize 
that: (a) greater negative reinforcement bias will be associated with poor treatment outcomes, 
and that this association will be stronger in  women than men , and (b ) within women, high 
progesterone will be associated with lower negative reinforcement bias and less severe opi [INVESTIGATOR_114174] (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_2506], anxiety severity).  
 
III. SUBJECT SELECTION  
Participants will be recruited for a randomized control led trial of the efficacy,  feasibility , and 
acceptability  of ICBT. We aim to enroll 54 participants in this trial, and ant icipate that up to 110 
participants will need to complete informed consent and screening in order to initiate treatment. 
Participants will be recruited via either: (1) invitation to participate by a member of the study 
staff, or (2) self -selection in respo nse to posted advertisements.  
 
III.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects will be included  if they: (1) are age 18 or older, (2) meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] , (3) are currently receiving pharmacotherapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (e. g., 
buprenorphine , buprenorphine -naloxone , naltrexone, Vivitrol), (4) have used opi[INVESTIGATOR_885308] 90 days, (5) exhibit clinically -significant anxiety defined as a score of 14 or 
higher on a clinician -rated anxiety symptom severity scale  (the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), 
(6) meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for a current diagnosis of an anxiety disorder , (7) are able to 
read and provide informed consent, and ( 8) intend to remain in the geographical area for the 
duration of the study peri od.    
 
Subjects will be excluded if they: (1) meet criteria for a current substance use or psychiatric 
disorder requiring a level of care higher than outpatient, (2) are currently receiving cognitive 
behavioral therapy, (3) report recent initiation of a p sychiatric medication indicated for anxiety 
(defined as less than 4 weeks on a stable dose ; not including PRN medications for sleep ), (4) are 
    4 receiving and taking an as -needed (PRN ) prescription for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] ( taking a stable, 
prescribed dose or misu sing/abusing a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_885309] ), (5) exhibit 
presence of a psychiatric or medical condition that would interfere with participation or that 
requires additional care (e.g., psychosis, acute suicidality) , or (6) were admitted to McL ean 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885310] .  
 
III.2. Source of Participants and Recruitment Methods  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will supervise the identification and recruitment of subjects. 
Subjects will be recruited fro m patients who are being treated at McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Alcohol and 
Drug Abuse Treatment Program (ADATP) continuum of inpatient, residential, partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or 
outpatient programs; subjects must be deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_885311]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_50366] a patient is appropriate for an outpatient 
level of care based on either: (1) consultation with the treating clinician, or (2) referring to the 
patient’s level of care based on the current treatment p lan with their primary treatment provider. 
Although some subjects will initially be recruited from inpatient or residential settings, they will 
begin the study treatment only after discharge to outpatient status. In order to identify potential 
participants  on the inpatient detoxification unit, the research assistant will check Epic for patients 
currently on the unit that meet eligibility criteria. The research assistant will then check with the 
patient’s case manager, or other staff member on the inpatient unit, to confirm eligibility and 
introduce the patient to the research assistant. To recruit from outpatient , partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , and 
residential  programs, t he study research assistant will check with clinical staff as well as the 
electronic medical record  daily for potentially eligible subjects, who will be approached by [CONTACT_885342]. Following initial 
identification and introduction to potential participants, regardless of level of care , the research 
assistant will meet with those who agree, and will ask if they are interested in completing a 
screening assessment. If a patient wants to participate, he or she will be invited to complete the 
Informed Consent process.   
In addition to recru iting potential subjects from the ADATP at McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we will also 
use direct notices by [CONTACT_885343] -refer into the study, such as posting Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) approved recruitment fliers where potential subjects are likely to  read them 
(e.g., McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , waiting rooms at other local area hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) and other media advertising 
on the Internet, newspaper, and local radio. Potential subjects responding to these notices and 
advertisements will contact [CONTACT_17033] b y telephone for a brief description of the study 
and to be screened for initial eligibility.   
 
Subjects will not be recruited  from among the Investigators own patients. However, because the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_885312], it i s possible that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_885313]. Under these circumstances, the study will be presented by [CONTACT_885344]’s treatment.  
 
Participants expressing interest in the study will be p rovided with additional information by a 
member of the study staff and will be offered the opportunity to ask questions. An initial 
screening will be conducted to provide an initial determination of study eligibility (see attached 
Screening Form). Particip ants who appear to be eligible at this stage and who express interest in 
participating will be scheduled for an informed consent meeting with a member of  the study 
staff.  
 
    [ADDRESS_1238607] ENROLLMENT   
Potentially eligible subjects will be asked to complete th e Informed Consent process, at which 
point the subjects will read through the IRB -approved consent form, and will meet with a 
research staff member who will  answer any questions, explain the schedule of study procedures, 
and review the risks and benefits o f the study. Subjects will be informed about the experimental 
nature, purpose, risks, and benefits of the study in accordance with procedures of the Partners 
IRB. There will be no time -limit placed on the consenting process. Research staff members 
understa nd that the consent is a process and not simply a matter of signing and dating the consent 
form.  Either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_311105] -Investigators (serving as designees of the PI) will be 
available to help explain the study and answer questions. Once the subje ct consents to participate 
in the study, the subject will sign and date the consent form along with a member of the research 
staff.  The subject will be provided with a copy of the consent form and the original will be 
stored in a secure location by a memb er of the study staff .  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either ICBT or IDC. This randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_66436]: (1) presence of a medication for anxiety, (2) gender, (3) 
type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (agonist/pa rtial agonist vs. antagonist), and (4) severity (defined by 
[CONTACT_139785]. absence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885314]).  
 
V. STUDY PROCEDURES  
All participants will receive [ADDRESS_1238608]. This baseline visit will begin with the administration of the Anxiety Disorders Interview 
Schedule for DSM -5 and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale to evaluate diagnostic  and clinical  
inclusi on/exclusion criteria. Any participants deemed ineligible at this time will be compensated 
$10 for their time and effort and will be discontinued.  
 
Participants who are eligible will then complete the remainder of the baseline assessment. This 
will includ e a battery of self -report and interviewer -administered measures (see below), and a 
urine drug screen.  
 
V.2. Study Treatment  
Participants will then schedule the first treatment session with the study clinician. All 
participants in this open pi[INVESTIGATOR_885315], both consisting of weekly, 
individual, 45 -60 minute psychotherapy sessions. At each study session, participants will be 
asked to provide a urine drug screen and will complete weekly self -report measures (see below). 
ICBT  treatment w ill target behaviors and cognitive patterns that are purported to maintain 
anxiety and harmful substance behaviors, with a focus on common maintaining processes across 
    [ADDRESS_1238609]. McHugh in the provision of trea tment. All treatment sessions 
will be audiotaped (see Audiotape Informed Consent Form) and a selection of these will be 
evaluated for fidelity .  
 
V.3. Retention  and Compensation  
The following procedures will be implemented to maximize study retention: (1) collection of 
locator information (see attached Locator Form), including multiple methods of contact [CONTACT_885345] (e.g., phone, email, text messaging) and at least one person who will be able to reach 
the participant if study staff are unable to; (2 ) use of mailed reminder postcards for appointments, 
bi-weekly check -in calls during the follow -up period, and mailed thank you notes for completed 
assessments; (3) use of text messaging to make contact [CONTACT_742872]; 
and, (4) prov ision of reimbursement for completion of study assessments (see below). These 
procedures are consistent with those of other longitudinal clinical trials to maximize retention 
(Zweben, Fucito, & O’Malley, 2009), including trials conducted within the ADATP ( e.g., Weiss 
et al., 2009). Participants will be informed of these procedures in the consent form, including the 
nature of the collection of locator contacts. In the event that study staff need to contact 
[CONTACT_4317]’ locator (e.g. if a participant’s phone  number changes), study staff will not disclose 
any information about the nature of the research study or the participant's health. If participants 
indicate that they are comfortable communicating via text (see attached Screening Form and 
Locator Form), st udy staff will not reference the nature of the study or clinical information, and 
will only use text messaging as a scheduling tool for participants for whom contact [CONTACT_885346] , or for those who indicate that texting is their preferre d method of contact . In 
order to maintain confidentiality, all text messages to participants will be sent through email. 
These  strategies have yielded exceptional data completion in previous studies of integrated 
behavioral therapy conducted in the ADATP ( e.g., > 95% main outcomes completion; Weiss et 
al., 2009).  
 
In line with the recent Partners system -wide policy update, “Procedure: Requests to Receive 
Unencrypted Email” (original approval date 7/18/2017), study staff will follow 
procedures/proper docume ntation regarding sending encrypted and/or unencrypted emails to 
participants to protect PHI. The study staff will use the following research template as provided 
by [CONTACT_885347]/responding to unencrypted email messages , either by 
[CONTACT_885348]/ verbal approval at the time of recruitment or during the study period regarding 
preferred  method of email communication :  The Partners HealthCare standard is to send email 
securely. This requires you to initially set up and activate an acco unt with a password.  You can 
then use the password to access secure emails sent to you from Partners HealthCare.   If you 
prefer, we can send you “unencrypted” email that is not secure and could result in the 
unauthorized use or disclosure of your informati on. If you want to receive communications 
by [CONTACT_241617][INVESTIGATOR_241608], Partners HealthCare will not be held responsible. Your 
preference to receive unencrypted email will apply to emails sent to you from research staff in 
this study. If you wi sh to communicate with other research staff at Partners regarding additional 
studies, your preference will have to be documented with  each  research group.   
 
 
    7 Participants will be asked to complete research assessments at four time points, each 
approximatel y 2-2.5 hours in duration . These visits will be compensated on an escalating 
schedule  accounting for length of the session  as follows: baseline = $ 25 (stress reactivity = 
additional $20), post -treatment = $ 40 (stress reactivity = additional $30), 1-month f ollow -up = 
$40, and 3 -month follow -up = $50. Participants who are determined to be ineligible following 
the screening with be compensated $10. Participants who complete the exit interview will be 
paid $10. Research staff will work closely with the particip ants to attempt to schedule all 
research assessments in person, and will provide  flexible scheduling as needed to maximize data 
completion. However, if after repeated attempts to schedule an in -person assessment are 
unsuccessful, participants will be given  the opportunity to complete assessments by [CONTACT_648]. 
Because phone assessment will preclude collection of several data points, the compensation for 
these visits will be reduced. The compensation for phone assessments will be: post -treatment = 
$10, 1 -month fo llow-up = $10, 3 -month follow -up = $15 (the baseline assessment must be 
conducted in person for enrollment in the trial). The stress reactivity assessments are listed 
separately to allow for the collection of the primary outcome measures first, and additio nal 
compensation for completing the full baseline and post -treatment assessments (including stress 
reactivity).  
 
V.4. Measures  
A battery of interviewer -administered , behavioral, biological,  and self -report measures will be 
administered at 4 major assessme nt points: baseline, end of treatment, 1 month follow -up, and 3 
month follow -up. In addition, weekly measures will be administered at each session , including a 
slightly larger assessment battery at week 6 (mid -treatment) . Self-report questionnaires will be  
completed either by [CONTACT_885349]. Electronic completion will be done via RedCap. The 
proposed research use the RedCap Database, an encrypted, electronic database that is both 
HIPPA compliant (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)  and approved by 
[CONTACT_885350] (for addition 
information on the RedCap Database feature see http://rc.partners.org ). Epic will be used for data 
collection t o supplement participant self -report when necessary. Examples include: 1) using Epic 
to confirm a participant’s address before sending payment, or 2) confirming a participant’s 
current medications and treatment provides for the Concomitant Treatment Questi onnaire (see 
below). For schedule of assessments see Table 1. Descriptions of measures are included below.  
 
V.4.1. Self -Report and Interviewer -Administered Measures  
 
Demographics. Participants will self -report sociodemographic variables. Demographic 
quest ions were drawn from the Tier 1 Core measures of the PhenX Toolk it 
(http://www.phenxtoolkit.org , 9/2014, Ver 5.8 ), and adapted as indicated  for this particular 
study .  
Addiction Severity Index, 5th Edition (ASI -V). The ASI -V (McLellan, Kushner, Metzger, & 
Peters, 1992)  is a semi -structured interview that provides information o n functioning across 
seven life domains and is used extensively in the study of substance dependence.  The 
domains have demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha ranges from .65 -.89; Leonhard, 
Mulvey, Gastfriend, & Schwartz, 2000) .  For this study, the sections on drug and alcohol use 
will be admi nistered in order to identify level of functioning relative to substance use as an 
index of disorder severity in the SD group.  
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM -5 (ADIS -5). The ADIS -5 (Brown & Barlow, 
2014) is a semi -structured diagnostic interv iew that assesses DSM -[ADDRESS_1238610] DSM -IV categories (Brown et al., 2001). The shorter 
current diagnosis version  of the ADIS  (Mini -ADIS) will be administered at all assessments .  
Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) . The ASI (Peterson & Reiss, 1992) is a self -report instrument 
designed to assess one’s tendency to respond fearfully to anxiety -related symptoms. For each 
statement, respondents rate each item on a Likert scale ranging from very little (0) to very 
much (4). The ASI total score is computed by [CONTACT_885351] [ADDRESS_1238611] been favorable (e.g. Reiss et al., 1986) . 
An updated and validated version of the ASI will be used in this study (Taylor et al., 2007).  
Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form (BPI) . The BPI (C leeland, 1989) is a [ADDRESS_1238612] validity in 
diverse patient samples for bo th the long (e.g., Gjeilo et al., 2007; Tan et al., 2004) and short 
forms (Mendoza et al., 2006). This measure will be used to examine pain and pain 
interference .  The BPI [INVESTIGATOR_885316], post-treatment , and 3 -month follow -
up.    
Client S atisfaction Questionnaire  (CSQ) . The CSQ ( Larsen et al., 1979 ), an [ADDRESS_1238613] -treatment.   
Concomitant  Treatment Questionnaire (CTQ) . Participants will be asked to report on any 
curren t treatment in addition to the study treatment for substance use or psychiatric problem s.  
Credibility and Expectancy Scale (CES).  The CES ( Borkovec & Nau, 1972 ) is a measure of the 
degree to which participants anticipate a therapy will be helpful for thei r symptoms and the 
degree to which it is credible. This measure will be administered at sessions 3 and 7 as a 
measure of feasibility.  
Distress Intolerance Index . The Distress Intolerance Index (DII; McHugh & Otto, 2011) is a 
10-item self -report measure of  the intolerance of distressing states that was derived from a 
study of distress intolerance measures.  The DII has demonstrated strong internal consistency 
reliability in clinical and unselected samples (McHugh & Otto, 2011) as well as strong 
concurrent a nd discriminant validity and distinguishes clinical from non -clinical groups 
(McHugh & Otto, 2012 ).  
Drug Use Motives Questionnaire  (DUMQ) . The DUMQ (Mueser, Nishith, Tracy, DeGirolamo, 
& Molinaro, 1995) is a 15 -item self report inventory designed to provi de an assessment of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], social and enhancement motives for alcohol use (Cooper, Russell, Skinner, & 
Windle, 1992). We will use a modified DMQ to assess non -alcohol drug use motives (as 
utilized by [CONTACT_885352]., 1995) with the addition of [ADDRESS_1238614] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) . The FTND (Heatherton, Kozlowski, 
Frecker, & Fagerstrom, 1991) will  be used as a continuous measure of nicotine dependence. 
The FTND has shown good internal consistency, a single dimension factor structure, and 
positive relationships with degree of nicotine intake a s assessed by [CONTACT_249899]. FTND 
items are co mbined wi th other smoking history items in this study.  
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS).  The HARS (Hamilton, 1959) is an interviewer -
administered measure of anxiety symptoms. The Structured Interview Guide for the HARS 
(Shear et al., 2001) was developed to imp rove the reliability of the HARS and will be used in 
this study. This will be the primary outcome measure for the study.  
    9 Homework Compliance.  Both participants and clinicians will separately rate compliance with 
homework/skills practice on a weekly basis with a form adapted from  an assessment of 
homework compliance developed by [CONTACT_885353], Epstein, & Covi (1986).   
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) . The ISI ( Bastien et al., 2001 ) is a 7 item self -report measure of 
sleep difficulty. This will be administered to a ssess whether sleep difficulty is associated with 
the achievement and maintenance of gains in treatment.  
Key Concepts Questionnaire (KCQ).  The KCQ is a brief self -report assessing  beliefs about the 
nature of anxiety and opi[INVESTIGATOR_885317]. This measure was developed by 
[CONTACT_885354] a potential mechanism of treatment effectiveness.  
Menstrual Cycle Information. The Menstrual Cycle  Information form is a measure tracking 
patient menstrual cycle history, current phase of menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive 
use, and hormonal contraception compliance. The first part of this measure  (Baseline 
Menstrual Cycle Information)  will be admi nistered during the baseline assessment. The 
second part of the form ( Menstrual Cycle and Compliance Calendar ), will be filled out 
during baseline and weekly assessments to characterize menstrual phase and ovarian sex 
hormones throughout the trial.   
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_885318] (OCS).  The OCS is an adaptation of the Cocaine Craving Scale that has 
been used widely as a brief measure of craving fo r both drugs and alcohol ( Weiss et al., 
2003). This 3 -item scale has demonstrated validity across a number of substances o f abuse 
and will be used in this study as a marker of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885319] 24 hours.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_659886] . Participants will self -report several variables related to the nature of 
their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], including use of heroin and prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], duration of use, and 
primary opi[INVESTIGATOR_885320].  
Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) . The OASIS (Norman et al., 2006) is 
a very brief (5 -item) measure of anxiety. The OASIS is a transdiagnostic measure o f anxiety 
designed to capture both syndromal and sub -syndromal symptoms.  A cut -off score of 5 for 
the OASIS reflects a clinical level of anxiety symptoms (Campbell -Sills et al., 2009).  
Perceived Stress Scale  (PSS) . The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kama rck, & Mermelstein, 
1983) is a [ADDRESS_1238615] reliability, external 
validity, and predictive validity (for severity  of symptoms, health service utilization, and 
smoking cessation outcome). The PSS will be administered at both baseline and post -
treatment  assessments  and will be used to evaluate individual differences in perceived stress 
in order to appropriately analyze  stress reactivity data.    
Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire. The Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ; 
Ehring et al., 2011) is a [ADDRESS_1238616] reliability, in 
addition to strong convergent and predictive validity . As the PTQ  was developed to measure 
repetitive negative thinking as a transdiagnostic process, it has been studied in various 
clinical populations (Ehrin g et al., 2011).   
Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale (PANAS). The PANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 
1988)  was developed as a brief measure of affect and yields the factors of Posit ive 
Affectivity (PA) and Negative Affectivity (NA). Internal consistency for both scales is high. 
The PA  subscale will be administered at baseline, mid -, and post -treatment . 
Primary Anxiety Symptom Measure.  Participants will also be asked to complete a mea sure of 
anxiety symptoms for the primary anxiety disorder diagnosis identified at baseline. This will 
include the following measures: Penn State Worry Questionnaire (Meyer et al., 1990) for 
generalized anxiety disorder, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (Mattick & Clarke, 1998) for 
    10 social anxiety disorder, Panic Disorder Severity Scale -Self Report (Houck et al., 2002) for 
panic disorder, Body Sensations Questionnaire ( Chambless, Caputo, Bright, & Gallagher, 
1984 ) for agoraphobia, and Fear Questionnaire (Mark s & Matthews, 1979) for specific 
phobias.  
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS). The QIDS (Rush et al., 2003) is a 16 -item 
self-report measure of depressive symptoms. The QIDS has been validated for measurement 
in clinical trials to assess change a nd will be used as a measure of depressive symptoms 
during the trial.  
Risk Assessment Battery (RAB).  The RAB (Metzger et al., 2001) is a self -report questionnaire 
of HIV/infectious disease risk behaviors. This measure has been extensively validated, 
inclu ding in both substance abusing and dual diagnosis populations and will be administered 
to assess risk behaviors in [ADDRESS_1238617] -treatment, and 3 -month 
follow -up.  
Timeline Follow -Back . Self -report of alcohol and other substance use will be collected weekly 
from participants using the Timeline Follow -back (TLFB) method, which has demonstrated 
good reliability and validity with adult alcoholics (Sobell & Sobell, 1996) and illicit drug 
users (Robinson et al., 2014).  
Saliva Sample Activ ity Documentation. The Saliva Sample Activity Documentation is a brief 
interviewer -administered questionnaire designed to assess recent use of medication, alcohol, 
caffeine, or nicotine in the past 12 hours, as well as physical activity or oral disease/inj ury that 
may affect saliva sample collection.  
Short Grit Scale (SGS).  The SGS is a n 8-item measure of grit, which is an individual’s 
tendency to pers evere towards long -term goals.  T he SGS has demonstrated strong 
psychometric properties (internal consiste ncy reliability, test -retest reliability, predictive 
validity for educational attainment and career stability) across various populati ons 
(Duckworth & Quinn, 2009).  This measure will be used in the present study to assess if grit 
is related to treatment o utcome, and will be administered at baseline and post -treatment.  
Substance Abuse Stigma Scale – Self-Devaluation subscale (SASS). The Self -Devaluation 
subscale of the SASS is an 8 -item measure assessing internalized or self -stigma among 
individuals abusin g substances (Luoma et al., 2013).  The SASS has shown strong 
psychometric properties among individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorders.  
The SASS will be administered at baseline  and post -treatment , and will be used to evaluate 
the impact of self -stigma on treatment outcome.  
WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL).  The WHOQOL (Murphy et al., 2000) is a 26 -item measure 
of self -reported quality of life that has been validated cross -culturally and will be used as a 
secondary outcome measure in this stud y.  
 
V.4.2 . Behavioral Computer Task   
The Escape Go/NoGo Learning Task is a novel task of negative reinforcement sensitivity and 
learning. This task is a modified version of a previously validated measure of reward and 
punishment sensitivity and learning ( Guitart -Masip et al., 2012). In this task, participants are 
required to learn contingencies between cues, responses and outcomes. A trial starts with the 
presentation of the cue (a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a fractal) for 2 seconds. During the cue, the words “Choose: 
Press or Not Press” are displayed and the participant makes a choice to press the spacebar (Go) 
or withhold a response (NoGo). Pressing the spacebar does not terminate the cue. Following the 
cue, feedback consists of either an aversive sound being played, acc ompanied by a pi[INVESTIGATOR_885321], or silence accompanied by a straight blue line. Feedback also contains participants’ choice 
on the prior cue (e.g. “You chose to PRESS”) and is presented for 2 seconds. The aversive sound 
is an unpleasant sound of a fork scra pi[INVESTIGATOR_885322] 85 
    11 dB. In pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], these sound and volume levels induced sufficient distress (average 
subjective distress rating of 7.1/10) without causing lasting effects on participants (i.e. ringing 
ears, etc .) and are below the Occupational Safety and Health Administration levels for 
permissible occupational noise. Feedback is followed by a 1 second inter -trial stimulus. There 
are 4 cues within 2 conditions. For the two cues in the “Escape” condition, the ons et of the 
aversive sound coincides with the presentation of the cue. The two cues in the “Avoid” condition 
are presented in silence. Participants’ goal in the task is to select the option (i.e., Go or NoGo) 
which tends to produce silence during the feedbac k. Within each condition, one cue will produce 
silence 80% of the time following a Go and the other cue will do the same following NoGo 
responses. Each cue is presented during 40 trials, for a total of 160 trials. Cumulative outcome 
measures for the Escape  Go/NoGo Learning Task include: accuracy percentage, a global 
measure of learning/performance, and win -stay, lose -shift, to examine the effect of immediate 
reinforcers on choice. In addition, a computational model of behavior will help determine the 
extent  to which automatic processes interfere with instrumental control.  
 
V.4.3. Stress Reactivity Assessment  
The stress reactivity paradigm includes two imagery conditions (neutral -relaxing, stress related) 
and a laboratory session.  This paradigm will be compl eted at pre - and post -treatment 
assessments.  During a visit prior to laboratory sessions, participants will complete two Scene 
Development Questionnaires  (Sinha & Tuit, 2012 ) that are designed to collect information about  
each imagery condition ( a non -drug-related stressful event in their life, and a neutral -relaxing 
event ); scripts for the imagery conditions will be developed us ing the information collected.  
Each script will be written, recorded, and edited by [CONTACT_885355].  During laboratory sessions, participants 
will listen to each script.  The order of the scripts will be randomized.  Psychophysiological 
measures (skin conductance) will be collected before, durin g, and after each imagery script. Skin 
conductance response will be collected using a Biopac MP150  system running AcqKnowledge 
4.4 software (Biopac Systems Inc., [LOCATION_003]) and the Biopac electrodermal activity amplifier 
(EDA100c).  Skin conductance response is used as an index of physiological arousal, and 
therefore stress reactivity.  Subjective measures that will be administered prior to and following 
each imagery condition  include the Positive and Negative Affect Scale ( Watson, Clark, & 
Tellegen, 1988 ), and t he Opi[INVESTIGATOR_59813] ( Weiss et al., 2003 ) that has been adapted to 
assess craving in the present moment  (i.e., “right now”) .  Following each  imagery script 
participants will also be asked to rate how “clearly and vividly” they were able to imagine the 
scenario  on a [ADDRESS_1238618] screening cup, 
which tests for the presence of the following substances: cocaine, marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], 
amphetamines, methamphetamines, phencyclidines, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturat es, methadone, 
tricyclic antidepressants, oxycodone, propoxyphene, and buprenorphine.  We will also use a 
Drug Screen Test Dip Card to test for fentanyl in the urine sample.  
 
V.4.5. Measurement of Sex Hormones and Menstrual Cycle Phase  
Female participants  will provide saliva samples and will report descriptive data on menstrual 
cycle phase in order to measure fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone throughout the study 
period. Salivary assays of estradiol and progesterone will be performed in duplicate and in 
    12 accordance with manufacturer specifications at the Laboratory for Biological Health Psychology 
at Brandeis University. Saliva samples will be collected using the passive drool method and 
according to recommended collection procedures. Samples will b e collected at baseline 
(immediately prior to the Escape Go/NoGo Task) and at each weekly session. In addition to 
measurement of salivary estradiol and progesterone, we will also collect descriptive data on 
menstrual cycle phase  (with the Menstrual Cycle I nformation form) , following recommendations 
for optimizing measurement of menstrual phase (Allen et al., 2016). Specifically, we will utilize 
both self -reported onset of menses and weekly hormone data to characterize menstrual cycle 
phase throughout the tr ial. We will also assess for presence, type, dose, and compliance with 
birth control at each time point.  Furthermore, using the interviewer -administered Saliva Sample 
Activity Documentation form, we will collect information on  participant  activity in the p ast [ADDRESS_1238619] to baseline demographic and clinical 
variables using t -tests and chi -square tests; if signifi cant group differences are identified in any 
variables known to be highly predictive of outcome, these variables will be adjusted for via their 
inclusion as covariates. These covariates will also be summarized with descriptive statistics and 
graphical meth ods to determine the most appropriate way to incorporate them in the analyses 
(e.g., continuous or categorical representation). All outcome analyses will utilize an intent -to-
treat approach, complemented by [CONTACT_885356].  
 
The hypothesis t hat I-CBT will yield greater reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_885323] (weeks of use in the previous 
4 weeks) and anxiety (HARS score) examining the main effect of treatment condit ion and its 
interaction with time on each outcome. The correlation among the repeated measures of the 
dependent variable will be appropriately accounted for via the inclusion of random subject 
effects (e.g., random intercepts and slopes for time). Covariat es will include pre -treatment values 
of the dependent variable and any baseline demographic or clinical variables identified as 
necessary covariates in preliminary analyses.  
 
To test the hypothesis that baseline stress reactivity is associated with treatme nt outcome at post -
treatment (week 12) , linear regressions will be utilized with primary  opi[INVESTIGATOR_885324] [ADDRESS_1238620] to this change; this analysis will include the main effects of 
time and group and the  time x  group interaction. The correlation among repeated measures of the 
dependent variable will be accounted for via the inclusion of random subject effects.  
 
With repeated assessments over [ADDRESS_1238621] to dropout of treatment prior 
to completion. For all of the proposed analyses, we will use statistical methods (e.g., linear 
    13 mixed effects models) th at incorporate partially observed data on participants who are lost to 
follow -up.   
 
We do not expect more than a 10% loss to follow -up (see C.4); nonetheless, the sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1238622] size and its reliability, even when allowing for up to 20% loss to follow -up. In this Stage [ADDRESS_1238623] sizes and clinically -significant change (as defined 
by [CONTACT_885357] & Truax, 1991). If promis ing results (i.e., presence of clinically -significant change) 
are detected, these data will provide an estimate of the reliability of the effect to inform power 
calculations for a larger Stage [ADDRESS_1238624] conducted a power analysis for the proposed sample size; 
effect sizes  are expressed  as standardized differences in means for ease of interpretation. For 
Aim 2, based on unpublished data from previous clini cal trials, we anticipate a small correlation 
between repeated measures of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_456085] ( r < .20) and a small to medium 
correlation ( r = 0.42) for the HARS. Thus, the proposed sample size would provide adequate 
power (power of at least 0.80) to d etect a minimum between -group difference from baseline to 
end of treatment in the magnitude of a large effect size ( d = .70 -.75). For Aim 3, based on 
previous studies examining stress reactivity and alcohol and cocaine use following treatment, 
which have c onsistently reported medium to large effect sizes (Sinha et al., 2009; 2011), the 
proposed sample size would provide adequate degrees of freedom to detect an effect size in the 
range of high medium to large.  
 
 
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
The anticipated r isks associated with the proposed study are minimal. As in any study involving 
assessment of psychiatric symptoms, there is some risk of emotional discomfort from discussing 
emotional topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (e.g., symptoms of anxiety, substance use). However, this discomf ort is 
expected to be transient . In addition, the stress reactivity tests  are designed to elicit mild to 
moderate, transient distress . Accordingly, evidence suggests that completion of laboratory stress -
reactivity paradigms is not associated with increased  risk of subsequent substance use (DeSantis 
et al., 2009). Participants will be monitored by [CONTACT_464]. If a participant reports  experiencing, 
(or study staff observes) distress at a higher level o r longer duration than the mild to moderate, 
transient di stress anticipated in study procedures, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_885325].  
 
Presence of any of the following criteria throughout the study will trigger a review of the 
participant’s appropriateness for t he study by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_885326] (either a clinician on the research team, or another member of the patient’s 
treatment team, if a release of information has been provided): (1) any serious adverse event, 
(2) evidence for a significant worsening of clinical status as indicated by (a) 2 consecutive 
weeks of a positive urine toxicology screen (not including prescribed medications or 
marijuana), or (b) 2 consecutive weeks of no -showing study treatment sessions.  
 
A core component of cognitive behavioral approaches to anxiety disorders is exposure to feared 
stimuli (e.g., social interactions, heights). This approach is intended to elicit moderate levels of 
anxiety in order for extinction of fear responding (the pu rported mechanism of change) to occur. 
Accordingly, this procedure has consistently demonstrated efficacy across the range of anxiety 
disorders for symptom reduction and disorder remission (e.g., Barlow et al., 2000). These 
    14 procedures are expected to elici t moderate levels of anxiety, which are similar to the anxiety 
experienced by [CONTACT_885358]. Evidence from 
numerous large -scale clinical trials supports the safety and tolerability  of these procedures, as 
indicate d by [CONTACT_885359] (see Hembree et al., 2003) and high levels of patient satisfaction 
(e.g., Stein et al., 2011), including in substance -dependent samples (e.g., Mills et al., 2012; Otto 
et al., 2010). Nonetheless, subjects will be closely monitored  for evidence of excessive or 
enduring distress following these procedures and precautions to protect against this risk will be 
taken.  
 
Another potential risk includes the possibility that subjects may experience dangerous or suicidal 
behavior. These are possible because of the nature of the dually diagnosed population studied in 
this research.  We do not anticipate that our study procedures will increase this particular risk, 
but there is a risk that this could occur during the study period. If a subject becomes very upset, 
is intoxicated, or is suicidal during the study, he or she will be seen by [CONTACT_885360] .  An assessment will be conducted, and the appropriate clinical recommendation 
will be made; this could involve treatment  either at McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139770]. If a patient 
provides a positive breath alcohol screen, a member of the study clinical staff will meet with the 
patient to determine whether he/she is able to complete the clinical or research session and to 
determi ne the participant's safety level and appropriate next steps (e.g., send to emergency room, 
refer to detox, send home in taxi, send home with a friend, etc.).  
 
Accidental opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], including fatal overdose, is a possible outcome of opi[INVESTIGATOR_885327]. We do not believe study procedures will increase this particular risk, because treatment 
enrollment has been found to be protective against overdose -related mortality among opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
dependent individuals (Degenhardt et al., 2011). In addition, all parti cipants are required to be on 
pharmacotherapy for opi[INVESTIGATOR_885328] a decreased risk of 
overdose in this population (Volkow et al., 2014 ). As noted above, all participants will be closely 
monitored and appropriate level of  care will be re -evaluated if there is evidence of a worsening 
of clinical status.  
 
Another potential risk is a breach of confidentiality.  However, as with the other risks mentioned 
above, we will take precautions to protect against this risk. Participan ts will receive a copy of the 
informed consent form explaining their privacy and confidentiality. All data will be coded with a 
unique identifier and will be stored separately from any identifying information (i.e., informed 
consent forms, clinical charts) . Given the longitudinal nature of this clinical trial, a key linking 
the unique subject identifier to the participant's name [CONTACT_885363]. This will be stored on 
password protected computer and a locked cabinet separate from other data. Informed con sent 
forms and data will be stored separately in locked files and only research staff will have access to 
this information.  Electronic questionnaires will be stored in the Redcap Database. As noted 
above, Redcap is an encrypted, electronic database that i s both HIPPA compliant (Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and approved by [CONTACT_885361] (for addition information on the 
RedCap Database feature see http://rc.partners.org ).  Only research staff affiliated with this 
proposal will have access to any identifying information.  Data being analyzed will not include 
identifying information.  The identity of the participants will not be revealed i n the presentation 
or publication of any result from the project. To provide additional privacy protection given the 
sensitive nature of the data collected (e.g., substance use data), a certificate of confidentiality will 
be requested from the National Ins titute on Drug Abuse. This will be requested following IRB 
approval, consistent with NIDA procedures.   
    [ADDRESS_1238625] 
completed the National Cancer Institute (NCI) course, Human Participants Protections Education 
for Research Teams , and research assistants will be closely supervised by [CONTACT_9154]. As part of 
the informed consent process, participants will be informed that if they feel uncomfortable 
responding to any question that they are free to choose not to respond or to express their 
discomf ort.  Each participant will be made aware that participation is completely voluntary and 
that he or she may withdraw participation at any time without penalty.  
 
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The major potential benefit to participants is the receipt of treatme nt that might help them to 
achieve their goal s of maintaining abstinence from opi[INVESTIGATOR_885329]. Participants 
will receive free cognitive behavioral treatment as part of this study from providers experienced 
in treating substance dependence. Par ticipants also will receive the potential benefit of 
participating in a study that may contribute to establishing more effective treatment for patients 
with co -occurring opi[INVESTIGATOR_885290]. Given the minimal risks associated 
with the p roposed investigation, we believe that this is a very acceptable risk -benefit ratio.  
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_885330]. Further consultation will  be obtained if necessary from the McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885331].   
 
Continuous, close monitoring of safety issues by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_885332]’s 
duration with prompt reporting of adverse events to the Partners  IRB.  A t the time of annual, 
continuing review we will provide the Partners IRB with a summary of any unexpected and 
related adverse events as well as any other unanticipated problems that occurred since the last 
continuing review. We will also follow the Partner s IRB policies for expedited reporting of 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events.   
 
IX.1. Reporting Unanticipated Problems Including Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Tracking of Unanticipated Problems including AEs will  begin at t he time of consent. 
Unanticipated Problems including AEs will be assessed at every research assessment and 
treatment session (i.e., baseline, weeks [ADDRESS_1238626] -treatment, 1 -month follow -up, and 3 -month 
follow -up). At every study appointment, research staff will ask about any emergency room visits, 
inpatient admissions, etc. (see Unanticipated Event Form). In addition, participants will be 
closely monitored during study assessment and treatment for any psychological distress or 
adverse reactions to any treatm ent procedures and study clinicians will assess for suicidal 
behavior or increased severity of psychological distress. Study staff will follow the guidelines 
below to determine how to report and categorize Unanticipated Problems. Any AE that results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_885333] 24 hours and will be categorized as an 
SAE. We will consult the IRB for guidance on any event not outlined in the protocol that are 
possibly related to study participation. Events that are unrelated to the disorder or study 
participation will not be collected in the present study given that it is a psychotherapy trial (e.g., 
common medical illness, such as cold or flu).

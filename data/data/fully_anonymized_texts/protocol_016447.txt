Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 1.0 Background 
1.1 Multiple Myeloma:  Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of the differentiated plasma cells that 
affect the older patient with a median age at onset of 65-[ADDRESS_616950] the quality of life me trics. Finally, some of these regimens require 
IV or subcutaneous administration, which can re quire frequent clinic, visits for patients. The 
highly effective multi-drug regimens currently  in use typi[INVESTIGATOR_84688] a proteasome 
inhibitor, either bortezomib given IV or SQ or carfilzomib given IV and an IMiD (typi[INVESTIGATOR_480125]). 
 
1.2 Implications of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma : MM is characterized by 
[CONTACT_480152] (PCs) predominantly in the bone marrow (BM), highlighting the dependence of the tumor on the marrow microenvironment. While all patients with monoclonal gammopathies have some level of circulating plasma cells, 
development of large numbers of plasma cells in the peripheral blood, referred to as plasma 
cell leukemia (PCL), has been uncommon.(Kumar  et al. 2005) Rarely patients present with 
solid tumors (solitary or multiple) in the soft  tissue and major organs called “extramedullary 
plasmacytomas” (EMP) or extramedullary disease (EMD). Recently, others and we have observed a disconcerting increase in the incidence of EMD in patients with MM.(Short et al. 2011, Usmani et al. 2012) These patients abruptly develop soft tissue masses, effusions, and 
plasmacytomas in major organs and the central nervous system.(Rosinol et al. 2004, Madan 
et al. 2009, Varettoni et al. 2009) Patients with EMD have a poor prognosis, are often difficult to treat, and are refractory to most of the currently available drugs. In fact, development of EMD is associated with a ve ry poor survival in patients with MM. Some 
studies have suggested that the malignant PC s in EMD have acquired additional genetic 
changes such as deletion of p53 gene.(Sheth et al. 2009, Lopez-Anglada et al. 2010) The increased occurrence of EMD may also reflect th at patients are living longer thus allowing us 
to observe later stages of natural MM evolutio n that we were unable to witness in the past. 
However preliminary data from our studies indicate that this is not the sole explanation; in 
fact, the increased incidence of EMD may, in part, be related to specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].(Short, Rajkumar et al. 2011) There is an urgent need to develop new treatment approaches for EMD 
and plasma cell leukemia with new as well as currently available drugs. 
 
We studied a large cohort of 1053 patients with  MM seen at Mayo Clinic between January1, 
2001, and December 31, 2010, for development of EMD during routine clinical follow up. 
Among these, 93 patients (8.8%) were identified to have EMD at some point during the 
disease course, with median time to EMD detection of 11 months (range 0 – 10 years). 
Patients who developed EMD at any time dur ing the disease course had a shorter overall 
survival compared with the rest (3.3 vs. 5.2 years, P <0.01). Development of EMD was 
associated with presence of high-risk FISH a bnormalities, especially del17p, elevated serum 
LDH and high plasma cell labeling index at di agnosis; (P <0.05 for all comparisons). We 
then studied [ADDRESS_616951] ory MM who enrolled on a clinical trial of 
pomalidomide between 2007-2010, in order to estimate the incidence of EMD in recent years.(Short, Rajkumar et al. 2011) At trial en try, the rate of treatment-emergent EMD was 
7.5% (13 of 174 patients). EMD was associated with poor survival; median OS from trial

ability to survive outside the marrow microenvironment. 
 
1.3 Ixazomib : Ixazomib, which has been formulated for both intravenous (IV) and oral (PO) 
administration, is a small molecule proteasome inhibitor. It is the citrate ester of the 
biologically active boronic acid form, MLN2238, which is structurally similar to bortezomib. In water or aqueous systems, ixazomib rapi [INVESTIGATOR_78932]2238, therefore all doses 
and concentrations are expressed as MLN2238.  Nonclinical studies were conducted with a 
solution of either MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with ixazomib. Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, reversibly, and selectively inhibits the 20S proteasome. However in contrast to bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) that may contribute to increased tissue distribution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible dissociation 
rate from the red blood cell proteasome, wh ile MLN2238 demonstrates a more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_480126]. The pharmacologic implications of this 
difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribu tion may in turn result in differences in safety 
and efficacy profiles in a broader range of tumors. In xenograft-bearing mice, the more rapid 
dissociation rate correlates with an increased ratio of tumor proteasome inhibition to blood 
proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib shows greater antitumor activity in several xenograft 
models, both solid tumor and bortezomib -resistant xenografts, than bortezomib. 
 Nonclinical Pharmacology : MLN2238 refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of 
the drug substance, ixazomib. Ixazomib refers to  the citrate ester of MLN2238. In water or 
aqueous systems, the equilibrium shifts from ixazomib to the biologically active boronic acid 
form MLN2238. All doses and concentrations are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 In Vitro Pharmacology: MLN2238 preferentially binds the β5 site of the 20S proteasome; at 
higher concentrations, it also inhibits the activity of the β1 and β2 sites. MLN2238 inhibits ß5 
site 20S proteasome activity in vitro, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 
3.4 nM. Potency is reduced roughly 10-fold ve rsus ß1 (IC50=31 nM) and 1,000-fold versus 
ß2 (IC50 =3500 nM). MLN2238 was also tested for inhibition against a panel of 103 kinases, 18 receptors (neurotransmitter, ion channel, brain and gut receptors), and 9 serine proteases. In all cases, the IC50 values were >[ADDRESS_616954] different β5 
proteasome dissociation half-lives (t1/2), reflecting differences in their on-off binding 
kinetics (the β 5 proteasome dissociation t1/2 for MLN2238 and bortezomib are 18 and 110 
minutes, respectively). Based on these favorable ch aracteristics, ixazomib is anticipated to be 
effective against multiple myeloma. (Ixazomib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Proteasome 
inhibition results in the accumulation of poly- ubiquitinated substrat es within the cell and 
leads to cell cycle disruption, with concomita nt activation of apoptotic pathways and cell 
death. Consistent with inhibition of ß5 20S activity, MLN2238 demonstrated potent activity against cultured MDA-MB [ADDRESS_616955] cell viability assay. In 
nonclinical models MLN2238 has activity agains t both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant 
xenografts.  In Vivo Pharmacology : To determine the activity of MLN2238 in vivo, pharmacodynamic 
studies were performed in immunocompromised mice bearing either CWR22 human prostate or WSU-DLCL2 (human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]) tumors. Pharmacodynamic responses in xenograft tumors  were analyzed by [CONTACT_58833] 20S proteasome 
inhibition and by [CONTACT_480153]1487 7 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 acid (DNA) damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) and activating transcription factor-3 
(ATF-3) as well as measuring growth arrest. Increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3 is indicative of a downstream biological response to proteasome inhibition. After a single dose 
of MLN2238, a clear dose response was observe d in CWR22 xenografts as seen in both 
tumor 20S proteasome inhibition and in changes in GADD34 and ATF-3 expression. In 
WSU-DLCL2 xenografts, greater tumor proteasome inhibition was observed with MLN2238 compared to bortezomib and resulted in increased expression of GADD34 and ATF-3. MLN2238 efficacy experiments demonstrated strong antitumor activity in 4 xenograft models: CWR22 (a human prostate cancer cell line) and 3 human lymphoma cell lines 
(WSU-DLCL2, OCI-Ly7-7D1-luc, and PHTX-22L). In the case of the CWR22 xenograft model, significant antitumor activity was seen w ith both IV and PO dos ing, demonstrating 
that this molecule has antitumor activity when administered via different dosing routes. In all 
[ADDRESS_616956] activity that extends beyond that seen with bortezomib. 
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics : Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics: The 
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MLN2238 were studied in severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. B ecause of the extensive red blood cell (RBC) 
partitioning of MLN2238, both blood and plasma PK parameters were determined in these studies. MLN2238 had a very low blood clearance (CLb) and a moderate blood volume of 
distribution at steady-state (Vss,b) after IV administration. The concentration-versus-time 
curve of MLN2238 displayed a distinct bi-exponen tial profile with a steep initial distribution 
phase and a long terminal t
1/2 (>24 hr) in all species tested. MLN2238 had higher plasma 
clearance (CLp) and a larger plasma volume of  distribution at steady-state (Vss,p) than in 
blood, largely because of the extensive RBC partitioning. The PK properties of MLN2238 
after oral administration were studied in rats  and dogs. The plasma oral bioavailability (F) 
was 41% in rats and nearly 100% in dogs. A clinical prototype formulation of the ixazomib 
capsule demonstrated that MLN2238 had excellent oral F and an excellent absorption profile in dogs. In addition, interindividual variab ility, as measured by %CV, in Cmax and AUC
0-24hr 
after oral administration was low to moderate, similar to that after IV administration. The terminal t
1/[ADDRESS_616957] very low CLb (0.0045 L/hr/kg) and a 
moderate Vss,b (0.79 L/kg) with a long terminal t
1/2 (>24 hours) in humans. The human 
efficacious IV dose of MLN2238 is predicted to be 2.0 mg/m2 (0.054 mg/kg) twice weekly. 
The human efficacious oral dose is predicted to be between 2 and 5 mg/m2 twice weekly, 
based on a predicted oral F of between 41% (as seen in rats) and 100% (as seen in dogs). The efficacious dose projection for once weekly oral wo uld be higher than twice weekly oral (data 
not provided).  Metabolism appears to be a major route of elim ination for MLN2238 and urinary excretion of 
the parent drug was negligible (<5% of dose). In vitro in liver microsomes, the metabolism of 
MLN2238 was high in mice and low to moderate in all other species studied. MLN2238 is metabolized by [CONTACT_20550] P450 (CYP) isozymes and non-CYP enzymes and 
proteins. The rank order of relative biotransfo rmation activity of each of the 5 major human 
MC1487 8 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 CYP isozymes in the in vivo studies was 3A4 (34.2%) >1A2 (30.7%) >2D6 (14.7%) >2C9 
(12.1%) >2C19 (negligible).  
MLN2238 is neither an inhibitor of CYP is ozymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 (IC50 
>30μM, with an estimated inhibition dissociation constant [Ki] >15 μM), nor a time 
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 (up to 30 μM). The potential for ixazomib treatment to 
produce DDIs via CYP inhibition is inferred to be low. 
 In a Caco-2 cell assay, MLN2238 showed medium permeability with a B-to-A/A-to-B 
permeability ratio of 2.9. MLN2238 may be a low- affinity substrate of para-glycoprotein (P-
gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) 
efflux pump transporters. MLN2238 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 (IC50 
>100 μM). Consequently, the potential for MLN2238 to cause DDIs with substrates or 
inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 is low. 
 
Ixazomib Safety Pharmacology : In exploratory safety pharmacology studies, MLN2238 was 
a weak inhibitor of the cloned cardiac potassium (K+) human ether à-go-g o related gene (hERG) channel, with an IC50 of 59.6 μM, which exceeds, by [CONTACT_3450] 200-fold, the 
plasma Cmax (111 ng/mL [0.3 μM]) predicted to occur in humans at the optimally 
efficacious dose after IV administration. 
 In the GLP-compliant, 1-cycle, repeat-dose, PO  toxicology study in beagle dogs, an increase 
in QTc was seen in male dogs at non-tolerated doses, and a potential increase in QTc was seen in male dogs at tolerated doses. However, increased QTc was not seen in female dogs at 
any dose, despi[INVESTIGATOR_478555] d plasma Cmax values similar to those of male 
dogs. Additionally, in a GLP-compliant, 2-cycle, repeat-dose, IV toxicology study in beagle 
dogs, no increase in QTc was seen in either male or female dogs at any dose, even though dogs in the IV study had higher MLN2238 plasma Cmax values than did the male dogs in the PO study. These data suggest that MLN2238 has a low potential for prolonging the QT 
interval in vivo . 
 Toxicology : All studies discussed in this section were  conducted with a solution of either 
MLN2238 or MLN2238 in equilibrium with ixazomib. Because ixazomib was shown to dissociate immediately to MLN2238 upon exposure to plasma in vitro and therefore could not be detected in plasma samples in vitro all doses, concentrations, and PK parameters noted, 
here and in the IB, are expressed as the boronic acid, MLN2238. 
 
The toxicology studies of MLN2238 were studied in SCID mice bearing human CWR22 tumor xenografts, Sprague-Dawley rats, beagle  dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys. Details of 
these studies are included in the IB.  
In Vitro  Toxicology: MLN2238 was not mutagenic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-
compliant bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay).  
 In Vivo  Toxicology: Details of the in vivo  toxicology IV dosing and oral dosing studies are 
provided in the IB. To summarize, the toxicologi c effects seen in the IV and PO studies are 
qualitatively similar to what was previously observed in rodents dosed with bortezomib, for 
which ixazomib is the next-generation molecule. MLN2238 did not cause significant 
toxicities that have not been previously observed after dosing with bortezomib. Therefore, on the basis of the similarity in the toxicity profile in rats between MLN22338 and bortezomib, 
MLN2238 is not known to present any additional safety risks beyond those that occur after 
MC1487 9 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 treatment with bortezomib. In addition, there were no significant findings at tolerated 
exposures in dogs observed after PO administration that were not seen after IV administration, and similar exposures were tolerated regardless of the route of administration. 
 
The potential risks identified from nonclinical studies in dogs and rats include: 
• GI toxicity that could result in nausea, vo miting, diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte 
imbalance, bleeding, bowel obstruction (i ncluding ileus and intussusception), and 
sepsis. 
• Reduced blood counts manifest as throm bocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. 
Reticulocytopenia was described in animals and may be associated with anemia. 
Reductions in blood counts may predispose to an increased susceptibility to infection, 
bleeding, and anemia. 
• Peripheral nerve ganglia effects that may be associated with peripheral neuropathy 
that includes pain, burning sensation, and numbness. Autonomic and motor neuropathy may be observed, as both have been reported for bortezomib. 
• Lymphoid cell depletion that may be associa ted with increased risk of infection, 
including re-activation of herpes zoster. 
• Acute phase response that may result in fever and metabolic changes. 
 All of the effects seen in the GLP-compliant PO  toxicology studies in both dogs and rats at 
tolerated doses were reversible/reversing and can  be monitored in the clinic with routine 
clinical observations (GI disturbances and in fections secondary to lymphoid compromise), 
clinical pathology assessments (inhibition of  erythropoiesis, th rombocytopenia, and 
inflammatory leukogram), and neurologic assessment, as are commonly done for patients 
treated with bortezomib. The neurologic lesions in these studies are similar to what has been 
described after treatment with bortezomib and are believed to be the cause of the peripheral 
neuropathy observed in patients treated with bor tezomib.Further details are presented in the 
IB.  
Clinical Experience with Ixazomib : Like bortezomib, ixazomib is a small molecule peptide 
boronic acid analog. Ixazomib is the first i nvestigational proteasome inhibitor with 
substantial oral bioavailability in patients with multiple myeloma.  
 
Ixazomib has been evaluated as an oral single agent in phase [ADDRESS_616958] included 
patients with advanced solid tumors, lym phoma, relapse/refractory MM (RRMM), and 
relapsed or refractory light-chain (AL) amyloidosis and demonstrated early signs of activity. Ongoing studies continue to investigate both single-agent ixazomib and ixazomib in 
combination with standard treatments. Based on encouraging preliminary data observed in 
patients with MM requiring systemic treatmen t, two phase 3 trials in newly diagnosed MM 
(NDMM) (C16014) and RRMM (C16010) patient  populations are currently evaluating 
ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and dexamethasone (RevDex) 
versus placebo/RevDex. Both trials are combining ixazomib at a weekly dose of 4.[ADDRESS_616959] of food, and oral 
bioavailability. Studies evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) of ixazomib alone (in Japanese patients) and in combination with le nalidomide and dexamethasone in Asian adult 
patients (including Japanese patients) with a diagnosis of NDMM are ongoing. 
 
MC1487 10 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 As of 27 March 2013, preliminary clinical data are available for a total of 653 patients across 
13 studies. The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. 
The adverse events (AEs) are consistent with the class-based effects of proteasome inhibition 
and are similar to what has been previously reported with bortezomib though the severity of some, for example peripheral neuropathy, is l ess. While some of these potential toxicities 
may be severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_480154], or, as needed, dose modification or discontinuation.  Fatigue was the most common AE reported among 384 patients treated in the oral (PO) 
studies (47%). Other common AEs reported in the pooled intravenous (IV) and PO safety 
populations include nausea, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rash is also a 
commonly reported treatment-emergent event; however, there is some variety in its 
characterization and causality resulting in different preferred terms to describe it. A high-level term outline of rash events includes r ashes, eruptions and exanthems NEC; pruritus 
NEC; erythemas; papulosquamous conditions; and exfoliative conditions . The dose escalation 
phases of most trials reported in the IB have now completed enrollment, and gastrointestinal 
(GI) symptoms were the common dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when the use of prophylactic anti-emetics was not permitted per pr otocol. In the expansion cohorts or phase 2 
cohorts ( per each study), the incidence and sev erity of GI symptoms was mitigated by [CONTACT_480155] (MTD)/recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) ( per each study) and standard clinical usage of an ti-emetics and/or antidiarrheal medications as 
deemed appropriate.   The most frequent (at least 20%) treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported with the PO formulation pooled from single-agent studies (n=201) irrespective of causality to 
ixazomib, include nausea (53%), fatigue (51% ), diarrhea (44%), thrombocytopenia (34%), 
vomiting (38%), decreased appetite (32%), fe ver (21%), and anemia (21%). The most 
frequent (at least 20%) TEAEs reported with the PO formulation pooled from combination 
trials (irrespective of the combination) (n=173) , irrespective of causality to ixazomib, include 
diarrhea (47%), fatigue (44%), nausea (38%), peripheral edema (35%),  constipation (33%), 
insomnia (29%), thrombocytopenia (28%), anemia (26%), vomiting (26%), neutropenia 
(25%), back pain (24%), pyrexia (23%), pe ripheral edema (21%, each), fever (20%), cough 
(20%), hypokalemia (20%), neutropenia (20%), and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (20%). 
Overall rash of all grades is reported in appr oximately 50% of patients and is more common 
when ixazomib is given in combination with lenalidomide, where rash is an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_96540]. 
 
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism : Clinical IV and PO PK data show that 
ixazomib citrate (measured as the biologically active boronic acid form of ixazomib 
[MLN2238]) has multi-exponential disposition with a rapid initial phase that is largely over 
by [ADDRESS_616960] time of 
occurrence of maximum (peak) concentration (Tma x) of approximately 0.5 to 2.0 hours and a 
terminal disposition half-life (t1/2) after multiple dosing of approximately 5 to 7 days. Results of a population PK analysis (n = 137) show that there is no relationship between body 
surface area (BSA) or body weight and clearance (CL). Also, based on stochastic simulations for fixed dose, exposures are independent of th e individual patient’s BSA.(Gupta et al. 2011, 
Gupta et al. 2012) Based on these data, a recommendation was made for fixed dosing in 
clinical trials. An absolute bioavailability of 67% was determined for ixazomib using the 
population PK analysis. Please refer to the current ixazomib IB and Safety Management Attachment (SMA) for information on the PK for IV doses of ixazomib.  
MC1487 11 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 Clinical Study C16009 (Arm 1) with ketocon azole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, showed a 2-
fold increase in area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) in the presence 
of ketoconazole. This resulted in the continue d exclusion of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors in 
ongoing/planned clinical studies.  Clinical Trial Experience Using the Oral Formulation of Ixazomib : As of 27 March 2013, a 
total of 507 patients with differing malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL amyloidosis, nonhematologic cancers, and lymphoma) have been treated in studies evaluating the oral ixazomib formulation. These patients have been treated with different doses of ixazomib 
either as a single-agent treatment (in 201 patients)  or in combination with currently clinically 
available treatments (in 306 patients). Information regarding the ongoing studies, patient 
populations, and doses investigated  is included in Table 1-1.

1.4 Potential Risks of Ixazomib :  
The emerging safety profile indicates that ixazomib is generally well tolerated. The adverse 
events (AEs) are consistent with the class-b ased effects of proteasome inhibition and are 
similar to what has been previously reported  with bortezomib, though the severity of some, 
for example peripheral neuropathy, is less. While some of these potential toxicities may be 
severe, they can be managed by [CONTACT_480156], or, as 
needed, dose modification or discontinuation. In the four ongoing studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) investigati ng single-agent oral ixazomib in patients with differing 
malignancies (multiple myeloma, AL am yloidosis, non-hematologic cancers, and 
lymphoma), a total of [ADDRESS_616962] frequent (at least 10%) AEs occurring in the pooled safety population from single-agent oral ixazomib studies (C16003, C16004, C16007, and C16009) are shown in

The clinical experience with ixazomib also shows early signs of antitumor activity as evidenced by [CONTACT_2669] a 50% reduction in disease burden in some patients and prolonged disease stabilization in others across all ongoing trials. The antitumor activity has been seen 
with single-agent ixazomib, when combined with establishe d therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and across the 
malignancies studied (advanced solid tumors, non-Hodgkin’s disease, Hodgkin’s disease, relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma, relapsed or refractory systemic light chain 
amyloidosis, and newly diagnosed multiple myeloma) to date.(Kumar et al. 2014, Kumar et 
al. 2014, Kumar et al. 2014, Richardson et al. 2014)  
1.5 Pomalidomide : Pomalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent that 
displays similar anti-angiogenic activity , but far greater anti-proliferative and 
immunomodulatory activity compared to the pare nt drug. Pomalidomide has also been shown 
to stimulate antibody-dependent cytotoxic T-cell activity (ADCC).  The efficacy of pomalidomide in relapsed myeloma has been shown in multiple trials.(Streetly et al. 2008, Lacy et al. 2009, Lacy et al. 2010, Lacy et al. 2011, San Miguel et al. 2013, Leleu et al. 2015) At tolera ted doses (MTD=2 mg QD and 5 mg QOD), 
pomalidomide has been shown to be active in subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma (MM) (study CC-4047-00-001). In [ADDRESS_616969] commonly occurring dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was reversible neutrope nia. As with other IMiDs administered to 
MC1487 16 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 subjects receiving concomitant systemic steroids, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was seen (in 
1subject each in this study and in its subse quent named patient supply rollover program). 
 
Preliminary efficacy and safety data from an ongoing phase II study, led by [CONTACT_128738], et 
al, at Mayo Clinic, were published. Sixty pa tients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma were enrolled. Pomalidomide (CC-4047) was given orally at a dose of 2 mg daily on days 1-28 of a 28-day cycle and dexamethasone  was given orally at a dose of 40 mg daily 
on days 1, 8, 15, 22 of each cycle. Patient also received aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 325 mg once daily for thromboprophylaxis. The study endpoints were the response rate in patients taking 
pomalidomide plus dexamethasone including pa tients with lenalidomide resistant refractory 
multiple myeloma, and safety of pomalidom ide plus dexamethasone. Responses were 
recorded using the criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group. Thirty eight 
patients achieved objective response (63%) in cluding CR in 3 patients (5%), VGPR in 17 
patients (28%), and PR in 18 patients (30%). The CR + VGPR rate was 33%. Grade 3 or 4 
hematologic toxicity occurred in 23 patients (38%); and consisted of anemia in three patients 
(5%), thrombocytopenia in two patients (3%) and neutropenia in 21 (35%). Among those that developed grade 3/[ADDRESS_616970] expe rienced the neutropenia in cycle 1-3; no new 
patients experienced grade 3/[ADDRESS_616971] common non-hematological grade 3/4 toxicities were fati gue (17%) and pneumonia (8%). Other grade 3/4 
non-hematological toxicities that occurred in l ess than 5% included diarrhea, constipation, 
hyperglycemia, and neuropathy. One patient (1.6%)  had a thromboembolic event of deep vein 
thrombosis. Lacy et al. have also demonstrat ed promising clinical activity of pomalidomide 
in myeloma patients with persistent disease following lenalidomide treatment.  CC-4047-MM-002 is a Celgene sponsored phase 1b /[ADDRESS_616972] received prior treatment that includes lenalidomide and bortezomib. This study consists of a phase 1 single agent pomalidomide (maximum tolerated dose [MTD]) 
segment and phase 2 randomized (pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone versus 
pomalidomide alone) segment. The MTD was 4 mg  21/28 days (there were 4 drug-related 
DLTs [Grade 4 neutropenia] at 5 mg). Neutr openia and anemia were the most common grade 
3/4 toxicities; there was a dose-dependent increase in grade 4 neutropenia. Based on the preliminary safety and response data, 4 mg 21/28 days is the dose for the phase 2 segment.  
Pre-clinical data and the prior experience with  thalidomide and lenalidomide in the treatment 
of patients with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) provide the rationale for the 
use of pomalidomide in patients with MMM. Th is is further supported by [CONTACT_109972] a 
Celgene sponsored trial (MMM-001) which indicated that pomalidomide therapy at 0.5 mg or 2 mg/day +/- an abbreviated course of prednisone is well tolerated in patients with 
myelofibrosis and active in the treatment of anemia. 
 
1.6 Rationale for the current trial : Clearly patients with EMD and PCL need newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
The combination of pomalidomide and ixazomi b provides a potentially powerful combination 
due to several reasons. We studied 174 consecu tive patients with relapsed refractory multiple 
myeloma (MM) enrolled on a phase II clinical trial of pomalidomide plus low-dose 
dexamethasone at Mayo Clinic. Extramedullary disease (EMD) was present at the time of 
trial entry in 7.5% (13 of 174 patients). The response of EMD to pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone included two complete and two partial responses among the 13 patients 
MC1487 17 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 (response rate, 31%). The results of this st udy suggest that pomalidomide can enter the 
extramedullary sites and attain therapeutic  levels, with resultant disease response.  
 
Similar to bortezomib, MLN2238 potently, re versibly, and selectively inhibits the 20S 
proteasome. However in contrast to bortezomib, it has a shorter dissociation half-life (t1/2) 
that may contribute to increased tissue distri bution. Bortezomib has a slowly reversible 
dissociation rate from the red blood cell proteasome, while MLN2238 demonstrates a more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_480127]. The pharmacologic implications of 
this difference in binding kinetics and tissue distribution may in turn result in differences in safety and efficacy profiles in a broader range of tumors. In xenograft-bearing mice, the more rapid dissociation rate correlates with an in creased ratio of tumor proteasome inhibition to 
blood proteasome inhibition, and ixazomib s hows greater antitumor activity in several 
xenograft models, both solid tumor and bortezomib-resistant xenografts, than bortezomib. 
This particular property may enable ixazomib to  attain higher levels in the extramedullary 
compartment, thus offer a particular advantage in this clinical situation. Finally, combinations 
of an IMiD and a proteasome inhibitor have been the most effective regimens in myeloma, as 
has been seen with bortezomib or carfilzomib combinations with thalidomide or lenalidomide.

A new cycle of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if: 
• The ANC is ≥1000/μL 
• The platelet count is ≥ 50,000/μL 
• Any other 
non-hematologic treatment -related adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved to ≤Grade [ADDRESS_616992] will be 
evaluated weekly and a new cycle of therapy will be held until the toxicity has resolved as described above. 
MC1487 28 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 If any drug dosing was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted 
with a one-level dose reduction without requiring an interruption for the remainder of the cycle, then that re duced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 
of the new cycle.  
If any drug dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle or if 
the new cycle is held due to known hematologic toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be started with a one-level dose reduction. If a new cycle of therapy cannot be restarted within 4 weeks of the scheduled Day 1 due to non-reso lution of drug related toxicities, the 
patient will be removed from protocol therapy and will go to event monitoring.

Patients may be at an increased risk of infection including reactivation of herpes zoster 
and herpes simplex viruses. Prophylaxis with  acyclovir 400 mg PO BID is recommended 
while on study therapy and for 1 month beyond the end of therapy 
 
9.8 Prohibited medications 
Systemic treatment with any of the following metabolizing enzyme inducers should be avoided, unless there is no appropriate alternative medication for the patient’s use. 
(Rationale: Unlike with inhibitors if there were to be a drug-drug interaction with an 
inducer, MLN2238 exposure would be less - so there is a reduced chance of an adverse 
event. However, there may be less chance fo r an antitumor effect, but that is not an 
absolute reason to be taken off ixazomib):  
• Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenytoin, and phenobarbital 
Extra caution should be exercised when using these medications concomitantly and incidence of any side effects should be ca refully monitored. Because these medications 
are constantly changing, please review any medications for their potential to induce 
CYP3A4. Potential resources may include the FDA and/or IUPUI websites, or your local institution’s pharmacist. 
Excluded foods and dietary supplements incl ude St. John’s wort and Ginkgo biloba. 
 
9.9a Erythematous Rash with or without Pruritus:  
As with bortezomib, rash with or without pruritus has been reported with ixazomib, 
primarily at the higher doses tested and when  given with agents where rash is an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_5171]. The rash may range from limited erythematous areas, macular 
and/or small papular bumps that may or may not be pruritic over a few areas of the body, 
to a more generalized eruption that is predominately on the trunk or extremities. Rash has 
been most commonly characterized as maculopa pular or macular. To date, when it does 
occur, rash is most commonly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient, self-limiting, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_20539] 1 to 2 in severity.  
Symptomatic measures such as antihistamines or  corticosteroids (oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) have 
been successfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylac tically in subsequent 
cycles. The use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], IV, or oral steroid (e.g., prednisone ≤10 mg per day or 
equivalent) is permitted. Ma nagement of a Grade 3 rash may require intravenous 
antihistamines or corticosteroids. Admini stration of ixazomib (and/or other causative 
agent if given in combination) should be modified per protocol and re-initiated at a 
reduced level from where rash w as noted (also, per protocol). 
In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult and biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or 
any SAE involving rash is recommended. Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient has previously devel oped a rash (e.g., using a thick, alcohol-free 
emollient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_12669]). A rare risk is 
Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a severe and potentially life-threatening rash with skin peeling and mouth sores, which should be  managed symptomatically according to 
standard medical practice. Punch biopsies for histopathological analysis are encouraged 
at the discretion of the investigator.  
MC1487 36 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 9.9b Thrombocytopenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Thrombocytopenia may be severe 
but has been manageable with platelet tr ansfusions according to standard clinical 
practice. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification 
recommendations in the protocol when thrombocytopenia occurs (see Table 8.2 ). 
Therapy can be reinitiated at a reduced level upon recovery of platelet counts. A rare risk 
is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) , a rare blood disorder where blood clots 
form in small blood vessels throughout the body characterized by [CONTACT_12703], 
petechiae, fever, or possibly more serious  signs and symptoms. TTP should be managed 
symptomatically according to standard medical practice. 
 
9.9c Neutropenia 
Blood counts should be monitored regularly as outlined in the protocol with additional 
testing obtained according to standard clinical practice. Neutropenia may be severe but has been manageable. Growth factor support is not required but may be considered according to standard clinical practice. Ixazomib administration should be modified as noted as per dose modification recommendations in the protocol when neutropenia occurs (see Table 8.2 ). Therapy can be reinitiated at a re duced level upon recovery of ANCs. 
 
9.9d Fluid Deficit 
Dehydration should be avoided since ixazomib may cause vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients treated with ixazomib, 
commonly in the setting of the previously  noted gastrointestinal toxicities and 
dehydration. Fluid deficit should be corr ected before initiation of study drug and as 
needed during treatment to avoid dehydration.  
9.9e Hypotension 
Symptomatic hypotension and orthostatic hypoten sion with or without syncope have been 
reported with ixazomib. Blood pressure should be  closely monitored while the patient is 
on study treatment and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the 
setting of concomitant symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or anorexia. Patients taking medications and/or diuretics to manage their blood pressure (for either 
hypo- or hypertension) should be managed according to standard clinical practice, including considerations for dose adjustment s of their concomitant medications during 
the course of the trial. Fluid deficit should be corrected before initiation of study drug and 
as needed during treatment to avoid dehydration. 
 
9.9f Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
One case of posterior reversible encephal opathy syndrome, which ultimately resolved, 
has been reported with ixazomib. This cond ition is characterized by [CONTACT_12704], seizures 
and visual loss, as well as abrupt increase in  blood pressure. Diagnosis may be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI). If the syndrome is diagnosed or suspected, 
symptom-directed treatment should be mainta ined until the condition is reversed by

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 10.3 Assessment of Attribution 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, 
the following attribution categories are utilized: 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s). 
Events determined to be possibly, probably  or definitely attributed to a medical 
treatment suggest there is evidence to indi cate a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.  
 
10.4 AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigationa l Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on the 
SAME Arm 
 
NOTE:  The combination of an investigati onal agent with a commercial agent is 
considered investigational.  
 Routine Reporting  
 
Routine AE reporting for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies using an investigational agent /intervention in combination with a commercial agent is stated in the protocol. See Section 10.5.  
 
NOTE:  When a commercial agent(s) is (are) used on the same treatment arm as the 
investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, cellular 
product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the entire combination (arm) is then considered an inves tigational intervention for reporting. 
 
Expedited Reporting 
An AE that occurs on a combination stud y must be assessed in accordance with 
the guidelines for CTEP investigational ag ents/interventions in Section 10.4, and 
where indicated, an expedited report must be submitted. 
An AE that occurs prior to admini stration of the investigational agent/ 
intervention must be assessed as specified in the protocol. In general, only Grade 
[ADDRESS_616997] be submitted by [CONTACT_394333]. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercial agent. Ther efore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity, expedited reporting is 
required. The clinical investigator must determine severity.

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 10.411 Persistent or Significan t Disabilities/Incapacities 
Any AE that results in persistent or signifi cant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions (fo rmerly referred to as disabilities), congenital 
abnormities or birth defects, must be report ed immediately if they occur at any time 
following treatment with an agent under an I ND/IDE since they are considered to be a 
serious AE and must be reported to the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b). 
 
10.412 Death 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_616999] dose, regardless of attribution to an 
agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or 
definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_31948] 28 days of life. 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5. 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms 
benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive 
Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the 
death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression: c linical deterioration associated with a 
disease process) should be submitted. 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_617000] dose, regardless of attribution to the 
investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_617001] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 
 
10.413 Secondary Malignancy 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy 
(e.g., treatment with investigational agent/in tervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A 
secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an 
IND/IDE must be reported. Three options  are available to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chem otherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML]) 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)

10.43 Additional instructions: 
 
Special reporting requirements for Millennium  
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_128749]/or in response to an open question 
from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures. Any clin ically relevant deteriorati on in laboratory assessments or 
other clinical finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating 
a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For serious AEs, the investigator must determ ine both the intensity of the event and the 
relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) 
from the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_617002] dose of 
ixazomib. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of ixazomib treatment or 
after the designated follow-up period that the sponsor-investigator and/or sub-investigator 
considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee). In addition, new primary malignancies that occur during the follow-up periods must be reported,  regardless of causality to study regimen, 
for a minimum of three years after the last dose of the investigational product, starting 
from the first dose of study drug. All new cas es of primary malignancy must be reported 
to Millennium Pharmacovi gilance (or designee). 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128710] l are not to be considered AEs unless the 
condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or 
intercurrent illness(es). 
Since this is an investigator-initiated study,  the principal investigator, Shaji Kumar, MD, 
also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB. 
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SA Es (including serious pretreatment events) 
must also be reported in English to M illennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee): 
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
All other serious (non-fatal/non-life-threatening) events within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event 
See below for contact [CONTACT_128750]. 
The sponsor-investigator must fax or ema il the SAE Form per the timelines above. A 
sample of an SAE Form will be provided. 
 
The SAE report must include at minimum:

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
11.1  Terms and definitions 
Serum or urine M spi[INVESTIGATOR_480132] t a requirement for entry into the study. If 
present, and meets criteria for measurable di sease this will be followed for M protein 
response using IMWG uniform response criteria as described below. 
Definitions for EMD response is similar to  those used for patients with lymphoma 
(Cheson et al. Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma). EMD 
measurements should be taken from the CT  portion of the PET/CT, or MRI scans, or 
dedicated CT scans where applicable. For pa tients with only skin involvement, skin 
lesions should be measured with a ruler. M easurement of tumor size will be determined 
by [CONTACT_480163] (SPD). 
Response is based on CT alone or the CT component of PET/CT or MRI where 
applicable and the PET. 
PET/CT scans are required at baseline for all patients with EMD. 
 
• M-protein: synonyms include M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], monoclonal protein and myeloma protein, 
paraprotein, M-component. 
Serum M-protein level is quantitated using densitometry on SPEP except in cases 
where the SPEP is felt to be unreliable. 
• M-proteins migrating in the β-region (usually IgA M-proteins) 
• Cases in which the M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_212234] (some specimens >4 g/dL) that they underestimate the actual immunoglobulin level (by [CONTACT_7809] 1500 mg/dL) due to technical staining properties of the agarose gel 
• Cases in which there are multiple peaks of same monoclonal protein 
(aggregates or dimers) 
 If SPEP is not available or felt to be unr eliable (above examples) for routine M-
protein quantitation, then quantitative immunoglobulin levels derived from nephelometry or turbidometry can be accep ted. However, this must be explicitly 
reported at baseline, and only nephelometr y can be used for that patient to assess 
response. SPEP derived M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_212235]. 
Urine M-protein measurement is estimated using 24-h UPEP only. Random or 24 h 
urine tests measuring kappa and lambda light chain levels are not reliable and are not 
recommended. 
 
• FLC estimation is currently carried out using the serum FLC assay (Freelite, The 
Binding Site Limited, [LOCATION_006]). Patients with kappa/lambda FLC ratio <0.26 are defined 
as having monoclonal lambda FLC and those with ratios >1.65 as having a 
monoclonal kappa FLC. The monoclonal light  chain isotype is considered the 
involved FLC isotype, and the opposite light chain type as the uninvolved FLC type.  
• CT, PET/CT or MRI  should be performed on all patients with EMD at baseline. 
This should be repeated after 1 cycle and then every three cycles or more frequently 
if clinically indicated. The same modality should be used for serial assessment. 
MC1487 48 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020  
• Peripheral blood testing for circulating plasma cells  should be performed in all 
patients with plasma cell leukemia at baseline and after 1 cycle and every two cycles 
thereafter. Peripheral smear or flow cytome try may be used to evaluate circulating 
plasma cells, but the same modality should be used throughout the study. 
 
• Response terms:  The following response terms will be used to define M protein 
response: stringent Complete Response (s CR), complete response (CR), very good 
partial response (VGPR), partial respons e (PR), Minimal Response (MR), stable 
disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). EMD or PCL response definitions/ 
criteria are detailed below. 
In addition, for each response category, there will be an “unconfirmed” response 
category, which will be for internal use, for the purpose of guiding decision making 
and test ordering. These designations will app lied at the time of the first measurement 
at which the quantitative aspect of the response category has been satisfied without the confirmation step having been satis fied. The designation “u” will precede the 
standard abbreviations, and will include usCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR, uPD.  
 
• Measurable disease: Patients who have a measurable serum or urine M-protein.  
o Serum M-protein ≥1 g/dl  
o Urine M-protein ≥ 200 mg/24 h 
o Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≥10 mg/dl provided serum FLC ratio is 
abnormal 
o At least one plasmacytoma that has a single diameter of ≥2 cm.  
o Plasma cell count exceeding 500/microL or 5 percent of the peripheral blood 
white cells 
The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is of particular use in monitoring response to 
therapy in patients who have oligo-secretory or non-secretory disease and should be 
used in assessing response only if th e baseline serum and/or urine M proteins 
are not “measurable” as above, and the baseline level of the involved FLC is “measurable.” When using this assay, it is important to note that the FLC levels 
vary considerably with changes in re nal function and in patients with renal 
insufficiency, the levels of both the kappa and lambda may remain elevated, but the 
ratio normalizes with achievement of CR. Thus, both the level of the involved and 
the uninvolved FLC isotype (i.e., the involved/uninvolved ratio or involved-uninvolved difference) should be considered in assessing response. Patients included 
on the study on the basis of FLC alone (i.e., no measurable serum/urine m-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]) should be the only ones who are evaluated using FLC response criteria. The others 
should follow usual criteria and ignore FLC results with the exception of defining 
stringent complete response. 
• Evaluable disease : Patients who do not have a “measurable” serum M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], serum 
free light chain, or urine M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531]. 
• Oligosecretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had 
“measurable” serum M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_357671] M-spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], but has had a detectable monoclonal 
protein in his/her serum and/or urine and/or measurable serum free light chain.  
• Non-secretory myeloma:  Patient with multiple myeloma who has NEVER had a 
detectable monoclonal protein in his/her serum and/or urine.

1  Immunofixation studies of both serum and urine  are required to document CR 
regardless of registration values, and in addition FLC  measurement and bone marrow 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_128711]. SPEP and UPEP are required to 
document VGPR regardless of registration values. 
2  For serum measurable patients, 24 hour urine does not need to be confirmed (i.e. 
repeated after documented response) for any response category 
3  Bone marrow biopsy results do not need to  be confirmed (i.e. repeated after 
documented response). 
11.3 Confirmed response  
In order to be classified as an M protein response, confirmation of serum monoclonal 
protein, serum immunoglobulin free light chain (when primary determinant of response) 
and urine monoclonal protein (when primary de terminant of response) results must be 
made by [CONTACT_99964]. 
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128712], 
except for patients with evaluable disease only, where a bone marrow is required 
to document all response categories including progression. However, a second 
confirmatory bone marrow is not required to confirm response in any case. 
• Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; 
however, if radiographic studies were perfo rmed there should be no evidence of 
progressive or new bone lesions. 
Appropriate tests required to document and confirm response are listed in Table 11.2 
11.4 Bone progression:  
Caution must be exercised to avoid rating pr ogression or relapse on the basis of variation 
of radiologic technique alone. Compression fracture does not exclude continued response and may not indicate progression. When progression is based on skeletal disease alone, it should be discussed with the Study Chair befo re removing the patient from the study.

lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiogra phic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. Bone marrow assessments need not be confirme d. Each category, except for stable disease, will have 
a working subcategory of “unconfirmed” [prefix ‘u”] to designate first time point at which response category MAY 
have been achieved if confirmed.

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 b Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the k/  ratio. An abnormal k/  ratio by [CONTACT_317438]/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting 
presence of an abnormal clone is k/  of >4:1 or <1;2.  
c Positive immunofixation alone in a patient previously classified as CR will not be considered progression. 
d Progressive disease should be confirmed.  However, treatment may be discontinued for progressive disease that is 
unconfirmed per physician discretion. In this case, an obje ctive status of PD should be entered on the measurement 
form and progressive disease should be reported on the event monitoring form. 
e Does not apply to EMD or PCL  
f In the case where a value is felt to be a spurious result per physician discretion (for example, a possible lab error),

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 15.0 Drug Information 
15.1 Ixazomib (MLN9708, Ninlaro®) 
15.11 Background 
Ixazomib (MLN9708) is a second-generation sm all molecule inhibitor of the 20S 
proteasome that is under development for the treatment of non-hematologic 
malignancies, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. 
Ixazomib ( MLN2238) refers to the biologically active, boronic acid form of the drug 
substance, ixazomib citrate (MLN9708). The transition to MLN2238 occurs in any 
aqueous system. 
15.[ADDRESS_617006] formulation consists of drug substance, microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and magn esium stearate. Seven different capsule 
strengths are manufactured: 0.2, 0.5, 2.0, 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 mg; each capsule 
strength has a unique color. Dosage strength is stated as ixazomib (the active 
boronic acid). Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules are individually packaged in blisters. 
Matching placebo capsules have been manufact ured for the 2.3, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.5 
mg ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules. The placebo capsules contain 
microcrystalline cellulose, talc, and magnesi um stearate and are identical in color 
and size to the corresponding active dose. 
15.13 Preparation and storage  
Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules (0.2 mg, 0.5 mg, 2 mg), individually packaged in blisters, can be stored at 2ºC to 8ºC or “Do not store above 25ºC. Do not freeze.” Ixazomib capsules (2.3 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, and 5.5 mg), individually packaged in 
blisters, can be stored at “2ºC - 8ºC”  or “Do not store above 25ºC. Do not 
freeze.”  
Ixazomib that is dispensed to the patient  for take-home dosing should remain in 
the blister packaging until the point of use.  The investigative site is responsible 
for providing the medication to the patient in the correct daily dose 
configurations. Capsules should remain in  the blisters until the point of use. 
Ixazomib capsules must be administered as intact capsules and must not be 
opened or manipulated in any way. Comprehensive instructions should be provided to the patient in order to ensure compliance with dosing procedures. Patients will be instructed to store the medication in the refrigerator until the time 
of use. Reconciliation will occur accordingl y when the patient returns for their 
next cycle of therapy. Returned unused capsules should be discarded in a proper biohazard container. 
Ixazomib is an anticancer drug. As with other potentially toxic compounds, 
caution should be exercised when handling ixazomib. It is recommended to wear gloves and protective garments during pr eparation when dispensed in clinic. 
Please refer to published guidelines regardi ng the proper handling and disposal of 
anticancer agents. 
15.14 Administration Ixazomib (MLN9708) capsules must be admi nistered as intact capsules and are 
not intended to be opened or manipulated  in any way. Capsules should be taken 
on an empty stomach with approximately 8 oz (1 cup) of water at least [ADDRESS_617007] 2 hours after food. 
MC1487 58 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient  has had a serious allergic reaction to 
boron or boron containing products. 
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information 
a) Absorption: After oral dosing, ixazomi b is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median 
Tmax of 1 hour. The lack of a discernible relationship between BSA and ixazomib 
clearance over a relatively wide BSA range (1.4-2.6 m2) indicates that total 
systemic exposure (AUC) following fixed dosing should be independent of the 
individual patient’s BSA. A high-fat meal decreased both the rate and extent of 
absorption. Therefore, ixazomib should be  administered on an empty stomach.  
b) Distribution: The steady state volume of distribution is large and is estimated to be 543 L. Ixazomib is 88-94% protein bound. 
c) Metabolism:  Metabolism is the primary route for elimination of ixazomib by 
[CONTACT_128765]-CYP enzymes. CYP3A4 and 1A2 comprise the major CYP isozymes that contribute to ixazomib metabolism. 
d) Excretion: The mean terminal half- life is 9.[ADDRESS_617008] for ixazomib. Dosing adjustment is not required in 
patients with mild and moderate  renal impairment in studies. 
However, in a dedicated renal impairment study (C16015), unbound AUC0-last was 38% higher in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function. Accordingly, a reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment  and ESRD requiring dialysis. Unbound 
systemic exposures of ixazomib are 27% higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as compared to patients with normal hepatic function.  
A reduced starting dose of ixazomib is recommended for patients with moderate 
or severe hepatic impairment. 
15.[ADDRESS_617009] were reduced in the presence of rifampin by [CONTACT_3450] 54% and 74%, respectively. As a result, the coadministration of strong CYP3A inducers with ixazomib is not recommended.  Ixazomib is neither a time-
dependent nor reversible inhibitor of CYPs  1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 
3A4/5, therefore the potential for ix azomib to produce DDIs via CYP isozyme 
inhibition is low. Ixazomib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4/5 
activity. The potential for ixazomib to cause DDIs with substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, MATE-1, MATE2-K, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, and OATPs is 
low. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ixazomib coadministered with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone (LenDex), are similar to those observed when ixazomib is administered as a single agent. This sugg ests that there is no readily apparent 
effect of coadministration of lenalidomid e and dexamethasone on the clinical PK 
of ixazomib. 
MC1487 59 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 Ixazomib should not be taken if the patient has had a serious allergic 
reaction to boron or boron containing products. 
15.17 Known potential toxicities  
See the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for more complete 
information including potential risks, as well as recommendations for clinical monitoring and medical management of toxicity.  Very common ( ≥10%): anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, decreased appetite, 
dizziness, peripheral neuropathy 
Common ( ≥1% to <10%):  Herpes zoster, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
erythema, rash, erythematous rash, pr uritic rash, macular rash, peripheral 
edema, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], back pain, maculo-papular rash, popular rash 
Uncommon ( ≥0.1% to <1%): generalized pruritis, generalized rash 
Herpes zoster – antiviral prophylaxis should be considered in patients 
being treated with ixazomib to d ecrease the risk of herpes zoster 
reactivation. Rare but serious risks – intestinal obstruction, pneumonia,  life-
threatening severe skin rash (Steven Johnson syndrome, TEN, DRESS syndrome), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, tumor lysis syndrome, renal failure, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, transverse 
myelitis, progressive multifo cal leukoencephalopathy. 
Overdose-  There is no known specific antidote for ixazomib overdose. In 
the event of an overdose in blinded studies, study medication assignment 
should be unblinded immediately. Th e clinician should consider admitting 
the patient to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128722], monitoring for adverse drug 
reaction, monitoring of vital signs, and appropriate supportive care. Gavage may be considered, but it s hould be kept in mind that ixazomib 
absorption is rapid. Ixazomib is not readily dialyzable.

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 15.2 Pomalidomide (Pomalyst ®, CC-4047)  
Please consult the most current Investigator’s  Brochure and package insert for complete 
drug information. 
15.21 Background: Pomalidomide (CC-4047) is a novel drug in the class of 
immunomodulatory agents known as IMiDs compounds. Pomalidomide binds to its molecular target cereblon (CRBN), a protein that is part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is responsible for the poly-ubiquitination of substrate 
proteins, targeting them for subcellular redistribution and destruction by [CONTACT_137482]. The pharmacologic properties of pomalidomide are of potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of  various hematologic neoplasms (such as 
multiple myeloma and myeloproliferative neoplasm-associated myelofibrosis), 
non-neoplastic hematologic disorders (such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell 
disease) and non-hematologic disorders such as systemic sclerosis, as well as 
solid tumor neoplasms. 
15.22 Formulation: Pomalidomide (CC-4047) capsules can be 0.5-mg gelatin capsules 
(size 4 reddish brown), 1-mg hard gelati n capsules (size 4 reddish brown), 2-mg 
(size 2 reddish-brown), 3-mg and 4-mg hard gelatin capsules (size 2 reddish-
brown), and 5-mg hard gelatin capsules (size 1 reddish-brown), containing 
pomalidomide, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, and sodium stearyl fumarate. 
Pomalidomide (CC-4047) capsules are supplied in high density polyethylene 
(HDPE) containers fitted with induction seals and child-resistant plastic closures 
or PVC/PCTFE blister with push-through foil. 
15.23 Preparation and storage : Store drug at controlled room temperature, between 
68-77 ºF (20-25ºC) or as indicated on the manufacturer’s label. The expi[INVESTIGATOR_480139].  
Only enough study drug for one cycle of therapy (one month) may be dispensed. 
15.24 Administration:  Pomalidomide is administered by [CONTACT_480166]. Pomali domide should be taken without food, at 
least [ADDRESS_617011] study staff immediately. 
15.25 Pharmacokinetic information :  
a) Absorption – oral absorption has been moderately rapid with first dose- Cmax 
occurring in 1.5 to 4 hrs. More than 70% of the pomalidomide dose is absorbed 
in humans. A high fat meal decreased th e rate of absorption but had minimal 
effect on overall extent of absorption; therefore drug may be administered without regard to food intake. b) Distribution – Apparent volume of distribution in healthy subjects ranged from 74-138 L across a dose range of 1 to 10 mg daily. Pomalidomide protein binding in human plasma is low to moderate (15.8% for R-enantiomer, 42.2% for S-
enantiomer) and the binding is concentra tion independent in the concentration 
range of 30 and 1000 ng/mL. Drug distributes into semen. 
MC1487 61 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 c) Metabolism - Eight metabolites were detected in plasma, each at exposures 
<10% of the plasma pomalidomide. CYP-dependent metabolites accounted for approximately 43% of the excreted radioactivity, while non-CYP dependent 
hydrolytic metabolites accounted for 25%, and excretion of unchanged 
pomalidomide accounted for 10%. d) Excretion – In healthy patients, 72.8% of the dose was recovered in urine and 15.5% was recovered in feces. Less than 3 % of the dose is excreted as unchanged pomalidomide in the urine. The geometric mean terminal elimination 
was approximately 7.5 hours. 
15.26 Potential Drug Interactions : Pomalidomide is partially metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2 
and CYP3A. Pomalidomide is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). 
Coadministration of pomalidomide with the strong CYP3A4/5 and P-gp inhibitor 
ketoconazole, or the strong CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_617012] on exposure to pomalidom ide.  Coadministration of the strong 
CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine with pomalidomide increased mean exposure to pomalidomide by 125% compared to pomalidomide alone. If strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 are coadministered with pomalidomide, the pomalidomide dose by [CONTACT_128770] 50%. 
Smoking: Administration of pomalidomid e in smokers, with smoking tobacco 
known to induce the CYP1A2 isoform, ha d no clinically relevant effect on 
exposure to pomalidomide relative to that exposure to pomalidomide observed in 
non-smokers. 
Dexamethasone: Co-administration of multiple doses of 4 mg pomalidomide 
with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone (a w eak inducer of CYP3A) to patients with 
multiple myeloma had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide 
compared with pomalidomide administered alone.

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 
16.1 Overview 
This is a phase II study of a novel regi men of ixazomib with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone for treatment of multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease and 
plasma cell leukemia. The study is designed to assess the confirmed response rate using a 
single stage phase II study design with an interim analysis. Accrual will be halted after 6 patients to assess safety (see Section 16.4). We do not plan to halt accrual during the interim analysis (see Section 16.214). 
16.11 Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of  this trial is the rate of confirmed 
response. A confirmed response is define d as a patient who has achieved an sCR, 
CR, VGPR, or PR on two consecutive evaluations. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria, who have signed a c onsent form and have begun treatment, 
will be evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
16.2 Statistical Design 
16.21 Decision Rule: The largest success pr oportion where the proposed treatment 
regimen would be considered ineffectiv e in this population is 25%, and the 
smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient popul ation is 50%. The following one–stage 
design with an interim analysis is based on a two-stage Simon optimum design and requires [ADDRESS_617013] 25%. 
16.211 Interim Analysis: Enter [ADDRESS_617014] 3, we will continue accrual. 
16.212  Final Decision Rule: Enter an additional [ADDRESS_617015] 10, this will be considered evidence of promising activity and the treatment may be recommended for further testing in subsequent studies in this population.  
16.213 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128724]. Analyses involving over accrued patients are discussed in Section 16.313. 
16.214 NOTE: We will not suspend accrual at  the interim analysis to allow the 
first 10 patients to become evaluable,  unless undue toxicity is observed.  
Given the limited overall sample size and the inclusion of an adverse 
events stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we feel it is ethical to not halt accrual for the interim analysis. However, if accrual is extremely rapid, we may temporarily suspend accrual in order to obtain safety data on these patients before re-opening accrual to further patients. 
 
MC1487 66 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 16.22 Sample Size: The one stage study design with an interim analysis to be used is 
fully described below. A minimum of 10 and a maximum of 27 evaluable 
patients will be accrued onto this phase II study unless undue toxicity is 
encountered. We anticipate accruing additional 3 patients to account for 
ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons for a total of 30 patients overall. 
16.23 Accrual Rate and Study Duration: The an ticipated accrual rate is 1-[ADDRESS_617016] 6 months. 
16.24 Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes is 
binomially distributed, the significance level is .10, i.e. there is a 10% chance of finding the drug to be effective when it truly is not. The probability of declaring 
that this regimen warrants further study (i.e. statistical power) and the probability 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480140] a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following table. 
 
If the true success proportion is... 0.25  0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 
Then the probability of declaring that the regimen warrants further study is… 0.10 0.24 0.44 0.64 0.80 0.90 
And the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480141]… 0.53 0.38 0.26 0.17 0.10 0.05 
 
16.25 Other considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns 
of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken in to account in any decision to terminate 
the study. 
 
16.3 Analysis Plan 
The analysis for this trial will commence at planned time points (see 16.2) and at the time the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. The Statistician and Study 
Chair will make the decision, in accord w ith CCS Standard Operating Procedures, 
availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory correlates), and the level of data maturity. It is anticipated that the ear liest date in which the results will be made 
available via manuscript, abstract, or presentation format is when last patient has been 
followed for at least 6 months. 
16.31 Primary Outcome Analyses: 
16.311 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of the 
confirmed response rate. A success is defined as an sCR, CR, VGPR, or 
PR noted as the objective status on two consecutive evaluations. All 
patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form 
and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response, unless they are determined to be a major violation. 
16.312 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_128771]. Ninety-
MC1487 67 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 five percent confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be 
calculated according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. 
16.313 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the 
additional patients will not be used to  evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128725]; however, they will be included in final point estimates and confidence intervals. 
16.[ADDRESS_617017] date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause. The distribution of progression-free survival will be 
estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. 
16.323 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will 
be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The 
maximum grade for each type of adve rse event will be recorded for each 
patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine patterns. 
Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration. 
16.[ADDRESS_617018] binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true MRD negative rate will be calculated. 
16.[ADDRESS_617019] cycle of treatment that is possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study treatment and that meets one of the following: 
MC1487 68 Addendum 7 
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 • Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue lasting > 3 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_480142] 
• Any other ≥Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity with the exceptions of electrolyte 
abnormalities that are reversible and asymptomatic 
• Febrile neutropenia 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding • Any ≥Grade 4 neutrophil count decreased or platelet count decreased that persists 
>7 days 
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
16.51 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at 
least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems 
that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clin ic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible  for reviewing accrual and safety data 
for this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_128775]. 
16.52 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_480143]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduc t of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profil es that have not crossed the specified 
rule below. 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly rela ted to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as “possible, ” “probable,” or “definite”) that satisfy 
one of the following: 
• if [ADDRESS_617020] possibly related to treatment. 
• if after the first [ADDRESS_617021] been treated, 30% of all patients experience a grade [ADDRESS_617022] possibly related to treatment.  
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment-related adverse event. 
16.[ADDRESS_617023] been  registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” 
website. The Primary and Secondary Endpoints along with other required information for this study will be reported on www.ClinicalTrials.gov . For purposes of timing of the 
Results Reporting, the initial estimated comp letion date for the Primary Endpoint of this 
study is 2.5 years after the study opens to accrual. The definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the time the last patient registered has been 
followed for at least 6 months.

FCBP: 
1. I verified that the required pregnancy tests performed are negative.  
2. I counselled FCBP regarding the following: 
• Potential risk of fetal exposure to pomalidomide: If pomalidomide is taken during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or deat h to any unborn baby. Females are advised to 
avoid pregnancy while taking pomalidomide. Th e teratogenic potential of pomalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out. FCBP must agree not to become pregnant while taking pomalidomide.  
• Using TWO reliable methods of birth control at the same time or complete abstinence from heterosexual contact [at least 28 days prior to therapy, during therapy, during dose 
interruption and 28 days after discontinuation of study drug]. 
• That even if she has amenorrhea she must  comply with advice on contraception.

methods of contraception:  
− Highly effective methods: 
o Intrauterine device (IUD) 
o Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants) 
o Tubal ligation 
o Partner’s vasectomy 
− Additional effective methods: o Male condom 
o Diaphragm 
o Cervical Cap 
• Pregnancy tests before and during treatment, even if the patient agrees not to have 
reproductive heterosexual contact. Two pregnancy tests will be performed prior to receiving 
study drug, one within 10-14 days and the second within 24 hours of the start of study drug. 
• Frequency of pregnancy tests to be done: 
− Every week during the first [ADDRESS_617029] every 28 days 
during the patient’s participation in this study if menstrual cycles are regular or every 14 
days if cycles are irregular. 
− If the patient missed a period or has unusual menstrual bleeding. 
− When the patient is discontinued from the study and at day 28 after study drug 
discontinuation if menstrual cycles are regular. If menstrual cycles are irregular, pregnancy tests will be done at discontinua tion from the study and at days 14 and 28 
after study drug discontinuation. 
• Stop taking study drug immediately in the event of becoming pregnant and to call their study doctor as soon as possible.  
• NEVER share study drug with anyone else. 
• Do not donate blood while taking study drug and for 28 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]. 
• Do not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_117209] 28 days after study

Please read this Pomalidomide Information Sheet before you start taking study drug and each time you 
get a new supply. This Pomalidomide Information Sheet does not take the place of an informed consent 
to participate in clinical research or talking to  your study doctor or healthcare provider about your 
medical condition or your treatment.  
What is the most important information I should know about pomalidomide? 
1. Pomalidomide may cause birth defects (deformed babies) or death of an unborn baby.  
Pomalidomide is similar to the medicine thali domide. It is known that thalidomide causes life-
threatening birth defects. Pomalidomide has not been tested in pregnant women but may also cause birth defects. Pomalidomide was found to cause birth defects when tested in pregnant 
rabbits. If you are a female who is able to become pregnant:  
• Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant 
• You must either not have any sexual relations with a man or use two reliable, separate 
forms of effective birth control at the same time:  
− for 28 days before starting study drug 
− while taking study drug  
− during dose interruptions of study drug  
− for 28 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743]  
• You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times: 
− within 10 – [ADDRESS_617030] dose of study drug  
− weekly for the first 28 days 
− every [ADDRESS_617031] irregular menstrual 
periods 
− if you miss your period or ha ve unusual menstrual bleeding 
− [ADDRESS_617032] dose of study drug ([ADDRESS_617033] dose if menstrual periods are irregular) 
• Stop taking study drug if you become pregnant during treatment 
− If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study, you must stop study drug 
immediately and immediately inform your st udy doctor. The study doctor will report all 
cases of pregnancy to Celgene Corporation.  
• Do not breastfeed while taking study drug  
• The study doctor will be able to advise you where to get additional advice on contraception. 
If you are a female not of childbearing potential: 
In order to ensure that an unborn baby [CONTACT_403357], your study doctor will 
confirm that you are not able to become pregnant. 
If you are a male: 
MC1487 82  
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 The effect of pomalidomide on sperm development is not known and has not been studied. The 
risk to the foetus in females of child bear ing potential whose male partner is receiving 
pomalidomide is unknown at this time.  
1. Male patients (including those who have had a vasectomy) must either not have any 
sexual relations with a pregnant female or a female who can become pregnant, or 
must use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a pregnant female or a female that can 
become pregnant: 
o While you are taking study drug  
o During dose interruptions of study drug

1. Why are you being asked to take part in this research study? 
 
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with a type of 
blood cancer called “multiple myelom a” that requires treatment. 
 About 30 people will take part  in this research study.  
  
 
2. Why is this research study being done? 
 
 You are being asked to take part in this research study because your multiple myeloma has gotten worse and is not responding to the standard drugs for multiple myeloma. 
 In this study, you will be treate d with an investigational dr ug called ixazomib (MLN9708), in 
addition to the standard regimen of pomali domide and dexamethasone . It is thought that 
ixazomib will interfere w ith the process of protein breakdown in the multiple myeloma cells. The 
drug used in this study is consider ed investigational, which means it has either not been approved 
by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for routin e clinical use or for the use described in 
this study. This study is being done  to find out what effects (good and bad) the ixazomib has on 
you and your Multiple Myeloma.   
 
3. Information you should know

Protocol version date: 30Mar2020  
 POTENTIAL DISCOMFORTS AND RISKS OF IXAZOMIB 
 
Based on early studies of ixazomib, it is possible to predict some of the discomforts and risks. 
The data suggest that the potential risks of ix azomib are likely to be manageable if monitored 
and treated. However, risks could become serious and potentially life-thre atening. It is possible 
that ixazomib may cause side effects that were not s een in animal studies or yet seen in patients.  
 
 Common risks of ixazomib (events occurring greater than 20% of the time) 
• Feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) 
• Throwing up (vomiting) 
• Loose stools (diarrhea) 
• Constipation 
• Feeling tired or weak 
• Decreased number of blood cells (platelets) th at help to clot th e blood, which could put 
you at increased risk of bleeding (thrombocytopenia) 
• Swelling of extremities 
• Fever 
• Decrease in red blood cells, which are the oxygen carrying cells which could make you 
feel tired (anemia) 
• A low number of white blood cells, which are the infection fighting cells, which could 
put you at risk for infection (neutropenia) 
• Infection including shingles 
• Skin rash 
• A low number of a particular white blood cell,  which is important to the immune system 
(lymphopenia) 
• Numbness and tingling (also known as peripheral neuropathy) 
 
Less likely risks of ixazomib (events occurring less than or  equal to 20% of the time) 
• Decreased appetite (not fee ling hungry, not wanting to eat)

• A painful blistery red rash that is confined to one side of the body, similar to chicken pox 
(shingles - herpes zoster) 
• Effects on your nervous system that may cause  painful feelings or numbness or tingling 
in hands and feet. The nerves that control th ings like your heart rate, gut movement, and 
urinary bladder may be affected.

called uric acid, phosphorus, potassium, creatin ine, and calcium. Severe tumor lysis can 
result in kidney failure and may harm m
uscle or nerve function (Tumor lysis syndrome) 
• High creatinine and renal failure. The amount of creatinine (a wa ste product made by 
[CONTACT_39625]) in your blood helps your doctor understand how your kidneys are working. 
High creatinine means your kidneys  are having trouble working well.  Patients who had 
lost body water because of vomiti ng and/or loose stools have ha d high levels of creatinine 
indicating that the kidneys were  failing to function adequately . In some severe situations, 
less kidney function may require temporary treatment with a machine that supports the 
function of the kidney (dialysis).

 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML ) has been reported with ixazomib in an 
oncology patient who had previously  received a medication associated with PML. PML is a rare, 
serious infection of the brain that is caused by a virus. Persons with a weakened immune system 
may develop PML. PML can result in death or severe disability. It is not known whether ixazomib may have contributed to the development PML in this patient.

unknown risks to the baby. If you may be able to  have children, you will be given a pregnancy 
test at screening, and if the result is positive,  you will not be able to be in the study. If you are 
sexually active, and able to have children, you an d your partner must use two (2) highly effective 
forms of birth control throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_617037]  dose of study drugs.  
 
Acceptable non-hormonal birth control methods include:  
• Total sexual abstinence. Abstinence must be for the total dur ation of the study i.e. from 
when you sign the informed consent form (ICF)  until [ADDRESS_617038] dose of study 
drugs 
• Male sexual partner who has undergone a vasectomy plus male condom with spermicide. (You will need to confirm th at your partner’s sperm was tested after the vasectomy 
procedure and that he was confirmed to be sterile.) 
• Tubal occlusion plus male condom with spermicide  
• Intrauterine Device (IUD) plus male condom with spermicide 
 Acceptable hormonal methods include:  
• Etonogestrel implants (e.g., Implanon®, Norpla n®) plus male condom with spermicide 
• Normal and low dose combined oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_480149] 
• Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol (EE) tr ansdermal system plus male condom with 
spermicide 
• Intravaginal device (e.g., EE and etonogestrel) plus male condom with spermicide 
• Cerazette® (desogestrel) plus male condom with spermicide. (Cerazette® is currently the 
only highly efficacious pr ogesterone based pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].) 
 
You should discuss with your study doctor whic h birth control methods are considered 
acceptable. 
 
A pregnancy test can be wrong. If you become pre gnant or think you may be pregnant during the 
study, stop taking study capsules and contact [CONTACT_39635]’s office immediately. You will be 
asked to withdraw from the study. You must not  be breast-feeding an infant during the study.

experience unexpected side effects or be at ri sk for symptoms, illnesses, and/or complications 
that could not be predicted. Tell your study docto r or study staff right away if you have any 
problems.  Many side effects go away shortly after the st udy drugs are stopped, but in some cases side 
effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away . There may be a risk of death. Some 
MC1487 96  
Protocol version date: 30Mar2020 side effects may not be known. Side effects may range from mild to life-threatening. Other drugs

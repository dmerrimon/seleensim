Study 
Population  Male and female subjects, 18 through 80  years of age (inclusive), with pain that is moderate 
or severe on the verbal categorical rating scale (VRS) and ≥4 on the NPRS after a 
bunionectomy  
  
Investigational 
Drug  Active substance: VX -548 
Activity: voltage -gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na V1.8) inhibitor  
Strength and route of administration: 50-mg tablets and matching placebo for oral 
administration  
  
Reference Drug  Active substance: HB/APAP  
Activity: opi[INVESTIGATOR_351564]: 5-mg/325 -mg capsules (over -encapsulated tablets) and 
matching placebo for oral administration 
  
Study Duration  Excluding the Screening Visit, each subject will participate in the study for 4  days plus a 
Safety Follow -up Visit 14  ± [ADDRESS_890396] dose of study drug.  
  
Study Design  This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3 -arm, parallel study design 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX -548 in treating acute pain after a bunionectomy 
(Figure  2-1). 
On Day - 1, subjects will undergo a primary unilateral bunionectomy with distal first 
metatarsal osteotomy (i.e., Austin procedure) and internal fixation under regional anesthesia (Mayo and popliteal sciatic block). A continuous popliteal sciatic block infu sion 
(0.2%  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) will be started after surgery and remain in place until approximately 
3AM, but no later than 5AM, on Day 1. After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups if: (1) the subject re quests the first dose of 
study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_890397] will not be eligible for 
this study.  
Approximately 1000 subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX -548 
([ADDRESS_890398] dose, then 50 mg every  12 hours [q12h]), HB/APAP (5 mg/325 mg every 
6 hours [q6h]; opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]), or placebo ( Table  2-1). Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_660314] (<8 versus ≥8). To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the 
same number of tablets and capsules q6h in a double -dummy design.

HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; NPRS: numeric pain rating scale; VRS:  verbal 
categorical rating scale 
Notes: After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups if: (1) the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the subject’s pain 
is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the sub ject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_890399] dose, then 50 mg q12h  400 
HB/APAP  5 mg/325  mg q6h  400 
Placebo  – 200 
HB/APAP:  hydrocodone bitartrate/acetaminophen; q6h: every 6 hours; q12h: every 12 hours  
Notes: To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and capsules in a 
double -dummy design. VX -548 active or VX -548 placebo tablets will be administered to all 
subjects q12h as follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 12, 24, and [ADDRESS_890400] dose of 
study drug. HB/APAP active or HB/APAP placebo capsules will be administered to all subjects 
q6h as follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and [ADDRESS_890401] dose of study drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the 
NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
Ibuprofen ( 400 mg orally q6h as needed) is permitted as a rescue medication for pain relief 
upon the subject’s request starting any time after the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_890402] rescue medication,  and subjects should generally not receive 
rescue medication unless their NPRS score is ≥4 . 
  
Assessments  Efficacy:  NPRS, use of rescue medications, and PGA of study drug  
Safety: AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, standard 
12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations  
Other:  DNA blood sample (optional) and PK parameters of VX -[ADDRESS_890403] size of 0.40 for VX -548 compared to placebo and 0.25 for 
VX-548 compared to HB/APAP, 338 evaluable subjects per group for VX -548 and 
HB/APAP and 169 evaluable subjects for placebo will provide more than 90% power for the 
prim ary endpoint of VX -548 versus placebo on SPID48 and 90% power for the key 
secondary endpoint of VX -548 versus HB/APAP on SPID48, based on 2 -sample t-tests with

1000 subjects are planned to be enrolled.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
The model will include SPID48 as the dependent variable and treatment as a fixed effect, with site and baseline NPRS as covariates. If the model estimation does not co nverge, then 
site will be removed from the model. The least squares mean difference from placebo for VX-548 will be provided along with the 95% CI and P value.

Voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (Na

this assertion arises from (1)  evaluation of the role Na V1.8 plays in normal physiology11-15, 
(2) pathological states arising from mutations in the Na V1.8 gene ( SCN10A )16, 17, (3) animal 
models18-21, and (4) pharmacology of known Na V1.8-modulating agents.22-24 In addition, because

abuse liability associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_218947]. Therefore, targeting the underlying biology of pain through selective Na
V1.8 inhibition represents a scientific approach to analgesic drug 
development that has the potential to address an urgent unmet need for safe and effective acute and chronic pain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_660309]. 
VX-548 is being developed for the treatment of pain. VX-548 is a Na
V1.8 inhibitor that is highly 
selective for Na V1.8 relative to other Na V channels. Clinical data from Phase 1 studies in healthy 
subjects and Phase 2 proof-of- concept studies in subjects with moderate to severe acute pain 
demonstrate that VX -548 is generally safe and well tolerated. Refer to the VX -548 Investigator’s 
Brochure for additional details.25

9 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, parallel study design evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX-548 in treating acute pain after a bunionectomy (Figure 9-1).  
On Day - 1, subjects will undergo a primary unilateral bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal 
osteotomy (i.e., Austin procedure) and internal fixation under regional anesthesia (Mayo and popliteal sciatic block). A continuous popliteal sciatic block infusion (0.2%  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) will be 
started after surgery and remain in place until approximately 3AM, but no later than 5AM, on Day 1. After removal of the popliteal sciatic block, a subject will be randomized to 1 of 
Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.0 Page 23 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  3 treatment groups if: (1) the subject requests the first dose of study drug for pain relief, (2) the 
subject’s pain is moderate or severe on the VRS, and (3) the subject’s pain is ≥[ADDRESS_890446] will not be eligible for this study.  
Approximately 1000 subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX-548 ([ADDRESS_890447] dose, then 50 mg every  12 hours [q12h]), HB/APAP (5 mg/325 mg every 6 hours [q6h]; 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]), or placebo ( Table 9-1). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_660316] (<8 versus ≥8). To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and capsules q6h in a double-dummy design.

Notes: To maintain the blind, all subjects will receive the same number of tablets and capsules in a 
double -dummy design. VX -548 active or VX -548 placebo tablets will be administered to all subjects q12h as 
follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 12, 24, and [ADDRESS_890449] dose of study drug. HB/APAP active or HB/APAP placebo capsules will be administered to all subjects q6h as follows: 0 hours (first dose) and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and [ADDRESS_890450] dose of study drug. In addition, pain intensity will be recorded on the NPRS immediately before each administration of rescue medication.  
Ibuprofen ( 400 mg orally q6h as needed [prn] ) is permitted as a rescue medication for pain relief 
upon the subject’s request starting any time after the first dose of study drug through [ADDRESS_890451] rescue medication, and subjects should generally not receive rescue medication unless their NPRS score is ≥4 . 
9.1.1  Screening 
All study periods will be conducted as described in Section 9.1. 
Screening Visit through Admission  
Assessments from the Screening Visit through admission (pre-procedure) are listed in Table 3-1. 
The Screening Visit will occur within 27  days before the scheduled bunionectomy procedure and 
may occur in the clinic or as a home health visit with a qualified visiting nurse if permitted by [CONTACT_427]. The investigator (or an appropriate authori zed designee at the study site) will 
obtain informed consent from each subject in person or remotely (Section 13.2.3) before performing any study-related procedure. If needed, Screening Visit assessments may be performed on different days within the visit window. 
To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions 
(Section  9.4).  
At the Screening Visit, subjects will receive trainings on appropriate expectations around their participation in a clinical study, placebo response reduction, and the importance of accurately reporting their post-procedural pain. On Day  -1 (pre-procedure), these trainings will be repeated. 
Additional review of these educational materials may be repeated for some or all subjects, as needed.  
Surgical Procedure Through Randomization  
Assessments from the surgical procedure through randomization are listed in Table 3-2. 
VRS will be completed upon request for the first dose of study drug for pain relief after removal 
of the popliteal sciatic block. NPRS will be completed after VRS only if the subject’s pain is rated moderate or severe on the VRS. If a subject does not meet the VRS and NPRS criteria (Section  8.1) within [ADDRESS_890452] will not be 
eligible for this study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repetition of Screening Assessment(s)  
Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, 
unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolysis of sample, equipment error). In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rescreening  
Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following exceptions: 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g.,  upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_351574]) in the [ADDRESS_890453] dose of study drug that was properly 
evaluated and which resolved fully 
• Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation within the allotted screening window

9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Approximately 1000 subjects  will be randomized 2:2:1 to 3 treatment groups: VX-548, 
HB/APAP (opi[INVESTIGATOR_351565]), or placebo. The randomization ratio of 2:2:[ADDRESS_890462] number. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_660314] (<8 versus ≥8). 
An interactive web or voice response system (IXRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. 
The randomization code will be produced by [CONTACT_14448] a qualified randomization vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the production of the final randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician who is not a member of the Study Team.  
9.3 Rationale for Study Elements  
9.3.1  Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm, parallel study design evaluating the efficacy and safety of VX-548 in treating acute pain after a bunionectomy. 
Bunionectomy is a well -established, multi-dose, surgical, acute pain model. A randomized, 
double-blind study design was selected to avoid observer bias and reduce symptoms or outcomes 
arising from the subjects’ knowledge of treatment. A parallel design is considered most appropriate given the acute nature of bunionectomy surgery. 
An opi[INVESTIGATOR_660310] a standard -of-care treatment (HB/APAP 5 mg/325 mg q6h) 
was included to establish the ability of the study, as executed, to successfully observe a treatment effect.  
Following a standard study design, subjects will be randomized after removal of the popliteal sciatic block and after the subject’s pain meets the pain threshold criteria. The pain threshold criteria are designed to ensure subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the drug is effective. 
Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.[ADDRESS_890463] dose (loading dose), then 50 mg q12h was selected 
based on favorable safety and PK data from healthy subjects and subjects with pain after bunionectomy or abdominoplasty. Exposures at the selected VX-548 dose are predicted to achieve Na
V1.8 inhibition levels of approximately 90% by 2 hours after administration of the 
100 mg loading dose. Exposures corresponding to approximately IC 90 are sustained with the 
administration of 50 mg q12h maintenance doses starting 12 hours after the loading dose. 
The duration of dosing (48 hours) is a standard duration for postsurgical, acute pain models and 
is of sufficient length to assess efficacy and safety.  
9.3.3  Rationale for Study Assessments  
VRS:  A 4-point VRS (none, mild, moderate, or severe) is included as part of the pain threshold 
inclusion criterion to ensure that all subjects have moderate or severe pain at baseline, which ensures subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the study drug is effective.  
NPRS: NPRS is frequently used in bunionectomy studies and is recognized by [CONTACT_4760] a valid pain intensity measure.
28 Pain rated ≥4 on an 11-point (0 to 10) NPRS at baseline ensures 
subjects have sufficient pain to determine if the study drug is effective. 
Use of rescue medications: The use of rescue medications is an important covariate in pain 
studies that can impact the analysis of other efficacy assessments.  
PGA of study drug : The PGA of study drug is a single- item assessment of patient perceptions 
of pain control with the study drug and is evaluated on a 4-point Likert scale (poor, fair, good, or excellent).
29 The PGA of study drug provides subjects the ability to state their perceptions of the 
treatment that may not be captured by [CONTACT_351586].

10.8.[ADDRESS_890478]’s treatment by [CONTACT_14450]’s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators  will use their best judgment as to 
whether to unblind without first attempting to contact [CONTACT_577233]. If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact [CONTACT_660321]. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the 
medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding. 
Contact [CONTACT_14452] (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate 
document. 
If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent 
clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_890479]’s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject).  In addition, the investigator will 
consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. 
Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory 
reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual subjects at any time.

Clinical laboratory assessments during screening must have no clinically significant findings that 
preclude participation in the study, as judged by [CONTACT_093], for a subject to receive study drug on Day 1.  
Additional Screening Tests: The following additional tests will be performed at the Screening 
Visit and/or pre- procedure to assess eligibility:  
• Serology: Hepatitis B surface antigen ( H BsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (HCV Ab), HCV 
RNA, human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 antibody/antigen (HIV- 1/HIV -2 Ab/Ag), 
and HIV- 1/HIV -[ADDRESS_890488] following a 
positive antibody or antibody/antigen test. Subjects with detectable viral load for HIV 
(≥200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) or HCV will be excluded (Section 8.2).  
• S erum Follicle -stimulating Hormone (FSH): Serum FSH will be tested at the Screening Visit 
for female subjects who are suspected to be postmenopausal ( as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
F
or a subject to be considered of non- childbearing potential, the serum FSH levels will be 
within the laboratory range for postmenopausal females. 
• P regnancy Testing: All biologically female subjects will have a serum beta -human chorionic 
gonadotropin ( β-hCG)  test during the Screening Visit. Female subjects of childbearing 
potential (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) will also have a urine β- hCG test before admission on Day -1. 
Both the serum and urine β -hCG tests (as applicable per Table 3-1) must be negative to 
receive study drug.

amphetamines/methamphetamines, barbiturates, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_306003] a 
urine test at the Screening Visit and before admission on Day -1. Alcohol screening will be assessed before admission on Day -[ADDRESS_890489] to receive study drug; a positive marijuana screen will only be exclusionary on Day -1. A positive drug screen for a known prescribed concomitant medication that is not otherwise exclusionary (e.g., benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) will not disqualify subjects.  
Additional Evaluations: A
 dditional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other 
times if judged to be clinically appropriate.  
For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used, w
ith the following exceptions: 
• Day - 1 drug and alcohol tests and urine β -hCG pregnancy tests will be assessed by [CONTACT_660322]. 
• Local laboratories may be used to repeat a screening assessment to determine eligibility on Day - 1 if there is clear evidence of laboratory error (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) in the central laboratory 
assessment.  
Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by [CONTACT_94295]. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94248]), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 
11.5.[ADDRESS_890490] study visits. At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital signs 
assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or  healthcare provider. If the 
Screening Visit occurs via home health, an abbreviated PE will be performed at the Screening Visit and a complete PE will be performed on Day -1. 
A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat (EENT); respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After the complete PE during screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. 
The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: general; 
cardiovascular system; respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133]; skin; and abdomen. 
A focused PE of the operative site will be performed in order to assess wound healing.
  
Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11943], and oxygen saturation (SpO 2). The subject will be instructed to rest (seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for at 
least [ADDRESS_890491] 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The 
performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: 
• The ECG will be done before blood draws or any other procedures that may affect heart rate. 
• The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5  minutes before having an ECG. 
• The test should be performed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by [CONTACT_168795]. All traces will be centrally evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the stud y through the Safety 
Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs.  
To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to 
baseline measurements. If the median QTcF is increased by >60  msec from the baseline or the 
median absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled or unscheduled ECGs (performed in triplicate), 2  additional ECGs (performed in triplicate) will be performed approximately 2  to 
4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If the median QTcF value from either of these repeated ECGs remains above the thr eshold value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), 
the subject should discontinue dosing. For safety monitoring after discontinuation, a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2  successive ECGs fall below the 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.

requirement is not waived. 
b Medical record documentation of contraception for non -study partners is not required. The subject must 
confirm that their partner has documented proof, and the subject’s confirmation should be documented.  
c Female condom cannot be used with male condom due to risk of tearing.  
Additional notes:  
• If over the course of the study the subject meets the criteria for waiving the contraception 
requirements, the subject does not need to follow the contraceptive methods listed in Table 11-3. 
• Male subjects must not donate sperm from the first dose of study drug, throughout the study, and for [ADDRESS_890497] dose of study drug. 
• Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of the Screening Visit must agree to follow the contraceptive requirements of this study if they become sexually active with a partner of the opposite biological sex. 
• Medical record documentation of contraception for non-study partners is not required. 
• If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to 
local regulations and/or requirements.

endpoint of VX- 548 versus placebo on SPID48 and 90% power for the key secondary endpoint 
of VX -548 versus HB/APAP on SPID48, based on 2- sample t -tests with significance level 0.05. 
To allow for about 15% dropout, a total of approximately [ADDRESS_890500] listings and disposition 
summary tables, unless otherwise specified. 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_890501] data listings. 
Continuous variables  will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: 
the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value 
(max).  
Categorical variables  will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most recent non- missing 
measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECGs, the baseline value will be defined as the average of the pretreatment measurements (triplicate) on Day  1. 
Change (absolute change) from baseline  
 will be calculated as Post- baseline value −  Baseline 
value. 
Treatment -emergent (TE) Period  will include the time from the first dose of study drug to the 
Safety Follow-up Visit or to the completion of study participation (as defined in Section 9.1.6), whichever occurs first.  
12.3.[ADDRESS_890502] disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications, and important protocol deviations will be summarized.  
12.3.3  Efficacy Analysis  
Only the principal features of the efficacy analysis will be presented in this section. For more details, please refer to the SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary Endpoints  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will include SPID48 as the dependent variable and treatment as a fixed effect, with site and baseline NPRS as covariates. If the model estimation does not co nverge, then site will be 
removed from the model. The least squares mean difference from placebo for VX -548 will be 
provided along with the 95% CI and P  value.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
SPID48 compared to HB/APAP and SPID24 compared to placebo will be analyzed in a similar manner as the primary endpoint. 
The time to ≥2- point (or ≥1-point) reduction in NPRS from baseline is the time elapsed from the 
first dose of study drug to the first time the subject has at least a 2-point (or 1-point) reduction in 
the NPRS from baseline. These endpoints will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the median time to event and survival curve for each treatment group. The log- rank test 
will be used to compare the survival curves between VX-[ADDRESS_890503], stratified by [CONTACT_660323]. The 
proportion of subjects using rescue medication from 0 to 48 hours compared to placebo will be analyzed similarly.  
The incidence of vomiting or nausea compared to HB/APAP will be analyzed using Pearson’s chi-squared test. If any expected counts are too small, Fisher’s exact test will be used instead. 
The total rescue medication usage from [ADDRESS_890504], stratified by [CONTACT_660323].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Multiplicity Adjustment  
The following primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested using a hierarchical testing procedure. Each endpoint will be tested in the following order at the 2-sided significance level of 0.05: 
• SPID48 compared to placebo 
• SPID48 compared to HB/APAP 
• Time to ≥2-point reduction in NPRS from baseline compared to placebo 
12.3.4  Safety Analysis  
The overall safety profile of VX-548 will be assessed in terms of the following safety and 
tolerability endpoints: 
• Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) 
• Standard 12- lead ECG outcomes  
• Vital signs 
Safety endpoints will be summarized descriptively based on the Safety Set. For safety analyses, 
no statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. Additional details will be provided in the SAP.

A population PK analysis of plasma concentration versus time data of VX-548 and may 
be performed using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. A population approach may also be used to investigate the exposure-response relationship for the efficacy and safety variables. A more detailed description of the methodology to be followed will be presented in the modeling and simulation analysis plan. The results of the population PK and PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis (if done) will be reported in a separate document. 
13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, and Reporting 
13.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increas e in its severity or 
frequency) after the ICF is signed.  
An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinically Significant Assessments  
Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and 
those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g.,  bacteria in urine or decreased 
hemoglobin). 
An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of 
the following: 
• Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment 
• Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
• A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study 
Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above 
criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by [CONTACT_093].  
A laboratory value that is Grade [ADDRESS_890506]’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE.  

Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.0 Page 45 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  [IP_ADDRESS]  Documentation of Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected in source documents from the time the ICF is signed until completion 
of study participation (Section 9.1.6).  
All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as [ADDRESS_890507]’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: 
• Description of the event 
• Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” 
• Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) 
• Severity  
• Causal relationship to study drug(s)  
• Action taken  
• Outcome  
• Concomitant medication or other treatment given  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The 
guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed 
July 2022). The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1.  
Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity  
Classification  Description  
Grade  1 (Mild)  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
Grade  2 (Moderate)  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADLa 
Grade  3 (Severe)  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADLb 
Grade  4 (Life -threatening)  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated   
Grade  5 (Death)  Death related to AE  
Source: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  (Accessed July 2022)  
ADL: activities of daily living; AE: adverse event  
Note: A semi- colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
a Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing 
money, etc.  
b Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.0 Page 46 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event  Causality  
Every effort will be made by [CONTACT_63398], if any, to the 
study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table 13-2. 
Table 13-[ADDRESS_890508] been ruled out, 
and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug.  
Possibly related  There is an association between the event and the administration of the 
investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, 
such as characteris tics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease.  
Unlikely related  The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be 
related to factors other than investigational study drug.  
Not related  The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the 
alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record).  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Action Taken  
The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken 
will be classified according to the categories in Table 13-3.  
Table 13-[ADDRESS_890509] to an AE 
Classificationa Definition  
Dose not changed  Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE  
Dose reduced  Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE  
Drug interrupted  Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE  
Drug withdrawn  Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE  
Not applicable  Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply.  
“Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational 
treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide 
whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.  
AE: adverse event  
a Refer to Section 9.7  for directions regarding what drug actions are permitted per protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Outcome 
An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. 
The outcome will be classified according to the categories in Table 13-4. 
Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.0 Page 47 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE 
Classification  Definition  
Recovered/resolved  Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms  
Recovered/resolved with 
sequelae  Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms  
Not recovered/not 
resolved (continuing)  Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains 
ongoing  
Fatal  Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly 
related to the AE.  
Unknown  Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g.,  a subject lost to follow up)  
AE: adverse event  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Given  
The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including 
clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 
13.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: 
• Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after 
participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) 
• Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home)  
If a subject has a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29918] (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139355], the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155409], unless an AE caused the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139357]. In addition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94253] (e.g.,  social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]) will not be 
considered to indicate an SAE. 
Protocol VX22 -548-104, Version  4.0 Page 48 of 57 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Confidential Information  Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not 
synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting and Documentation of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow-up Visit, 
regardless of causality, will be reported by [CONTACT_351593] 24  hours of 
identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are 
considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24  hours of 
identification .  
For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safety Follow -up Visit, the 
SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on 
previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure t imely reporting to health authorities.  
Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:  
Email: [EMAIL_3373]  (preferred choice)  
Fax: +1 -[PHONE_11313]  
For technical issues related to submitting the form, contact [CONTACT_756]: +[PHONE_3679] 
SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will 
be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_94316](s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not b e required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved 
at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters  
Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities, IEC, and participating investigators in accordance with current ICH E2A Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable.

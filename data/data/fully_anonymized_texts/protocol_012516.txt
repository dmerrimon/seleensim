HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189718] of these clinical trials. The HIV Vacc ine Trials Network (HVTN) has 
addressed ethical concerns in the following ways:  
 HVTN trials are designed and conducted to enhance the knowledge base necessary to 
find a preventive vaccine, using methods that are scientifically rigorous and valid, 
and in ac cordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff incorporate the philosophies underlying major 
codes [1-3], declarations, and other guidance documents relevant to human subjects 
research into the design and conduct of HIV vaccine clinical trials.  
 HVTN scientists and operational staff are committed  to substantive community 
input —into the planning, conduct, and follow -up of its research —to help ensure that 
locally appropriate cultural and linguistic needs of study populations are met. 
Community Advisory Boards (CAB) are required by [CONTACT_854417] d at all 
HVTN research sites to ensure community input, in accordance with Good 
Participatory Practices (GPP) and all local and national guidelines.  
 HVTN clinical trial staff counsel study participants routinely on how to reduce HIV 
risk. Participants who  become HIV infected during the trial are provided counseling 
on notifying their partners and about HIV infection according to local guidelines. 
Staff members will also counsel them about reducing their risk of transmitting HIV to 
others.  
 The HVTN requires  that all international HVTN sites lacking national plans for 
providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) develop plans for the care and treatment of 
participants who acquire HIV infection during a trial. Each plan is developed in 
consultation with representati ves of host countries, communities from which 
potential trial participants will be drawn, sponsors, and the HVTN. Participants will 
be referred to programs for ART provision when the appropriate criteria for starting 
ART are met. If a program is not availa ble at a site and ART is needed, a privately 
established fund will be used to pay for access to treatment to the fullest extent 
possible.  
 The HVTN provides training so that all participating sites similarly ensure fair 
participant selection, protect the pr ivacy of research participants, and obtain 
meaningful informed consent. During the study, participants will have their 
wellbeing monitored, and to the fullest extent possible, their privacy protected. 
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time.  
 Prior to implementation, HVTN trials are rigorously reviewed by [CONTACT_432149].  
 HVTN trials are reviewed  by [CONTACT_432150].  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 6 of 155  The HVTN designs its research to minimize risk and maximize benefit to both study 
participants and their local communities. For exa mple, HVTN protocols provide 
enhancement of participants’ knowledge of HIV and HIV prevention, as well as 
counseling, guidance, and assistance with any social impacts that may result from 
research participation. HVTN protocols also include careful medical review of each 
research participant’s health conditions and reactions to study products while in the 
study.  
 HVTN research aims to benefit local communities by [CONTACT_854418] g the capacity of 
the communities through training, support, shared knowledge, and equipment. 
Researchers involved in HVTN trials are able to conduct other critical research in 
their local research settings.  
 The HVTN recognizes the importance of institutio nal review and values the role of in 
country Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and Ethics Committees (ECs) as 
custodians responsible for ensuring the ethical conduct of research in each setting.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 7 of 155 2 IRB/EC review considerations  
US Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) and other US feder al regulations require 
IRBs /ECs to ensure that certain requirements are satisfied on initial and continuing 
review of research (Title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 46.111(a) 1 -7; 21 
CFR 56.111(a) 1 -7). The following s ection highlights how this protocol addresses each of 
these research requirements. Each HVTN Investigator welcomes IRB/ EC questions or 
concerns regarding these research requirements.  
This trial is also being conducted in Southern Africa, with partial fundi ng from the US 
NIH. Due to this, the trial is subject to both US and local regulations and guidelines on 
the protection of human research subjects and ethical research conduct. Where there is a 
conflict in regulations or guidelines, the regulation or guide line providing the maximum 
protection of human research subjects will be followed.  
In compliance with international and local (as appropriate) Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines, each research location has a locally based Principal Investigator (PI) who is 
qualified to conduct (and supervise the conduct of) the research; and the research 
addresses an important local health need for an HIV vaccine. In addition, the 
investigators take responsibility for the conduct of the study and the control of the study 
products, including obtaining all appropriate regulatory and ethical reviews of the 
research. Each participating site has a standard operating procedure for ensuring that 
participants have the necessary information to make a decision whether or not to consent  
to the research.  
The sections below address each of the review concerns by [CONTACT_1202]/ECs regarding how the 
research will be conducted.  
2.1 Minimized risks to participants  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 1 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 1: Risks to subjects are minimized.  
This protocol minimizes risks to participants by (a) correctly and promptly informing 
participants about risks so that they can join in partnership with the researcher in 
recognizing and reporting harms; (b) respecting local/national blood draw limits; (c) 
performing di rect observation of participants postvaccination and collecting information 
regarding side effects for several days postvaccination; (d) having staff properly trained 
in administering study procedures that may cause physical harm or psychological 
distress,  such as blood draws, vaccinations, HIV testing and counseling and HIV risk 
reduction counseling; (e) providing HIV risk reduction counseling and checking on 
contraception use (for women); and (f) providing safety monitoring.  
2.2 Reasonable risk/benefit balanc e 
45 CFR 46.111(a) 2 and 21 CFR 56 .111(a) 2: Risks to subjects are reasonable in 
relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the 
knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result.  
In all public health research, the risk -benefit ratio may be difficult to assess because the 
benefits to a healthy participant are not as apparent as they would be in treatment 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189719] selection  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 3 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 3: Subject selection is equitable  
This pro tocol has specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for investigators to follow in 
admitting participants into the protocol . Participants are selected because of these criteria 
and not because of positions of vulnerability or privilege. Investigators are r equired to 
maintain screening and enrollment logs to document volunteers who screened into and 
out of the protocol and for what reasons.  
2.4 Appropriate informed consent  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 4 & 5 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 4 & 5: Informed consent is sought 
from each prospective subject or the subject ’s legally authorized representative as 
required by 45 CFR 46. 116 and 21 CFR Part 50 ; informed consent is appropriately 
documented as required by [ADDRESS_1189720] be obtained before any study 
procedures are initiated and assessed throughout the trial ( see Section  9.1). Each site is 
provided  training in informed consent by [CONTACT_432152]. 
The HVTN requires a signed consent document for documentation, in addition to chart 
notes or a consent checklist.  
2.5 Adequate safety monitoring  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 6 and 21 CFR 56.111 ( a) 6: There is adequate provision for 
monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.  
This protocol has extensive safety monitoring in place (see Section 11). Safety is 
monitored daily by [CONTACT_106806] 108  Protocol Safety Review 
Team (PSRT). In addition, the HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) periodically 
reviews study data.  
2.[ADDRESS_1189721] privacy/confidentiality  
45 CFR 46.111 (a) 7 and 21 CFR 56.111 (a) 7: There are adequate provisions to 
protect the privacy of subjects and maintain the confidentiality of data.  
Privacy refers to an individual ’s right to be free from unauthorized or unreason able 
intrusion into his/her private life and the right to control access to individually 
identifiable information about him/her. The term “privacy ” concerns research participants 
or potential research participants as individuals whereas the term “confident iality ” is used 
to refer to the treatment of information about those individuals. This protocol respects the 
privacy of participants by [CONTACT_269953] (see Appendix A ). The privacy of participants is protected by 
[CONTACT_269954] ’s name [CONTACT_854490] 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189725] (31%) preventive 
efficacy for an HIV vaccine regimen comprising ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521) and clade B/E 
gp120 Env protein (AIDSVAX B/E) [4], a large number of consultations with 
independent groups of scientists collected through the NIH, MHRP, and the Global 
Vaccine Enterprise were held providing input into the next steps for the field. Several 
consensus concepts emerged: (1) the need to evaluate the RV144 pox -protein prime -
boost approach in a higher incidence population in a region of the world most affected by 
[CONTACT_36160][INVESTIGATOR_901] ( ie, southern Africa); (2) the consequent need to manufacture vaccines 
that more closely match those clades/subt ypes that circulate in the proposed trial 
population (clade C); (3) at least 1 of the vaccine concepts to be tested should be 
analogous to the ALVAC/gp120 regimen used in RV144; and (4) the program to be 
developed should build upon the “correlates” analysi s done post -RV144 [5] to confirm 
the correlates identified in RV144 and to continue to define additional correlates of risk 
(CoR) for HIV vaccines. These recommendations led to the formation of the Pox Protein 
Public Private Partnership (P5), a group of vaccine developers, funde rs, and 
implementers, which was created to build on the RV144 results with the goal of 
improving the pox -protein regimen and enhancing the level and/or duration of protection 
seen in the RV144 study, with the hope of producing an effective prophylactic HIV  
vaccine with the potential to have a major public health impact.  
The P5 partnership is committed to evaluating multiple vaccine regimens  and will 
address this goal by [CONTACT_854420] -generation 
vaccine products as well as different adjuvant systems to identify those exhibiting potent 
yet diverse immunological profiles, thus providing the greatest potential to confirm 
previous and identify new CoR in an efficacy trial. More than a dozen different vaccine 
regimens will be evaluated in several phase 1/2a trials; and a number of these candidate 
vaccine regimens will be selected based on safety and immunogenicity data collected 
through the primary immunogenicity timepoint of Month 6.5 to advance to phase 2b 
proof -of-concept ef ficacy testing.  
4.1.1  The RV144 trial  
The RV144 trial was conducted by [CONTACT_854421] a community -based s ample of more than 16 000 HIV -1–
uninfected participants in Thailand and results were published in 2009 [4]. This 
community -based study enrolled individuals aged [ADDRESS_1189726] combination of 
canarypox prime ALVAC -HIV (vCP1521), expressing clade E env and clade B gag and 
pol, followed by [CONTACT_854422]® clades B/E gp120 protein boost. These products were 
based on viruses commonly circulating in Thailand at the time. This  vaccine regimen 
demonstrated 31.2% efficacy when compared with placebo (n = 51 vs. n = 74, 
respectively; p = 0.04) at 3.5 years [4]. Although evaluation of vaccine efficacy at [ADDRESS_1189727] vaccination was not included in the pre s pecified analysis, substantially 
greater reduction in acquisition was observed  1 year postvaccination (estimated 60.5%, 
95% CI 22 -80) with the vaccine effect waning over time to 31% cumulative through 3.5 
years [6].

To better understand how the RV144 vaccine regimen reduced the risk of HIV infection, 
a large consortium of independent laboratories worked together systematically to ensure 
maximal information could be derived from samples obtained from participants who 
were vaccinated and became infected compared with those vaccinated but uninfected at 
the end of the trial. A case control study was performed on 41 infected vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
205 uninfected vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (5:1) and 40 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (20 infected a nd 20 
uninfected) within the RV 144 clinical trial to identify CoR [5]. Among the 6 primary 
immunological variables selected for the correlates analysis (5 different antibody [Ab] 
responses and CD4+ T cell cytokine production) that were measured at the 2 weeks after 
the final vac cination visit ( ie, at or near peak immunogenicity), [ADDRESS_1189728] was the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) Ab that bound to a scaffolded 
gp70 V1V2 reco mbinant protein; this variable correlated inversely with infection rate ( ie, 
higher V1V2 Ab→lower infection rate). The second was plasma Env -specific binding 
IgA, which correlated directly with infection rate ( ie, higher immunoglobulin A [IgA] Ab 
to Env→hi gher infection rate). The other 4 primary variables correlated inversely with 
infection rate only when the level of IgA binding was low. Notably, neither low levels of 
V1V2 Ab nor high levels of Env -specific IgA were associated with higher rates of 
infecti on than those found in the placebo group [5]. 
Recently, several studies have further enhanced our understanding of the efficacy seen in 
RV144. Rolland and colleagues demonstrated a sieve effect in the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
specifically that the vaccine induced better protection aga inst viruses that matched the 
vaccine sequence at position 169 in the V2 loop of Env [7]. These data further 
substantiate the importance of antibodies directed against this region in protecting against 
infection [5]. Yates and colleagues noted that Env V1V2 -specific IgG3 was the 
immunoglobulin subclass showing the strongest correlation with prevention of HIV 
acquis ition in RV144 [8]. Chung and colleagues demonstrated that the IgG3 subclass was 
much better at engaging Fc -mediated effector responses when compared to the other 
subclasses, th ereby [CONTACT_1541] a possible mechanism explaining the association of Env 
V1V2 IgG3 with a lower rate of HIV acquisition [9]. In sum, these CoR studies point to 
the importance of Ab responses, directed against a specific region of Env, in mediating 
the differing rates of HIV acquisition observed in RV144. They lay the groundwork for 
directin g immune analyses planned for future HIV vaccine clinical trials.  
4.[ADDRESS_1189729] recent Gap Report of the Joint United Nations Program on 
HIV/AIDS, there were an estimated 35 million people living with HIV globally in 2013. 
There were 2.1 million new HIV infections globally and 1.5 million AIDS deaths in 
2013. Therefore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_45478] -recognized benefits from scaling -up ART and certain 
HIV prevention strategies, the global burden of HIV remains enormous [10].

HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189731] indications that a prophylactic vaccine can reduce HIV acquisition 
risk.  
With approximately 6.3 million people living with HIV as of 2013, South Africa’s 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_854393] -Saharan region bears the 
preponderant burden of the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_854394] 70% of all infections 
worldwide. Ten countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, South 
Africa, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) account for 81% 
of all people living with HI V in the region and half of those are in only 2 countries —
Nigeria and South Africa. The vast majority of newly acquired infections in this region 
occur during unprotected heterosexual intercourse and subsequent transmission to 
newborns and breastfed babies . Approximately 340,000 new HIV infections and 200,000 
HIV-related deaths occurred in South Africa in 2013 [10]. These statistics give strong 
support to recent statements from top scientists and opi[INVESTIGATOR_854395] a preventive HIV vaccine [11]. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1189732] had only partial success. The estimated 
incidence rates  remain high at 15.8/100,000 overall, and 4 times as high among African 
Americans. Concernedly, the rates for young Americans, aged 20 -29 years, increased 
between 2008 and 2011. In addition, 65% of new infections were estimated to be among 
men who have sex  with men, and rates were increasing. It is unlikely that early treatment 
strategies and the availability of pre -exposure prophylaxis alone will be able to stop this 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], and that therefore an effective vaccine will be essential [12].  
The P5 partnership will investigate new vaccine products and vaccination strategies in 
populations from the US and Sub -Saharan Africa. This will ensure the study of correlates 
of risk and protection is representative of the global HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], resulting in the 
greatest impact on populations at risk in the US and globally.  
4.3 Rationale for phase 1/2a vaccine regimen selections  
The vaccine regimens included in the multiple phase 1/2a trials  were selected based on 
the rationale that they will have robust yet distinct immune profiles for selection of future 
phase 2b efficacy testing and to address specific questions in the field that are pertinent 
for identifying CoR. These questions include t he following:  
 What are the immune responses elicited by [CONTACT_854423] a pox vector?  
 When DNA is administered alone as a prime followed by [CONTACT_854424]/adjuvant boost?  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 17 of 155  When DNA and protein/adjuvant are c o-administered at each vaccination?  
 What immune responses are elicited by [CONTACT_854425] C gp120 + AS01 B alone 
regimen?  
 How do the adjuvants MF59 versus AS01 B affect the immune responses elicited by 
[CONTACT_854426]?  
 Does a higher dose (100 mcg) of  each Env protein in the Bivalent Clade C gp120 
vaccine product adjuvanted with AS01 B dampen immune responses as compared to a 
lower dose (20mcg) within each vaccine regimen?  
 How does priming with DNA versus priming with ALVAC versus priming with 
NYVAC aff ect HIV -specific immune responses when followed by [CONTACT_854427] + protein/adjuvant boosting?  
 What are the immune responses elicited by a vaccine regimen comprising ALVAC 
and Bivalent Subtype C gp120 when the protein component is administered with 
MF59 an d with alum adjuvants, or without adjuvant?  
Including all vaccine regimens in a single phase 1/2a trial would be prohibitively 
complex. Therefore a suite of studies has been developed, allowing the opportunity to 
address the pertinent questions in a progra mmatically feasible manner. The MF59 versus 
AS01 B question will be addressed in several of these studies – HVTN 108 among them – 
as it applies to several vaccine product regimens. Similarly, since the AS01 B/protein dose 
question may provide different resul ts depending upon the full vaccine regimen 
evaluated, this question will be addressed in several studies as well. However, only 1 
AS01 B adjuvanted Env protein dose for each vaccine regimen will be considered for 
advancement to phase 2b testing.  
HVTN 108  is one of the phase 1/2a studies planned within this program. Evaluation of 
DNA/protein and protein only regimens will provide an opportunity to compare the 
immunogenicity of these simpler, non -vector vaccine regimens. This s tudy has 7 active 
arms and 1 placebo arm and will compare DNA priming administered at Months 0 and 1, 
followed by [CONTACT_100660] + Protein + MF59 or AS01 B boosting at Months 3 and 6, versus DNA 
+ Protein + MF59 or AS01 B co-administered at Months 0, 1, and 6. In addition, this study 
will evaluate Protein + AS01 B administered at Months 0, 1, and 6. Furthermore, to assess 
whether too high a protein dose in the presence of AS01 B adjuvant may overstimulate the 
immune system a nd thereby [CONTACT_854428], 2 different doses of each of the bivalent 
Env proteins will be evaluated: 20 mcg versus 100 mcg for each of the DNA containing 
regimens (see section 4.5.4 ). 
How to identify the regimens which will be further assessed in a future efficacy trial will 
depend on the ‘adequate take/potency’ (ATP) as defined in Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_1189733] 
into a future efficac y trial. Such an efficacy trial could potentially include 1 or more of 
the vaccine regimens evaluated in this study, together with regimens from other phase 
1/2a studies.

4.4.2  Bivalent Subtype C gp120 proteins  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Constructs  
Bivalent Subtype C gp120 , manufactured by [CONTACT_854430] (Laupheim, 
[LOCATION_013]), consists of 2 separate subtype C recombinant monomeric proteins, TV1.C 
gp120 and 1086.C gp120. These recombinant gp120s represent the receptor binding 
domain of the HIV envelope glycoprotein. Each gp120 is modified from its wild type 
full-length form (gp160) by [CONTACT_854431] e native signal sequence and deletion of the 
entire gp41 C -terminal portion of the glycoprotein containing the TM and cytoplasmic 
domains.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Manufacturing and formulation  
Each protein is expressed in CHO cells under conditions favorable for secretion of 
monomeric protein. Following fermentation, each protein is extensively purified as 
described in the following paragraph.   
Following clone selection, a fed batch cell culture at 500L or 1000L  scale is employed for 
cell propagation. Once the cells reach optimum  cell density, the culture is harvested and 
purified using standard methods. Harvest clarification was performed using a series of 
depth filters followed by [CONTACT_854432] a sterilizing -grade filter . The harvest 
was collected in single use dispo sable bags and purified including further enrichment for 
monomer. Additional process ing utilizes multiple filtration  steps and a series of 
chromatography steps  that remove process related impurities .  
Both TV1.C and 1086.C bulk drug substances are stored f rozen at not more than -61°C. 
The formulations are similar for both drug substances, containing Env antigen, sodium 
citrate, and sodium chloride, pH 6.5-7.0. Each of the HIV gp120  proteins as final 
products are tested for pH, appearance, identity, strength  (concentration), purity, potency, 
as well as safety and content uniformity following US Pharmacopoeia  methods where 
applicable .

the overall number of participants will provide sufficient safety data to comfortably move 
into a phase 2b efficacy set up (see also Section 6.1). 
4.5.[ADDRESS_1189738] been published since the 1990s. Quantitative and qualitative 
differences were found between the antibod ies induced by [CONTACT_115599] -based DNA/protein vs. 
Env protein alone or DNA alone in rabbits [13,14] . In addition, nonhuman primate ( NHP ) 
SHIV challenge studies showed protective antibody responses [15,16] . 
DNA -protein combination vaccine regimens have recently been investigated in clinical 
trials. Two studies conducted by  [CONTACT_854433] (VRC) in 2008 -
2010 assessed influenza H5 DNA priming followed by [CONTACT_854434] H5/N1 monovalent 
inactivated vaccine (MIV) and showed that the combination approach enhanced the 
magnitude of hemagglutination inhibition anti bodies to protective levels in 81% of 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_854396] 4 -fold higher than MIV given twice [17]. In 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189739] 12 -
24 weeks after the prime as compared to 4 -8 week intervals [18]. 
Three HIV vaccine clinical trials have been conducted using the DNA prime/Env protein 
boost p latform. The first study was conducted by [CONTACT_854435]. In this study, participants who received [ADDRESS_1189740] demonstrated Env -specific interferon gamma (IFN -γ) enzyme -linked 
immunospot ( ELISpot ) responses in over 90% of participants 2 weeks after the final 
vaccination, which persisted at 1 year (5 months after the final vaccination) in over 80% 
of part icipants. Also, Env -specific binding antibodies were induced at a higher magnitude 
than those seen from recombinant envelope vaccine regimens alone and these responses 
persisted in most participants at [ADDRESS_1189741] decrease in titer [19]. 
Furthermore, the DNA prime plus protein boost approach elicited a unique Ab profile 
compared to recombinant HIV envelope protein alone or a pox -vector  prime plus protein 
boost, characterized by [CONTACT_854436]4 binding site antibodies  [20] . 
HVTN [ADDRESS_1189742] regimen induced: 1) substantial levels of binding antibodies against Env in 100% o f 
vaccinees; 2) significantly higher titers of homologous neutralizing antibodies (nAbs); 3) 
CD4+ T -cell responses to Env antigens of significantly greater magnitude (among the 
group that was primed with 1mg of env DNA), in comparison with the group that w as 
immunized with gp140 protein alone, and 4) a polyfunctional CD4+ T cell response 
pattern that differed qualitatively from the CD4+ responses in the  protein alone group, 
shifting towards a Th 1 response by [CONTACT_854437] [21]. In HVTN 049, antibodies were 
induced that were avid, reacted with envelopes of multiple clades (A, B, C, A/E, G) and 
mediated infectious virion capture [Georgia Tomaras, personal communi cation]. Also, in 
a comparison between multiple different vaccination strategies from several HVTN 
clinical trials with differing combinations of DNA, MVA, Ad5 vectors, and Env protein 
vaccinations, as well as RV144, the DNA/protein strategy in HVTN [ADDRESS_1189743] magnitude memory B cell responses [22]. 
HVTN [ADDRESS_1189744], a significant portion of the HVTN 049 
participants still had detectable T -cell and binding Ab responses, suggesting remarkably 
durable memory respo nses induced by [CONTACT_854438] + protein combination. This impression 
was further confirmed by [CONTACT_854439] C gp140 protein [23]. The findings from these clinical trials 
provide intriguing clues as to an approach that may facilitate the induction of nAbs  and 
long-lasting memory B and T cell responses and provides justification to examine the 
DNA prime/ DNA+ protein boost regimen in this study. Co -administration of the DNA 
with the protein as a boost increases the number of DNA vaccinations beyond [ADDRESS_1189745] been shown to be beneficial in some clinical trials of other 
HIV DNA vaccine candidates [24]. While boosting with DNA that is co -administered 
with protein has not yet been investigated in humans, boosting with co -administration of 
vector and protein has been shown to enhance immunogenici ty as compared to vector or 
protein boost alone [25]. By [CONTACT_5259], then, it is hypothesized that the combined 
DNA/protein boost will elicit strong humoral and cellular responses. Therefore, HVTN 
108 will evaluate DNA prime with DNA+ protein boost.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189746] vaccination. 
The Pa vlakis group demonstrated the potential immunologic advantages of co -
administration of protein with DNA in NHP. In this 4 -arm study rhesus macaques 
received either DNA alone, DNA co -administered with protein, 2 DNA priming 
injections followed by 2 protein boosts, or sham DNA vaccination. The DNA vaccine 
plasmids expressed SIV Env, Gag, Pol, Nef, Tat, and Vif, were given with rhesus IL -12 
DNA adjuvant administered IM with electroporation. The protein vaccine consisted of 
inactivated SIVmac239 particles. Vacc inations were given at month 0, 2, 4 and 9, and 
followed by [CONTACT_854440] -dose mucosal challenge with heterologous SIVsmE660. The 2 
groups that received DNA vaccine (DNA alone, or DNA co -administered with protein) at 
all 4 timepoints had higher levels of va ccine -induced SIV -specific IFN -γ+ T cells. 
However, the group that received co -administered DNA and protein had the highest 
levels of Env binding Abs and higher avidity that persisted at a higher rate than the other 
groups. In addition, Env binding Abs and  avidity correlated with slower SIV acquisition 
and cytotoxic CD4+ effector memory inversely correlated with peak viral load [26,27] . In 
addition, the Haigwo od group recently demonstrated in rabbits that DNA plus protein co -
administration was superior to protein administration alone in terms of antibody kinetics, 
magnitude, avidity, and neutralization potency [28].  
These studies suggest that a qualitative difference in humoral and T -cell responses may 
result from co -administration of protein with DNA, as compared to the more common 
approach of priming with DNA or viral vector immunogens and p rovides justification for 
the systematic investigation of protein/DNA co -administration.  
Protein was co -administered with DNA or NYVAC in the NHP AUP512 study (see 
Section 4.7.3 ) and this approach induced earlier binding antibody immune responses.  
Protein co -administered with NYVAC, as well as protein co -administered with DNA -
HIV-PT123 is currently being evaluated in HVTN 096/EV04, and this is the only clinical 
trial of which we are aware that has co -administered DNA and protein (DNA -HIV-PT123 
and AIDSVAX B/E have been given simultaneously at months 0 and 1, followed by 
[CONTACT_854441] a NYVAC -HIV and AIDSVAX B/E). This study is still 
blinded and final res ults are pending (see Section 4.8.1  for interim results).  
4.5.[ADDRESS_1189747] of these trial designs is the use of 
2 different adjuvants with the HIV envelope (env) glycoproteins in the boosts. Adjuvants 
are known to enhance the potency, quality, and longevity of antigen -specifi c immune 
responses [29], and the availability of novel commercial adjuvants that are potent and 
safe has been heralded as an important contribution that may advance HIV vaccines 
[30,31] . The MF59 adjuvant,  an oil -in-water emulsion,  is licensed for several flu vaccines 
in multiple countries, and in pre -clinical model s [32] has demonstrated recruitment of  
antigen presenting cells and up -regulation of cytokines, chemokines, and receptors. The 
adjuvant has improved antibody affinity maturation [33], improving both epi[INVESTIGATOR_854397], and elicits a balanced Th1 and Th2 response. It also increases T -cell 
proliferation by [CONTACT_854442] -stimulatory 
molecules [34]. Remarkably durable memory responses (T -cell and binding and 
neutralizing Ab responses) were induced by a DNA -prime/gp [ADDRESS_1189748] 
regimen in HVTN 049 and HVTN 088 (see results in Section 4.5.1 ).

cytokine production [36]. MPL directly activates APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) to 
produce cytokines and elevated levels of costimulatory molecules [37-39]. QS-21 is a 
natural saponin molecule extracted from the bark of the South American tree Quillaja 
saponaria Molina  [40] (reviewed in [35,41] ). The early evaluations of QS -21 as an 
adjuvant demonstrated that it could promote high Ag -specific Ab responses and CD8+ T-
cell responses in mice [42,43]  and high Ag -specific Ab responses in humans [44]. 
However, specific receptors and signaling pathways induced by [CONTACT_145608] -based adjuvants 
have yet to be clearly defined, most likely through the activation of the inflammasome as 
observ ed with QuilA [45]. AS01 has been selected in a number of human vaccine 
candidates because of its association with enhanced and durable immune responses, both 
humoral and cellular [35,46 -54] and recently with protection [46,47] . The ability of AS01 
to improve adaptive immune responses was shown in mice to be linked to a transient 
stimul ation of the innate immune system characterized by [CONTACT_145609] a specific 
pattern of cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment that occurred rapi[INVESTIGATOR_854398], consistent 
with the rapid drainage of the vaccine components to the draining lymph node, and also 
linked to the generation of a high number and heterogeneous dendritic cell  population in 
the draining lymph node that was efficient at priming T cells  [55]. 
[COMPANY_004] PRO HIV -002 evaluated the gp120 20 mcg / NefTat 20 mcg (clade B) candidate 
HIV vaccine formulated with 1 of 3 different Adjuvant Systems (AS02 A, AS02 V and 
AS01 B) each in 60 healthy HIV -seronegative adults. The vaccine candidates were 
administered at Month 0, Month 1, Month 3 and Month 6. All vaccine formulations 
induced strong HIV -specific CD4+ T -cell responses characterized by [CONTACT_854443] -[ADDRESS_1189749] immunization, with significantly stronger responses seen in the AS01 B 
group ( Figure 4-3 A and B). Broad coverage of CD4+ T -cell responses was  demonstrated 
against gp120, and to a lesser extent Nef, derived from the most common circulating 
clades (B, C and circulating recombinant form [CRF] -01) ( Figure 4-3 C).

The demonstration of superior CD4+ T -cell inductio n by [CONTACT_113879]01 B has guided selection of 
this Adjuvant System for further HIV vaccine evaluation [54]. 
Retrospective testing of the [COMPANY_004] PRO HIV -002 clinical study evaluating 
gp120W6.1D/NefTat in different Adjuvant Systems has been performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Georgia 
Tomaras’ lab , which had conducted the correlate analysis of the RV144 trial. Samp les 
collected at various timepoints from 30 subjects vaccinated with gp120W6.1D (20 mcg) 
/NefTat/AS01 B were tested. The analysis of the isotype -specific responses showed that 
after the vaccination that all subjects had detectable IgG1 responses, however mo st of 
these subjects also had detectable IgA against gp120 vaccine protein [56].  
In all c ases, IgG1 was found to have the highest serum concentration among the IgG 
subclasses (mean concentration of serum antibody to gp120 was 5 µg/ml). IgG2 vaccine -
induced antibodies were detected in a minority (8/30, 27%) of subjects. When IgG3 and 
IgG4 vacci ne-induced antibodies were detected, they were found in concentrations less 
than IgG2 vaccine -induced antibodies.  
The V1V2 specificity was also assessed and the results showed that after vaccine dose 3, 
100% of the subjects had total anti -V1V2 concentrati ons comparable to the high levels 
seen in RV144 and that this response was persistent, with total IgG anti -V1V2 detected in 
87% of the subjects [ADDRESS_1189751] vaccine dose (4 -dose 
schedule) (see Figure 4-4) [57].

2 doses F4 10 mcg / AS01 B received a booster dose of F4 10 mcg / AS01 B ([COMPANY_004] ECR -
004). Before the administration of the booster dose, all participants we re still seropositive 
for anti -F4 antibodies as well as high levels of CD4+ T -cell responses were still detected. 
The F4/ AS01 B booster induced strong F4 -specific CD4+ T -cell responses, with similar 
frequencies and polyfunctional phenotypes as following pr imary vaccination, and high 
anti-F4 antibody concentrations, reaching higher levels than those following primary 
vaccination (see Figure 4-6) [49].

4.5.4  Rationale for evaluation of protein plus AS01 B alone arm and 2 protein doses with 
AS01 B 
Clinical trials assessing gp120 with a GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ([COMPANY_004]) Adjuvant 
System provide evidence that a n Env protein with AS01 B can elicit strong humoral and 
cellular responses. Currently, it is unclear whether too high a protein dose in the presence 
of the AS01 B adjuvant leads to suboptimal vaccine responses.  
HVTN 041 evaluated a combination vaccine (NefTa t and gp120W61D) formulated with 
AS02 A (oil-in-water emulsion of a combination of MPL and QS -21) administered at 0, 1 
and 3 months with varying doses (5, 20 and 100 mcg in 20 subjects each) of the gp120 
vaccine component (the NefTat antigen dose was consta nt at 20mcg). The vaccine was 
safe and well tolerated at all dose amounts and Nef -, Tat-, and gp120 -specific binding 
antibodies were induced in all individuals that received the respective antigen, lasting up 
to 9 months after the final immunization ( Figure 4-7).

Figure 4-8 gp120 -specific CD4+ T cell responses (IFN - and/or IL -2) induced by [CONTACT_145614]/gp120/AS02 A vaccine candidate in study HVTN 041  
[COMPANY_004] PRO HIV -005 evaluated an HIV vaccine candidate consisting of a recombinant 
fusion protein (F4) containing 4 HIV -1 clade B antigens (Gag p24, Pol -RT, Nef, and Gag 
p17) adjuvanted with AS01 B in 3 different doses: 10, 30, and 90 mcg. Each dose of the 
AS01 B-adjuvanted vaccine candidate was administered twice in a group of 50 subjects, 
following a Month 0 and Month 1 schedule. Three control groups of 10 subjects received 
a dose of 10, 30 or 90 mcg without AS01 B. The 10 mcg AS01 B-dose elicited a 
statistically  significantly higher CD4+ T -cell response as compared to the other doses (p 
< 0.[ADDRESS_1189755] second vaccination), while anti -F4 IgG responses were elicited 
in 100% of vaccinees with no significant difference in GMC titers amongst the groups 
[58].  
The protein dose question with AS01 B warrants evaluation within the context of the 
specific immunogens and vaccine regimens being tested using updated methodologies. 
The dampening effect of high protein d oses on the immune response has not been 
observed with Env proteins adjuvanted with MF59 however, so this specific question is 
limited to the AS01 B adjuvanted arms. These observations raise important hypotheses to 
test in this and other planned phase 1/2 trials. The  protein plus AS01 B alone question 
warrants testing as well in the context of immune responses as they relate to the 
correlates in RV144 (see Section 4.1.2 ).  
As mentioned in section 4.5.3  protein alone adjuvanted by [CONTACT_113879]01 B induced  anti-V1V2 
antibody conc entrations comparable to RV144 and detectable levels of IgG1 in 100% of 
the subjects.  
4.5.5  Dose rationale  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DNA -HIV-PT123 dose  
The choice of the 4mg dose for the DNA -HIV-PT123 vaccine is based on: 1) the dose 
response study conducted by [CONTACT_854444] r (VRC), NIAID [59] with a 
DNA vaccine using a similar backbone as DNA -HIV-PT123, that demonstrated that there 

HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189756] a greater magnitude and frequency of T cell responses in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_854399] 4 -or 8-mg dose than in the recipie nts of the 2 -mg dose; 2) the previous clinical studies 
with the DNA -HIV-PT123 and NYVAC -HIV combination [24,60,61] ; 3) the preclinical 
immunogenicity studies NHP with DNA -HIV-PT123 (see Section 4.7.1 ); and 4) the 
repeated -dose toxicity study of DNA -HIV-PT123 and NYVAC -HIV (see Section 4.6.1 ) 
that used the same clinical material at the same dose as  this study and demonstrated that 
the selected dose was safe and well tolerated in animals.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bivalent Subtype C gp120 dose  
For the Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 vaccine component,  100 mcg each of the 2 
gp120 subtype C proteins (TV1 gp120 and 1086) will be admixed with the oil -in-water 
emulsion MF59 (9.75 mg squalene) by [CONTACT_854445].  
Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 vaccine has not yet been administered to humans. The 
200 mcg total dose was selected based on previous cl inical experience. Limited dose 
range studies performed with [COMPANY_001] (formerly Chiron) subtype B SF2 gp120 and 
subtype E gp120 protein candidates indicated that 50 mcg and 100 mcg, totaling  150 
mcg, doses with MF59 adjuvant were immunogenic and well toler ated [62].  
As discussed in 4.5.3 , the Bivalent Subtype C gp120 dose for evaluation with AS01 B is 
based on previous dose escalation studies. Both a  20mcg and 100mcg per Env component 
will be tested to determine if the higher dose results in suppression of any immune 
parameters when administered with this adjuvant system.  
The dose of the AS01 B / Bivalent Subtype C gp120 administered alone will be 20mc g of 
each Env component for consistency with the PRO HIV -002 trial described in 4.5.4 . 
4.5.6  Schedule  
The vaccination schedule of the DNA prime followed by [CONTACT_100660]+protein boost regimens is 
based upon the schedule used in RV144, but replaces the canarypox (ALVAC) vector 
immunogen with a DNA plasmid construct. The schedule for the DNA and protein co -
administration and protein alone regimens is similar to the prime/boost regim ens, yet 
administers placebo instead of active product at month 3. In previous trials with 
adjuvanted protein, peak immunogenicity is obtained after [ADDRESS_1189757] vaccinations is preferred for antibody matu ration.  
4.5.7  Choice of control  
Sodium Chloride for Injection, 0.9% delivered IM will serve as the placebo for the DNA 
vaccine, the Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 vaccine, and the Bivalent Subtype C gp120 
+ AS01 B vaccine.  
4.6 Summary of preclinical safety studies  
4.6.1  Preclinical safety study of DNA -HIV-PT123 in combination with NYVAC -HIV-PT1 
and NYVAC -HIV-PT4 
A toxicity study (SVT11 -02) in rabbits was conducted in 2011 -2012 to determine and 
assess systemic (short -term and persistent) and local site reactogenicity of DNA -HIV-
PT123 followed by a boost with attenuated vaccinia, NYVAC -HIV-PT1 and NYVAC -

1 Two separate types of NYVAC (HIV -PT-1 and HIV -PT-4) were administered separately in 2 separate injections of 1 mL each. Saline 
control was delivered as 2 separate injections of 1 mL each.  
New Zealand White rabbits (20/sex, total 40 rabbits) were randomly assigned to receive 
IM injections of either DNA -HIV-PT123 on Days 0, 14, 28 and 42 followed by [CONTACT_854446] - 
HIV-PT-1 and NYVAC -HIV-PT-4 on Days 56 and 70 or to saline control on the same 
days. NYVAC -HIV-PT1 and NYVAC -HIV-PT4 were administered separately (right and 
left hind limbs) in 2 separate injections of 1 ml each on Days 56 and 70. The control 
group received saline control delivered as a single injection on Days 0, 14, 28 and 42, and 
delivered as 2 separate injections  of 1 mL each on Days 56 and 70.  
Clinical symptoms, body weight, temperature, ophthalmology, injection site reactions 
and safety laboratory parameters were assessed. Five animals/sex/group were sacrificed 2 
days or 2 weeks following the final vaccination (Day 72 or 84). Each animal underwent a 
complete necropsy with organ weights. All tissues collected from animals assigned to the 
main study (Day 72 necropsy) were examined microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897]. For those animals 
assigned to the recovery study (Day 84 necropsy) only the injection site with surrounding 
muscle and gross lesions was microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_480385].  
In accordance with the toxicity report, all animals survived to scheduled sacrifice. No 
abnormal findings or statistically significant changes in physical and cageside 
examinations, ophthalmological examination, body weights, administration site, 
urinalysis and gross necropsy considered to be related to treatment were observed. Body 
temperatures were briefly elevated following the NYVAC administration. Some chan ges 
were observed in clinical pathology and microscopic observations, most of which could 
be correlated to an acute inflammatory and immune response that is expected with 
administration of a test material intended for use as a vaccine. Most changes were 
temporary and reversible and therefore not considered to constitute a safety concern. 
Overall, it was concluded that the study results demonstrated that administration of DNA -
HIV-PT123 in combination with NYVAC -HIV-PT1 and NYVAC -HIV-PT4 was safe and 
well-tolerated in New Zealand White Rabbits. The vaccine was immunogenic in all 
treated animals following the complete immunization schedule.  
4.6.2  Toxicity studies of HIV Env vaccines  
Nonclinical in vivo  Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies were conducted 
with early candidate subtype B and E gp120 Env protein vaccine candidates that were 
subsequently advanced to phase [ADDRESS_1189759] been tested in 
nonclinical safety studies. The subtype C gp140 previously tested was from the same 
strain (HIV -1 TV1) as one of the components (TV1 gp120) in the proposed Bivalent 
Subtype C gp120/MF59 vaccine, and hen ce is very similar in sequence. Overall, 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 32 of 155 toxicology studies revealed that both the subtype B gp140 and subtype C gp140 vaccines 
with MF59 were well tolerated and testing revealed no adverse local or systemic effects.  
Data from the following nonclinical stu dies are included in the IB:  
 Subchronic IM toxicity study of Biocine® HIV Thai E gp120/SF 2 gp120 vaccine in 
rabbits  
 Repeat dose toxicity of IM HIV DNA/PLG prime followed by [CONTACT_145626] B 
gp140/MF59 in rabbits  
 Repeat dose toxicity of intranasal (IN) subtyp e B gp140 with an LTK63 adjuvant 
followed by [CONTACT_145626] B gp140 with MF59 in rabbits  
 Repeat dose toxicity of IM SAAVI DNA -C2 followed by [CONTACT_145627] -C with 
subtype C gp140/ MF59 in rabbits  
4.6.3  Toxicity studies of MF59  
MF59 is not associated with any potentia l for systemic toxicity and it has a low order of 
local reactogenicity. In repeat -dose rabbit studies, clinical pathology findings of increased 
fibrinogen and minor inflammatory and degenerative changes at the injection site are 
consistent with the effects  of IM injections of an immunological adjuvant. These findings 
are readily reversible within days to 1 to 2 weeks. In repeat -dose toxicology studies in 
dogs, there were no effects on cardiovascular or central nervous system (safety 
pharmacology) parameters . MF59 is not genotoxic (Ames test) or clastogenic (mouse 
micronucleus), is not a dermal sensitizer (Guinea pig), and was not teratogenic (rat and 
rabbit) or a developmental toxicant (rat)  [63].  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_854400]59 include  [63]: 
 single - and repeat -dose toxicity (including local tolerability),  
 genotoxicity,  
 sensitization, and  
 embryofetal and developmental toxicity.  
4.6.4  Toxicity studies of AS01 B  
Toxicology studies performed with AS01 B included:  
 Repeated dose studies (Rabbit, Rat)  
 Local tolerance studie s (Rabbit)  
 Safety/pharmacology studies (Rat, Dog)  
 Genotoxicity (micronucleus) studies (Rat)  
The pre -clinical toxicity studies indicated that no treatment -related systemic toxicity was 
associated with single or repeated IM injection of AS01 B, alone or in co mbination with

4.7.2  AUP444: Imm unogenicity study comparing the priming ability of DNA -HIV-PT123 
vs NYVAC followed by [CONTACT_854447]/or protein boost in NHP  
The immunogenicity and safety of DNA -HIV-PT123 in combination with NYVAC or 
NYVAC -KC and protein was evaluated in this non -human primate  study. The results 
discussed below focus on the safety and immunogenicity results from groups that 
received DNA prime. Groups 1 -3 are therefore also referred to as DNA prime groups and 
groups 4 -5 are also referred to as No -DNA prime groups.  
The study des ign is provided in Table 4-7. The study was initially designed with 6 
vaccinations for groups 1, 2 and 3 (last vaccination at week 32) and 4 vaccinations for 
groups 4  and 5 (last vaccination at week 24). This is also referred to as “Primary 
Vaccination” in this study. Based on the initial immunogenicity data, a late boost at week 
49 was added.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of AUP444 cellular responses  
 DNA -HIV-PT123 was greatly immunogenic with an average of 0.5% cytokine 
secreting cells after DNA immunization;  
 The DNA -HIV-PT123 prime groups induced bala nced CD4 and CD8 T -cell 
responses as shown by [CONTACT_854448] 3 DNA immunizations;  
 DNA -HIV-PT123 prime induced broad T -cell responses as indicated by [CONTACT_854449], Gag, Pol and Nef HIV proteins;  
 The DNA -HIV-PT123 prime groups induced more balanced Env and Gag/Pol 
responses; while the No -DNA prime groups (Group 4 -5) induced predominantly Env 
T-cell responses;  
 The DNA -HIV-PT123 prime groups induced more potent CD4 and CD8 T -cell 
responses both in terms of magnitude and polyfunctionality.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of AUP444 humoral responses  
Prior to the late protein only boost at week 49, the no -DNA prime groups induced 
significantly greater Nab activity against Tier 1 viruses and SHIVs (TZM.bl assay), and 
significantly greater titers of ADCC activity as well as a trend to greater cross clade  
binding IgG Ab titers, as compared to DNA prime groups. Post the week [ADDRESS_1189763], no significant increase in T -cell responses was observ ed 
with the DNA.  
In summary, no apparent toxicity was observed during the course of the AUP444 study 
and the vaccines were well tolerated. Dose site observations were generally mild in 
nature and quickly resolved. The immunogenicity data obtained in this study 
demonstrated that DNA -HIV-PT123 combined with NYVAC or NYVAC -KC were 
highly immunogenic in terms and CD4 and CD8 T -cell responses as assessed by 
[CONTACT_854450]. The immunogenicity profile of the DNA, NYVAC

combination.  
4.7.3  AUP512: protein schedule vaccination study  
The objective of the AUP512 NHP study is to compare the safety and immunogenicity 
among: 1) DNA or NYVAC prime / NYVAC + protein boos t versus DNA or NYVAC in 
combination with gp120 protein prime followed by [CONTACT_854446]/gp120 protein boost; 2) 
DNA+gp120 protein at all timepoints versus Groups 1 -4. Groups 1 -4 are being studied in 
HVTN 096 (see Section 4.8.1).  
In order to better understand the kinetics of the antibody response, the study was 
amended by [CONTACT_854451] [ADDRESS_1189764]. The study design is provided in Table 4-8.

Preliminary immunogenicity data demonstrated that:  
 IgG binding antibody responses against Env are detectable in Groups #2, #3 and #5 at 
week 6 (after 2 immunizations and co -administration with gp120 proteins). These 
responses are further boosted at week [ADDRESS_1189765] Env are detectable in Groups #1 and #4 only at week 14

Env and/or gp70 -V1V2 binding in the Luminex assay. For each animal week 0 and 
week 26 samples were tested. The results obtained indicate:  
 Animals in AUP 512 developed binding Abs targeting multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]:  
 C1, C1 -V1, V2, C3, V3, C5 of gp120.  
 No binding was seen in gp41.  
 V3-response dominated in most animals, followed by C5, C3, and C1.  
 No significant difference was seen among the groups for binding patterns.

antibodies;  
 T-cell responses were greater in the DNA prime/NYVAC boost group.  
AUP512 demonstrated that earlier immunization with protein (week 0 vs week 14) 
induces earlier IgG binding and neutralizing antibody responses,  and heterologous DNA 
prime and NYVAC boost regimens induces greater T -cell responses compared to 
homologous NYVAC or DNA prime boost regimens.  
With regard to safety, no apparent toxicity was observed during the course of this study 
and the vaccines were w ell-tolerated. Minimal dose site reactions were observed and any 
changes in clinical pathology were generally mild in nature, often preexisting conditions 
or incidental findings. Overall, the study animals were devoid of any signs of clinical 
abnormality. The only scorable reporting was inappetence and occasional Grade [ADDRESS_1189766] inappetence correlate with anticipated recovery times

4.7.4  Dose -range Immunogenicity study of Bivalent Clade C gp120  (TV1 .C and 1086)  / 
AS01 B in mice  
The objective of this experiment was to assess the dose response relationship of bivalent  
Clade C gp120  (TV1 .C and 1086) antigens in CB6F1 mice when formulated in 
comb ination  with AS01B, in terms of antigen -specific cellular an d humoral  responses. 
Animals were  immunized intramuscularly on Day 0, 14 , and 28  with 10 mcg, 2 mcg, 0.4 
mcg, or 0.08 mcg of bivalent (TV1 .C and 1086) gp120 antigens formulated with [ADDRESS_1189767]  dose, respectively.  
The bivalent 1086 -TV1.C / AS01 B vaccine formulation elicited 1086C and TV1 .C-
specific  CD4+ T cell  response s for all tested doses. No statistical ly significant  differences 
were  observed between doses,  however, a trend for higher 1086C -specific CD4+ T cell  
responses was observed with lower dose s of 1086 -TV1.C / AS01 B (Figure 4-9-Panel A). 
This was not  observed when measuring the TV1 .C-specific CD4+ T cell responses  
(Figure 4-9-Panel B). The  vaccine -induced CD8+ T cell responses at [ADDRESS_1189768] 
immunization were low to  unde tectable for both , TV1 and 1086 responses. The bivalent 
(1086C -TV1.C) gp120  antigens adjuvanted in AS01 B induced dose -dependent high level s 
of 1086C and TV1 .C-specific  antibody responses at [ADDRESS_1189769]  
immunization ( Figure 4-9-Panel C). Moreover, for all  antigen doses tested, similar levels 
of 1086C and TV1 .C specific total immunoglobulin (Ig) responses were  observed,  
suggesting that there is no negat ive impact on the humoral responses when combining  
1086C and TV1 .C antigens in AS01 B. Anti -V1V2 total Ig responses were also detected in  
all the groups ( Figure 4-9-Panel D).

Additionally, co-administration of protein  with DNA or NYVAC from priming 
substantially reduces the generation of IgA binding Ab responses to gp140 and gp120.

in many clinical trials. In addition, recombinant oligomeric (o -gp140) Env proteins for 
subty pes B and C from [COMPANY_001] have been or are currently in clinical trials. Overall, in 
these studies, recombinant HIV -Env proteins manufactured by [CONTACT_145642]. In most cases, recombinant HIV -Env proteins (either gp120 
or gp14 0) were CHO -based and administered with MF59, [COMPANY_001]’ proprietary oil -in-
water emulsion adjuvant [64]. MF59 safety has been established in clinical studies as 
well as in commercial products. A seasonal influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 
(Fluad®) is licensed in the EU and other countries for use in the elderly. MF59 is also 
used in a pre -pandemic H5N1 influenza vaccine (Aflunov®) licensed in the EU for use in 
adults, and in 2 pandemic H1N1 influenza v accines (Focetria® and Celtura®), licensed in 
the EU and other countries for use in adults and children. More than [ADDRESS_1189779] been distributed in licensed products.  
Recombinant monomeric (gp120) vaccine can didates studied include Chiron’s early

[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability from recent human experience  
There were [ADDRESS_1189780] been 4 recent  clinical trials using [COMPANY_001] 
CHO -based subtype C gp140.  
A phase 1 single -center trial (C86P1) was conducted using [COMPANY_001] CHO -based subtype 
B gp140 recombinant Env protein in Great Britain by [CONTACT_854453] (MUVAPRED) Consortium to assess safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of IN administration of subtype B gp140 with and without the mucosal 
adjuvant LTK63 (detoxified mutant heat labile protein) followed by [CONTACT_204173] b oosting with 
subtype B gp140/MF59. This study enrolled 30 healthy volunteers aged 18 -45, with 20 to 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 41 of 155 receive gp140. The protocol was amended to halt further IN administration of LTK63 
following a report of an AE ( ie, facial nerve paralysis) with a possible association with 
the LTK63 adjuvant in another study [72]. During the study, there was 1 SAE reported of 
Bell’s Palsy (facial nerve paralysis) considered possibly related to the study vaccine 
LTK63 in a subject who never received any subtype B gp140 protein or any protein with 
MF59 adjuvant. IN vaccination was reactogenic resulting in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_854403], nasal discomfort, pharyngo -laryngeal pain and 
rhinorrhea. The subtype B gp140 MF59 was well tolerated following IM boost.  
Another completed study with [COMPANY_001] subtype B  gp140 MF59 was a multicenter, 
placebo -controlled trial (HVTN 049) conducted by [CONTACT_854454] [21]. 
Subjects received 1 of 3 doses of a DN A/PLG vaccine (subtype B gag DNA/PLG and 
subtype B env DNA/PLG microparticles, at doses of 250/250, 500/500, or 
1000/1000mcg) or placebo (5 to 1 ratio) as a single IM injection at 0, [ADDRESS_1189781] of subtype B gp140 with MF59 (or plac ebo) at 6 and 9 months. An 
additional group of subjects received subtype B gp140 with MF59 without DNA prime, 
administered at 0, 3, and 9 mo nths. Overall 96 healthy, HIV -1–uninfected adult subjects 
were enrolled and [ADDRESS_1189782] had a 
Grade 3 increase in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) to 2311 U/L, [ADDRESS_1189783] had a Grade 4

immunogenicity of 2 boosting doses of [COMPANY_001] subtype C gp140/MF59 or placebo in 
subjects who previously received 3 vaccinations of SAAVI DNA -C2 and 2 vaccinations 
of SAAVI MVA -C. This study enrolled 27 subjects.  There was 1 report of endometrial

reported as an SAE and assessed as unrelated to study agents.  
Two other recent  phase 1 studies with [COMPANY_001] subtype C gp140/MF59 have been 
conducted by [CONTACT_854455] . In addition, 1 phase 1 trial was 
conducted by [CONTACT_854456]à  (ISS) in Italy. One of these trials, HVTN 
088, was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] in order to evaluate the safety and 
immunogen icity of a long -interval, cross -clade subtype C gp140/MF59 boost in subjects 
previously administered subtype B gp120/MF59 or subtype B gp140/MF59 in previous 
trials. This included subjects from the HVTN049 DNA/PLG prime, gp140/MF59 boost 
study described ab ove. The study enrolled [ADDRESS_1189786] been 3 SAEs reported in this trial, 1 involving traumatic injury, 1

cardiomyopathy. All were assessed as not related to the study products.  
The ISS study (ISS P -002) conducted in Italy examin ed the safety and immunogenicity of 
subtype C gp140 co -administered with ISS TAT compared to subtype C gp140 alone or 
TAT alone. The study includes intradermal and IM injections (100 mcg for subtype C 
gp140 and 7.5 mcg for ISS TAT). This study did not include MF59. This study was 
stopped early due to slow enrollment and subsequent expi[INVESTIGATOR_854405] . No SAEs were reported in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summary of immunogenicity from recent hum an experience  
The immunogenicity of [COMPANY_001] recombinant proteins has been demonstrated 
consistently in all clinical trials and in both of the recently completed studies using 
[COMPANY_001] CHO -based subtype B gp140 MF59. In the HVTN 049 DNA/PLG prime protein 
boost study, the primary cellular immunogenicity endpoints included IFN -γ ELISpot and 
ICS responses. Immunogenicity was assessed 14 days after each vaccination. Env -
specific IFN -γ ELISpot response rates did not increase substantially after the 3 1000 -mcg 
DNA/PLG prime vaccinations (6/27) compared to baseline, but did rise after the first 
protein/MF59 boost (14/25). nAb titers against the homologous SF162 isolate were 
undetectable after the third 1000 mcg DNA/PLG priming vaccination. Neutralization was 
booste d to high titers in all subjects following the second protein boost. Similarly in the 
group of subjects who received subtype B gp140/MF59 without a DNA/PLG prime, a 
nearly complete response to the SF162 isolate was observed at the second vaccination (all 
but [ADDRESS_1189788]) which lasted through the third vaccination. Binding Ab titers against Env, 
measured by [CONTACT_28745] -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were detected following the 
first subtype B gp140/MF59 boost and were very high following the second boost 
admin istration  [21].  
The C86P2 MUVAPRED IN study, demonstrated immunogenicity with considerable IgG 
and IgA Ab responses to subtype B gp140 in serum, cervical, and vaginal secretions of 
subjects following IN administration of subtype B gp140 with the adjuvant LTK63 and 
an IM boost with subtype B gp140 and M59 adjuvant. nAb responses against the 
homologous SF162 were also detected in all groups following  IM boost with subtype B 
gp140 and MF59 adjuvant.  
Available data from HVTN 073E show  that boosting with protein improves binding and 
neutralizing antibody responses for DNA/MVA primed subjects. All participants who 
received the protein boost had binding an tibody responses to TV1.[ADDRESS_1189789], neutralizing antibody responses to MW965.26 were seen in 
all participants and persisted in  75% of participants for at least 6 months. Notably, 
neutralizing antibody responses, which were not detected in the main HVTN 073/SAAVI 
[ADDRESS_1189790] in the study extension. In the 
absence of priming, several prot ein administrations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_854406]. That these responses were detected after a single dose

effective way to boost such r esponses.  
In addition, in the subtype C gp140/MF59 HVTN [ADDRESS_1189791] study 16 
previously primed volunteers and 20 naïve volunteers each received 2 doses of the 
subtype C gp140/MF59  given 6 months apart. HIV -1–specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
respon ses were measured by [CONTACT_145648]. Ab responses were measured with a Luminex 
binding Ab assay and a nAb assay in TZM -bl cells. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_145578] (4 -17 years 
from prior protein/MF59 administration), 5 of 16 ( 31%) of primed participants 
demonstrated CD4+ T -cell responses to Env at baseline, which increased to 12 of 16 
(75%) after a single protein boost. IgG and IgA responses to Con S  gp140were present in 
64% (IgG) and 7% (IgA) of primed participants at baseline, and rose to 93% and 85%, 
respectively, after 1 dose of protein. 71% of primed participants demonstrated nAb 
against Tier 1 clade B isolate MN at baseline. After a single booster dose of protein, 
100% of the primed participants neutralized MN and 93% showed neutralizing activity 
against a clade C isolate, MW965.26. Unprimed participants did not demonstrate CD4+ 
responses or Ab responses to Env until after the second dose, which elicited IgG and IgA 
responses to vaccine -matched oligomeric TV1  Env in 88% and 50%, respectively. nAb 
developed to MN i n 38% and to MW965.26 in 88% of the unprimed participants.   
Three of the 4 vaccine regimens in HVTN 086 contained [COMPANY_001] subtype C 
gp140/MF59 , either as a boost following pox -vector (MVA) primes, administered 
concurrently with a pox -vector (MVA) vaccine,  or in a concurrent pox -vector/protein 
boost and second protein boost following DNA plasmid primes. Ab responses were 
measured with a Luminex binding Ab assay and a nAb assay in TZM -bl cells. All three 
vaccine regimens containing subtype C gp140/MF59  elicited high rates (82 –100%) and 
magnitudes of IgG binding Ab against a range of gp120 and gp140 antigens. All vaccine 
regimens had evidence of nAb to (Tier 1) HIV strains MN.3, MW965.26, and SF162.LS, 
with the MVA - and DNA -primed regimens showing the highest titers to MW965.26, a 
clade C strain. HIV-1 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses to global potential T -
cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (PTEg) were measured by [CONTACT_145648].  The MVA - and DNA -primed 
vaccine regimens elicited  the highest rates of CD4+ T cells producing IFN -γ and/or IL -2 
(77% and 45%, respectively), while the regimen with concurrent MVA/protein 
administration elicited the lowest rate (13%).

002 are presented in Section 4.5.3  and 4.5.4 .  
The safety, reactogenicity and tolerability profiles of the vaccine regimens investigated in 
these studies were considered acceptable and are presented below.  
HVTN 041  evaluated a combination vaccine (NefT at and gp120W61D) formulated with 
AS02A (which is an oil -in-water emulsion of a combination of MPL and QS -21, while 
AS01 is a liposomal formulation of the same components) administered at 0, 1 and 3 
months with varying doses (5, 20 and 100 mcg) of the gp12 0 vaccine component (the 
NefTat antigen dose was constant at 20mcg).  
The vaccinations were well tolerated and none were discontinued because of vaccine -
associated reactogenicity. The most common local symptoms were pain and tenderness. 
Systemic symptoms w ere generally mild with the exception of moderate myalgia and 
headache occurring in 20 and 25%, respectively. Both symptoms were evenly distributed 
in the 3 NefTat and gp120W61D groups (20% in each group for myalgia and from 10

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 44 of 155 [2/20 subjects] to 40% [8/20  subjects] per group for headache). Severe pain was observed 
in 2/20 subjects of 2 NefTat and gp120W61D groups (5 mcg and 100 mcg of gp120). 
Severe tenderness was observed in 2/20 subjects of 1 NefTat and gp120W61D group (5 
mcg of gp120). Severe malaise wa s observed in 2/20 subjects of 1 NefTat and 
gp120W61D group (20 mcg of gp120). All vaccine -related reactogenicities were 
transient and had either improved or resolved within 48 h of onset. Grade 4 laboratory 
abnormalities were observed in 1 single particip ant who was administered the AS02A -
adjuvanted NefTat 20 mcg / gp120W61D [ADDRESS_1189792] been due to creatine supplements taken prior to exercise and 
likely not vaccine related. There were 6 serious a dverse events during the trial that 
occurred within 24 hours postvaccination and were felt to be probably or definitely due to 
the immunizations. These included 2 severe local site reactions in group NefTat 20 mcg 
and gp120W61D 5 mcg (associated to limitat ion of limb movement in 1 case), 2 
occurrences of severe malaise in 2 subjects of group NefTat 20 mcg / gp120W61D 20 
mcg, a febrile illness (103.2 ◦F) in [ADDRESS_1189793] of group NefTat 20 mcg / gp120W61D [ADDRESS_1189794] from group NefTat 20 mcg / 
gp120W61D 100 mcg. All of these serious adverse events significantly  improved within 
24 h of onset.  It is important to note that none of these SAEs would be regarded as such 
in accordance with the current ICH E2A definitions.  Grade 3 and Grade 4 related 
Adverse Events were considered SAEs per the “SAE reporting manual” active at the time 
of the study.  
PRO HIV -002 evaluated the gp120W61D 20 mcg / NefTat [ADDRESS_1189795] ems (AS02A, AS02V and 
AS01B), each in [ADDRESS_1189796] all doses (90.4% to 98.8%) 
were follow ed by [CONTACT_2669] 1 solicited or unsolicited symptom considered to be related to 
vaccination with no difference between groups. The reactogenicity profiles obtained in 
the present study were expected and confirmed the previous results obtained with these 
adjuvants. During the course of the study, a total of 14 SAEs were reported in 12 
subjects, none of them was causally related to vaccination.  
Local and general solicited symptoms could be divided into 4 groups given their 
frequency per dose given into bracket s (by [CONTACT_145649]):  
 Pain (between 86.3% and 96.3%) with few grade 3 symptoms (≤ 3.4%).  
 Fatigue (between 33.8% and 46.6%), feverishness (between 22.9% and 53.4%), 
headache (between 35.0% and 48.3%) and myalgia (between 25.8% and 43.3%). 
Few cases of gr ade 3 myalgia and fatigue were reported (≤ 4.2%). For 
feverishness the frequency of grade 3 symptoms was 10.1% and for headache 
was 5.9% in the gp120/ NefTat/ AS01 B group.  
 Redness, swelling, nausea and fever: the frequency of those symptoms did not 
exceed 30.3%. Few grade 3 nausea and fever were reported (≤ 2.1%). The 
frequency of grade 3 redness and swelling was 20.2% and 13.9% respectively in 
the gp120/ NefTat/ AS01 B group.  
 Diarrhea and vomiting: the frequency of these symptoms was less than or equal 
to 7.5%. No grade 3 diarrhea was observed, and only 0.4% of the doses were 
followed by [CONTACT_479] 3 vomiting.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189797] all general symptoms (fatigue, feverishness, headache, myalgia, nausea and fever, 
vomiting) were considered as related to the vaccination, except f or diarrhea.  
The duration of general symptoms was less than or equal to [ADDRESS_1189798] cases whereas 
the duration of local symptoms was often more than 2 days. In the gp120/ NefTat/AS01B 
group the overall frequency of the general symptoms tended to be hig her after the 2nd, 
3rd, or 4th dose of vaccine compared to the first dose (but not for all symptoms and all 
groups).  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs ranged from 78.3% to 83.3%. The most frequently 
reported symptoms were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_854407], followed by 
[CONTACT_145650], injection site pruritus and pharyngeal pain. Less than half 
unsolicited symptoms were causally related to vaccination (incidence between 31.7% and 
36.7%). The most frequent symptoms causally related to v accination were administration 
site reactions (injection site induration, pruritus or warmth) and asthenia. Few grade 3 or 
grade 3 related symptoms occurred: 18 subjects (incidence between 6.7% and 13.3%. 
according to group) experienced grade 3 unsolicited  symptoms, among which a majority 
were non -related infectious conditions (cystitis, gastroenteritis, otitis, pyelonephritis, 
tonsillitis, tooth abscess, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_854408]). 6 of 
them had symptoms considered to be cau sally related to vaccination (lymphadenopathy, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], application site hyperesthesia, asthenia, muscle rigidity, headache, and 
tremor).  
No significant changes in laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) 
and vital signs were  observed throughout the study.  
PRO HIV -005 evaluated an HIV vaccine candidate consisting of a recombinant fusion 
protein (F4) containing 4 HIV -1 clade B antigens (Gag p24, Pol -RT, Nef, and Gag p17) 
adjuvanted with AS01B in 3 different doses: 10, 30, and 90mcg.  Each dose of the 
AS01B -adjuvanted vaccine candidate was administered twice in a group of 50 subjects, 
following a Month 0 and Month 1 schedule. Three control groups of 10 subjects received 
a dose of 10, 30 or 90 mcg F4 in water for injection (WFI).  
React ogenicity was higher during the 7 -day period after each vaccine dose in the 
F4/AS01 groups than in the F4 in WFI groups. The incidence of local and general 
symptoms tended to be higher in the F4/AS01 groups after the second vaccine dose. Pain 
was the most common solicited local symptom, reported after 96.0% –98.0% of doses in 
the F4/AS01 groups and after 10.0% –30.0% of doses in the F4 in WFI groups (grade 3 
severity after 5.0% -10.1% of doses in the F4/AS01 groups). Fatigue was the most 
common solicited gener al symptom, reported after 66.0% -77.8% and 30.0% -45.0% of 
doses in the F4/AS01 and F4 in WFI groups, respectively (grade 3 severity after 7.0% -
12.1% of doses in the F4/AS01 groups). Fever of more than 39°C was reported in 3.0%, 
2.0% and 1.0% of the doses i n the respective 10, 30 and 100 mcg F4/AS01 groups). No 
solicited local or general grade 3 symptoms were reported in the F4 in WFI groups. No 
differences in reactogenicity were observed between the antigen dose levels in the 
F4/AS01 groups. During the 30 -day postvaccination period, 60.0% –84.0% of subjects in 
the F4/AS01 groups reported unsolicited symptoms, compared with 50.0% –70.0% in the 
F4 in WFI groups. In the F4/AS01 groups, unsolicited symptoms (mainly chills and 
injection site reactions) were conside red causally related to vaccination in 30.0% –44.0% 
of subjects and were of grade 3 severity in <10.0%. All related symptoms were transient 
and resolved without sequelae, generally within 2 –3 days. Six serious adverse events 
were reported in the F4/AS01 gro ups, all considered unrelated to vaccination No subjects 
died during the study period, and no subject withdrew because of adverse events.

(PRO HIV -005) received a (third) single booster dose of F4 10 mcg / AS01B.  
93.3% (ie, 14 out of 15 subjects) of the subjects reported at least 1 AE and 40% (ie, 6 out 
of 15 subjects) of the subjects in the group F4 reported at least [ADDRESS_1189799] frequent 
solicited local AE. Grade 3 pain (13.3% or in 2 out of 15 subjects), redness (in 6.7% or in 
1 out of 15 subjects) or swelling (in 13.3% or in 2 out of 13 subjects) were reported for a 
maximum duration of [ADDRESS_1189800] frequently reported 
solicited general AEs. Fever was recorded in 6 out of 15 subjects (40%) within the 2 days 
after vaccination. Grade 3 fatigue (in 20% or in 3 out of 15 subjects) or fever (in 1 out of 
15 subjec ts) was reported with a maximum duration of 1 day. Grade 3 unsolicited AEs 
were reported by 13.3%  (ie, 2 out of 15 subjects). Out of these cases, 2 cases were 
considered by [CONTACT_854457]: 1 case of chills and 1 
case of insomnia. All of the grade 3 unsolicited AEs were resolved without sequelae. No 
subjects died, experienced an SAE, or withdrew due to an AE.

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 50 of 155 6 Statistical considerations  
6.1 Accrual and sample size calculations  
Recruitment will target enrolling 334 healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants ages 18 -
40 in Southern Africa and the [LOCATION_002]. Participants will be randomized to 8 
treatment groups (7 vaccine groups and 1 placebo group).  Vaccine groups [ADDRESS_1189801] 3 different boosts consisting of DNA coadministered with a 
protein/adjuvant combination (gp120 proteins at 100 mcg with MF59 adjuvant, gp120 
proteins at 100 mcg with AS01 B, or gp120 proteins at 20 mcg with AS01 B) at 2 
timepoints.  In groups 4 -6 the DNA is co administered with 1 of the protein/adjuvant 
combinations at 3 timepoints. An additional vaccine group (group 7) will test the proteins 
alone at the 20 mcg dose adjuvanted with AS01 B administered at 3 timepoints. Groups 2, 
3 and 5 -7 will enroll 50 participa nts per group. Groups 1 and 4 evaluating the proteins 
adjuvanted with MF59 will enroll 30 participants per group as these two vaccine 
regimens are also being evaluated in HVTN 111 at sites in Southern Africa (HVTN 111 , 
n=30 per group). Evaluation of these  2 regimens will pool data from HVTN 108 and 
HVTN 111 for a total of 60 participants per group. The primary purpose of the placebo 
group (Group 8 n=24) is to ensure blinding. To ensure that both men and women will be 
adequately represented in the trial, th e trial will enroll at least approximately 40% of each 
sex overall. Hence, when approximately [ADDRESS_1189802] study vaccinati on, all participants 
will provide some safety data. However, for immunogenicity analyses, it is possible that 
data may be missing for various reasons, such as participants terminating from the study 
early, problems in shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], low cell viability  of processed peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or high background. Immunogenicity data from 17 phase 1 
and 2 phase 2a HVTN vaccine trials, which began enrolling after June 2005 (data as of 
September 2014), indicate that 15% is a reasonable estima te for the rate of missing data 
at Month 6.5.  For this reason, the sample size calculations in Section 6.1.2  for n=[ADDRESS_1189803] administration. Various statistic al considerations for safety assessment are 
addressed below based on groups with n=50. The statistical properties for the combined 
safety data from the MF59 regimens in 108 and 111 (n=60 for each) will be slightly 
better than the properties for n=[ADDRESS_1189804] serious adverse events (SAEs) (See Section  11.2) can be 
expressed by [CONTACT_115608] 1  SAE would likely be observed and 
the true event rate below which no events would likely be observed. Specifically, for each 
group of the study (n = 50), there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true 
rate of such an event is 4.5% or more; and there is a 90% chance of observing no events 
if the true rate is 0.2% or less. As a reference, in HVTN vaccine trials from December 
2000 through April 2014, about 4% of participants who received placebos experienced an 
SAE.

of the 95% confidence interval for the true rate of an adverse event based on the observed 
data. Table 6-2 shows the 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals for the probability of an 
event based on a particular observed rate. Calculations are done using the score test 
method [73]. If none of the 50 participants receiving a vaccine regimen experience a 
safety event, the 95% 2 -sided upper confidence bound for the true rate for such an event 
is 7.1%.

6.1.2  Sample size calculations for immunogenicity  
The primary immunogenicity evaluation of each vaccine regimen will be an assessment 
of whether the regimen meets  the ‘adequate take/potency’ (ATP) condition s, which are 
based on the assessment of the primary immunogenicity endpoints (section 5.1). For 
purposes of power and type 1 error calculations  we use ATP conditions  as defined in 
Table 6-3 based upon 11 endpoints from 4 immunogenicity assays.  The assessment of the 
group 1 and 4 vaccine regimens, which use the MF59 adjuvant, will be based on the 
pooled HVTN 108 and HVTN 111 data.  Since our knowledge of the importance of 
immunologic endpoints i s evolving with time, changes may be made to the ATP 
definition prior to ATP assessment. The final criteria used to assess the ATP condition, 
once the trial is complete, and before analysis has commenced, will be defined in the 
HVTN 108 Statistical Analysi s Plan (SAP).  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 52 of 155 Table 6-3 Adequate take/potency definition for power and type 1 error calculations (as of 
January 2015), ATP is established as meeting criterion (1) and at least 2 of criteria (2) - (4).  
Immunog enicity endpoints  Criteria  
(1) 1 -3 endpoints: IgG binding antibodies 
to 3 vaccine -matched gp120 proteins  1. For ≥ 2 gp120s the LL of the 95% CI for 
vaccine response rate > 65%  
(2) 4 -6 endpoints: IgG binding to a panel of 
3 scaffolded -V1V2 proteins  2. For ≥ 1 V1V2 variable the LL of the 95% 
CI for vaccine response rate > 30%  
(3) 7 -9 endpoints: Neutralizing antibodies 
to 3 vaccine -matched gp120 pseudoviruses  3. For ≥ 1 gp120 pseudoviruses the LL of the 
95% CI for vaccine response rate > 30%  
(4) 10 -11 endpoints: CD4+ and CD8+ T -
cell response to at least 1 peptide pool  4. The LL of the 95% CI for either CD4+ or 
CD8+ response rate to at least 1 peptide pool 
> 30%  
Criteria for ‘adequate take/potency’ for each category of endpoints are presente d in the 
right column of Table 6-3 based on comparing the lower limits (LL) of the 95% CIs for 
the crude positive response rates with the thresholds for the category.  These criteria have 
largely been chosen to reflect the findings of the correlates analysis performed in the 
wake of the RV 144 trial (see Section 4.1.2 ). Future ph ase 2b efficacy testing will target 
vaccine efficacy (VE) of at least 40%; therefore, we would like to screen out regimens 
that have an immunogenicity profile that is unlikely to provide this level of efficacy. In 
particular:  
1. The first category includes 3 variables measuring IgG binding antibodies to each of 
the 3 vaccine -matched gp120s. The criterion will be satisfied for this category if for 
≥2 gp120s the LL of the 95% CI for vaccine response rate is greater than 65%. The 
rationale for choosing this 65% t hreshold is the belief that high rates of homologous 
IgG binding antibodies are likely to be necessary for a vaccine to prevent HIV 
infection with VE of at least 40%.  
2. The second category includes IgG binding antibodies to a panel of scaffolded -V1V2 
proteins. IgG binding antibodies to V1V2 proteins have been identified as an immune 
correlate of risk in RV144 with a response rate of 64% (LL 58%). The criterion will 
be sat isfied for this category if for ≥1 V1V2 endpoint the LL of the 95% CI for 
vaccine response rate is greater than 30%. The rationale for choosing this 30% 
threshold is to screen out regimens that have very low chance of achieving 40%VE; 
note that a perfect b inary correlate of protection would require a 40% response rate to 
achieve 40% VE.  
3. The third category includes neutralizing antibody (Nab) to vaccine -matched gp120s. 
Nab are generally believed to be important for preventing infectious diseases. The 
criter ion will be satisfied for this category if for ≥1 gp120s pseudoviruses the LL of 
the 95% CI for vaccine response rate is greater than 30%. The rationale for choosing 
this 30% % threshold is to screen out regimens that have very low chance of 
achieving 40%V E. 
4. The fourth category includes CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell responses to vaccine -matched 
peptide pools. Adequate T -cell responses may be necessary for an efficacious 
vaccine. The estimated CD4+ T -cell response rate was 74% (LL 68%) in RV144.The 
criterion will be satisfied for this category if the LL of the 95% CI for either CD4+ or 
CD8+ T -cell response rates to at least 1 peptide pool is greater than 30%. The 
rationale for choosing this 30% threshold is to screen out regimens that have very 
low chance of achieving  40%VE.

out of categories 2 -4.  
Figure 6-1 addresses the power and type 1 error for passing ATP for a regimen of size 43, 
which allows for missing assay data from 15% of participants  in a group with 50 
participants enrolled . Among all pos sible configurations of the 11 endpoints in Table 6-3 
(based on the endpoint either passing or failing it’s individual pre -specified lower 
confidence limit threshold criteria), the minimum probability that a vaccine regimen 
passes the ATP condition given that it truly meets the condition and the maximum 
probability that a vaccine regimen passes the ATP condition given that it does not truly 
meet the condition are shown in Figure 6-1 for varying values of δ, where  δ is the  
difference between the true response rate of an endpoint that passes the individual criteria 
and the lower confidence limit threshold. These calculations assume each individual 
endpoint either has positive response rate = lower confidence limit threshold (fails 
threshold criteria) or has positive response rate = threshold + δ (passes threshold criteria). 
The threshold value is used to define failure of the endpoint so that calculations provide 
the minimum power [P(Pass ATP|ATP)] and maximum Type 1 error [P (Pass ATP|Not 
ATP)].  With [ADDRESS_1189807] 80% when δ= 24%; and the probability of incorrectly identifying ATP for a 
vaccine regimen is at most  18% for δ ≤ 30% ( Figure 6-1) (note that a vaccine does not 
satisfy the adequate take/potency condition if ≥ [ADDRESS_1189808] category fail or all 
endpoints in 2 or more of categories 2 -4 fail).  The gro up 1 and 4 regimens  (HVTN 108 
and 111 pooled data) will have slightly better properties with anticipated sample size of 
51 participants  evaluable for ATP.  These simulations are based on 10,000 simulated 
datasets and use an exchangeable correlation structur e between responses with pairwise 
correlations of 0.3 (a modest correlation based on RV144 data).

positive response ra te = δ% + threshold and an endpoint that fails its threshold criteria has 
positive response rate equal to the prespecified threshold.

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 55 of 155 maintaining security of the treatment assignments (except in emergency situations as 
specified in the HVTN MOP). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_101820] 
(South ern Africa  and US).  
6.3 Blinding  
Participants and site staff (except for site pharmacists) will be blinded as to participant 
treatment group assignments. Study product assignments are accessible to those HVTN 
CRS pharmacists, DAIDS protocol pharmacists and co ntract monitors, and SDMC staff 
who are required to know this information in order to ensure proper trial conduct. Any 
discussion of study product assignment between pharmacy staff and any other HVTN 
CRS staff is prohibited. The HVTN SMB members also are u nblinded to treatment 
assignment in order to conduct review of trial safety.  
When a participant leaves the trial prior to study completion, the participant will be told 
he or she must wait until all participants are unblinded to learn his or her treatment  
assignment.  
Emergency unblinding decisions will be made by [CONTACT_6962]. If time permits, 
the HVTN 108 Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) should be consulted before 
emergency unblinding occurs.  
6.4 Statistical analyses  
This section describes the fin al study analyses, unblinded as to treatment group 
assignment. Data from enrolled participants will be analyzed according to the initial 
randomization assignment regardless of how many vaccinations they received. In the rare 
instance that a participant rec eives the wrong treatment at a specific vaccination time, the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will address how to analyze the participant’s safety data. 
Analyses are modified intent -to-treat analysis in that individuals who are randomized but 
not enrolled do not contribute data and hence are excluded. Because of blinding and the 
brief length of time between randomization and enrollment —typi[INVESTIGATOR_106742] 4 
working days —very few such individuals are expected.  
Analyses for primary endpoints will be perfor med using SAS and R. All other descriptive 
and inferential statistical analyses will be performed using SAS, StatXact, or R statistical 
software.  
No formal multiple comparison adjustments will be employed for multiple safety 
endpoints, multiple primary imm unogenicity endpoints, or secondary endpoints. 
However, multiplicity adjustments will be made for certain immunogenicity assays 
specified  in the SAP, when the assay is viewed as a collection of hypotheses ( eg, testing 
multiple peptide pools to determine a positive response).  
Data from HVTN 108 and 111 will be combined to assess the safety and immunogenicity 
of the MF59 regimens. Data from these studies may be evaluated with data from other  
phase 1/2a studies within the P5 partnership HIV vaccine program . Comparable 
eligibility criteria and validated assays for primary immunogenicity endpoints will be 
used to mitigate the potential bias introduced by [CONTACT_854459].

immunogenicity for primary - and secondary -objective analyses.  
6.4.2  Baseline comparability  
Treatment groups will be compared for baseline participant characteristics using 
descriptive statistics.  
6.4.3  Safety/tolerability analysis  
Since enrollment is concurrent with receiving the first vaccination, all participants will 
have received at least 1 vaccination and therefore will provide some safety data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reactogenicity  
The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of reactogenicity sign 
or symptom will be tabulated by [CONTACT_854460]. For a given sign or symptom, each participant’s 
reactogenicity will be counted once under the maximum severity for all injection visits. 
In addition, to the individual types of events, the maximum severity of local pain or 
tenderness, induration or erythema, and of systemic symptoms will be calculated. 
Kruskal -Wallis tests will be used to  test for differences in severity between groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs and SAEs  
AEs will be summarized using MedDRA System Organ Class and preferred terms. 
Tables will show by [CONTACT_854461] a System Orga n Class or within preferred term category by 
[CONTACT_145661]. For the calculations in these tables, a 
participant with multiple AEs within a category will be counted once under the maximum 
severity or the strongest recorded cau sal relationship to study product. Formal statistical 
testing comparing groups is not planned since interpretation of differences must rely 
heavily upon clinical judgment.  
A listing of SAEs reported to the DAIDS Regulatory Support Center (RSC) Safety Offic e 
will provide details of the events including severity, relationship to study product, time 
between onset and last vaccination, and number of vaccinations received. A separate 
listing will do the same for AEs of special interest (AESI). AESI for this prot ocol include 
but are not limited to potential immune -mediated disorders; a sample list of AESI is 
provided in Appendix J . These listings will be submitted to the FDA in all annual reports 
and clinical trial reports.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local laborator y values  
Box plots of local laboratory values will be generated for baseline values and for values 
measured during the course of the study by [CONTACT_6982]. Each box plot will 
show the first quartile, the median, and the third quartile. Outlie rs (values outside the box 
plot) will also be plotted. If appropriate, horizontal lines representing boundaries for 
abnormal values will be plotted.  
For each local laboratory measure, summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_854462] , as well as changes from baseline for postenrollment values. In 
addition, the numbers (percentages) of participants with local laboratory values recorded 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 57 of 155 as meeting Grade 1 AE criteria or above as specified in the DAIDS AE Grading Table 
(see Section 11.2) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_854463] . Reportable clinical laboratory abnormalities without an associated clinical 
diagnosis will al so be included in the tabulation of AEs described above.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for vaccination discontinuation and early study termination  
The number and percentage of participants who discontinue vaccination and who 
terminate the study early will be tabulated by [CONTACT_854464].  
6.4.4  Immunogenicity analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General approach  
For the statistical analysis of immunogenicity endpoints, data from enrolled participants 
will be used according to the initial randomization assignment regardless of how many 
injections they r eceived. Additional analyses may be performed, limited to participants 
who received all scheduled injections per protocol. Assay results that are unreliable, from 
specimens collected outside of the visit window, or from HIV -infected participants 
postinfect ion are excluded. Since the exact date of HIV infection is unknown, any assay 
data from blood draws 4 weeks prior to an infected participant’s last seronegative sample 
and thereafter may be excluded. If an HIV -infected participant does not have a 
seronegat ive sample postenrollment, then all data from that participant may be excluded 
from the analysis.  
For each of the 11 primary endpoints listed in Table 6-3, response r ates will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_854465]. For CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
response, response rates to the individual peptide pools will also  be calculated. Crude 
response rates will be presented with their corresponding 95% confidence interval 
estimate calculated using the score test method [73]. For secondary and exploratory assay 
endpoints, response rates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated if appropriate 
for the endpoint. Criteria for a positive response for an assay will be described in the 
SAP.  
All of the primary assays, and likely som e of the secondary assays, will have quantitative 
assay data, including IgG binding antibody magnitude, neutralizing antibody titers, area 
under the magnitude -breadth curve [AUC -MB] for the neutralizing antibody assay, and 
percentage of positive cells from  the ICS assay. Quantitative data will be displayed as 
graphical and tabular summaries of the distributions by [CONTACT_488], treatment group, and 
timepoint . For all primary and secondary immunogenicity endpoints, box plots and plots 
of estimated reverse cumulat ive distribution curves will be presented  by [CONTACT_19313].  
Formal statistical comparisons between individual arms is not the primary objective of 
the trial, although these are likely to be made to better understand the effect of adjuvants 
on immune response and t he effect of dose for arms adjuvanted with AS01 B. For 
comparisons in which the response rate for 1 of the groups is low (eg, ≤ 20% for the 
class), statistical testing will use Fisher’s exact test comparing the [ADDRESS_1189812] of the continuous dat a readouts would be left censored at the lower limit of 
detection.  For comparisons in which the response rates for both groups are high (eg, ≥ 
75%), t he difference between groups will be tested using the continuous readouts with a 
nonparametric Wilcoxon ra nk sum test if the data are not normally distributed and with a 
2-sample t -test if the data appear to be normally distributed.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189813] underlying continuous or count -type readout that are 
dichotomized into responder/nonresponder categ ories (eg, CD4+ T cell response). If 
treatment group differences for these assays are best summarized by a mixture model of 
response rates and magnitudes,  then Lachenbruch’s test statistic [74] will be used to 
evaluate the composite null hypothesis of equal response rates in the [ADDRESS_1189814] statistic equals 
the square of a binomial Z -statistic for comparing the response rates plus the square of a 
Wilcoxon statistic for comparing the respons e distributions in the subgroup of 
responders. A permutation procedure is used to obtain a 2 -sided p -value.  For estimation, 
differences in response rates between groups will be estimated using the methods 
described above, and in the subgroup of positive re sponders, differences in location 
parameters between groups will be estimated using the methods described above.  
Based upon previous HVTN trials, missing 15% of immunogenicity results for a specific 
assay is common due to study participants terminating fro m the study early, problems in 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_36406], or low cell viability of processed PBMCs. To achieve unbiased 
statistical estimation and inferences with standard methods applied in a complete -case 
manner (only including participants with observed data i n the analysis), missing data 
need to be missing completely at random (MCAR). Following the most commonly used 
definition, MCAR assumes that the probability of an observation being missing does not 
depend on any participant characteristics (observed or uno bserved). When missing data 
are minimal (specifically, if no more than 20% of participants are missing any values), 
then standard complete -case methods will be used, because violations of the MCAR 
assumption will have little impact on the estimates.  
If a substantial amount of immunogenicity data are missing (at least 1 value missing from 
more than 20% of participants), then using the methods that require the MCAR 
assumption may give misleading results. In this situation, analyses of the immunogenicity 
endp oints at a specific timepoint will be performed using parametric generalized linear 
models fit by [CONTACT_54683]. These methods provide unbiased estimation and 
inferences under the parametric modeling assumptions and the assumption that the 
missing dat a are missing at random (MAR). MAR assumes that the probability of an 
observation being missing may depend upon the observed responses and upon observed 
covariates, but not upon any unobserved factors. Generalized linear models for response 
rates will use a binomial error distribution and for quantitative endpoints, a normal error 
distribution. For assessing repeated immunogenicity measurement, linear mixed effects 
models will be used. If the immunological outcomes are left - and/or right - censored, then 
the linear mixed effects models of Hughes [75] will be used, because they accommodate 
the censoring. In add ition, secondary analyses of repeated immunogenicity measurements 
may be done using weighted GEE [76] methods, which are valid under MAR. All of the 
models described above will include as covariates all available baseline predictors of the 
missing outcomes.  
6.4.5  Analyses prior to end of  scheduled follow -up visits  
Any analyses conducted prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits should not 
compromise the integrity of the trial in terms of participant retention or safety or 
immunogenicity endpoint assessments. In particular, early unblinded analyses by 
[CONTACT_432194] a 
need to know basis only.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016

During the course of the trial, unblinded analyses of safety data will be prepared 
approximately every [ADDRESS_1189815] approve any other requests for unblinded safety data 
prior to the end of the scheduled follow -up visits.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunogenicity  
An unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_106882] a primary immunogenicity 
endpoint may be performed when all participan ts have completed the 6.[ADDRESS_1189816] 80% of these 
participants. Analysis of secondary endpoints (ie, additional immunogenicity assays) will 
occur after the unblinded primary immunoge nicity analysis since selection of secondary 
assays is dependent upon the primary analysis. Analysis of exploratory objectives 
(including the month 12 timepoint ) will take place after the primary analysis. An 
unblinded statistical analysis by [CONTACT_854466] a secondary or exploratory 
immunogenicity endpoint may be performed when all participants have completed the 
corresponding immunogenicity visit and data are available for analysis from at least 80% 
of these participants. The Laboratory Program w ill review the analysis report prior to 
distribution to the protocol chairs, DAIDS, vaccine developer, and other key HVTN 
members and investigators. Distribution of reports will be limited to those with a need to 
know for the purpose of informing future tr ial-related decisions. The HVTN leadership 
must approve any other requests for HVTN immunogenicity analyses prior to the end of 
the scheduled follow -up visits.

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 60 of 155 7 Selection and withdrawal of participants  
Participants will be healthy, HIV uninfected (seronegative) adults who comprehend the 
purpose of the study and have provided written informed consent. Volunteers will be 
recruited and screened; those determined to be eligible, based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study. Final eligibility determination will 
depend on results of laboratory tests, medical history, physical examinations, and answers 
to self -administered and/or interview questions.  
Investigators should always u se good clinical judgment in considering a volunteer’s 
overall fitness for trial participation. Some volunteers may not be appropriate for 
enrollment even if they meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Medical, psychiatric, 
occupational, or other condition s may make evaluation of safety and/or immunogenicity 
difficult, and some volunteers may be poor candidates for retention.  
Determination of eligibility, taking into account all inclusion and exclusion criteria, must 
be made within 56 days prior to enrollme nt unless otherwise noted in sections 7.1 and

7.3 Participant departure from vaccination schedule or withdrawal  
This section concerns an individual participant’s departure from the vaccination schedule. 
Pause rules for the trial as a whole are described in Section 11.3. 
7.3.1  Delaying vaccinations for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, a participant’s scheduled vaccination will be delayed. The 
factors to be considered in such a decision include but are not limited to the following:  
 Within 45 days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of blood products or immunoglobulin  
 Within 30 days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of live attenuated vaccines other than influenza vaccine  
 Receipt of allergy treatment with antigen injections  
 Within 14 days prior to any study injection  
 Receipt of influenza vaccine or any vaccines that are not live attenuated vaccines 
(eg, pneumococcal)  
 Pre-vaccination abnormal vital signs or clinical symptoms that may mask assessment 
of vaccine reaction.  
 Pregnancy: for participants who become pregnant, no study vaccinations will be 
given; except for participants who may have been pregnant during the study but are 
no longer pregnant as shown  by 2 negative urine pregnancy tests taken from 2 
different urine samples  that may be collected on the same day ; in this circumstance, 
the HVTN 108  PSRT should be consulted to determine if the participant may resume 
vaccina tions.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 67 of 155 Vaccinations should not be administered outside the visit window period specified in the 
HVTN 108  Study Specific Procedures.  
In order to avoid vaccination delays and missed vaccinations, participants who plan to 
receive licensed vaccines or allergy treatments should be counseled to schedule receipt of 
these substances, when possible, outside the intervals indicated above. The effects of 
these substances on safety and immunogenicity assessments and their interactions with 
study vaccines are unknown. Therefore, if circumstances allow, these substances should 
also be avoided in the interval between a study vaccination and completion of the 2 week 
postvaccination follow -up visit.  
7.3.2  Participant departure from vaccination sch edule  
Every effort should be made to follow the vaccination schedule per the protocol. If a 
participant misses a vaccination and the visit window period for the vaccination has 
passed, that vaccination cannot be given. The participant should be asked to co ntinue 
study visits. The participant should resume the vaccination schedule with the next 
vaccination unless there are circumstances that require further delay or permanent 
discontinuation of vaccination (see Sections 7.3.1  and 7.3.3 ).  
7.3.3  Discontinuing vaccination for a participant  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant’s vaccinations will be permanently 
discontinued. Specific events that will result in stop pi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a participant’s vaccination 
schedule include:  
 Co-enrollment in a study with an investigational research agent (rare exceptions 
allowing for the continuation of vaccinations may be granted with the unanimous 
consent of the HVTN 108  PSRT).  
 Clinically significant condition (ie, a condition that affects the immune system or for 
which continued vaccinations and/or blood draws may pose additional risk), 
including but not limited to the following:  
 Pregnancy (vaccinations will b e stopped while a participant is pregnant. If the 
participant is no longer pregnant and can be vaccinated within an appropriate 
visit window, vaccinations may resume, see Section 7.3.1 ); 
 Any grade 4 local or systemic reactogenicity symptom, or AE that is 
subsequently considered to be related to vaccination;  
 Any grade 3 clinical AE (exception: fever or vomiting and subjective local and 
systemic symptoms) that is subse quently considered to be related to vaccination;  
 Any grade 3 or 4 lab abnormality confirmed by a repeated value that is 
subsequently considered to be related to vaccination. Upon PSRT review the 
participant may be allowed to continue study vaccinations.  
 Clinically significant type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associated with study 
vaccination. Consultation with the HVTN 108  PSRT is required prior to 
subsequent vaccinations following any type 1 hypersensitivity reaction associ ated 
with study vaccination; or  
 Investigator determination in consultation with Protocol Team leadership (eg, for 
repeated nonadherence to study staff instructions).  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 68 of 155  A study participant who misses  a study injection  is permitted to continue with 
subsequent study injections that can still be scheduled within the time interval 
specified in the HVTN 108  Study Specific Procedures  (SSP) unless there is a 
protocol -mandated reason for discont inuation.  
Such participants should be counseled on the importance of continuing with the study and 
strongly encouraged to participate in follow -up visits and protocol -related procedures per 
the protocol for the remainder of the trial, unless medically cont raindicated.  
In addition, vaccinations will be stopped for participants diagnosed with HIV infection. 
HIV-infected participants will not continue in the trial (see Sections 7.3.4  and 9.8.1 ). 
7.3.4  Participant termination from the study  
Under certain circumstances, an individual participant may be terminated from 
participation in this study. Specific events that will result in early termination include:  
 Participant refuses further participation,  
 Participant relocates and remote follow -up or transfer to another HVTN CRS is not 
possible,  
 HVTN CRS dete rmines that the participant is lost to follow -up,  
 Participant becomes HIV infected, or  
 Investigator decides, in consultation with Protocol Team leadership, to terminate 
participation (eg, if participant exhibits inappropriat e behavior toward clinic staff ), or 
 Any condition where termination from the study is required by [CONTACT_106887].

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 80 of 155 9 Clinical procedures  
The schedule of clinical procedures is shown in Appendix H . 
9.1 Informed consent  
Informed consent is the process of working with participants so that they fully understand 
what will and may happen to them  while participating in a research study. The HVTN 
informed consent form documents that a participant (1) has been informed about the 
potential risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation, and (2) is willing to participate 
in an HVTN study. Informed  consent encompasses all written or verbal study information 
HVTN CRS staff provide to the participant, before and during the trial. HVTN CRS staff 
will obtain informed consent of participants according to HVTN policies and procedures.  
The informed consent  process continues throughout the study. Key study concepts should 
be reviewed periodically with the participant and the review should be documented. At 
each study visit, HVTN CRS staff should consider reviewing the procedures and 
requirements for that vis it and for the remaining visits. Additionally, if any new 
information is learned that might affect the participants’ decisions to stay in the trial, this 
information will be shared with trial participants. If necessary, participants will be asked 
to sign r evised informed consent forms.  
An HVTN CRS may employ recruitment efforts prior to the participant consenting. For 
example, some HVTN CRSs use a telephone script to prescreen people before they come 
to the clinic for a full screening visit. Participants mu st sign a screening or protocol -
specific consent before any procedures are performed to determine eligibility. HVTN 
CRSs must submit recruitment and prescreening materials to their IRB/EC and any 
applicable Regulatory Entity (RE) for human subjects protect ion review and approval.  
Note: As defined in the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual, an RE is “Any group other 
than the local IRB/EC responsible for reviewing and/or approving a clinical research 
protocol and site -specific ICFs [informed consent forms] pri or to implementation at a 
site.” CRSs are responsible for knowing the requirements of their applicable REs.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1189858] approval from their IRB/EC and any applicable RE to use a 
general screening consent form that allows screening for an unspecified HIV vaccine 
trial. In this way, HVTN CRS staff can  continually screen potential participants and, 
when needed, proceed quickly to obtain protocol -specific enrollment consent. Sites 
conducting general screening or prescreening approved by [CONTACT_11577]/EC and any 
applicable RE may use the results from this scr eening to determine eligibility for this 
protocol, provided the tests are conducted within the time periods specified in the 
eligibility criteria.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 81 of 155 9.1.2  Protocol -specific consent forms  
The protocol -specific consent forms describe the study products to be used a nd all 
aspects of protocol participation, including screening and enrollment procedures. A 
sample protocol -specific consent form for the main study is located in Appendix A .  
A separate sample consent form for other uses of specimens is located in Appendix D. 
Each HVTN CRS is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol -specific consent form(s) for 
local use, based on the sample prot ocol-specific consent forms in Appendix A  and 
Appendix D . The consent form(s) must be developed in accordance with the  
requirements of the following:  
 CRS’s IRB/EC,  
 CRS’s institution and any applicable REs, and  
 Elements of informed consent as described in Title 45, CFR Part 46 and Title 21 
CFR, Part 50, and in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6, Good 
Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance 4.8.  
Study sites are strongly encouraged to have their local CABs review their sites -specific 
consent forms. This review should include, but should not be limited to, issues of cultural 
competence, local language cons iderations, and the level of understandability.  
The sample informed consent form includes instructions throughout the document for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_115539].  
Sites should follow the instructions in the Protocol -specific Official Memo distributed 
along wi th this protocol regarding when they may begin using their site -specific protocol 
consent forms.  
Regarding protocol registration, sites should follow procedures outlined in the current 
version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_1189859] on the procedures and issues 
presented, and answering all questions completely.  
An Assessment of Understanding is used to document the participant’s understanding of 
key concepts in this HIV vaccine trial. The participant must complete the Assessment of 
Understanding before en rollment. Staff may provide assistance in reading and 
understanding the questions and responses, if necessary. Participants must verbalize 
understanding of all questions answered incorrectly. This process and the participant’s 
understanding of the key conc epts should be recorded in source documentation at the site.  
IRB/EC and any applicable RE may require that a participant has signed either a 
screening or protocol -specific consent document prior to administering the Assessment of 
Understanding. The consent  process (including the use of the Assessment of 
Understanding) should be explained thoroughly to the IRB/EC and any applicable RE, 
whose recommendations should be followed.

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 82 of 155 9.2 Pre-enrollment procedures  
Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/ visits, up to and including before 
vaccination on day 0. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must be assessed within 56 
days before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the eligibility criteria (or below in 
this section).  
After the appropriate inform ed consent has been obtained and before enrollment, the 
following procedures are performed:  
 Medical history, documented in the case history record;  
 Assessment of Understanding (see Section 9.1.3 ); 
 Assessment of whether the volunteer is at low risk for HIV infection;  
 Complete physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs, and clinical 
assessments of head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; n eck; lymph nodes; heart; chest; 
abdomen; extremities; neurological function; and skin;  
 Assessment of concomitant medications the volunteer is taking, including 
prescription and nonprescription drugs, vitamins, topi[INVESTIGATOR_49186], 
alternative/complementary me dicines (eg, herbal and health food supplements), 
recreational drugs, vaccinations, and allergy shots;  
 Laboratory tests as defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, including:  
 Screening HIV test,  
 CBC with differential and platelet count,  
 Chemistry  panel (ALT, AST, ALP, and creatinine),  
 Urine dipstick (urinalysis if indicated, see Section 9.10), 
 HBsAg,  
 Anti-HCV Ab,  
 Syphilis test,  
 Urine or serum pregnancy te st (volunteers who were born female);  
 Pap smear (only for volunteers 21 years or older who were born female and who 
agree to provide cervical samples ; for specific requirements see Section 7.1, 
Bullet 24); 
 Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
 Obtaining of volunteer demographics in compliance with the NI H Policy on 
Reporting Race and Ethnicity Data: Subjects in Clinical Research, Aug. 8, 2001 
(available at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-01-053.html);  
 Counseling on HIV testing and risk reduction, performed in compliance with the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s current guidelines or other local 
guidelines for HIV counseling, testing, and referral as described in Section 9.8; and  
HVTN 10 8, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 83 of 155  Discussion of pregnancy prevention. A pregnant or breastfeeding person may not be 
enrolled in this trial. Specific criteria and assessment of contraception and pregnancy 
status are described in study inclusion criteria. Discussion of pregnancy prev ention 
includes advising a participant who was born female and who reports no current 
sexual activity that could lead to that participant becoming pregnant to have a plan to 
begin adequate birth control. This plan would be put to use if, during the study, the 
participant becomes sexually active in a way that could lead to that participant 
becoming pregnant.  
9.2.1  Use of screening results from another HVTN study  
If a participant screens for an HVTN study at the same HVTN CRS but then does not join 
that study, screening results from that effort may be applied to the screening for this 
protocol, as long as the screening was done under participant consent, the partic ipant has 
signed a consent form to begin screening for this study, and the tests were conducted 
within the time periods specified in the eligibility criteria (see Sections 7.1 and 7.2). 
9.[ADDRESS_1189860] vaccination. The time interval between 
randomization and enrollment should not exceed 4 working days. The HVTN CRS 
randomizes the participant  via the Web -based randomization system  as described in the 
HVTN 108 Study Specific Procedures . Circumstances may require a participant’s 
enrollment visit to be changed. This may exceed the 4 -day randomization time limit.  
At all vac cination visits, the following procedures are performed before vaccination:  
 Abbreviated physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a symptom -
directed evaluation by [CONTACT_106903]/or appropriate physical exam based on participant 
self-reported sy mptoms or complaints;  
 Assessment of baseline reactogenicity parameters;  
 Assessment of concomitant medications (as described in Section 9.2); 
 Assessm ent of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses; and  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (for participants who were born female). Persons who 
are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy (verified  by [CONTACT_30219]), are not required to undergo 
pregnancy testing.  
Following completion of all procedures in the preceding list, and if results indicate that 
vaccination may proceed, vaccination is prepared and administered (see Sections 8.3 and 
8.4). 
Administration of all injections during a  vaccination visit must be accomplished within 1 
calendar day.  
Immediately following vaccination, the participant remains in the clinic for observation. 
An initial reactogenicity assessment is made at a target of 30 minutes after injection, with 
an accepta ble range of 25 -60 minutes. Before leaving the clinic, the participant will be

The following procedures will be performed at all vaccination visits. These procedures 
may be performed prior to or following vaccination:  
 Risk reduction counseling (as described in Section 9.8);  
 Pregnancy prevention assessment (as described in Section 9.2 and 9.9); and  
 Assessment of new or unresolved social impacts (site staff will ask p articipant about 
the status of any unresolved social impacts and if s/he has experienced any new 
social impacts as a result of the trial participation).  
Additional procedures will be performed at scheduled visits as specified in Appendix H :  
 HIV infection assessment including pretest counseling. A subsequent follow -up 
contact [CONTACT_106905] -test counseling and to report results to 
participant;  
 Confirm that participants received HIV test results from previous visit. If not, provide 
test results and post -test counseling as appropriate; and

assessed involve personal relationships, health insurance, life insurance, educational 
or employment oppor tunities, housing, immigration, or travel);  
 Administration of behavioral risk assessment questionnaire;  
 Administration of a questionnaire that asks the participant about any HIV testing he 
or she may have received outside of the study. Participants will al so be asked whether 
they believe they received the active vaccine or the control;  
 Specimen collection (blood and/or mucosal and/or stool) should be completed prior 
to vaccination;  
 For participants who agree to mucosal sampling collection (see Appendix H  and 
Section 9.6): 
 Urine test or swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia  ; 
 Vaginal swab for Trichomonas and bacterial vaginosis (for participants providing

This contact [CONTACT_854471], text message , or email. At this contact, CRS 
staff will collect information about their health, specifically related to potential AESIs. If 
indicated, the participant may be asked to come in for a clinical assessment which may 
also include referrals  for AESI assessment. AESIs are described  further  in Appendix J . 
9.6 Mucosal sampling  
Mucosal samples will be collected at the timepoints indicated in Appendix H  from the 
study participants who agree to these p rocedures.  
Participants who consent to provide cervical, rectal, or semen samples will be tested for 
the following infections at the mucosal sampling visits: gonorrhea, chlamydia, and 
syphilis. Participants who were born female who consent to provide cervi cal fluid 
samples will be tested for trichomoniasis and for bacterial vaginosis and (if clinically 
indicated) for hyphae/budding yeast. Test results will be provided to participants and all 
participants who test positive for 1 or more of these infections w ill receive counseling as 
well as treatment (or referral for treatment) as appropriate.  
Rectal fluid sampling (both sexes):  For participants born female, a pregnancy test must 
be performed and be negative prior to any rectal mucosal sampling . Persons who a re 
NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy with bilateral 
oophorectomy (verified by [CONTACT_30219]), are not required to undergo pregnancy 
testing. Rectal secretion sampling should be deferred if a participant is menstruat ing, but 
should be performed as soon as possible, if still within the visit window. In addition, 
rectal sampling will not be performed (or may be deferred to a later date if still within the 
visit window) if there is a contraindication to rectal secretion sampling, such as an active 
infection or inflammation of the colorectal area [such as an herpes simplex virus (HSV) -2 
outbreak or inflamed hemorrhoids or colitis/diarrhea] or if the participant has any active 
genital tract infection (GTI).  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 87 of 155 For 48 hours pri or to sample collection, participants should abstain from:  
 Receptive anal sex,  
 Insertion of any foreign object or substance into the anus (including but not limited to 
cleaning products [creams, gels, lotions, pads, etc.], lubricant, enemas, and douching 
even with water), and  
 Using perianal or intra -anal steroid or other anti -inflammatory cream in or around the 
anus.  
Cervical fluid sampling (only for participants who were born female):  Participants 
who are [ADDRESS_1189863], but should be performed on the same day as the collection . Persons who 
are NOT of reproductive potential due to having undergone total hysterectomy with 
bilateral oophorectomy (verified by [CONTACT_30219]), are  not required to undergo 
pregnancy testing. Cervical sampling should be deferred if a participant is menstruating, 
but should be performed as soon as possible, if still within the visit window. In addition, 
cervical sampling will not be performed (or may b e deferred to a later date if still within 
the visit window) if a participant has an active ulcerative genital lesion or is known to 
have an active GTI at the scheduled timepoint. Participants providing cervical secretion 
samples should be advised as follo ws: 
 Do not use anything with spermicide, lubricants, or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/intravaginal medications 
(eg, topi[INVESTIGATOR_106788]) for 48 hours before the samples are collected;  
 Do not douche for 48 hours before the samples are collected;  
 Do not have vagi nal sex and/or insert any foreign object or substance into the vagina 
for 48 hours before the samples are collected;  
Semen sampling (only for participants who were born male):  Participants providing 
semen samples are asked to refrain from ejaculation for at least 48 hours prior to 
specimen collection. In addition, mucosal sampling will not be performed (or may be 
deferred to a later date if still within the visit window) if a participant is known to have an 
active GTI at the scheduled timepoint.  
9.7 Stool samp ling 
Two stool samples will be collected from the study participants who agree to this 
procedure: 1 prior to  enrollment (before the injection of the vaccine) and 1 at the Month 
6.5 timepoint. These samples will be collected using swabs, either via rectal s wabs or by

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 88 of 155 9.8 HIV counseling and testing  
HIV counseling will be performed in compliance with the CDC’s guidelines or other 
local guidelines for HIV counseling and referral. HIV testing will be performed in 
accordance with the current HVTN HIV testing algorithm following enrollment.  
Participants will be counseled routinely during the trial on the avoidance of HIV infection 
and on the potential negative social impacts of testing antibody positive due to the 
vaccine. They will also be counseled on the risks of HIV antibody testing outside of the 
HVTN CRSs and will be discouraged from doing so during study participation and/or 
during any period of vaccine -induced positive serology.  
Study staff will take particular care to inform study pa rticipants of the likelihood of 
routine HIV testing being offered or performed outside the study CRS at emergency 
rooms, clinics, and medical offices. Such testing has become more likely due to the 
CDC’s revised guidelines for HIV counseling and testing, a s well as policy changes in 
many countries to make HIV testing more frequent and routine. CRS staff should inform 
participants of their right to opt out of HIV testing outside the study site. CRS staff 
should inform study participants if local and/or state  policies and regulations permit 
medical providers to perform HIV testing without first informing patients. If this is the 
case, then CRS staff should advise study participants that they may decline testing 
preemptively. CRS staff should also inform partic ipants if positive results must be 
reported to local public health authorities. CRS staff should also inform participants of 
the need to maintain study blinding by [CONTACT_106913]. CRS 
staff should provide participants with CRS co ntact information and should encourage 
participants to ask medical providers to contact [CONTACT_262284]. The CRS can verify that the 
participant is in an HIV vaccine clinical trial and should only be tested at the study CRS.  
Potential participants identified as be ing HIV infected during screening are not enrolled. 
All participants who become HIV infected during the study will be terminated from this 
study. Potential and enrolled participants identified as HIV infected will be referred for 
medical treatment, counsel ing, and management of the HIV infection. These individuals 
may also be referred to appropriate ongoing clinical trials or observational studies.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_1189864] may elicit an antibody response to HIV proteins. Therefore, vaccine -
induced positive serology  (VISP)  may occur in this study. Several precautionary 
measures will be taken to distinguish intercurrent HIV infection from vaccine -induced 
positive serology. These precauti onary measures include:  
 Participants will have physical examinations at visits specified in Appendix H . Signs 
or symptoms of an acute HIV infection syndrome, an intercurrent illness consistent 
with HIV -1 infection, or probable HIV exposure would prompt a diagnostic workup 
per the HVTN algorithm for Recent Exposure/Acute Infection Testing to determine 
HIV infection.  
 HIV testing will be performed at multiple timepoints throughout the study (see 
Appendix H ). Th e Laboratory Program (or approved diagnostic laboratory) will 
follow the HVTN HIV testing algorithm (as described in the Laboratory Manual of 
Operations), which is able to distinguish vaccine -induced antibody responses from 
actual HIV infections.  
HVTN 108, Versi on 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 89 of 155  All part icipants can receive HIV -[ADDRESS_1189865] vaccine -induced seropositivity.  
 All participants who received vaccine pro duct and who have vaccine -induced 
positive or indeterminate HIV -1 serology (as measured by [CONTACT_106915] -HIV 
antibody screening tests) at or after the study is unblinded will be offered poststudy 
HIV-1 diagnostic testing (per the HVTN poststudy HIV -1 testing algorithm) 
periodically and free of charge as medically/socially indicated (approximately every 
6 months) unless or until HIV Ab testing is no longer the standard test in clinical 
settings.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_1189866] kits. This is called “vaccine -induced 
seropositivity” (VISP) . In order to provide poststudy HIV testing to distinguish between 
VISP and HIV infection, and to mitigate po tential social harms resulting from VISP in 
HIV vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_432138], the HVTN has created a VISP 
registry. Following study unblinding, the registry will allow trained staff to verify that an 
individual has received an HIV vacci ne, and therefore has the potential for VISP. 
Information in the VISP registry will not be used for research. Rather, the registry exists 
to support provision of poststudy testing and counseling services to HIV vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The registry contains the  names of all study participants, unless they request 
that their names be removed.  
9.[ADDRESS_1189867] that could cause that 
participant to become pregnant should be reminded at all scheduled clinic visits of the 
importance of using contraception and should be referred to specific counseling, 
information, and advice as needed. (Specific contraception requirements are listed in 
Section 7.1). This reminder should be documented in the participant’s study record.  
Self-reported infertility —including h aving reached menopause (no menses for 1 year) or 
having undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation —must be 
documented in the participant’s study record.  
9.10 Urinalysis  
Dipstick testing may be performed in the clinic or the lab, as long as the required 
elements (glucose, protein, and hemoglobin) are tested. The examination is performed on 
urine obtained by [CONTACT_106916].  
If the screening dipstick is transiently abnormal due to menses or infection, document this 
issue in the participant’s so urce documentation. For infection, provide appropriate 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 90 of 155 treatment and/or referral. Following resolution, repeat the dipstick and, if within the 
eligibility limits specified in the protocol, the participant may be enrolled.  
Follow -up urinalysis should be def erred if a participant is menstruating, but should be 
performed as soon as possible. If a follow -up dipstick is abnormal due to a participant’s 
menstrual period, document in the comment section of the case report form (CRF) and 
repeat the dipstick once the  participant is no longer menstruating. A micro -urinalysis is 
not required.  
9.11 Assessments of reactogenicity  
For all participants, baseline assessments are performed before and reactogenicity 
assessments are performed after each vaccination. All reactogenicit y symptoms are 
graded according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 2.0, November  2014, 
except as noted in Section 11.2.[ADDRESS_1189868] the clinic for events 
that arise during the period between vaccination and the next scheduled visit . In general, 
a participant who self -reports any postvaccination reaction greater than mild is seen by a 
clinician within 48 hours after onset, unless the reaction is improving and/or has 
completely resolved.  
Reactogenicity events are reported using CRFs that correspond to the time of assessment 
in Table 9-1. Reactogenicity assessments include assessments of systemic and local 
symptoms, vaccine -related  lesions, and lymph nodes. Events not listed on a CRF, or with 
an onset after the reactogenicity assessment period (day of vaccination and 7 full days 
after), or those meeting SAE/adverse event criteria requiring expedited reporting to 
DAIDS, are recorded on an adverse experience log form.

Systemic symptoms include increased b ody temperature, malaise and/or fatigue, myalgia, 
headache, chills, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting. Local symptoms include pain and/or

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 91 of 155 tenderness proximal to the injection site. The daily maximum severity reached for each 
symptom during the assessment pe riod is reported.  
Body temperature is measured by [CONTACT_432203]. If temperature is measured in Fahrenheit, the conversion to Celsius should be 
documented in the participant’s chart note. A measurement is take n once daily during the 
assessment period and should be repeated if participant is feeling feverish.  
9.11.2  Assessment of injection site  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_854414]. The 
maximum horizontal and maximum vertic al measurements for all injection site reactions 
are recorded.  
All injection site reactions are monitored until resolution. Areas greater than 25 cm2 are 
followed daily; otherwise, the frequency of follow -up is based on clinician judgment.  
9.11.3  Assessment of lymph nodes  
This assessment is required only when reactogenicity assessments are performed by 
[CONTACT_432204], not by [CONTACT_2299].  
Only the proximally draining lymph nodes are assessed (eg, axillary nodes on the same 
side of the body for injections give n in the deltoid). Lymph nodes are first evaluated for 
enlargement and tenderness. If they are found to be enlarged, measurements are taken to 
determine the size (widest diameter) of the enlarged node(s).  
9.12 Visit windows and missed visits  
Visit windows are d efined in HVTN 108  Study Specific Procedures. For a visit not 
performed within the window period, a Missed Visit form is completed. If the missed 
visit is one that required safety assessments or local safety labs, HVTN CRS staff should 
attempt to bring the participant in for an interim visit as soon as possible.  
Procedures performed at an interim visit are usually toxicity/safety assessments 
(including local safety labs) and HIV testing. With the exception of HIV testing, th ese 
procedures are performed only if they were required at the missed visit or if clinically 
indicated. HIV testing may be performed as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_5984]. Blood 
samples for immunogenicity assays are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_854415]. 
If a missed visit required vaccination, please refer to Section 7.3.2  and Section 7.3.3  for 
resolution.  
9.13 Early termination visit  
In the event of early participant termination, site staff should consider if the following 
assessments are appropriate: a final physical examination, clinical la boratory tests 
(including urine dipstick, CBC with differential, platelet count, and chemistry panel), 
pregnancy testing, social impact assessment, and HIV test.

procedures should be completed unless medically contraindicated. For participants who 
are no longer pregnant, see Section 7.3.1 . In case of required termination  from the study , 
enrollment in an observational study should be offered to the participant. If the 
participant terminates from the study prior to the pregnancy outcome, the site should 
make every effort to keep in touch with the partici pant in order to ascertain the pregnancy 
outcome.

10.1 HVTN CRS laboratory procedures  
The HVTN Site Lab Reference Manual provides further guidelines for operational issues 
concerning the clinical and processing laboratories. The manual includes guide lines for 
general specimen collection, special considerations for phlebotomy, specimen labeling, 
whole blood processing, HIV screening/diagnostic testing, and general screening and 
safety testing.  
Tube types for blood collection are specified in Appendix G . For tests performed locally, 
the local lab may assign appropriate tube types.  
In specific situations, the blood collection tubes may be redirected to another laboratory 
or may require study -specific processing techniques. In thes e cases, laboratory special 
instructions will be posted on the protocol -specific section of the HVTN website.

minimal. The total blood volume drawn for each participant will not exceed 500 mL in 
any 56 -day (8 -week) period.  
10.3 Primary immunogenicity timepoint  
The primary immunogenicity timepoint in this study is at visit 10 (day 182) (ie, 2 weeks 
after the 4th vaccination visit). Endpoint assays for humoral and cellular responses are 
performed on participants at the p rimary immunogenicity timepoint and may be 
performed at baseline. Depending on the number of responders observed, assays for 
humoral and cellular responses may be performed on participants at other timepoints; the 
schedule is shown in Appendix G . 
10.4 Endpoint assays: humoral  
10.4.1  HIV-1 multiplex antibody assay  
Total binding IgG antibodies to HIV -1 Env proteins (including V2 regions of interest) 
will be assessed on serum and mucosal secretion samples from study participants taken at 
the prima ry immunogenicity timepoints and baseline. Specimens from other timepoints 
as well as other HIV antigens and Ab isotypes may also be assayed based on the results 
of the initial assay.  
10.4.2  Neutralizing antibody (nAb) assay  
HIV-1–specific nAb assays will be performed on serum samples from study participants 
taken at the primary immunogenicity timepoint. Specimens from the baseline and other

10.5 Endpoint assays: cellular  
10.5.1  Flow cytometry  
Flow cytometry will be used to examine vaccine -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell 
responses following stimulation of PBMCs with synthetic HIV peptides that span the 
proteins encoded by [CONTACT_432205]. ICS param eters will include cytokines such as 
IFN-γ, interleukin (IL) -2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and may include other 
cytokines (such as cytokines relevant to Th2 and Th17 responses) to identify T cells of 
specific functionality. Markers of cytotoxic po tential (Granzyme B, perforin, and CD57) 
may also be included. Data will be reported as percentages of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells 
responding to a specific peptide pool. Additional cell surface markers, cytokines, or 
functional markers may also be analyzed.

in HVTN vaccine trials.  The typ e of assay(s) employed will be dependent on the response 
obtained by [CONTACT_432206] s. Please note that 
the Lab Assay Algorithm will be updated periodically to include new assays.  
10.8 Exploratory studies  
Samples may be u sed for other testing and research related to furthering the 
understanding of HIV immunology or vaccines. In addition, cryopreserved samples may 
be used to perform additional assays to support standardization and validation of existing 
or newly developed m ethods.

Swabs of stool will be shipped to a central laboratory. Specimens are processed to enable 
nucleic acid sequencing. 16s rRNA sequences will then be determined using pyro -
sequencing approaches or other methods.  
10.9 Other use of store d specimens  
The HVTN stores specimens from all study participants indefinitely, unless a participant 
requests that specimens be destroyed or if required by [CONTACT_1744]/EC, or RE.  
Other use of specimens is defined as studies not described in the protocol.  
This rese arch may relate to HIV, vaccines, the immune system, and other diseases. This 
could include limited genetic testing and, potentially, genome -wide studies. This research 
is done only to the extent authorized in each study site’s informed consent form, or as  
otherwise authorized under applicable law. Other testing on specimens will occur only 
after review and approval by [CONTACT_106885], the IRB/EC of the researcher requesting the 
specimens, and the CRS’s IRBs/ECs if required.  
The protocol sample informed consent fo rm is written so that the participant either 
explicitly allows or does not allow their samples to be used in other research when they 
sign the form. Participants who initially agree to other use of their samples may rescind 
their approval once they enter t he study; such participants will remain in this study and 
their samples will only be used for the studies described in this protocol. If a participant 
decides against allowing other research using his or her samples, or at any time rescinds 
prior approval for such other use, the study site investigator or designee must notify 
HVTN Regulatory Affairs in writing. In either case, HVTN Regulatory Affairs directs the 
HVTN Lab Program not to use samples from these participants for such other uses.  
CRSs must noti fy HVTN Regulatory Affairs if institutional or local governmental 
requirements pose a conflict with or impose restrictions on other use of specimens.

11.1.4  HVTN Core roles and responsibilities in safety monitoring  
 Daily monitoring of clinical data for events that meet the safety pause  and HVTN 
108 PSRT AE review criteria (see Section 11.3); 
 Notifying HVTN CRSs and other groups when safety pauses o r planned holds are 
instituted and lifted (see Section 11.3); 
 Querying HVTN CRSs for additional information regarding reported clinical data; 
and 
 Providing support to the HVTN [ADDRESS_1189876] submit all safety forms (eg, reactogenicity, adverse experience, urinalysis,

relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational study product/procedure(s), whether or not 
related to the investigational study product/procedure(s). All AEs are graded according  to 
the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Version 2.0, November  2014, available on the RSC 
website at http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/, except : 
 Weight loss is required to be reported as an AE only if it is considered to be 
deleterious to the participant’s health (see HVTN 10 8 Study Specific Procedures ); 
 Injection Site Erythema or Redness and Injection Site Induration or Swelling will not 
consider interference with usual social and functional activities such that:  
 Grade 1 is: 2.5 to < 5 cm in diameter OR 6.25 to < 25 cm2 surface area;  
 Grade 2 is: ≥ 5 to < 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 25 to < 100 cm2 surface area;  
 Grade 3 is: ≥ 10 cm in diameter OR ≥ 100 cm2 surface ar ea OR Ulceration OR 
Secondary infection OR Phlebitis OR Sterile abscess OR Drainage;

dermatitis, necrosis involving dermis or deeper tissue);  
 The grading of Insomnia events w ill consider the criteria within the Insomnia 
parameter as well as the general AE functional table such that:  
 Grade 1 Insomnia is defined as: Mild difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or 
waking up early causing no or minimal interference with usual s ocial and 
functional activities with intervention not indicated;  
 Grade 2 Insomnia is defined as: Moderate difficulty falling asleep, staying 
asleep, or waking up early, causing greater than minimal interference with usual 
social and functional activities w ith intervention indicated;  
 Grade 3 Insomnia is defined as: Severe difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or 
waking up early, causing inability to perform usual social & functional activities 
with intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374].  
If a definit ion of insomnia falls between 2 grades, the final grading will be selected 
based on the degree of interference with usual social and functional activities caused 
by [CONTACT_432210].  
Unsolicited AEs will be collected  over a period of 30 days after each vaccina tion visit. 
All collected AEs are reported to the SDMC on the appropriate CRF. Clinic staff should 
evaluate every AE to determine if (1) the AE meets the requirements for expedited 
reporting (Section 11.2.3 ), (2) if the AE meets the criteria for a safety pause/prompt AE 
review (Section 11.3), and (3) if the AE is a potential immune -mediated disease that may 
be listed as an AE of special interest (AESI). A sample list of AESI is provided in 
Appendix J . 
Certain AEs will be collected and reported throughout the entire study :  
 SAEs/EAEs,  
 AESIs,  
 New chronic conditions requiring medical intervention for ≥ 30 days,  
 Newly diagnosed or treated STIs,  
 AEs leading to early participant withdrawal or early discontinuation of study 
product(s) administration.  
CRSs are expected to notify  the CSS or RML of any serious safety concern requiring 
their attention (see Table 11-1). Telephone numbers and email addresses are found on the 
Protoc ol home page on the HVTN Members’ site 
(https://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn108). Concerns requiring immediate attention 
should be communicated by [CONTACT_106932].  
In the case of email notification the CSS or RML will reply during working hours (US 
Pacific Time) to confirm that the email has been received and reviewed. If email service 
is not available, the HVTN CRS should notify the CSS or RML of the event by 
[CONTACT_756], then submit CRFs.

AE information in accordance with IRB/EC and any applicable RE requirements.  
11.2.3  Expedited reporting of adverse events to DAIDS  
Requirements, definitions and methods for expedited reporting of AE s are outlined in 
Version 2.0 (January 2010) of the Manual for Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events to 
DAIDS (DAIDS EAE Manual), which is available on the RSC website at http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/ . The SAE Reporting Category will be used for the 
main study period .  
The internet -based DAIDS Adverse Event Reporting System (DAERS) must be used for 
expedited AE reporting to DAIDS. In the event of system outages or technical 
difficulties, expedited AE reports may be submitted via the DAIDS EAE Form. For 
questions about DA ERS, please contact [CONTACT_106898] -[EMAIL_2683]  or from 
within the DAERS application itself.  
Sites where DAERS has not been implemented will submit expedited AE reports by 
[CONTACT_604891]. This form is available on 
the RSC website: http://rsc.tech -res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance/. For questions 
about expedited AE reporting, please contact [CONTACT_138305] ( DAID SRSCSafetyOffice@tech -
res.com ).  
Under ICH E2A ( Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting ), an SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:  
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening (Note: The ter m “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were 
more severe),  
 requires patien t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] ,  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
 is a medically important event or reaction*  
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exe rcised when deciding if other situations are 
serious. Such instances could include medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to preven t 1 of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
development of drug dependen cy or drug abuse.  
While the participant is in the main study reporting period (see Section 3), the SAE 
Reporting Category will be used.  
If the participant has completed the main study  and has not yet completed the AESI 
contact  (Section 9.5) the S[LOCATION_003]R reporting category will be used.

S[LOCATION_003]Rs if the study site staff become aware of the events on a passive basis (eg, from 
publicly available information).  
The study products that must be considered in determining relationships of AEs requiring 
expedited reporting to DAIDS and pertinent national regulatory authorities are:  
 DNA -HIV-PT123/ placebo  
 Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59/p lacebo  
 Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01B/placebo  
The NIAID/DAIDS will report all unexpected SAEs related to the study products 
observed in this clinical trial to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32 (IND Safety 
Reports). All AESIs will be considered “une xpected”, and, if deemed related to the study 
products, will be reported to FDA as S[LOCATION_003]Rs , if applicable . However, because safety is 
a primary study endpoint, the Sponsor Medical Officer will not be unblinded to study 
treatment assignment when there is an assessment of relatedness of the SAE with the 
study product(s); and the safety report will be sent to the FDA based on the blinded 
attribution assessment.  
11.2.4  Expedited reporting of AEs to pertinent national regulatory authorities  
The study sponsor or designe e(s) prepares and files expedited reports to appropriate 
regulatory authorities within the timelines required by [CONTACT_269942].

a Phone numbers and email addresses are found on the Protocol home page on the HVTN Members’ site 
(https ://members.hvtn.org/protocols/hvtn108 ). 
b Does not include subjective reactogenicity symptoms (injection site pain, tenderness, fatigue/malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, c hills, headache, 
nausea).  
For all safety pauses, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 108  PSRT, HVTN Regulatory 
Affairs, DAIDS Pharmaceutical Affairs Branch (PAB), DAIDS Regulatory Affairs 
Branch (RAB), DAIDS Safety and Pharmacovigilance Team (SPT), and participating 
HVTN CRSs. When an immediate safety p ause is triggered, HVTN Core notifies the 
SMB.  
Once a trial is paused, the HVTN 108  PSRT reviews safety data and decides whether the 
pause can be lifted or permanent discontinuation of vaccination is appropriate, consulting  
the SMB if necessary. HVTN Core notifies the participating HVTN CRSs, HVTN 
Regulatory Affairs, DAIDS PAB, DAIDS RAB, and DAIDS SPT of the decision 
regarding resumption or discontinuation of study vaccinations. Based on the HVTN 108  
PSRT assessment, the trial sponsor or designee(s) notifies pertinent national regulatory 
authorities as needed.  
If an immediate HVTN 108  PSRT notification or prompt HVTN 108  PSRT A E review is 
triggered, HVTN Core notifies the HVTN 108  PSRT as soon as possible during working 
hours (US Pacific Time) —or, if the information was received during off hours, by [CONTACT_432213]. If a prompt HVTN 108  PSRT AE review cannot be 
completed within 72 hours of notification (excluding weekends and US federal holidays), 
an automatic safety pause occurs.  
The HVTN requires that each CRS submit to its IRB/EC protocol -related  safety 
information (such as safety reports, notification of vaccine holds due to the pause rules, 
and notification of other unplanned safety pauses).  CRSs must also follow all applicable 
RE reporting requirements.  
In addition, all other AEs are reviewed r outinely by [CONTACT_106885] 108  PSRT (see Section 
11.4.2 ). 
11.4 Review of cumulative safety data  
Routine safety review occurs a t the start of enrollment and then throughout the study.

Thank you for your interest in our research study. Pl ease read this consent form or ask 
someone to read it to you. If you decide to join the study, we will ask you to sign or make 
your mark on this form. We will offer you a copy to keep. We will ask you questions to 
see if we have explained everything clearl y. You can also ask us questions about the 
study.  
Research is not the same as treatment or medical care. The purpose of a research study is 
to answer scientific questions.  
About the study  
The HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) and [Insert site name]  are doing a study to 
test HIV vaccines. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.  
About [ADDRESS_1189917] 40 percent will be women.  The 
researcher in charge of this study at this clinic is [Insert name [CONTACT_107002]] . The United 
States National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are 
paying for the st udy.  
1. We are doing this study to answer several questions.  
 Are the study vaccines safe to give to people?  
 Are people able to take the study vaccines without becoming too uncomfortable?  
 How do people’s immune systems respond to different combinations and do ses of the 
study vaccines? (Your immune system protects you from disease.)  
2. The study vaccines cannot give you HIV.  
The study vaccines are not made from actual HIV. It is impossible for the study vaccines 
to give you HIV. Also, they cannot cause you to give  HIV to someone else.  
3. We do not know if the study vaccines will decrease, increase, or not change your 
risk of becoming infected with HIV if you are exposed to the virus.  
Sites: Any change to the language in this section requires approval from HVTN 
Regulat ory Affairs.  
Several studies have tested whether HIV vaccines can reduce the risk of getting HIV 
from another person. In some studies, people who got the vaccine seemed to have the 
same  risk of getting HIV as people who did not get the vaccine. In one stud y, people who 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189918] your risk of getting HIV  
from another person. The risk could be higher, lower, or unchanged. It’s very important 
to avoid exposure to HIV during and after the study. We will tell you how to avoid HIV.  
4. These study vaccines are experimental.  
There are 3 study vaccines being tested in this study. They are all experimental vaccines. 
That means we do not know whether the vaccines will be safe to use in people, or 
whether they will work to prevent HIV infection. These vaccines are used only in 
research studies. The study vaccines are ca lled DNA -HIV-PT123, Bivalent Subtype C 
gp120/MF59, and Bivalent Subtype C gp120/AS01 B. From here on, we will call them the 
DNA vaccine, the Protein/MF59 vaccine, and the Protein/AS01 B vaccine, or the study 
vaccines.  
The DNA vaccine:  
The DNA vaccine was de veloped by [CONTACT_854480] (Lausanne, Switzerland).  
The DNA vaccine is being tested in people in 2 other studies in the US and in 
Switzerland. These studies are giving the DNA vaccine in combination with other 
vaccines. As of June 2014, over 180 peop le received the DNA vaccine. So far, it has not 
made them too uncomfortable or caused them serious health problems. However, studies 
with a small number of people do not tell us everything about the safety of the study 
vaccines.  
The Protein/MF59 vaccine:  
The Protein/MF59 vaccine was developed by [CONTACT_854469] (Cambridge, MA, [LOCATION_003]).  
The Protein/MF59 vaccine has man -made pi[INVESTIGATOR_145592] a protein found on the outside of 
HIV. These proteins will be mixed with an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance added to 
the v accine to help the immune system respond better. In this study vaccine the adjuvant 
is called MF59. MF59 is commonly used in licensed flu vaccines in many European 
countries. It has also been used in other vaccines that have been given to over 50,[ADDRESS_1189919] e in research studies without causing any serious health problems.  
The Protein/MF59 vaccine has not been given to people before. It has been tested in 
mice, rabbits, and monkeys and it did not cause any health concerns. Animal testing may 
not always tell u s what will happen with humans. Similar vaccines have been given to 
more than 10,000 people in research studies. In these studies, the protein vaccines did not 
cause serious health problems.  
The Protein/AS01 B vaccine:  
The Protein/AS01 B vaccine was develop ed by [CONTACT_145600] (Rixensart, 
Belgium).  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 122 of 155 The Protein /AS01 B vaccine has the same proteins used in the Protein/MF59 vaccine. 
However, these protein pi[INVESTIGATOR_145593] a different adjuvant called AS01 B. The 
Protein/AS01 B has not been given to people before either. Similar vaccines have been 
given to over [ADDRESS_1189920] studies. In these studies, the vaccines did not cause 
serious health problems.  
General risks of vaccines:  
All vaccines can cause fever, chills, rash, aches and pains, nausea, headache, dizziness, 
and feeling tired. Vaccines can also cause pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the 
injection site. Most people can still do their planned activities after getting a vaccine. 
Rarely, people experience side effects that limit their normal activities or make them go 
to the doctor.  
Rarely, a vaccine can cause an allergic reaction, including a rash, hives, or difficulty 
breathing. Allergic reactions can be life -threatening. You should tell us if you have ever 
had a bad reaction to  any injection or vaccine.  
Rarely, people who have received vaccines with adjuvants have developed illnesses 
called autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases have also occur red in people who 
have not been vaccinated. These diseases develop when immune cells that normally 
protect you from illness attack your organs instead. Autoimmune diseases can be serious 
and can also be lifelong . They can involve, for example, your liver, kid neys, skin, joints, 
eyes, brain, as well as other parts of the body. Since no one knows for sure if vaccines 
with adjuvants might cause autoimmune diseases, we continue to monitor this situation 
closely.  
Risks of the study vaccines:  
This section lists the side effects we know about. There may be others that we don’t yet 
know about, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn about any new side effects.  
The DNA vaccine:  
In studies with this and similar DNA vaccines, the most common complaints were mild 
to moderate pain or itching in the area where they got the injection, headache, and feeling 
tired. Some people felt flu -like symptoms, nausea, and rash. These  problems usually 
happened within a couple of days after injection(s) and usually went away on thei r own 
within a few days.  
The Protein/MF59 vaccine:  
This study vaccine has not been tested in people before. In studies with similar products, 
some people had redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, or itching in the area where they got 
the injection. Some peo ple had headaches. A small number of people had  joint pain, flu -
like symptoms, nausea, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, or swollen lymph nodes after getting an 
injection. A very small number of people had a stomach ache. Most people who had 
symptoms only had some  of these symptoms, not all of them.  
The Protein/AS01 B vaccine:  
This study vaccine has not been tested in people before . In studies with similar products 
some people had redness, swelling, pain, tenderness, warmth , or itching in the area where 
they got the  injection. Some people had headache, fever, tiredness or weakness. A small

include, but is not limited to:  
 Checking your weight, temperature and blood pressure  
 Looking in your mouth and throat  
 Listening to your heart and lungs  
 Feeling your abdomen (stomach and liver)  
We will also do blood and urine tests. The se tests tell us about some aspects of your 
health, such as how healthy your kidneys, liver, and immune system are. We will also test 
you for: hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. We will ask you about medications you are 
taking. We will ask you about b ehaviors that might put you at risk for getting HIV. If you 
were born female, we will test you for pregnancy. People who have had a complete 
hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and ovaries, verified by [CONTACT_30219]), are not 
required to have a pregnancy  test. 
We will review the screening results with you. The screening results may show you are 
not eligible to join the study, even if you want to. Also, you might not be able to join if 
we have already enrolled enough  people of your same sex.

9. You will come to the clinic for scheduled visits about [#] times over 12 months.  
Site: Insert number of visits and range of visit lengths. (There is site -specific variation in 
screening protocol s and in the number of possible follow -up visits between protocol -
mandated visits.)  
Visits can last from [#] to [#] hours.  
You may have to come for more visits if you have a lab or health issue.  
We may contact [CONTACT_132334] u after the main study ends (for example, to tell you about the study 
results).  
10. We will give you [Site: Insert compensation]  for each study visit you complete.  
This amount is to cover the costs of [Site: Insert tex t] 
Site: Insert any costs to participants (eg, birth control costs for female participants who 
could become pregnant).  
US sites only:  
Payments you receive for being in the study may be taxable. This happens if we pay you 
more than $[ADDRESS_1189924] to pay anything to be in this study.

Site: Modify the randomization metaphor in the next sentence as appropriate to your 
local culture . Whether you get the study vaccines or the placebo is completely random, 
like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin.  
You have about a [ADDRESS_1189926] a serious medical 
problem and need to know what you got before the end of the study, we can tell you.  
12. We will give you the study products on a schedule.  
There are 8 groups in this study. Eac h group will get a different combination of study 
products. Also, different groups will get different doses (high or low) of the protein used 
in the protein vaccines. Each group will get 12 injections during the study. You will get 
the injections into your  upper arms. You will get 3 injections at every injection visit.  
The DNA vaccine will go into the left arm. The Protein/MF59 vaccine and the 
Protein/AS01 B vaccine will go into the right arm.  The placebo can be given in both arms.  
Site: A pi[INVESTIGATOR_349682] o f the injection schedule has been provided in  Appendix E . You

At each injection visit, you will have to wait in the clinic for about a half hour after 
getting the injections to see if there are any problems. You will need to record how you 
feel each day for a total of [ADDRESS_1189928].  
13. In addition to giving you the study products, we will:  
 Do regular HIV testing, as well as counseling on your results and on how to avoid 
getting HIV;  
 Perform physical exams;  
 Do pregnancy tests if you were born female;  
 Ask questions about your health, including medications you may be taking;  
 Ask questions about any personal problems or benefits you may have from being in 
the study.  
 Take urine and blood samples.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 127 of 155 When we take blood, the amount will depend on the lab tests we need to do. It will be 
some amount between 10 mL and 200 mL (2 teaspoons to a little more than ¾ cup). Your 
body will make new blood to replace the blood we take out.  
Site: You may want to add a sentence to the end of the previous paragraph 
contextualizing the blood volumes described (eg, “To compare, people who donate blood 
in the US can give a total of about 500 mL in an 8 -week period.”). Modify the example 
for cultur al relevance and alter blood volumes as necessary.  
Site: Insert Appendix F , Table of procedures (for informed consent form) in this section 
or distribute it as a se parate sheet if it is helpful to your study participants. You are not 
required to do either.  
We will be looking for side effects. We will review the results of these procedures and 
tests with you at your next visit, or sooner if necessary. If any of the re sults are important 
to your health, we will tell you.  
14. If you agree, we will also collect stool, rectal fluid and cervical fluid or semen.  
At the end of this form we will ask if you allow us to collect stool, rectal fluid and 
cervical fluid (if you were b orn female) or semen (if you were born male). You can 
decide not to give any of these samples and still be in the study.  
Stool  
We would like to collect a small sample of your stool to look at the bacteria living in your 
stomach. We want to learn if your immune response to the study vaccines is influenced 
by [CONTACT_145694]. We will do this twice during this study. If you agree to give the rectal 
fluid sample  described below , we can collect the stool sample at the same time , or you 
may provide a stool sampl e at home or at the clinic. The clinic must receive the stool 
sample within [ADDRESS_1189929] the parts of the body where people may be 
exposed to HIV: their rectum, vagina, and penis.  
We would like to collect these samples at [ADDRESS_1189930] these samples. This will help make sure your samples give 
accurate lab readings.  
Rectal fluid  
Site: You may delete the units of measure that are not used at your site in the ne xt 
sentence. We will collect rectal fluid by [CONTACT_145695] a plastic tube into your rectum that 
is about 10 cm (4 inches) long and a little less than 2.5 cm (1 inch) wide. The tube will go 
in about 7 cm (3 inches). Then we will insert up to [ADDRESS_1189931] for 5 minutes and then removed.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189932] your rectal fluid,  we will ask you not to do these things :  
 have receptive anal intercourse  
 put anything into your anus, including cleaning products (creams, gels, lotions, pads, 
etc.), lubricant, or enemas  
 douche (even with water),  
 use any anti -inflammatory creams in or around your anus.  
We will not collect rectal fluid if you are menstruating , pregnant or if we think you may 
have an infection. You should tell us if your rectal area is sore.  
Cervical fluid  
If you are [ADDRESS_1189933] recent result being normal. If you haven’ t had a Pap smear within the last [ADDRESS_1189934] cervical fluids, we will insert a speculum (a device that holds your 
vagina open) into your vagina and place the sponge in the opening of the cervix. This is 
similar to getting a pap sme ar. If we use the Softcup, we will explain how to use it.   
For the [ADDRESS_1189935] your cervical fluid, we will ask you to not do these 
things :  
 use any spermicide, lubricants, douche (even with water), or medication in or around 
your vagina;  
 have vaginal intercourse or insert anything into your vagina.  
We will not start the collection of  cervical fluid if we learn that  you are menstruating or 
pregnant or if we think you may have a cervical or vaginal infection.  
Semen  
You may provide the semen at  home or at the clinic. We will ask you to ejaculate into a 
plastic cup, which we will give to you. The clinic must receive the semen sample within [ADDRESS_1189936] an infection we may not use your sample.  
15. We will counsel you on avoiding HIV infection.  
We will ask you personal questions about your HIV risk factors such as sexual beha vior 
and drug use. We will talk with you about ways to keep your risk of getting HIV low. 
Some topi[INVESTIGATOR_269869]:  
 What you think may cause risky behavior for you.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 129 of 155  Methods to avoid getting HIV.  
These may include not having sex, using condoms,  or behavior changes, such as cutting 
down on alcohol. We will talk with you about which methods of HIV prevention may be 
right for you.  
16. We will test your samples for this study.  
We will send your samples (without your name) to labs approved by [CONTACT_854481] r this 
study, which are located in the [LOCATION_002] and South Africa. Researchers at these labs 
will test your samples to see how your immune system responds to the study products.  In 
rare cases, some of your samples may be sent to labs approved by [CONTACT_854482].  
Researchers may also do genetic testing related to this study on your samples. Your genes 
are passed to you from your birth parents. They affect how you look and how your body 
works. The differences  in people’s genes can help explain why some people get a disease 
while others do not. These types of genetic tests involve some of your genes, not all of 
your genes (your genome). The researchers will study the genes related to the immune 
system and HIV a nd those that affect how people get HIV.  
If you become HIV infected, the researchers may look at all of the genes of the virus 
found in y our samples. If you give cervical, stool, or rectal fluid samples, the researchers 
may look at all of the genes of the  bacteria found in your samples.  In both cases, t he 
researchers will use this information to learn more about HIV and the study products. The 
researchers may put this information about the virus and/or bacteria into a protected 
database so that other resea rchers can access it. They would not be able to link the 
information from your samples to you .  
In some cases, researchers may take cells from your samples and grow more of them over 
time, so that they can continue to contribute to this study.  
Tests done on your samples are for research purposes only. The labs will not give the 
results to you or this clinic, and the results will not become part of your study record.  
When your samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN will continue to store 
them . 
Site: Delete next section if using Appendix D , the separate consent for use of samples and 
information in other studies  
17. When we take samples from you for this study, we take extra samples in case we 
have to repeat tests.  When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN 
wants to keep them for use in other studies by [CONTACT_432222]. We will 
call these “extra samples.”  
This section gives you in formation so you can decide if you want your extra samples and 
information used in other studies. You will mark your decision at the end of the form. If 
you have any questions, please ask.  
Do I have to agree? No. You are free to say yes or no, or to chang e your mind after you 
sign this form. At your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your 
decision will not affect your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 20 16 
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 130 of 155 Where are the samples stored? Extra samples are stored in  a secure place called a 
repository.  [Site: choose one of the following two sentences.  African sites should choose 
the sentence referencing the repository in South Africa.  All other sites should choose the 
sentence referencing the repository in the [LOCATION_002].] Your samples will be stored in 
the HVTN repository in South Africa.  Your samples will be stored in the HVTN 
repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
How long will the samples be stored? There is no limit on how long your extra samples 
will be stored. [Site: insert limits if your regulatory authority imposes them.]  
Will I be paid for the use of my samples? No. Also, a researcher may make a new 
scientific discovery or product based on the use of your samples. If this happens, there is 
no plan to share any m oney with you. The researcher is not likely to ever know who you 
are. 
Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies? Probably not. 
Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or your doctor. They are 
not needed  for your medical care. They are not part of your medical record. The studies 
are only being done for research purposes.  
Will the HVTN sell my samples and information? No, but the HVTN may share your 
samples with other researchers. Once we share your sampl es and information, we will not 
be able to get them back.  
How do other researchers get my samples and information? When a researcher wants to 
use your samples and/or information, their research plan must be approved by [CONTACT_106885]. 
Also, the researcher’s inst itutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee (EC) will 
review their plan. [Site: insert review by [CONTACT_106954]’s IRB/EC, if applicable.] 
IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well -being of people in research. If the research plan is 
approved, the HVTN wi ll send your samples to the researcher’s location.  
What information is shared with other researchers? The samples and limited information 
will be labeled with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_107030]. 
However, some information that we share may be personal, such as your race, ethnicity, 
gender, health information from the study, and HIV status. We may share information 
about the study product you received and how your body responded to the study product.  
What kind of studies might be d one with my extra samples and information? The studies 
will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases. The researchers 
may:  
 Take cells from your samples and grow more of them. This means the 
researchers may keep your cells growing over time.  
 Do limited genetic testing, which involves only looking at some of your genes, 
not all of your genes.  
If you agree, your samples could al so be used for genome wide studies. In these studies, 
researchers will look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers compare the 
genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that could help them 
understand diseases. The researche rs may put the information from the genome -wide 
studies into a protected database so that other researchers can access it. Usually, no one 
would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a person. However, if another 
database exists that also ha s information on your genome and your name, someone might

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189937] access to my information in s tudies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
 Researchers who use your stored samples and limited information for other research  
 Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using your samples or 
information  
 The research er’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
 The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of any new 
studies that use your extra samples or information may be published. No publication will 
use your name [CONTACT_107005].  
18. We will do our best to protect your private information.  
US sites: Check HIPAA authorization for conflicts with this section.  
Your study records and samples will be kept in a secure location. We wi ll label all of 
your samples and most of your records with a code number, not your name [CONTACT_269973]. However, it is possible to identify you, if necessary. We will not 
share your name [CONTACT_107007], or w ith anyone else who

required by U.S. Law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At 
most, the website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at 
any time.  
19. We may stop your injections or take you out of the study at any time. We may do 
this even if you want to stay in the study and even if you were scheduled for 
additional injections.  
This may happen if:  
 you do not follow instructions,  
 the researcher thinks that staying in the study might harm you,  
 you get HIV,  
 you enroll in a different research study where you receive another study product, or  
 the study is stopped for any reason.  
If we stop your injections, we may ask you to stay in the study to complete other study 
procedures.  
20. We will stop your injections if you become pregnant during the study.  
We will encourage you to stay in the study if you choose. The clinic staff will discuss 
your study options with you.  
If you leave the study wh ile you are still pregnant, we will contact [CONTACT_854484].  
21. If you get infected with HIV during the study, we will help you get care and support.  
You will not be able to stay in this study. W e will counsel you about your HIV infection 
and about telling your partner(s). We will tell you where you can get support and medical 
care, and about other studies you may want to join. Site: Modify the following sentence as 
appropriate. We will not provid e or pay for any of your HIV care directly.  
Other Risks  
22. There are other risks to being in this study.  
This section describes the other risks and restrictions we know about. There may also be 
unknown risks, even serious ones. We will tell you if we learn a nything new that may 
affect your willingness to stay in the study.  
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures. These are taking blood and 
giving injections. These procedures can cause bruising, pain, fainting, soreness, redness, 
swelling, itching, a sore, bleeding, and (rarely) muscle damage or infection at the 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 134 of 155 injection site. Taking blood can cause a low blood cell count (anemia), making you feel 
tired.  
Risks of collecting rectal and cervical fluids:  
You may have some discomfort and minor bleeding during these procedures. This does 
not usually last very long.  
Personal problems/discrimination/testing HIV antibody positive:  
About 10 to 20% of people who join HVTN studies report personal problems or 
discr imination because of joining an HIV vaccine study. Family or friends may worry, 
get upset or angry, or assume that you are infected with HIV or at high risk and treat you 
unfairly as a result. Rarely, a person has lost a job because the study took too much  time 
away from work, or because their employer thought they had HIV.  
The body makes antibodies to fight or prevent infection. Most vaccines cause the body to 
make antibodies as a way of preventing infection. Your body may make antibodies to 
HIV because y ou received an HIV study vaccine. The study vaccines are likely to cause 
you to test positive on some types of HIV tests, even if you are not infected with HIV.  
This is called vaccine -induced seropositivity (VISP). VISP means that after you get the 
study v accines, a routine HIV test done outside this clinic is likely to say you have HIV, 
even if you don’t. For this reason, you should plan to get HIV tests only at this clinic 
during the study. Our tests can tell the difference between true HIV infection and a 
positive result that is caused by [CONTACT_106985].  
If you receive a positive test result caused by [CONTACT_106984], we can 
provide you with free HIV testing for as long as you need it. If this happens, we do not 
know how long you will t est positive due to the study vaccines. If you receive a positive 
HIV test result and we determine it is because you have HIV, we will refer you for 
follow -up care.  
It is unlikely, but you could test negative at the end of the study and positive some time 
later, even though you don’t have HIV. This could happen if different HIV tests come 
into use. We will give you a phone number to call for more information.  
Site: Modify the following paragraph if applicable.  If someone believes you are infected 
with HIV even if you are not, you could face discrimination and other problems. For 
example, you could be denied medical or dental care, employment, insurance, a visa, or 
entry into the military (in some countries). If you do have a positive HIV antibody test 
cause d by [CONTACT_106985], you will not be able to donate blood or organs. Your family 
and friends may treat you differently. We will give you a brochure that tells you more 
about testing HIV positive because of an HIV vaccine, and how you can avoid some of 
these problems.  
If you become pregnant during or after the study and have VISP, we don't know if the 
antibodies could be passed to your baby. We know that this happens with other vaccines, 
like tetanus vaccine. These antibodies from the mother are not a da nger to the baby, and 
they go away over time. If the baby [CONTACT_854485], we can do this testing for 
free for as long as it is needed. For most babies antibodies from the mother last for about 
six months.  
You should always tell the delivery staff i f you have VISP. However, you may still be 
tested for HIV using the antibody test when you deliver your baby. If your test is positive 
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189938] that can tell the difference between true HIV infection and a VISP 
result.  
Embarrassment/anxiety:  
You may feel embarrassed when we ask about your HIV risks, such as having sex and 
using drugs. Also, waiting for your HIV test results or other health test results could 
make you feel anxious. You could feel worried if your test results show that you are 
infected with HIV. If you feel embarrassed or anxious, please tell us and w e will try to 
help you.  
Risks of disclosure of your personal information:  
We will take several steps to protect your personal information. Although the risk is very 
low, it is possible that your personal information could be given to someone who should 
not have it. If that happened, you could face discrimination, stress, and embarrassment. 
We can tell you more about how we will protect your personal information if you would 
like it.  
Risks of genetic testing:  
The genetic testing could show you may be at ris k for certain diseases. If others found 
out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. However, it is almost impossible 
for you or others to know your test results from the genetic testing. The results are not 
part of your study records and are no t given to you.   
U.S. Sites, include the following paragraph  In the very unlikely event that your genetic 
information becomes linked to your name, a federal law called the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect you.  GINA keeps healt h insurance 
companies and employers from seeing results of genetic testing when deciding about 
giving you health insurance or offering you work. GINA does not help or protect you 
against discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], disability or long -term c are insurance.  
Unknown risks:  
We do not know if the study vaccines will increase, decrease, or not change your risk of 
becoming infected with HIV if exposed. If you get infected with HIV, we do not know 
how the study vaccines might affect your HIV infecti on or how long it takes to develop 
AIDS.  
We do not know if getting these study vaccines will affect how you respond to any future 
approved HIV vaccine. It could be that a future HIV vaccine may not work as well for 
you because you got the study vaccines. C urrently, no HIV vaccine has been approved 
for use.  
We do not know how the study vaccines will affect a pregnant participant or a developi[INVESTIGATOR_432147].  
HVTN 108, Version  2.0 / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189939] health problems you don’t yet know about.  
This study may help in the search for a vaccine to prevent HIV. However, if the study 
vaccines later become approved and sold, there are no plans to share any money with 
you.  
Your rights and responsibilities  
24. If you join the study, you have rights and responsibilities.  
You have many rights that we will respect. You also have responsibilities. We list these 
in the Participant’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. We will give you a copy of it.  
Leaving the study

If you become sick or injured in this study, there is a process to decide if it is r elated to 
the study products and/or procedures. If it is, we call it a study -related injury. There are 
funds to pay for treatment of study -related injuries if certain conditions are met. The 
funds may come from different groups, as described below.  
(Sites:  adjust the language in this paragraph so it is applicable to your site ) In this study, 
our clinic has insurance to cover your medical treatment in the case of a study -related 
injury.  The insurance will follow the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry 
guidelines for payment of study -related injury. We can give you a copy of these 
guidelines.  In rare cases, the insurance funds may not be enough. There may be other 
ways that study -related injuries can be funded. We can give you more information, if you 
would like.  
For study -related injuries that cannot be funded as described above, the HVTN has 
limited funds to pay medical costs that it determines are reasonable . (Sites: insert locale - 
appropriate medical insurance language in the following senten ce) If the injury is not 
study related, then you and your health insurance will be responsible for treatment costs.  
Some injuries are not physical. For example, you might be harmed emotionally by [CONTACT_432226]. Or you might lose wages beca use you cannot go to work. 
However, there are no funds to pay for these kinds of injuries, even if they are study 
related.   
You may disagree with the decision about whether your injury is study related. If you 
wish, the HVTN will ask independent experts to  review the decision. You always have 
the right to use the court system if you are not satisfied .

HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 144 of 155 Appendix D  Sample consent form for use of samples and 
information in other stud ies 
Title: A phase 1/2a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIV clade 
C DNA, and of MF59®- or AS01 B-adjuvanted clade C Env protein, in various 
combinations, in healthy, HIV -uninfected adult participants  
HVTN protocol number: HVTN 108  
Site: [Insert site name]  
When samples are no longer needed for this study, the HVTN wants to keep them for use 
in other studies by [CONTACT_432222]. We will call these “extra samples. ” 
This form gives you information so you can decide if you want your extra samples and 
information used in other studies. You will mark your decision at the end of the form. If 
you have any questions, please ask.  
1. Do I have to agree?  
No. You are free to s ay yes or no, or to change your mind after you sign this form . At 
your request, we will destroy all extra samples that we have. Your decision will not affect 
your being in this study or have any negative consequences here.   
2. Where are the samples stored?  
Extra samples are stored in a secure place called a repository.  [Site: choose one of the 
following two sentences. African sites should choose the sentence referencing the 
repository in South Africa. All other sites should choose the sentence referencing the  
repository in the [LOCATION_002].] Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in 
South Africa. Your samples will be stored in the HVTN repository in the [LOCATION_002].  
3. How long will the samples be stored?  
There is no limit on how long your extra samples will be stored.  [Site: insert limits if your 
regulatory authority imposes them.]  
4. Will I be paid for the use of my samples?  
No. Also, a researcher may make a new scientific discovery or product based on the use 
of your samples. If this happens, the re is no plan to share any money with you. The 
researcher is not likely to ever know who you are.  
5. Will I benefit from allowing my samples to be used in other studies?  
Probably not. Results from these other studies are not given to you, this clinic, or you r 
doctor. They are not needed for your medical care. They are not part of your medical 
record. The studies are only being done for research purposes.  
6. Will the HVTN sell my samples and information?  
No, but the HVTN may share your samples with other researchers. Once we share your 
samples and information, we will not be able to get them back.  
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page 145 of 155 7. How do other researchers get my samples and information?  
When a researcher wants to use your samples and/or information, their research plan 
must be approved by  [CONTACT_106885]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) 
or ethics committee (EC) will review their plan. [Site: insert review by [CONTACT_106954]’s 
IRB/EC, if applicable.]  IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well -being of people in research. 
If the research plan is approved, the HVTN will send your samples to the researcher’s 
location .  
8. What information is shared with other researchers?  
The samples and limited information will be labeled with a code number. Your name [CONTACT_854493]. However, some information that we share may be 
personal, such as your race, ethnicity, gender, health information from the study, and HIV 
status. We may share information about the study product you received and how your 
body responded to the study pr oduct.  
9. What kind of studies might be done with my extra samples and information?  
The studies will be related to HIV, vaccines, the immune system and other diseases. The 
researchers may:  
 Take cells from your samples and grow more of them. This means the 
researchers may keep your cells growing over time.  
 Do limited genetic testing, which involves only looking at some of your genes, 
not all of your genes.  
If you agree, your samples could also be used for genome wide studies. In these studies, 
researchers wi ll look at all of your genes (your genome). The researchers compare the 
genomes of many people, looking for common patterns of genes that could help them 
understand diseases. The researchers may put the information from the genome -wide 
studies into a prote cted database so that other researchers can access it. Usually, no one 
would be able to look at your genome and link it to you as a person. However, if another 
database exists that also has information on your genome and your name, someone might 
be able to  compare the databases and identify you. If others found out, it could lead to 
discrimination or other problems. The risk of this is very small.  
10. What are the risks of genetic testing?  
The genetic testing could show you may be at risk for certain diseases.  If others found 
out, it could lead to discrimination or other problems. However, it is almost impossible 
for you or others to know your test results from the genetic testing. The results are not 
part of your study records and are not given to you.   
U.S. Sites, include the following paragraph   
In the very unlikely event that your genetic information becomes linked to your name, a 
federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) helps protect 
you. GINA keeps health insurance companies  and employers from seeing results of 
genetic testing when deciding about giving you health insurance or offering you work. 
GINA does not help or protect you against discrimination by [CONTACT_106962], 
disability or long -term care insurance.   
HVTN 108, Version 2.0  / August 8, 2016  
HVTN108_v2 -0_FINAL.docx  / Page [ADDRESS_1189946] access to my information in studies using my extra samples?  
People who may see your information are:  
 Researchers who use your stored samples and limited information for other research  
 Government agencies that fund or monitor the research using you r samples or 
information  
 The researcher’s Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
 The people who work with the researcher  
All of these people will do their best to protect your information. The results of any new 
studies that use your extra samples  or information may be published. No publication will 
use your name [CONTACT_107005].  
Questions  
12. If you have questions or problems about allowing your samples and information to 
be used in other studies, use the following important contacts.  
If you have questions about the use of your samples or information or if you want to

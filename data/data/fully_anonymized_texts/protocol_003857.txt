T Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte (T -LGL) lymphoproliferative disorders are a heterogeneous group of 
uncommon diseases which may involve a polyclonal or a monoclonal T cell population, which bear characteristic surface markers corresponding to activated cytotoxic (CD3+, CD8+) lymphocytes.  They are 
often associated with quite severe neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia which may be life-threatening.  
There  is some evidence that the abnormal cytotoxic lymphocyte population may cause the cytopenias by 
[CONTACT_503184], although the mechanism is unclear.  Immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to improve the cytopenias of T-LGL leukemia, however the long term use of the commonly used agents often lead 
to significant toxicity in the older patients which are affected by [CONTACT_53220]. 
Alemtuzumab (Campath ) is currently approved as second line agent in patients with chr onic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL)  and has been used successfully in the treatment of certain autoimmune disorders. In the 
Hematology Branch, Campath is currently being investigated in two bone marrow failure syndromes: aplastic 
anemia and myelodysplasia. Cytopenia(s) is an important characte ristic of patients with T -LGL leukemia, often 
being the indication for immunosuppressive therapy. Our preliminary experience with Campath indicates that it is well tolerated, in particu lar among the elderly patients.  
Therefore, we pr opose this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase II, single agent, study which will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
alemtuzumab (Campath ), an im munosuppressive drug, in subject s with T -LGL  leukemia. A lemtuzumab 
(Campath®) will be administered off label at 10 mg per day by [CONTACT_503185] 10 days total.  Subjects 
who do not show a response to initial Campath or relapse may receive a second cycle of drug after the 3 month 
time point. 
The primary end point of the study is the response rate at three months, defined as improvement in cytopenia(s).  
Secondary endpoints will include relapse- free survival, response at 6 months, life threatening toxicity, reduction 
in the number of abnormal T- LGL clone,  response to second cycle of Campath, and overall survival.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
The primary objective is to identify a possible therapeutic ben efit of immunosuppression with 
alemtuzumab (Campath ) in the treatment of subject s with T Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte (T- LGL ) 
leukemia as evidenced by (a) improvement in cytopenia(s), and (b) a reduction in the number of abnormal 
T-LGL present in the peripheral blood. 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Pathophysiology of T- cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia  
 
A syndrome of increased numbers of circulating large granular lymphocytes (LGL) associated with 
chronic neutropenia was recognized as a distinct clinical en tity in [ZIP_CODE].  Since that time, the 
nomenclature associated with this syndrome has changed many times.  In 1993 Loughran pr oposed a 
classification based on the demonstration of clonality as well as a characteristic lymphocyte surface 
phenotype2.  Clonal LGL proliferations may be either CD3+ (T cell LGL, or T- LGL leukemia) or CD3 - 
(NK cell LGL, or NK -LGL leukemia).  T -LGL leuke mia is much more common in Europe and in the 
[LOCATION_002], while NK -LGL leukemia is prevalent in Asia. There is no broad consensus on the exact 
criteria to establish the diagnosis of T -LGL leukemia, however, there is general agreement that three 
requirements must be met to establish the diagnosis: (1) evidence of a clonal population of T cells based on T- cell receptor gene rearrangement studies; (2) an abnormal number of phenotypic T- LGLs based on 
flow cytometry; (3) and the proper clinical scenario of prolonged cytopenia
2,3. 
 
The clinical features of this syndrome, which occurs most commonly in individuals over the age of 50, 
include recurrent bacterial  infections ; occasional splenomegaly, and an association with rheumatoid 
arthritis.4,[ADDRESS_647968] neutropenia, often severe, and upon inspection of the bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], a “maturation arrest” in the myeloid series may be seen.  Anemia (which may be profound, 
requiring transfusion support) and thrombocytopenia (usually of moderate degree) occur less frequently.  Occasionally, hemolytic anemia has been observed.  Lymphadenopathy and skin involvement are 
distinctly unusual.  In the largest single institution cohort of patients, 61 (90%) of 68 patients were alive 
at 3.5 years, with the majority (70%) requiring therapy during the period of the study. A separate 
multicenter study reported 20% mortality at 4 years.  Spontaneous remissions are rare, if they occur at all. 
 Examination of the peripheral blood smear is important in establishing the diagnosis of T -LGL leukemia  
(with the characteristic finding of increased numbers of LGLs) which are characterized by a larger than 
normal lymphocytes, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_647969] a monoclonal gammopathy6. 
 The phenotype of the T cell type of this s yndrome is characteristic
2,7.  CD3+ lymphocytes express LGL 
antigens such as CD16 and CD57 to varying extents.  A homogeneous population of CD3+ CD16+ lymphocytes is present in almost all cases of T -LGL leuk emia. This subset accounts for fewer than 5% of 
circulating lymphocytes in normal individuals, and any increase in this population is highly suggestive of 
T-LGL leukemia. CD56 is uncommonly expressed; however, when present may signal a more aggressive 
clinical course.  Greater than 95% of cases have a TCR αβ+, CD4 -, CD8+ phenotype. More recently the 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  5 CD52 antigen (the target of Campath) was shown to be highly expressed in malignant cells of patients 
with T -LGL leukemia, which provides a rationale for the use of Campath in treating this disease8. 
 
The cause of the LGL proliferation is unknown.  CD3+, CD57+ cells, the rare counterpart of the leukemic 
LGL, are thought to represent in vivo activated cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTL) of unknown antigen 
specificity9.  It has been hypothesized that antigen activation plus cytokine secretion could lead to 
leukemic LGL proliferation in vivo10.  The mechanism by [CONTACT_503186]. T-
LGLs may contribute to cytopenia by [CONTACT_503187] -γ and tumor necrosis factor- α. Clonal evolution would depend on additional 
genetic or environmental factors.  Retroviral infection with HTLV -I/II has been proposed as a potential 
pathway of antigen activation, although serologic positivity against this virus is present in only a few 
patients11.  It is also possible that a primary abnormal hematopoietic element may provide the antigenic 
stimulus for the LGL proliferation, with subsequent myelosuppression resulting from a T cell-mediated attack on the hematopoietic cells.  Studies indicate mortality ranging from 10% to 20% at 4 years
7,12.  
 
2.2   Treatment options for T -cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T -LGL)  
 
Most patients with T -LGL (>70%) require therapy because of recurrent infections, symptomatic anemia or 
severe thrombocytopenia.  There is no standard approach to the treatment of these patients and opti mum 
treatment remains undefined . The main goa l of therapy is to ameliorate the cytopenia(s) to prevent life 
threatening infections, bleeding or complications from anemia. Case reports and case series in the literature have shown limited responses to steroids, low -dose daily cyclophosphamide, low-dose methotrexate or to 
granulocyte- colony stimulating factor (G -CSF) 
2,13,14,15.  Long- term intermittent treatment with these agents 
is often required, leading to toxicity and the potential for secondary leukemias or myelodysplasia (e.g., 
long- term alkylators use). Combination chemotherapy for patients with an aggressive clinical course has not 
been successful.  Three case reports of patients with T-LGL leukemia have documented responses to daily 
cyclosporine A treatment, which appears to be better tolerated than the aforementioned drugs during 
potentially long-term therapy.16,17,18 At NHLBI we treated 25 T -LGL patients with oral cyclosporine and 
response was observed in about half of the patients. Sustained response r equired continued low -dose 
cyclosporine19. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_503160], increased populations of the CD3+ T- LGLs 
persisted in patients during cyclosporine therapy, suggesting an amelioration of the cytopenias by [CONTACT_503188].    
2.3 Alemtuzumab (Campath®)  
2.3.1  Description  
 
Alemtuzumab (Campath®) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the CD52 protein, which is highly expressed on all lymphoid cells and monocytes.
20  Alemtuzumab (Cam path®) is a 
recombinant DNA derived humanized monoclonal antibody that is directed against the 21-28 kD cell 
surface glycop rotein, CD52.  CD52 is expressed on the surface of normal and malignant B and T 
lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages and tissues of the male reproductive system.  Alemtuzumab (Campath®) is an IgG1 kappa with human variable framework and -constant regions and 
complementarity -determining regions from a murine (rat) monoclonal antibody (Campath-1G).  The 
alemtuzumab (Campath®) ant ibody has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kD.  Alemtuzumab 
(Campath®) is produced in a mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) suspension culture in a medium 
containing neomycin.  Neomycin is not detectable in the final product.  The rationale for using the 
humanized form of the monoclonal antibody is the decreased formation of antibodies against 
alemtuzumab (Campath®), which limit efficacy and the potential for re-administration of the drug.

October 2 7, 2016  6 2.3.2 Clinical Pharmacology   
 
Alemtuzumab (Campath®) binds to C D52, a non- modulating antigen that is present o n the surface of 
essentially all B and T lymphocytes, a majority of monocytes, macrophages and NK cells.  Analysis of 
samples collected from multiple volunteers has not identified CD52 expression on erythrocytes or 
hematopoetic stem cells.  The proposed mechanism of action is antibody -dependent lysis of cells 
following cell surface binding.  Alemtuzumab (Campath®) Fab binding was observed in lymphoid tissues 
and the mononuclear phagocyte system.  Significant binding was also observed in the skin and male 
reproductive tract (epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], sperm, seminal vesicle).  Mature spermatozoa stain for CD52, but neither 
spermatogenic cells nor immature spermatozoa show evidence of staining.  
 Alemtuzumab (Campath®) pharmacokinetics displayed nonlinear elimination kinetics.  In CLL patients 
treated with Campath®, mean half-life was 11 hours (range 2 to 32 hours) after the first 30 mg dose and 6 
days (range 1 to 14 days) after the last 30 mg dose. Systemic clearance decreased w ith repeated 
administration due to decreased receptor -mediated clearance (i.e. loss of CD52 receptors in the 
periphery).   
 
2.3.3 Clinical Experience Alemtuzumab (Campath®)  
 
Alemtuzumab produces profound and persistent lymphopenia, affecting predominantly the CD 4+ T cell 
subset. This property has made it attractive in the treatment of a wide range of diseases including 
rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, ocular inflammatory disease, lymphoid malignancies, and in 
conditioning regimens in stem cell transplantation to prevent graft failure and graft- versus-host 
disease.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Rheumatoid Arthritis  
 
The mechanisms by [CONTACT_503189] -1H induces its lymphocytotoxic effect appear to be 
complement- mediated cytotoxicity, antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity and induction of 
apoptosis. Most data regarding the degree and duration of lymphopenia have been derived from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 33,34 A decrease in lymphocyte and monocyte counts are seen 
immediately after administration. Initial cell recovery is noticed with CD16+ NK cells and CD14+ monocytes returning to normal levels within 1-2 months, and CD 19+ B cells within 3 -6 months. 
Cytotoxic CD8+ T cell begin to recover at about 3 months after treatment and helper CD4+ T cells 
may remai n suppressed for years. Metteson et al demonstrated that 22% of patients remained 
lymphopenic at 6 months after treatment, with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells being 14% and 13% pretreatment levels, respectively. 
[ADDRESS_647970] shown that T cell subsets can remain suppressed 
for an even longer period, not rising above 20% of pretreatment levels at any time after [ADDRESS_647971] one disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug received a total of 100, 250 or 400 mg 
over 5 or 10 days. 38 Profound lymphopenia developed in all patients with clinical responses 
appearing more sustained in patients receiving 250 or 400 mg. Approximately 50% of patients 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  7 achieved a 50% Paulus response at 31 days and 20% maintained a 50% Paulus response at least 6 
months. There were 2 fatal infections, one patient died from infection with Coccidioides immitis  
(methotrexate was added after Campath -1H) and another of suspected hemolytic-uremic syndrome.  
Overall, infectious complications were minor ( mainly herpetic) and all occurred within [ADDRESS_647972] generally been mild. As expected, viral infections with herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus occur 
at a high frequency.   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_503161]4+ T cell lymphopenia after treatment with 
Campath -1H, few fatalities have been reported secondary to opportunistic infections, suggesting 
that the recovery of B cells and NK cells along with low but existing levels of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are adequate to avoid infectious catastrophes. However, serious, sometimes fatal, opportunistic infections do occur following treatment with Campath- 1H. 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)  
 
The efficacy and safety of Campath -1H in CLL was evaluated in a prospective, non- comparative 
phase II trial conducted at 21 centers in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe. 
40 Ninety -three patients with 
high-risk CLL refractory to alkylating agents and fludarabine received Campath -1H 30mg, 3 times 
a week, up to a maximum of 12 weeks. Overall response was 33%, with 2% complete and 31% 
partia l responses. Median time to progression was 4.[ADDRESS_647973] common adverse event was infusion -related and was generally grade 1 or 2 in severity. 
They inc luded rigors, fever, nausea, vomiting and rash.  Infections occurred in 51 patients (55%) 
during the study, being mild to moderate in 26, and more severe (grade 3 or 4) in 25 patients. Septicemia occurred in 14 patients (15%), with grade 3 or 4 in 10 patie nts.  Superficial candidiasis 
occurred in 9 patients and viral reactivation with cytomegalovirus (n=7) or Herpes simplex (n=6) in 13 patients. A total of 18 patients developed opportunistic infections, 11 during treatment and 7 in the follow -up period. Opportunistic infections included Pneumocystis jiroveci (n=1); Aspergillus  
pneumonia (n=1); rhinocerebral mucormycosis (n=1); systemic candidiasis (n=1); cryptococcal pneumonia (n=1, fatal); herpes zoster (n=4, follow-up); pulmonary aspergillosis (n=1, follow-up, 
fatal); Listeria  meningitis (n=1, follow -up). The most common opportunistic infection was CMV 
reactivation (n=7). Nine deaths occurred during treatment or within [ADDRESS_647974] administration of Campath-1H (3 progressive disease, 3 pneumonia, 1 pulmonary embolism, 1 
sepsis, 1 rhinocerebral mucormycosis) and 19 deaths occurred between 30 and 180 days (11 
progressive disease, 6 infections, 1 respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], 1 inanition). Patients who died during 
treatment were more likely to have advanced disease at study entry (Rai III or IV) and have failed 
to respond to Campath-1H.   
Most patients experienced transient cytopenias during treatment, with neutropenia most commonly 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  8 seen during weeks 5 and 6 (30% of patients) and thrombocytopenia during the first 2 weeks of 
therapy. Neutrophil and platelet counts recovered by 2 months follow-up.  
 
Two smaller phase II trials in patients with chemotherapy and fludarabine refractory CLL (24 and 
29 patients each) also showed similar response rates of about 30%. 41,[ADDRESS_647975] failed fludarabine therapy.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Transplant setting to prevent graft rejection and GVHD  
 
Alemtuzumab has also been used as part of conditioning regimens in stem cell transplantati on to 
prevent graft rejection and graft -versus- host disease. 
43,44 In solid organ transplantation Campath- 1H 
has been used with cyclosporine in renal allograft recipi[INVESTIGATOR_503162]. 
45 In bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia, 
Campath -1G (rat anti -human IgG2b monoclonal antibody directed against the same CD52 antigen) 
has been used in HLA-identical sibling donors as well as matched unrelated donors with low incidence of graft- versus host di sease and graft failures. 
46,47 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Immune cytopenias  
 
There are no published studies of Campath -1H in patients with aplastic anemia, but a recent case 
series used Campath -1H in a diverse population of [ADDRESS_647976] therapy.
 48 The diseases included were: 4 with autoimmune neutropenia (AIN), 
4 with autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), -1 with immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), 3 
with Evan’s syndrome, 3 with autoimmune cytopenias, 1 with ITP and AIN,1 with ITP and pure 
red cell aplasia (PRCA) and [ADDRESS_647977] dose reactions, Campath- 1H was well tolerated in all patients.  
 Of the 4 patients with AIN, a sustained response was seen in three, with the fourth patient requiring 
fewer G -CSF injections. Of the 4 patients with AIHA, 2 with warm type autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia responded and one with cold type hem olytic anemia had a partial response. In the 4 patients 
with PRCA, 2 responded with one having a relapse after the CsA level was found to be sub -
therapeutic. Of the 3 patients with Evan’s syndrome, [ADDRESS_647978] had a transient response only.  A response was seen in 2/3 patients with autoimmune 
cytopenia, but both relapsed. The one patient with ITP and AIN had a sustained response from the 
ITP, although he remained neutropenic.  
 
Of the 7 patients who died, 2 had autoimmune cytopenia (1-Guillain Barre syndrome, 1- TTP), 2 
had Evan’s syndrome (1 – cerebral hemorrhage, 1 – recurrent bronchial carcinoma), 1 had ITP (cerebral hemorrhage), 1 with AIHA (intractable intravascular hemolysis and systemic venous 
thrombosis), 1 had PRCA (non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma transformation). A profound and predictable 
lymphopenia developed in all patients. B lymphocyte recovery occurred before 3-6 months, CD8+ 
T cells recovered at variable times ranging from [ADDRESS_647979]

October 2 7, 2016  9 In a case report, a 51 year old female with a 5 year history of autoimmune neutropenia failed 
treatment with G -CSF, azathioprine, cyclosporine, one course of horse ATG, one course of rabbit 
ATG and prednisolone. 49 She was then treated with Campa th-1H 10 mg/d for [ADDRESS_647980] -thymic T- cell malignancies are a heterog eneous group of rare lymphoid disorders which 
include T -prolymphocytic leukemia, cutaneous T- cell lymphoma, T -LGL leukemia, and human T- cell 
lymphotropic virus associated with adult T- cell leukemia- lymphoma. These diseases are often resistant to 
conventional chemotherapeutic regimens and relapses are common, resulting in patients becoming refractory to treatment. Campath has shown to be active in T -cell malignancies 
50. Anecdoctal reports of 
successful treatment with Campath in patients with T -LGL le ukemia r efractory to immunosuppression are 
emerging in the literature51,52,53. An illustrative case was that of a 53-year old woman with T- LGL who 
was treated with a succession of multiple immunosuppressive and/or chemotherapeutic regimens over 20 
months whic h included methotrexate, prednisone, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, anti-thymocyte 
globulin, OKT3 and pentostatin with no significant sustained response 52. Following treatment with 
Campath, she experienced sustaine d improvement of the blood counts with minimal toxicity.    
 
Although T -LGL leukemia is commonly thought of as an indolent disease, a majority of patients end up 
requiring treatment due to constitutional symptoms or complications of cytopenias such as fatigue, bleeding and/or infections
54. The T -LGL CD3+ clone is frequently resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, 
and immunosuppression remains the mainstay of therapy. Although small case series indicate that responses are achieved with immunosuppressive agents such as corticosteroids, methotrexate, 
cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine; relapses are common, and discontinuation of drug and/or long- term 
intermittent use is often required. This practice often leads to significant toxicity in older patients, which 
is the age group where T- LGL is most commonly observed. The long term use of alkylating agents such 
as cyclophosphamide also raises the potential for clonal disor ders such as myelodysplasia and leukemia. 
In addition, eradication of the T -LGL CD3+ clone is infrequent. Campath is a potent lymphocytotoxic 
agent which is currently approved for the treatment of CLL. The use of Campath in T-LGL may not only 
improve the cytopenia(s), but also eradicate the leukemic clone and result in more prolonged remission 
and/or de crease in the rate of relapse.  
 
Anecdotal reports suggest that Campath is active in T -LGL leukemia, with a potential lower toxicity than 
long term use of corticosteroids, methotrexate or cyclophosphamide. More recently the CD52 antigen (the 
target of Camp ath) was shown to be highly expressed in malignant cells of patients with T- LGL 
leukemia, which provides a rationale for the use of Campath in treating this disease55.We therefore 
propose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Campath in subjects  with T -LGL  leukemia .  
 
Although T -LGL is classified as a leukemia, tumor burden is not a characteristic of the clinical syndrome; 
total absolute lymphocyte count is often within normal range or low, lymphadenopathy and/or organomegaly are very infrequently observed.  Therefore, the dose of Campath will be the same as it is 
being used in other bone marrow failure protocols at the Hematology Branch; 10 mg IV for 10 days. 
When Campath is used as an immunosuppressive agent, doses from 50-100 mg are often used in other 
scenarios like in bone marrow transplantation and other autoimmune disease (for example, multiple 
sclerosis). When Campath is used an anti -tumor agent (in chronic lymphocytic leukemia) the dose used is 
higher; 30 mg three times a week for 8 to 12 weeks (per product label).  Since the mechanism of 
cytopenia(s) in T -LGL is perceived to be similar to other bone marrow failure syndromes, the same

October [ADDRESS_647981] year who had a complete 
response followi ng the proposed regimen of 10 mg IV for 10 days.   
 
2.5 Justification for a second cycle in subjects with no response or relapsed disease:  
 
We have observed in our preliminary experience that Campath is an active agent in T-LGL and that the 
regimen is well tol erated with a toxicity profile consistent with the product label (to date no serious 
treatment related SAEs have been noted in this study ). Campath is currently being investigated in several 
clinical trials worldwide in transplantation and for the treatmen t of autoimmune diseases including multiple 
sclerosis where protocol plans  include two and sometimes three cycles of Campath  56.  
 
Although we are very encouraged by [CONTACT_503190] T- LGL, response is not 
universal and some patients a re showing signs of relapse after successful initial response. In order to 
investigate if a repeat course will benefit those who do not respond initially  or for patients who respond and 
relapse, repeating a course of Campath is r ational, and it consistent with what is commonly done in other 
bone marrow failure syndromes like aplastic anemia, where repeat courses of immunosuppression ( ATG ) 
are often administered to patients who are refractory or relapse .

TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1. Alemtuzumab (Campath®) Administration  
All subject s will initially receive a test dose of 1 mg in 100 ml NS given intravenously over 1 hour.  
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  12 If tolerated, alemtuzumab (Campath®) will be administered at 10 mg/dose IV for [ADDRESS_647984] s will be admitted to the Clinical Center hospi[INVESTIGATOR_503165]. If the study drug 
infusion is tolerated well (toxicity < grade 2) the subject may be discharged and receive the remainder of 
the treatment course as an outpatient.  
5.2 Re-treatment (per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106])  
Subjects who do not respond to initial cycle or relapse following initial treatment may be retreated at 
the discretion of principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_503166]  10 mg/dose IV for 10 days 
anytime after the 3 month (primary assessment)  time point.   
5.3 Pre-medications and management of infusion reactions  
Subjects  will receive pre-medication with oral diphenhydramine 50 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg 30 
minutes prior to infusion.  
Infusions reactions will be treated symptomatically (e.g., anti-emetics, IV fluid hydration, acetaminophen, 
antihistamines, inhaled bronchodilators).  
 
In case of moderate or severe reactions hydrocortisone will be giv en and the infusion will be discontinued 
and restarted at a slower rate once the symptoms have subsided.  
 If a subject has a persistent severe infusion reaction to alemtuzumab (Campath®) that does not respond to 
measures to ameliorate the signs/symptoms associated to the infusion, the infusion will be discontinued and the subject will be followed for 6 months then taken off study (see section 9.6). 
 
5.4 Permitted supportive care  
 
• Transfusional supportive care (e.g., blood and platelets) as clinically indic ated.  
 
• Growth factors if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_31598]  
 
5.5 Infection Prophylaxis and Monitoring  
 
• Pneumocystis prophylaxis:   Aerosolized pentamidine will be used as prophylaxis against 
Pneumocystis jiroveci , [ADDRESS_647985] 6 months. If at 6 months CD4+ cells are < 200 / µL, Pneumocystis 
jiroveci  prophylaxis will be continued until CD4+ cells > 200 / µL.  Trimethoprim/ 
sulfamethoxazole, Dapsone or other prophylactic regimen against Pneumocystis carinii  may be 
substituted at the discretion of the PI.  
 
• Antiviral prophylaxis:   Valacyclovir [ADDRESS_647986] 2 months to 
subjects regardless of HSV serology status. If at 2 months CD4+ cells are < 200 / µL, antiviral 
prophylaxis will be continued until CD4+ cells > 200 / µL   
 
• Antibacterial prophylaxis: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID until ANC > 200 / µL (in subjects with 
ANC < 200 / µL only).  This drug may be continued at the discretion of the PI.

October 2 7, 2016  13  
• EBV and CMV Monitoring:   Subjects will be monitored for EBV and CMV PCR in the blood 
prior to treatment, then weekly for the first month, every other week in the second month, monthly 
for another [ADDRESS_647987] s with a single temperature of 38.5 ° C or two readings of 38.0 ° C or greater will be evaluated for 
infection including cultures of blood and urine and any other suspi[INVESTIGATOR_503167]. Antibiotics will be initiated following current infectious disease guidelines.   
 
5.[ADDRESS_647988] recently received alemtuzumab (Campath®), should not be immunized wi th live 
viral vaccines due to the immunosuppression.  In addition, other persons living in the household should not take oral polio vaccine since there is a chance they could pass the polio virus on to the subject.  
Subjects will be instructed to avoid per sons who have taken oral polio vaccine within the last several 
months, not to get close to them, or stay in the same room with them for very long. If they cannot take these precautions, they will be instructed to consider wearing a protective face mask that covers the 
nose and mouth.  
 
Subjects who develop hypersensitivity to alemtuzumab (Campath®) will be advised they may have an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction to other monoclonal antibodies.

7.2 Intended use:  These specimens will not be read by a pathologist or used for diagnostic purposes.  The 
studies will not be used in assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken for descriptive or  
exploratory ancillary research .  The se ancillary studies may be done and if done, may be correlated with 
the presence or absence of response to protocol therapy:  
• Characterize LGL cells on a molecular level using gene expression profiling and T -cell receptor 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
 
• Characterize clonal expansions in LGL by V- beta profile and/or TCR -beta chain sequencing in 
the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow; identify the epi[INVESTIGATOR_503169]- SCL.  
 
• Flow cytometric analysis of ly mphocyte subsets

the NHLBI Office of Technology Transfer and Development (OTTAD).  
 
In the event there is sample left over, with the subject’s permission, they will be stored for other 
exploratory laboratory research studies previously reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_503196] A.   
7.3 Storage:   Research samples will be stored with i dentifiers in the secure laboratory of the principal 
investigator.  
7.4 Tracking:     Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS Research Screens.  Should a CRIS

scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed.  
7.6 Loss or destruction of samples:  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan for tracking 
and storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified.  
7.7  Technology Transfer

8.2.[ADDRESS_648000] s who do not complete the treatment course because of 
toxicity or voluntary withdrawal will be included in analyses.  
 8.2.4 Relapse -free survival is defined as the time elapsed between time of documented response to 
Campath and evidence for relapse.  Relapse is defined as a fall in peripheral blood counts to 50% 
the values obtained during the response period.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_648001] s if the treatment is not effective.  
A response probability of 30% or less would warrant terminating the treatment on this patient population, 
and we hypothesize that the actual response probability using this treatme nt would reach 50% or more. 
 Let p be the probability of complete or partial response at 3 months. Our sample size is determined by 
[CONTACT_11700] H
0: p≤30% versus the alternative H 1: p ≥50% at 0.05 significance level and 
0.80 of the power. We determine the sample size using the Two- Stage Minimax Design outlined in Table 
1 of Simon (1989)57. This design is selected because it requires a smaller t otal number of subjec ts (n=39) 
than the Simon’s Two-Stage Optimal Design (n=46). At the first stage, 19 subjects will be accrued and 
the null hypothesis will be accepted (i.e., the treatment will be terminated) if [ADDRESS_648002] s to n=39. 
The null hypothesis of p ≤ 30% will be accepted if the total number of complete and partial responders a t

8.4  Statistical Methods  
 
The planned analyses will include descriptive statistics on the proportions of respons es (i.e. % subjects with 
partial or complete response) and the time to response. The response probabilities will be estimated using 
the sample proportions and their inferences including confidence intervals and hypotheses testing will be evaluated using Binomial distributions.  
 
The time to responses and the relapse-free survival will be analyzed using appropriate tools in survival 
analysis, such as cumulative incidence estimate and Cox regression type analysis for covariates, which 
takes into consideration both death without the event of interest as a complete risk and random censoring 
due to loss of follow-up. The Kaplan- Meier estimates and Cox regression will be used to evaluate the 
treatment effects on the overall survival. Graphical tools will be used to display the appropriate estimates (i.e. estimated proportions, the cumulative incidence curves, Kaplan- Meier curves) and their corresponding 
95% confidence intervals.  
 
Methods based on multiple regression, analysis of variance, and logistic regression wi ll also be employed if 
deemed appropriate.  
 
8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503171]:  
 
 Death  considered to be definitely relat ed to  alemtuzumab (Campath -1H®)  
 Any grade IV toxicity considered to be definitely related to alemtuzumab (Campath-1H®), i.e. 
opportunistic infection such as tissue- invasive CMV or Pneumocystis jiroveci, with exception 
of temporary cytopenias.  
 
We will m onitor the numbers of subjects who have developed one or more of the above treatment related 
severe adverse events (TRSAE).  The study will be seriously considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503172] (Death or any 
grade IV toxicity considered definitely related to Campath) is over a pre- specified threshold value.  
 From our experience using this agent in other clinical settings, we anticipate the rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_503173] 10% or less within the first [ADDRESS_648003] dos e of study 
medication.  Following Geller et al. (2003, “Design of Early Trials in Stem Cell Transplantation: A Hybrid Frequentist-Bayesian Approach”), our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106554] a Bayesian approach.
58 The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503174] 10% is at least 90%. We take our prior 
distribution to be a beta distribution with the sum of the two beta parameters to be 5, i.e. the parameters of 
the beta prior distribution are 0.[ADDRESS_648004] developed TRSAE. The following table summarizes the threshold numbers 
for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503175]:

October [ADDRESS_648005] s who ha ve developed 
any of the TRSAE reaches:  
≤ 10 3 
≤ 17 4 
≤ 24 5 
≤ 32 6 
≤39 7 
 
We investigated the performance of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106558] a simulation study. In each simulation 
run, we generated a study with 39 independent Bernoulli trials, each had a probability p for having the 
above TRSAE and q=1- p for not having such TRSAE and compared the TRSAE outcomes with the 
above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106559]. We repeated the simulation 100,000 times and computed the proportion of stopped studies (i.e. “number of stopped 
studies”/100,000) which were stopped using the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. The following table summarizes the proportions of stopped studies under a number of scenarios for p: 
 
 
Prob of TRSAE = p  2% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 
Proportion of Stopped Studies  0.1%  2.0%  17.5%  47.6%  75.4%  91.6%  
Average Number of Subject s 38.[ADDRESS_648006] that our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106560] a low prob ability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study when the proportion 
of the above TRSAE is below the benchmark value of 10%, and the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study is 
high when the true proportion of the above TRSAE exceeds this benchmark value. Based on these results, 
we believe that our Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106561].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_648007] choice:   Subject s may be removed from study at their request.  The risks of withdrawing will 
be discussed, as will alternative treatment opt ions.  
  
Per principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21781]:   Alemtuzumab (Campath®) administration will be discontinued; the 
subject will be followed until the event has resolved if the subject  develops:  
 
 Intolerance of alemtuzumab (Campath®) infusion as manifested by [CONTACT_27913], fever, chills 
and/or rash that is refractory to supportive measures; OR any subject who develops CTC AE 
grade 4 hepatic injury or DIC subsequent to infusions of alemtuzumab. 
 Life threatening acute hypersensitivity reactions  
 Pregnancy or unwillingness to refrain from pregnancy  
 Initiation of additional immunosuppressive therapy (except steroids or CsA)  
 Failure to respond to Campath therapy  
 Subject non -compliance 
 Lost to follow -up

Those subjects who choose to withdraw or are removed from the study per PI [INVESTIGATOR_503176] [ADDRESS_648008] Campath related safety issues.  Once off study subjects will be referred back to his or her 
referring physician or consented to the Hematology Branch evaluation and treatment protocol (94-H-
0010) for consideration for standard therapy or evaluation for eligibility for another branch protocol, depending on what is considered to be in the best interest of the subject.  
 
9 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
9.1 Safety Monitoring  
 
Principal investigator :  [INVESTIGATOR_106567], efficacy and safety data will be monitored by [CONTACT_978].  
 
NHLBI I RB: Accrual and safety data will be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_94158] (IRB).  Prior 
to implementation of this study, the protocol and the proposed consent form will be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_108670] (IRB) operating according to the Title [ADDRESS_648009] 
continuing annual review so long as the protocol is open to accrual or follow up of subjects. 
 
9.2  Event Characterization and Reporting  
Events include adverse events (AE ), serious adverse events (SAE), protocol deviations (PD), unanticipated 
problems (UP), and non-compliance.    
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_218035] (AEs, protocol deviations, UPs, SAEs) to determine the 
seriousness, expectedness, and reportabi lity of the event.  As required and/or needed, the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_218036].  
9.2.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward or unfavorable medical o ccurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):   A serious adverse event that:  
 results in death;  
 is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred);  
 results in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 results in a persistent or significant incapacity;  
 results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
 based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
 Suspected adverse reaction: Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  22 suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 Serious event: An event is serious if it meets the definition of a serious adverse event (above) or if it requires 
immediate corrective action by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or IRB to protect the safety, welfare or rights of subjects.  
 
Unexpected adverse reaction: A n adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is 
not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events 
or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP):  Any incident, experience, or out come that meets all of the following criteria::  
1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; 
Investigator’s Brochure or  other study documents; and 
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized.  Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event:  An unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition 
of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], invol ves risk to the subject, affect others 
in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data.  For example, report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for study drug. 
 Protocol Deviation (PD):  Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB approved research protocol. 
 
Non-compliance: The failure to comply with applicable NIH HRPP policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory 
requirements for the protection of human resea rch. Noncompliance may be further characterized as:  
 1. Serious non-compliance: Non- compliance that:  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP. d. Inva lidates the study data.  
 
2. Continuing non- compliance: Non -compliance that is recurring. An example may be a pattern of non-
compliance that suggests a likelihood that, absent an intervention, non-compliance will continue. Continuing noncompliance could als o include a failure to respond to IRB requests to resolve previous allegations of non -
compliance.  
3. Minor (non- serious) non -compliance: Non -compliance that, is neither serious nor continuing.

and/or disease. AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_107695] 2.0.  A copy of the criteria can be 
down-loaded from the CTEP home page at   http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting /ctc.html.    
 
Abnormal laboratory findings  used to evaluate the safety of this protocol regimen will be collected to 
include any change from laboratory assessments done prior to first dose of study medication that result in 
a progression to a grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicity.  The laboratory toxicities will be attributed (unrelated, 
unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely) to study medication and/or disease. They will be graded by 
[CONTACT_107695] 2 .0. 
 
Length of Adverse Event reporting: Ad verse event collection will continue for [ADDRESS_648010] rema ins on study. 
 
9.2.3     Serious Adverse Events Management   
 
Serious adverse events will be attributed as definitely (clearly related to the research), probably (likely 
related to the research), possibly (may be related to the research), unlikely (doubtful ly related to the 
research) and unrelated (clear not related to the research).    
 
Treatment related SAEs (TRSAEs) are those attributed as definitely, probably, or possibly. As 
detailed in section 8.5 stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], only Death and any grade IV toxicities considered to be definitely 
related to alemtuzumab (Campath -1H®) will be  monitored and considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503177]. John Tisdale, MD, NIDDK will serve as the independent 
monitor who reviews the att ribution of TRSAEs  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (overnight admission) for routine supportive care (platelet or RBC transfusions) or 
admission from the NIH inpatient unit to the NIH ICU for routine monitoring will not be reported as a 
serious adverse event.

10.3  Risks and Discomforts  
 
10.3.1  Related to alemtuzumab (Campath®)   
Alemtuzumab (LEMTRADA previously marketed as Campath ) may cause an increased risk of 
malignancies, including thyroid cancer, melanoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders in p atients 
with multiple sclerosis ( Product Label, approved on 11/14/2014). 
The most commonly reported infusion related adverse events were  rigors (86%), drug -related fever 
(85%), nausea (54%), vomiting (41%), and hypotension (32%). Hematologic toxicities included 
pancytopenia/marrow hypoplasia (6%), anemia (80%), thrombocytopenia (72%), neutropenia (85%), and 
profound lymphopenia, and should be monitored. Infections reported included sepsis (15%), pneumonia 
(16%), and opportunistic infections such as CMV (8%) , Candidiasis (5%), Aspergillosis (2%), and 
Mucormycosis (2%).  
Infusion -related symptoms and signs:  Alemtuzumab can result in serious infusion reactions which 
include nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, rigors, hypotension, rash, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, pruritus, urticaria, bronchospasm and dyspnea.   An attempt to prevent these reactions is made by [CONTACT_503197]. Subjects will be carefully monitored during infusions.  In case of mild reaction, the subject 
will be treated according to symptoms (antiemetics, IV fluid hydration, acetaminophen, antihistamines, 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  26 inhaled bronchodilators). In case of moderate or severe reaction, the infusion will be discontinued and 
restarted at a lower rate once symptoms have subsided.  
 Infections:   Serious, sometimes fatal bacterial, viral, fungal and protozoan infections have been reported 
in patients receiving alemtuzumab (Campath®).  Subjects will be at risk for opportunistic infections. Therefore subject s will receive prophylaxis for Herpes virus and Pneumocystis jiroveci .   
 
Cardiac toxicities:  The following were reported in at least one patient treated on studies where 
alemtuzumab was used as a single agent: cardiac failure, cyanosis, atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrest, 
ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular tachycard ia, angina pectoris, coronary artery disorder, myocardial 
infarction, and pericarditis. Some of these cardiac abnormalities may be irreversible.  For this reason, we 
will monitor subjects with an echocardiogram and a [ADDRESS_648018] dose of alemtuzumab (Campath®).  The ECHO will also be repeated at the 3 month follow 
up visit.   We will closely monitor subjects for cardiac symptomology and ask them to immediately report 
any cardiac symptoms (palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], ir regular pulse, difficulty in breathing, dizziness, swelling in the 
ankles, chest discomfort or pain).   
Hematologic toxicities:  Myelosuppression involves all 3 cell lineages.  Serious and in rare instances fatal 
pancytopenia/marrow hypoplasia, autoimmune i diopathic thrombocytopenia, and autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia have occurred in patients receiving alemtuzumab (Campath®).   
 
Other side effects  (> 5% in CLL studies) include headache, anorexia, asthenia, skeletal pain, myalgias, 
peripheral edema, dysthesias,  dizziness, tremor, stomatitis, mucositis, dyspnea, cough, pneumonitis, 
rhinitis, abdominal pain, back pain, dyspepsia, constipation, insomnia, depression, somnolence, diarrhea, and EBV related lymphoproliferative disease.   
 
 Pregnancy and breast feeding : Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted.  It is not known 
whether alemtuzumab can affect reproductive capacity or cause fetal harm.  Human IgG is known to pass 
the placental barrier and thus may potentially cause fetal B -cell depletion; theref ore alemtuzumab should 
only be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed.   It is not know whether alemtuzumab is excreted in human milk.  Because human IgG is excreted in human mild and the potential for absorption 
and immunosuppression in the infant  is unknown, women should be advised to discontinue nursing for at 
least [ADDRESS_648019] dose of alemtuzumab (Campath®).  
 
10.3.2  Related to bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]:   No major risks are involved with bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_12752]. However, a small risk of infections, pain, bleeding, and hematoma formation at the 
site of the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218047].  
 
10.3.3  Related to blood draws:   No major risks are involved with blood draws. Minor complications including bleeding, pain, an d hematoma formation at the site of blood draws, vasovagal reactions or 
infections may rarely occur.  
 
10.3.4  Related to Cardiac monitoring 
 
• EKG :  An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heartbeat.   
With each beat,  an electrical impulse (or “wave”) travels through the heart.   This wave causes the 
muscle to squeeze and pump blood from the heart.  A technician will put patches (electrodes) on 
the chest, arms and legs.   The electrodes are soft and don’t cause any disco mfort when they’re put 
on or taken off by [CONTACT_298046].  The machine only records the EKG.  It doesn’t send electricity into the body.  There’s no pain or risk associated with having an electrocardiogram  
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  27  
• ECHO :   The ECHO uses sound waves to visualize an d evaluate the function of the heart. There 
are no associated risks  
 
• Holter Monitor : The Holter involves wearing a monitor for 24 hours during which time the 
electrical activity of the heart is recorded. There are no associated risks other than the 
inconvenience of wearing the apparatus.  
 
10.3.5  Related to central line placement :  A catheter may be placed in a large vein of the neck, chest, 
or arm  using local anesthetic. Subjects will sign a separate consent for the placement procedure. Only 
trained experienced staff will place the line in order to minimize these procedure related risks 
 The risks from the procedure are low; they include bleeding, bruising, or infection at the site of 
insertion. Very rarely (less than 1% of the time), the line placement may nick a vein causing one lung to 
collapse during line insertion. If the lung collapses, a tube may have to be inserted into the chest and 
remain in place until the lung re -expands. Because of this risk, subjects will have a chest x -ray 
following the proce dure to make sure the line is in the correct place and that the lung is not collapsed. 
Once placed, the line will remain in place until drug administration is complete.   
 
10.3.6  Related  to  Infection  medications  
 
• Pentamidine: cough (31- 47%), bronchospa sm (10 -23%), decreased appetite (53-72%), fatigue, 
metallic taste, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, dizziness, rash, nausea, pharyngitis, chest 
pain/congestion, night sweats, chills, vomiting.  
 
• Valacyclovir:  Nausea and/or vomiting, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, 
arthralgia, acute hypersensitivity reactions, elevations in liver enzyme laboratory values (e.g. AST).  
Renal failure and CNS symptoms have been reported in patients with renal impairment who received valacyclovir at gr eater than the recommended dose  
 
• Cirpofloxacin  (Cipro, Cipro XR, Proquin XR) The most frequent side effects include nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, rash, headache, and restlessness. Rare allergic reactions have 
been described, such as hives  and anaphylaxis (shock). Rare instances of seizures, other neurologic 
sequella and tendon ruptu re have been reported. Drug interactions with other medications have 
been reported and these will be reviewed before antibiotic start.  July 8th 2008 the FDA warned the 
prescribing community of the newly required “black box warning” that caution patients over 60,  
those taking corticosteroids, and those who've undergone heart, lung, or kidney transplants  are  at 
increased risk of tendon rupture or tendinitis if they take fluoroquin olones .  FDA estimates that 
spontaneous ruptures occur in about one in 100,[ADDRESS_648020] apheresis donation policies 
and procedures operative in the Dept. of Transfusion Medicine and will be in compliance with the 
Blood Donor Standards of the American Association of Blood Banks and the rules and regulations of the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse reactions to apheresis procedures are rare, bu t include:  
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  28  
• Pain and hematoma at the needle placement site  
• Vasovagal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], characterized by [CONTACT_108684], dizziness, nausea and rarely, 
syncope are seen in less than 2% of the procedures. Hypotension secondary to volume depletion is known for the rare potential for a cerebrovascular or cardiovascular event.  
• Cutaneous or circumoral  parasthesias, chills, nausea, heartburn and rarely muscle spasms may result from the use of citrate anticoagulant used to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate reactions are usually relieved by [CONTACT_503198].  
 
Prior to each apheresis, the potential risks associated with the proc edure will be explained to the patient 
and a separate informed consent obtained.  
 
10.4 Risks in relation to benefits  
  
 For adult subjects:  
 
The potential benefit to the subject include reduction or even abolition of transfusion requirements and/or improvement of cytopenia, resulting in improved quality of life and also decreased morbidity 
and mortality from transfusion-associated viral agents, iron overload, and/or a susceptibility to 
infections. Potentially, treatment with other more toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_106580].  
 
Therefore, the research involves greater than  minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit

Informed Consent of Non -English Speaking Research Participants:  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no translated extant IRB 
approved consent document,  the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_503180] M77 -2, 45 CFR 
46.117 ( b) (2). The summary that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB approved 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October [ADDRESS_648022] that consent document translated into the given inherent language.  
Informed Consent for adult research participants unable to provide consent:  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant unable to provide informed consent, the 
following justification and procedures per NIH HRPP SOP 14E will be used to enrolled participants in 
the this protocol.  
Justification for inclusion:   This research provides the prospect of direct benefit, therefore inclusion is 
justified.  The benefits to the participants could be reduction or even abol ition of transfusion 
requirements and/or i mprovement of cytopenias resulting in improved quality of life and also 
decreased morbidity and mortality from transfusion- associated viral agents.   Potentially, bleeding 
complications and treatment with other more toxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_106580].  Not 
allowing participants who cannot provide consent would deny them the potential benefits this protocol 
offers for their MDS.  There are no plans to include institutionalized participants. 
 
Risk/Bene fit Assessment : 
This research involves greater than minimal risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 
CFR 46.102) 
 
Consent and Assent: 
Procedures to determine capacity: If documentation of decision making capacity is not present in the medic al record or the investigator questions the decision making capacity of the 
individual, then the Ability to Consent Assessment Team (ACAT) ([PHONE_6313] or [PHONE_6314]) will be contact[CONTACT_302602]. 
 
Procedures for obtaining consent for leg ally authorized representative (LAR) (Risk Level B per 
SOP 14E):  The following procedures will be followed starting with (1) in order to determining 
the LAR.  
(1) For adults who cannot consent and have a court appointed guardian from a 
jurisdiction that a llows it or a Durable Power of Attorney (DPA) for health care and/or 
research participation, the PI/designee or ACAT confirms appropriateness of surrogate to consent to research, including that: 
 (a)The surrogate understands that the protocol involves research;  
(b)The surrogate understands the risks, potential benefits, (if any), and alternatives to the study; 
(c)The surrogate has sufficient reason to believe participation in the study is consistent 
with the subject’s preferences and values  
 (2) Adults who cannot consent and who do not have a DPA or court-appointed 
guardian, but who are capable of understanding the DPA process and can assign a 
DPA, then ACAT confirms appropriateness of surrogate to consent to research, which includes assessing criteria (a)-( c) above.  
 (3) Adults who cannot consent, who do not have a DPA or court-appointed guardian, 
and who are not able to understand the DPA process to appoint a DPA, then a person at 
the highest level of the following list may serve as surrogate and authorize subject’s 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  30 participation if ACAT confirms surrogate appropriateness (which includes assessing 
criteria (a) -(c) above):  
1. spouse or domestic partner; 2. adult child; 
3. parent; 
4. sibling; 5. other close relative 
 
If at any time there is a question about th e authority of the LAR to provide consent 
based on the jurisdiction appointing the durable power of attorney or other legal question regarding the LAR to provide consent, the Office of the General Counsel will be consulted. 
 
Procedures to obtain assent and  documentation of assent or dissent:  The informed consent 
discussion will include the individual unable to provide informed consent along with LAR.  The individual unable to provided informed consent will be asked if they agree to participate in 
the research and this will be documented in the medical record.

12     PHARMACEUTICALS  
12.1 ALEMTUZUMAB (CAMPATH®)  
 
Generic: alemtuzumab ,  NSC#715959  
Classification : monoclonal antibody  
Action : Monoclonal antibody directed against CD52 antigen, a surface glycoprotein expressed by 
[CONTACT_503199]: Campath pharmacokinetics were characte rized in a study of30 Campath- naïve 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia(B -CLL) who had failed previous therapy with purine 
analogs. Campath was administered as a [ADDRESS_648024] 30 mg dose, the mean volume of distribution at steady -state was 0.18 L/kg (range: 0.1 to 0.4 L/kg).Systemic 
clearance decreased with repeated administration due to decreased receptor -mediated clearance 
(i.e., loss of CD52receptors in the periphery). After 12 weeks of dosing, patients exhibited a seven-
fold increase in mean AUC. Mean half-life was11 hours (range: 2 to 32 hours) after the first 30 mg 
dose and was 6 days (range: 1 to 14 days) after the last 30 mg dose. Comparisons of AUC in 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  31 patients 65 years or older (n=6) versus patients less than 65 years (n=15) suggested that no dose 
adjustments are necessary for age. Comparisons of AUC in female patients (n=4) versus male 
patients (n=17) suggested that no dose adjustments are necessary for gender. The pharmacokinetics 
of Campath in pediatric patients have not been studied. The effects of renal or hepatic impairment 
on the pharmacokinetics of Campath have not been studied. 
Availability /Supply : Available through the Campath Distribution Program (The [COMPANY_011] Foundation for 
North America 1 -[PHONE_10430]). Vials are provided through this program upon completion of a patient 
specific request form. Prior to submission of a drug request the patient must provide authorization for 
the release of medical information (NIH -527). Refer to the Pharmacy Department or Clinical Pharmacy 
Specialist for additional details on drug procurement.  Each single use, clear glass vial of Campath 
contains 30 mg Alemtuzumab in 1 mL of solution (8.0 mg sodium chloride, 1.44 mg dibasic sodium 
phosphate, 0.2 mg potassium chloride, 0.2 mg monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.1 mg polysorbate 80, 
and .0187 mg dis odium edetate dehydrate). No preservatives are added. Each carton contains three 
Campath vials (NDC [ZIP_CODE]-357-03) or one Campath vial NDC [ZIP_CODE]-357-01). Product description : Alemtuzumab injection is available in single -use, clear glass vials containing 30 
mg of alemtuzumab in 1 ml of solution 
Storage:  Stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) and protected from direct 
sunlight. Protect from freezing; discard if frozen. 
Stability : Diluted solution for administration can be stored at room temperature (15 to 30 degrees 
Celsius) or refrigerated, and should be used within 8 hours after dilution; protect solution from 
light.  
Preparation for Administration : Parenteral drug products should be inspected for visible particulate 
matter and discolor ation prior to administration. If particulate matter is present or the solution is 
discolored, the vial should not be used. DO NOT SHAKE VIAL PRIOR TO USE. As with all 
parenteral drug products, aseptic technique should be used during the preparation and administration of alemtuzumab (Campath®). Withdraw the necessary amount of alemtuzumab from 
the vial (solution concentrated to 30mg/ml) into a [ADDRESS_648025] into 100 mL sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP or 5% Dextrose in Water USP. Gently 
invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard syringe and any unused drug product .  
12.2 CIPROFLOXACIN  
Drug Class and Mechanism:  Many common infections in humans are caused by [CONTACT_503200], 
called bacteria. Bacteria can grow and multiply, infecting different parts of the body. Medicines 
that control and eradicate these bacteria are called antibiotics. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that 
stops multiplication of bacteria by [CONTACT_503201] (DNA).  
Supply: Commercially available  
Drug interactions:  Ciprofloxacin administered together with theophylline
 can lead to elevated blood 
levels of theophylline. Theophy lline is used to open airways in the treatment of asthma . Toxic 
levels of theophylline can lead to seizures, and disturbances in heart rhythm. If concurrent use of ciprofloxacin and theophylline cannot be avoided, frequent blood tests to monitor theophylline 
blood levels are performed. Ciprofloxacin should be used with caution in subject s with central 
nervous system diseases such as seizures, because rare seizures have been report ed in subject s 
receiving this medication. Many antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, can alter the normal bacteria 
in the colon and encourage overgrowth of a bacteria responsible for the development of 
inflammation of the colon (pseudomembranous colitis). Pseudomembranous colitis can cause fever, 
abdominal pain, diarrhea , and sometimes even shock. Pati ents taking ciprofloxacin can develop 
sensitivity of the skin to direct sunlight. Ciprofloxacin can enhance the action of the anticoagulant 
warfarin  (Coumadin), and increase the risk of bleeding.  
Storage and Stability:  Ciprofloxacin should be stored at below 86 degrees F 
 
06-H- 0190 (Amendment N) 
Stefan Cordes, MD  
October 2 7, 2016  32 Administration: Ciprofloxacin may be taken with or without food. Ciprofloxacin is partially 
metabolized by [CONTACT_503202]. Dosages require a djustment in patients with 
severely abnormal liver or kidney function. Antacids block the absorption of ciprofloxacin and they 
should not be taken together.  
Adverse reaction s: see section 10.3.8, Risks and discomforts  
 
12.3 PENTAMIDINE  
 
Supply:  Commercially available (NebuPent®, American Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc.)  
Product description:    Pentamidine isethionate is available as a [ADDRESS_648026] be dissolved in 6 mL of sterile water for injection, USP. It is important to use only sterile water; saline solution will 
cause the drug to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047].  
Storage and stability:   Store dry product at controlled room temperature 15-30

 1. INTRODUCTION  46 
Peritoneal dialysis  (PD) is a form of renal replacement therapy indicated for those with acute 47 
kidney injury or end stage renal disease  (ESRD) . In 2013 PD was utilized  in approximately 7%  of [ADDRESS_1264619] in the [LOCATION_002] . Within that time, the  prevalence 49 
of PD has seen an increase by [CONTACT_46431] 30% between 2007 – 2014.[ADDRESS_1264620] and is individualized based on patient and life -style specific 61 
factors. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) allows 4 – 5 exchanges performed 62 
manually whereas automated periton eal dialysis (APD) involves continuous, automated , cyclical  63 
exchanges performed by a device at home during the night.3 APD offers advantages over CAPD 64 
by [CONTACT_901456] -free or “dry” daytime dwel ls thereby [CONTACT_901457] [ADDRESS_1264621] been 67 
reporte d.3 Overall, the prevalence of APD has been increasing throughout the years as  the 68 
number of patients utilizing CAPD declines.4  69 
 70 
Vancomycin in Peritoneal Dialysis  71 
Peritonitis is a common complication in PD and accounts for  a large portion  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 72 
readmission and mortality.1,5 In addition, severe or prolonged peritonitis can lead to membrane 73 
failure prompting the switch from PD to hemodialysis.  The International Society of Peritoneal 74 
Dialysis (ISPD) recommends intraperitoneal administration  as the preferred route to deliver [ADDRESS_1264622] 80 
characterized by a distribution and elimination phase foll owing parenteral administration. 81 
Vancomycin’s bactericidal activity is considered time -dependent with the ratio of the 24-hour  82 
area -under -the-concentration (AUC) versus time/minimal -inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio 83 
(AUC/MIC) being the best pharmacokine tic/pharmacodynamic predictor of effectiveness. The 84 
preferred AUC/MIC ratio is > 400. Dosing in the range of 15 -30 mg/kg is recommended by [CONTACT_292247] 85 
Pharmacokinetics of Vancomycin in Automated Peritoneal Dialysis

Page 4 of 14 
 professional societies including ISPD to maintain a serum concentration level of 15 mg/L in order 86 
to maximize  efficacy and reduce toxicity , although this trough is only loosely correlated with 87 
corresponding AUC/MIC .5,6 Furthermore , the evidence supporting  this recommend ed trough  is 88 
essentially nonexistent  in PD patients on APD, where data on vancomycin bioavailability and 89 
clearance with varying degrees of peritoneal function is sparse.  In addition,  early 90 
pharmacokinetic studies were conducted only in patients on CAPD modalities, glucose -based 91 
prescriptions, or those on intravenous vancomycin.7-9  Lastly, the relationship between serum 92 
concentration and site of action at the peritoneal cavity wall is not established.  In totality, the 93 
goal is to close the knowledge gap in this very common use of vancomycin.  94 
Although the ISPD advisory comm ittee on peritonitis management recommends a 25% increase [ADDRESS_1264623] the  exposure, 96 
clearance, distribution and serum half -life for those antibiotics administered. This however is an 97 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_901453] 98 
(RKF)  may impact pharmacokinetics. The impact on RKF on vancomycin in PD is also lacking. RKF 99 
is critical for the welfare and survival  of PD patients. Indeed, 2 la rge multicenter studies, the 100 
Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD -2) (AJKD;41:1293 -2302, 101 
2003) and the Canada/[LOCATION_003] Peritoneal Adequacy Study (CAN[LOCATION_003])  (JASN, 12:2158 -2162, 2001) , [ADDRESS_1264624] shown statistically significant (by [CONTACT_901458]) 12% reductions in mortality 103 
per ml/min/1.73 m2 residual GFR increase or per 5L/week  residual GFR increase, respectively.  [ADDRESS_1264625], the enhanced vancomycin clearance of RKF may result in under -dosing and 106 
secondly, overdosing may result in nephrotoxicity and loss of critically important RKF. This 107 
presents a challenge when considering the bi -exponential pharmacokinetic behavior of 108 
vancomycin  and produces a significant source of variability allowing controversy in the role of 109 
monitoring serum vancomycin in patients on APD.10,11 110 
Interestingly, a  recent retrospective analysis examining residual renal function and peritonitis 111 
outcomes show that the  odds of peritonitis treatment failure for those with urinary creatinine 112 
clearances of greater than 5 mL/min were greater when co mpared to those who were anuric.[ADDRESS_1264626] shown to improve fluid removal during long 120 
dialysis exchanges and offer greater peritoneal membrane protection.  In-vitro studies conducted 121 
with 7.5% icodextrin demonstrate physic al compatibility and chemical stability, however there is [ADDRESS_1264627] on the minimum inhibitory 123

 concentration of vancomycin in -vivo.13 As there will be increasing use of icodextrin, 124 
characterization of vancomycin pharmacokinetics will be important.  125 
Therefore, this current study a ims to explore the pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  of 126 
intraperitoneal administered vancomycin in un -infected subjects on APD and explore the in -vivo 127 
behavior of vancomycin in 7.5% icodextrin PD solution.    128 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  129 
2.1 Primary Objective  130 
 Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of vancomycin in serum , urine,  and dialysate 131 
following a single intermittent intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin in non -infected 132 
patients on automated peritoneal dialysis  133 
2.2 Secondary Objective s 134 
 Examine the relatio nship between residual kidney function and vancomycin clearance 135 
using serum, dialysate and urine  136 
 Describe the safety, tolerability, and stability of intraperitoneal vancomycin when 137 
administered in a 7.5% icodextrin -containing dialysis solution  138 
2.3  Exploratory Objectives  139 
 Investigate  dosing recommendations and adjustments based on population 140 
pharmacokinetic parameters generated from serum and dialysate concentrations in adult 141 
patients on APD  142 
 Correlate the peritoneal transport function, measured using the peritoneal equilibration [ADDRESS_1264628] (PET), to vancomycin pharmacokinetics  144 
 Correlate dialysis adequacy, measured as a function of peritoneum urea  clearance, time, 145 
and volume of dialyzer fluid (Kt/V), to vancomycin pharmacokinetics  [ADDRESS_1264629] at 152 
the Thomas Jefferson University Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  153 
 154 
Subjects will be on an APD  regimen consisting of a 12 -hour overnight dwell followed by a 9 -hour 155 
on-cycler exchange  (figure 1) . Vancomycin will be administered via intraperitoneal injection in 1 156 
liter of icodextrin solution. There will be 4 exchanges during  the 9 -hour exchange period. A sparse 157 
sampling approach will be used in collecting blood samples. A total of 16 blood samples will be 158 
collected.  159

 7. SAMPLE SIZE AND ANALYSIS PLAN  414 
8.1 Sample Size  415 
Due to the exploratory nature of this pharmacokinetic study, no fo rmal sample size calculation 416 
was performed. A total of 4 subjects will be enrolled.  417 
8.2 Statistical and Pharmacokinetic Analysis  418 
A non -compartmental analysis (NCA) will be utilized to estimate vancomycin pharmacokinetic 419 
parameters in patients on APD. The values generated from the NCA will be used to parameterize 420 
the population pharmacokinetic model.  421 
 422 
Data from all patients will be analyzed simultaneously using nonlinear mixed -effects modelling 423 
software (NONMEM). A base model will be developed to characterize the data. Covariate analysis [ADDRESS_1264640] (HIPAA) and FDA 21 CFR  Part 11. Data files can be conveniently exported into 433 
various data formats (e.g. Microsoft Excel, SAS Statistical Software, R, SPSS, or STATA) for further 434 
analysis.  435 
8.2 Case Report Forms and Data Entry  436 
Clinical and demographic data will be collected from  paper source documents . Information will 437 
be entered into an electronic case report form (eCRF). Each enrolled subject’s eCRF will then be 438 
transcribed into REDCap and will serve as a central repository of all enrolled subjects in the study. 439 
A data monitor will monitor the accuracy of the study charts and data entry.  440 
8.3 Case Report Form Storage and Backup  441 
The eCRF will be stored in the Department  of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics 442 
secured server. Access will only be granted by [CONTACT_901459] -investigators.  443 
9. SAFETY  444 
Vancomycin has been previously studied  in non -infected patients on peritoneal dialysis. In 445 
addition, the dose selected in this study is not devoid of the doses used in previous studies 446 
administered intravenously or through the intraperitoneal route.7,9 The safety and tolerability of 447 
vancomycin administered through the intraperitoneal route will be assessed in this study by 448 
clinical evaluation of vital si gns, physical examinations, and laboratory safety evaluations. In 449 
addition, continual serum concentration monitoring through blood sampling will be performed 450

 as part of this research study. In addition, the likelihood for rare adverse events to vancomycin 451 
such as ototoxicity will be unlikely to occur based on the minimal dose used compared to 452 
literature.14 Nephrotoxicity from a single IP 20 mg/kg dose of vancomycin would be extremely [ADDRESS_1264641] . Major risk factors for nephrotoxicity related to vancomycin dosing include 455 
large daily doses (> 4grams/day), prolonged duration , and concurrent potentially toxic antibiotics 456 
(aminoglycosides or pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -tazobactam), none of which apply to this study protocol. Other [ADDRESS_1264642] accordance with 45 462

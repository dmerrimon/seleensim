1.1 Background and Scientific Rationale 
 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory state of the gastrointestinal 
tract(1)  affecting 3.1 million people in the [LOCATION_002]. (2, 3)  Patients with IBD are treated 
with immunosuppressants that increase their risk of herpes zoster (HZ), also known as shingles. (4-6)  Those with IBD have a two- fold increased risk for HZ compared to age 
matched controls.  Because most IBD patients are treated with systemic immunosuppressants, which are an independent risk factor for HZ, the live attenuated HZ vaccine was not 
recommended.  However, the release of the new inactivated HZ vaccine, Shingrix 
(GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, [LOCATION_006]), presents new opportunities for preventive care.   The FDA 
recently lowered the age of Shingrix that allows all adults 18 and older  to receive the vaccine.   
 
Vedolizumab is an α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody that mainly affects gastrointestinal mucosa and associated lymphoid tissue and may not increase the risk for HZ.   It selectively 
downregulates gut inflammation by [CONTACT_240152] T- lymphocyte trafficking, without 
systemic immunosuppression. (7)  Vedolizumab does not appear to increase the risk for HZ. (8) 
A HZ subunit vaccine was recently approved and will be safe to administer to immunosuppressed IBD patients. (9)  (10)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_240139], studies elucidating immunogenicity of the HZ subunit vaccine are lacking.  
 
This proposal will evaluate the immunogenicity of the new herpes zoster subunit vaccine in IBD patients on vedolizumab compared to those on anti -tumor necrosis 
factor therapy in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   We will evaluate if the cell -mediated immunity to VZV is 
boosted with immunization.  Reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) results in HZ, and 
strong cell mediated immunity prevents reactivation of HZ. (11)  (12)  
 
Our primary goal is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the herpes zoster subunit vaccine to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_240140] a larger  immunogenicity study. We will c ompare the VZV -specific T 
cell response (cell mediate immunity) prior and after immunization with the herpes subunit vaccine in IBD patients 18- [ADDRESS_291531].   T cell response is critical in preventing reactivation of VZV and will be measured using an interferon gamma (IFN γ) enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT), the 
standard measure of CMI to VZV. (13)  Our lab has previously evaluated T cell response to 
influenza and hepatitis B vaccine in lung transplant patients. (14, 15)  We are currently 
evaluating cell -mediated immunity via ELISPOT in immunosuppressed and non-
immunosuppresed IBD patients.   
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_240141] a larger multi -center study

superior response to those on anti -TNF therapy. A recent study showed that hepatitis B 
vaccine immunogenicity was not affected by [CONTACT_240153]. (18)   Additionally, our preliminary 
data showed that IBD patients on vedolizumab were able mount a superior response to the 
influenza vaccine compared to those on anti -TNF therapy.

2.0 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 
 
The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity of the herpes zoster 
subunit vaccine in IBD patients on vedolizumab compared to those on anti -TNF monotherapy.   
 
Primary objective The primary objective will be the change in cell mediated immunity (CMI) 
as measured by [CONTACT_240154]- immunization to one month after receiving second dose of 
vaccine.  We anticipate that the change in CMI will be greater for the IBD patients  on 
vedolizumab (Group B) compared to the IBD patients treated with anti -TNF monotherapy 
(Group A).  
 Secondary objective: Sustained T cell response:  We will measure sustained change in CMI 
at [ADDRESS_291533] -immunization.  
 
Secondary objective:  Antibody response A secondary outcome will be the change in VZV 
antibody concentration from pre- immunization to one month post -immunization.  This 
quantitative VZV antibody concentration will be in addition to the one that will be used to 
determine previous varicella infec tion for study eligibility.  We will also compare the VZV 
antibody concentration s at 6 and 12 months following vaccine administration.   
 Secondary objective: vaccine adverse effects.   To evaluate for adverse effects following 
immunization patients will receive phone calls from study personnel to ascertain vaccine -
related adverse effects at months 1, 2, 3.  Our study is underpowered to measure differences 
in adverse effects between groups.  Adverse event data will be reported.

3.1 Primary Endpoints 
 
The primary endpoint will be evaluating the change in cell- mediated immunity (CMI) between 
vedolizumab and anti -TNF monotherapy patients  following the two- dose herpes zoster vaccine 
series .  
 
3.1 Secondary Endpoints  
 
We will measure sustained change in CMI at 6 months’ post -immunization. Another secondary 
endpoint will be the change in VZV antibody concentration from pre- immunization to [ADDRESS_291534]-immunization.   
 
3.2 Safety Endpoints 
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_20497] (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) as well as by [CONTACT_240155] -Bradshaw Index (HBI) or the 
Simple Colitis Activity Index  (SCAI) questionnaire at the baseline visit and at three to four week  
post-vaccination.

4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
4.1 Program Type / Scope of Study / Clinical Design / Sites  
 
This is  a single center study evaluating the immune response to herpes zoster subunit vaccine 
in IBD patients on vedolizumab compared to those on anti -TNF monotherapy.   Patients will be 
recruited at the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166] .  Humoral and cell mediated 
immunity will be evaluated at initial visit, and at one, 6 and 12 months after second dose of vaccine . 
 4.1.1 Lead Site Responsibilities  
 The University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240142] s will be the only  site for the study and be 
responsible  for the following: coordinating activities  at all sites , receiving and analyzing 
samples and data,  and develop ing and updating the study protocol as needed.  
 Communication pl an: UW will hold monthly teleconferences (lead by [INVESTIGATOR_240137], UW PI) 
with research staff (such as  research coordinator). At this teleconference,  the following will be 
discussed: recruitment , barriers to recruitment and potential future protocol changes.    
 
 
Adverse events/ SAE/ Unanticipated problems:  All Adverse events, including adverse events 
to vaccines, flares of IBD and deviations from the protocol will be reported to the lead site 
within 3 days and reported to [COMPANY_005] within 4 calendar days. The lead site will be responsible 
for reporting any adverse events as described in the Safety Reporting section. All fatal or life-
threatening SAEs and pregnancies will be reported to the lead site and [COMPANY_005] within 24 
hours.  
 Compliance with protocol:  To assure no deviations from the protocol occur, the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_240143] .  Any deviations  in protocol will be further investigated 
to evaluate the root  cause for deviation.  
 Changes in protocol:  All changes in protocol need to be approved at  University of Wisconsin .

• Adults with established inflammatory bowel disease age 18-70  
• Two study cohort will included  
o Group A IBD patients on anti -TNF monotherapy  
o Group B IBD patients on vedolizumab monotherapy  
Patients in both groups should have been on stable treatment for IBD for at least three months.

3 Number of Subjects 
(Statistical Justification)  
 
We will recruit up to total of up to 17 
IBD patients on anti -TNF 
monotherapy (Group A) and up to 16 
IBD patients on vedolizumab (Group B).  
We will enroll up to 33 patients in the 
study. We base this sample size 
calculation on the Rondaan study that compared VZV immune responses measured by [CONTACT_240156] (SLE) to healthy 
individuals  (19).  We used the Rondaan study’s median as our estimated measure of central 
tendency and a conservative standard deviation estimate for the power calculation.
  
 
 
We will compare CMI response following subunit zoster vaccine series  among IBD patients 
treated anti -TNF monotherapy and vedolizumab.  Because there are no previous data on 
vaccine responses to HZ in IBD patients from which we can calculate power estimates, sample size has been determined by [CONTACT_240157] a year.  Our goal is to 
derive estimates of vaccine response results in this population to power future studies. Julious and van Belle devised the “rule of 12” as the sample size that optimizes the width of the 
confidence interval for pi[INVESTIGATOR_240144].  (20) (21) The confidence interval includes the 
range of likely values for the population and will be useful for planning the clinical trial.  (20) The 
width of the confidence interval decreases sharply until the sample size reaches [ADDRESS_291535]

  7.[ADDRESS_291547] two blood specimens collected at four visits 
(days 0, 90, 240, and 425) for evaluation of humoral and cell mediated immunity to herpes 
zoster subunit vaccine.  Subjects who do not have a history of chicken pox or a documented 
VZV IgG antibody result on file will have an additional blood draw collection to confirm previous 
exposure to the varicella virus. Humoral immunity will be measured using VZV antibody to 
ELISA and cell mediated immunity will be evaluated via ELISPOT.  
 Specimens at UW will be labeled with the subject’s study ID number and date of collection so   
that data collected for this protocol can be linked to the sample. Samples will be stored in Rennebohm Hall at the University of Wisconsin. Only investigators and key personnel 
assigned to the laboratory have access to the lab. Samples will be coded (labeled with subject 
ID and date of collection) before they arrive to the lab. All computers used for data storage and analysis are password protected and used exclusively by [CONTACT_69289].

Protocol Version 3.0 
Dated: November 16, 2022  18  
All analysis on samples will be completed by [CONTACT_240171] . 
 Any future studies that will utilize  these specimens will be done by [CONTACT_240159] a separate IRB approval. Only coded samples and data will be released for future research. The information linking the samples and data to individual subjects will not be 
released.  
 
Varicella zoster antibody ELISA.  Serum samples obtained prior to zoster vaccine 
administration, 90 days, 240 days and 425 days  will be used to measure varicella antibody 
concentrations.   Sera are being stored at – 80oC. These assays are done separately from the 
qualitative varicella zoster IgG clinical lab measurement to determine eligibility to participate in the study.  Varicella antibody concentrations in s erum samples will be measured using a 
commercially available ELISA kit (Abnova, Walnut, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  Although no correlation between varicella antibody concentration and protection 
from z oster has been identified, (22)   the change in antibody concentration following 
immunization shows an immune response to the vaccine and is often included as a marker of zoster vaccine immunogenicity. (23)    
 Measure of Effect: ELISPOT and Antibody response ELISPOT . ELISPOT is an enzyme-
linked assay for detecting and enumerating cytokine- producing lymphocytes.   ELISPOT can 
detect cytokine- producing cells in as few as 1 in 300,000 cells. (24)    ELISPOT is the standard 
for measuring varicella CMI  and will be used to measure CMI on days 0, 90, 180 and 365. (25) 
Cytokine ELISPOT Sets for IFNγ (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen; San Diego, CA) will be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  All ELISPOTs will be performed in duplicate. 
Tetanus toxoid and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Sigma, St. Louis) will be used as positive 
controls.  Two hundred thousand lymphocytes will be incubated with varicella zoster antigen, 
tetanus toxoid, PHA, or media alone (negative control) on IFNγ antibody coated plates at [ADDRESS_291548] and labeled det ection antibody added (biotin and 
avidin- horseradish peroxidase) followed by a chromogenic substrate.  A colored spot indicates 
a cell producing IFNγ.  Each well will be inspected and cytokine- producing cells will be counted 
using AID® imaging system.  Any well with more than 300 spots will be considered too 
numerous to count and reported as >300 cells/well.  ELISPOT will be repeated on these specimens starting with fewer cells.  
 7.3.2 Disease Activity Assessment  
 
The Harvey -Bradshaw Index (HBI) or the Simple Colitis Activity Index  (SCAI) questionnaire will 
be used to assess for CD or UC disease activity respectively  (Appendices 1 and 2) . These 
assessments include questions about patient overall well -being as well as specific symptoms 
and complications of CD or UC, such as stool frequency and abdominal pain.

8.0   S AFETY REPORTING   
 
Safety Reporting 
Institution/Investigator is solely responsible for reporting all Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events to regulatory authorities, investigators, IRBs or IECs , [COMPANY_004] and [COMPANY_005], as 
applicable, in accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study i s 
conducted.  
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs and pregnancy reports must also be 
reported in English by [CONTACT_161620]:  
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs within 24 hours of the sponsor -investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event  
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 
Protocol Version 3.0 
Dated: November 16, 2022  21 All other serious (non- fatal/non life threatening) events within 4 calendar days of 
the sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
 
[COMPANY_005] Safety Reporting Contact [CONTACT_240172]’s Pharmacovigilance 
Department as outlined in the study contract.  
 
All reported adverse drug reactions and safety issues related to [COMPANY_005] compound must be included in the final study report.  
Definitions:  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a medicinal product; the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to 
the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that 
has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.  
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseli ne.  We are 
mainly concerned of flares of disease immediately after vaccination at the blood sample # 2 visit.   
 
 
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility. This includes adverse 
reactions which arise from: use of a medicinal product within the terms of the marketing 
authorization; use outside the terms of the marketing authorization, including overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors; and occupational exposure*.  
* This corresponds to the exposure to a medicinal product for human use as a result of one’s occupation, such as nurses who may handle products routinely in their occupational setting.  
 
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
1) results in death,  
2) is life-threatening,  
Note: The term “life- threatening” in the definition of “serious”  refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 CONFIDENTIAL   
 
Protocol Version 3.0 
Dated: November 16, 2022  22 3) requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240149],  
4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , 
5) leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect , 
6) may require intervention to prevent one of 1) -5) above or may  expose the patient to 
danger, even though the event is not  immediately life -threatening or fatal or does not 
result in  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe 
in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor m edical significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache).  This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient’s life or ability to funct ion.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be 
considered serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm
3 to less than 2000 is 
considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) 
serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Events 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, 
she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue study drug.  The sponsor -investigator must fax a completed Pregnancy Form to the [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance 
or designee immediately.  The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy outcome 
(i.e., delivery, still birth, miscarriage) and [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance or designee will request 
this information from the sponsor -investigator.  Please refer to study contract for [COMPANY_005] 
pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_3031].  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation 
in this study, the sponsor -investigator must also immediately fax a completed Pregnancy Form 
to the [COMPANY_005] Pharmacovigilance or designee. Every effort should be made to follow the 
pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.  Please refer to study contract for [COMPANY_005] 
pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_3031].  
Product Complaints and Medication Errors  
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals who 
identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact [CONTACT_240173].   
A medication error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable patient and that leads to 
inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient harm.  While overdoses and 
underdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by a patient do not.

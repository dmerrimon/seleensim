BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease(s)  
 
Summary of SARS -CoV -2 and an overview of the COVID -19 pandemic  
 
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (S ARS -CoV -2) is a novel single stranded RNA 
betacoronavirus that can cause severe infections in humans, first identified in December 2019, 
and spreading widely across the globe since that time [1 -3]. The World Health Organization 
declared COVID -19 a global p andemic on March 11, 2020 [4].  As of September 2021, there 
have been over 4.7 million COVID -19-associated deaths worldwide [5].  
 
Patients infected with SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472221] a wide range of clinical symptoms, from individuals 
who are fully asymptomatic to those  with fulminant respi[INVESTIGATOR_377296] [6 -7]. 
Many patients with COVID -19 experience a range of symptoms including fatigue, body aches, 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
7 fever or chills, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, headache, nausea, 
vomiting , or diarrhea [6 -8]. Even when mild at onset, there is growing evidence these symptoms 
can persist for prolonged periods of time after the acute infection has resolved. Patients with 
severe SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472222] emental oxygen, 
pulmonary edema, lung infiltrates, and systemic inflammation, with elevated interleukin -6 and 
C-reactive protein levels [9 -10]. Patients who become critically ill from COVID -[ADDRESS_472223] high mortality rates [9].  
 
Not all patients are similarly affected by [CONTACT_4113] -19 infection - there is growing evidence that 
certain factors are associated with particularly severe clinical outcomes. Age is believed to be a 
strong risk factor for poor C OVID -19 outcomes, and over 80% of COVID -19-related deaths 
have occurred in people who are 65 years or older [11]. Moreover, an array of pre -existing 
medical conditions have been linked to a high risk of severe disease and death due to COVID -19, 
including o besity and diabetes, chronic lung disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and 
underlying immunocompromising states, including both solid organ and stem cell transplants 
[12-13]. Finally, patients with many of these preexisting comorbidities have a significantly 
higher risk of in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380] [14,15].  
 
For most patients, a full recovery from SARS -CoV -2 infection occurs 10 -20 days after symptom 
onset  [16]. However, infections can be severe and prolonged in immunocompromised patients, 
with a recovery period that can last for several months after infection, high associated mortality 
rates, and the selection of new SARS -CoV -2 variants in some of these patients [1 7-18]. 
 
SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472224] an impaired humoral immune response to SARS -
CoV -2 vaccination compared to responses in the general population, especially patients receiving 
anti-CD20 antibodies, solid organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], patients with certain B -cell hematologic 
malignancies, and stem -cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including CD -19+ chimeric -antigen receptor T 
(CAR -T) cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] [ 19-29]. Only 44 -70% of patients exposed to anti -CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 73% 
of hematopoietic cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and 14% of CD19 -CAR -T cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_377297]-SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377298] -CoV -2 mRNA vaccination 
[19-23]. Patients with B -cell hematologic malignancies, such as mantle cell lymphoma (44%), 
marginal zone lymphoma (62%), chro nic lymphocytic leukemia (37 -64%), Waldenstrom’s 
macroglobulinemia (74%), follicular lymphoma (78%), and diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(79%), also have significantly impaired humoral responses to SARS -CoV -2 mRNA vaccination, 
especially patients treated wit h anti -CD20 antibodies, steroids, venetoclax, or Bruton’s tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors, but also patients who have not recently received chemotherapeutic agents  [24-
29]. 
 
Patients with solid organ transplantation also have impaired humoral immune responses t o 
SARS -CoV -2 vaccination, with only 36 -62% developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a measurable antibody response to 2 -
vaccine SARS -CoV -2 mRNA regimens, with particularly low humoral responses in older solid 
organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_377299]  [30-34]. While a third 
‘booster’ dose of mRNA vaccine increases immunogenicity of the SARS -CoV -2 mRNA 
vaccines, with a detectable serologic response rising from 40% after dose 2 to 68% following 
dose 3, a substantial subset of solid organ transplant patients s till do not develop evidence of 
humoral immunity to SARS -CoV -2 [34-36]. 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472225] impaired 
humoral immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 vaccination [3 7-39]. 
 
These patients are also at higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_21337] -19 disease [9 -10]. Therefore, 
alternative approaches are needed to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection and mitigate disease 
severity in these particularly vulnerable patients.  
  
COVID -19 Variants  
 
With over 240 million confirmed cases and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide due to COVID -19 
to date [ 40], there has been an accelerated search for both preventive interventions such as 
vaccines a nd effective therapeutic agents, such as antivirals and monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Over the course of the COVID -19 pandemic, several SARS -CoV -2 variants, including Alpha 
(B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351, B.1.351.2, B.1.351.3), Delta (B.1.617.2, AY.1, AY.2, AY. 3), and 
Gamma (P.1, P.1.1, P.1.2), have spread widely [1 7-18].  
 
The Delta and Omicron (BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, and BA.3) variant s are more infectio us and spread 
more efficiently than earlier lineages of SARS -CoV -2 [17, 41 -43]. Since December 2021, the 
Omicron lineage has become the dominant variant of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472226] 
sublineages, BA.1, BA.1+R346K, BA.2, BA.2 + H78Y, and BA.3, whi ch share 21 mutations in 
the spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870]. BA.2 contains 8 additional unique mutations while BA.1 and BA.1+R346K 
contain 13 and 14 unique mutations, respectively [41]. Importantly, at least 15 of these mutations 
are located in the receptor -binding domain of the S -protein [42].  
 
Mutations in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_377300]  [43-44]. Because the S -
protein is the binding site for many monoclonal  antibodies and the target of existing SARS -CoV -
[ADDRESS_472227] demonstrated reduced susceptibility of the BA.2 subvariant to 
Sotrovimab, although t he extent to which its antiviral efficacy is affected has varied widely 
across studies  [41-42]. Mutations in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_377301] [42 -43]. Prevention 
and treatment strategies need to evolve with sufficient rapi[INVESTIGATOR_377302] -CoV -2 variants.  
 
Existing COVID -19 Treatments and Preventive Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377303] -19 Treatments  
  
Antiviral agents : There are three antiviral agents currently authorized  for treatment of COVID -
19 in the US. Veklury (remdesivir) is an intravenous (IV) antiviral drug that has been  approved 
for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients ([ADDRESS_472228] 
40 kg) with COVID -19 requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] [13].  In December 2021, ritonavir -boosted 
nirmatrelvir was issued an EUA for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID -19 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
9 aged ≥12 years and weighing ≥40 kg who are within 5 days o f symptom onset and considered at 
high-risk The EPIC -HR trial  found that this drug reduced the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377304] 
89% compared to placebo in non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377305] -risk adults with COVID -19 [45]. This agent 
has become first -line therapy for many patients with mild to moderate COVID -19 in the United 
States . Finally, the MOVe -OUT trial of the novel oral antiviral drug molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_377306] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377307] D-19 disease by [CONTACT_3450] 30% compared to placebo [4 6]. This therapy received FDA 
EUA on in December 2021 for the treatment of high -risk adults with mild to moderate COVID -
19, within 5 days of symptom onset and for whom alternative antiviral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377308].  
 
Monoclonal antibodies : Multiple monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377309] U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization. The Regeneron REGEN -COV antibody 
cocktail of casirivimab and imdevimab  was approved under EUA for the treatment of mild to 
moderate COVID -19 disease in adults and in pediatric patients ([ADDRESS_472229] 40 kg), who have positive results of direct SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472230] -exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but this 
cocktail was later de -authorized due to its severely reduced antiviral efficacy against the 
Omicron variant  [47].  
 
In February 2021, the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibodies bamlanivimab and etesevimab received 
EUA for the treatment of adults and children with COVID -[ADDRESS_472231] emerging SARS -CoV -2 variants  
[48]. In May 2021, sotrovimab received EUA for the treatm ent of mild -to-moderat e COVID -19 
in adults and children ([ADDRESS_472232] 40 kg) with positive results of 
direct SARS -CoV -2 viral testing, and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID -19, 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059] [ 49-50]. In March 2022, the distribution of sotrovimab was 
paused due to the spread of the Omicron BA.2 variant , given the reduced antiviral susceptibility 
of this variant to sotrovimab. In February 2022, the antibody bebtelovimab received EUA for the 
treatment of non -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377305] -risk patients with mild to moderate COVID -19 [51]. 
Bebtelovimab appears to  retain its activity against the Omicron variant of concern (VOC) and 
both its BA.1 and BA.2 subvariants  [52]. 
 
Immune modulators : There are tw o immune modulators, baricitinib (Olumiant) and 
tocilizumab (Actemra), with FDA EUA for the treatment of COVID -19. Baricitinib is authorized 
for the treatment of COVID -19 in combination with Veklury in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377310] 
(2 years or older) wh o are receiving corticosteroids and need supplemental oxygen, mechanical 
ventilation (non -invasive or invasive), or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)  [48]. 
Actemra is authorized for use in the same patient population as baricitinib but it does not  need to 
be administered in combination with Veklury  [53].  
  
Prevention

Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
10 Vaccines : In August 2021, the [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech COVID -19 messenger RNA vaccine, also 
known as Comirnaty, was approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration  [54]. 
The Moderna and Jan ssen COVID -19 vaccines also received FDA EUA , with the Moderna 
vaccine receiving  FDA approval [5 5-56].  
 
Monoclonal antibodies : In addition to these modes of prevention, AZD7442 is an antibody 
combination that was recently shown to be an effective form of COVID -19 pre -exposure 
prophylaxis in the PROVENT Phase III clinical trial [5 7]. AZD7442 leverages a proprietary half -
life extension technology and may provide 12 months of protection from COVID -19. This 
monoclonal antibody is delivered by [CONTACT_33813] (IM) injection.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_472233] cells and viral RNA replication [ 56]. The ACE2 receptor is prone to m utations, 
leading to resistance to currently available monoclonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Sotrovimab is an 
investigational engineered monoclonal antibody that targets a highly conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_377311] -CoV -2. Using Xmab Fc technology, this ant ibody has a 
modification in its Fc region that increases its binding affinity to receptor FcRn in lysosomes in 
endothelial cells, rescuing these antibodies from degradation, prolonging its serum half -life, and 
potentially increasing its bioavailability in tissues such as the respi[INVESTIGATOR_276910].  
Sotrovimab targets a highly conserved spi[INVESTIGATOR_377312], with amino acid conservation > 99.99% for 
all amino acids based on > 2,100,000 available sequences. Variants at two positions, E340 and 
P337, resulted in significa nt EC 50 shifts indicating reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab. E340 
and P337 are 99.99% conserved among sequences in the GISAID database (16 July 2021). 
Sotrovimab neutralizes SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472234] alpha (B.1.1.7), beta 
(B.1.3 51), gamma (P.1), delta (B.1.617.2) and kappa (B.1.617.1) variant live virus. In vitro 
sotrovimab neutralizes  and retains activity against the alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma 
(P.1), delta (B.1.617.2). delta plus (AY.1/AY.2) epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) , iota (B.1.526), kappa 
(B.1.617.1), lambda (C.37) and mu (B.1.621) variant viruses  in the VSV/VeroE6 pseudotyped 
virus system ; against omicron BA.[ADDRESS_472235] BA.2 live virus [44, 58 -60]. 
 
Sotrovimab has been  authorized for the treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and 
children ([ADDRESS_472236] 40 kg) with positive results of direct SARS -
CoV -2 viral testing, who are at  high risk of progression to severe COVID -19, including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use 
Authorization (EUA)  [49-50], although starting March 25, 2022, it was no longer authorized in 
states and territories where the proportion of COVID -19 cases caused by [CONTACT_377353].2 
variant is above 50%  [61]. 
  
Drug Interactions  
 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472237] been conducted with sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is neither 
renally excreted nor metabolized by [CONTACT_377354] P450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions 
with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or 
inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely.  
 
In in vitro pharmacodynamic studies with remdesivir or bamlanivimab, sotrovimab showed 
additive virologic effect and no antagonism with either agent.  
 
COVID -19 Monoclonal Antibody Efficacy Trial -Intent to Care Early (COMET -ICE) 
Interim Clinical Trial Results  
  
COMET -ICE, a phase 3, randomized, placebo -control led pi[INVESTIGATOR_377313] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377314] -[ADDRESS_472238] one risk factor 
for disease progression, was stopped in March 2021 by [CONTACT_377355] y. An interim analysis of this study showed an  85% risk 
reduction in disease progression leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377315] a 500 
mg single intravenous dose of sotrovimab, compared to placebo  [49]. In this study, 3 patients in 
the sotrovimab treatment group (1% of the 291 patients randomized to this arm) developed 
disease progression leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059], compared to 21 patients in the placebo 
group (7% of the 292 patients randomized to this arm). Adverse events were  reported by 17% of 
patients in the sotrovimab group and 18% of those who received placebo, and serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were less common in patients receiving sotrovimab (2%) than in those receiving 
placebo (6%) [ 50]. Based on this interim analysis o f the COMET -ICE trial, sotrovimab was 
granted a U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the 
treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 in adults and children ([ADDRESS_472239] 40 kg) with positive resu lts of direct SARS -CoV -2 viral testing, and who are at 
high risk of progression to severe COVID -19, including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]  [49]. 
 
Safety Profile of Sotrovimab in Clinical Studies  
As of August 18,  2021, [ADDRESS_472240] received sotrovimab administered intravenously 
(IV) or intramuscularly ( IM) in Vir /[COMPANY_004] -sponsored clinical studies. As summarized in the 
sotrovimab Investigator Brochure v3 , no safety concerns for sotrovimab have been identifie d in 
these clinical studies, and sotrovimab has been safe and well -tolerated.  
Rationale for Dose Selection  
 
A dose of 500  mg was selected for the study based on in vitro  neutralization data, in vitro  
resistance data, and intravenous (IV) pharmacokinetic (P K) data from the COMET -ICE trial  
[49]. The 500  mg dose is being evaluated in ongoing and halted clinical studies; COMET -ICE 
[[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], ACTIV -3-TICO [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]], COMET -PEAK ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), COMET -
TAIL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and Study 217653 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Sotro vimab (500  mg, IV) was 
assessed in participants with COVID -19 in an early treatment study, VIR -7831 -5001 (214367, 
also known as COMET -ICE [[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]]), with the aim of preventing disease progression in 
non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88492]. For the first planned  interim analysis, the Independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (IDMC) met on 10  March  2021 and reviewed data from 583  participants. 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
12 The IDMC recommended halting enrollment in the trial due to overwhelming efficacy, with an 
85% reduction in the risk of hospit alization or death in the sotrovimab arm versus the placebo 
arm (primary endpoint)  [49]. 
 
Sotrovimab neutralized SARS -CoV -2 live virus with an average EC 90 value of  186.3  ng/mL 
(range: 125.8 – 329.5 ng/mL) (PC -7831 -0105). In resistance analyses, no  viral b reakthrough was 
observed through [ADDRESS_472241]  a high barrier to resistance (PC -7831 -0109). Using an increasing 
concentration selection method to force resistance emergence,  E340A was identified as a 
monoclonal antibody -resistant mutant (MARM) conferring a >100 -fold reduction in 
susceptibility to sotrovimab. Notably, E340 is  99.9% conserved among available SARS -CoV -2 
sequences. Due to the binary nature of the resistance selec tion results, a specific inhibitory 
quotient (IQ) was not informed by [CONTACT_139110].  
 
Based on IV PK data from the lead -in and expansion phase s of the COMET -ICE study, the mean 
serum concentration of sotrovimab following a single 500  mg IV dose is 40.3 g/mL  (N = 469) 
at Day 29 . Based on the non-compartmental analysis of intensive PK data from the lead -in phase, 
the sotrovimab median (range) half -life is estimated to be 56.5 (42.4, 77.3) days.  
 
A 500  mg IV dose was initially selected to ensure that sotrovimab concentrations in the lung are 
maintained at or above levels anticipated to be neutralizing for the duration of the treatment 
window  [62-66]. In vitro  live virus assays indicated that, compared to wild type EC 90 (0.288 
μg/mL), Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 confer a 3.5 -fold and 35 -fold shift in EC 90, respectively (PC -
7831 -0155). Based on the EC 90 of BA.2 and accounting for the lung:serum ratio as 25%,  an IV 
dose of 500 mg is expected to maintain serum levels above tissue -adjusted EC 90 at day 15 for 
90% of patients and day 34 for 50% of patients . 
 
This study will assess two intravenous (IV) doses of sotrovimab, administered on Treatment Day 
[ADDRESS_472242] the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, and the availability of the hi gher 2000mg 
dose for administration in the study . 
 
The exposure after 2000 mg IV was predicted using a preliminary population PK model that was 
developed using data across several studies including COMET -ICE, COMET -PEAK, BLAZE -4 
and a PK study in individua ls of Japanese and Caucasian descent. The predicted median (10th, 
90th percentile) sotrovimab serum concentrations at [ADDRESS_472243] 500 mg IV dose are 69.2 (38.7, 
109.4) µ g/mL and 64.5 (38.0,105.2) µg/mL, respectively. Tissue -adjusted EC 90 values were 
calculated using different assumptions for lung:serum ratio of 25%, 15% or 10% (based on 
literature reports for monoclonal antibodies in general, and were used to estimate cov erage above 
tissue -adjusted EC 90 following the second dose of sotrovimab 2000 mg IV [ 67-72]. 
 
When assuming a lung:serum  ratio of 25%, a [ADDRESS_472244] the Omicron BA.2 variant in 90% of patients for approximately [ADDRESS_472245] dose. With more conservative assumptions of a lung:serum ratio of 15% 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
13 and 10%, a [ADDRESS_472246] BA.2 in 90% of patients for approximately 2 months.  
 
2.3          Rationale  
 
The primary medical approach to preventing COVID -19 currently is centered on several widely 
available vaccine products. In the [LOCATION_002], there are currently three COVID -19 vaccines  
available, the [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson/Janssen vaccines. Both 
[COMPANY_007] -BioNTech and Moder na are messenger RNA vaccines while the Johnson and 
Johnson/Janssen vaccine uses an adenovirus DNA vector. The [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech vaccine was 
95% effective at preventing laboratory -confirmed SARS -CoV -2 viral infection, while the 
Moderna vaccine was about 94.1 % effective. In comparison, a single dose of the Johnson and 
Johnson vaccine was 66.3% effective in preventing laboratory confirmed SARs -CoV -[ADDRESS_472247] 2021 and Ja nuary 2022, respectively  [6]. 
 
Only 44 -70% of patients exposed to anti -CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 73% of hematopoietic cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 
and 14% of CD19 -CAR -T cell recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], for example, develop SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377316] -CoV -2 mRNA vaccination  [7-11] Patients with B -cell hematologic 
malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (37 -64%), follicular lymphoma (78%), and diffuse 
large B -cell lymphoma (79%), also have significantly impaired humoral responses to SARS -CoV -2 
mRNA vaccination, especially patients treated with anti -CD20 antibodies, steroids, venetoclax, or 
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but also patients who have not recently received chemotherapeutic 
agents  [12-15, 41].  Among two preliminary studies on solid organ transplant patients  receiving 
immunosuppressive drugs the prevalence of SARS -CoV-2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377317] 20 -
40% after two doses of the vaccine  [16-17], with similarly low prevalence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_377318] -CD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377319] s [18 -20]. Finally, all these patient populations are also at higher risk 
of severe COVID -19 disease, highlighting the need for alternative approaches to prevent SARS -CoV -2 
infection in these particularly vulnerable patients.  
 
There are  also several treatments for COVID -19 that are currently approved or under investigation, 
including remdesivir, dexamethasone, tocilizumab, and antivirals (e.g., remdesivir, molnupi[INVESTIGATOR_42654] ); 
however, none of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_377320] -[ADDRESS_472248] called AZD7442 showed evidence of  efficacy  for COVID -19 pre -
exposure prophylaxis in the PROVENT Phase III clinical trial  [57].  
  
Monoclonal antibodies represent a highly specific and versatile alternative for COVID -19 
prevention and treatment. Given that passive immunity is an instantly effective inducer of 
neutralization, opsonization, complement activation and antibody de pendent cellular cytotoxicity 
and does not depend on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ immune response, it appears to be  ideal for 
immunocompromised patients who f ail to develop SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377321]  [64]. In May 2021, sotrovimab received U.S. Food 
and Administration Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -
19 in adults and children ([ADDRESS_472249] 40 kg) with positive results 
of direct SARS -CoV -2 viral te sting, and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID -19, 
including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017]  [49-50], although as of March 25, 2022, it is no longer

14 authorized for the treatment of mild -moderate COVID -19 in states and territories where the 
propor tion of COVID -19 cases caused by [CONTACT_377353].2 variant exceeds 50% [61].  
 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of sotrovimab, 
administered for the prevention of SARS -CoV -2 infection and COVID -19 disease, and to 
determine the pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab in these patients when administered at baseline 
and with a repeat dose. Immunocompromised individuals with a negative SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377322], and measures to prevent COVID -19 infection in these vulnerable patients 
are needed.

The effects of sotrovimab  on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19241]. 
Pharma cological studies of sotrovimab have not been conducted in pregnant women  
and there is limited clinical experience using sotrovimab in women who are pregnant 
or breastfeeding . However, there is the potential for sotrovimab to cross the placental 
barrier an d be present in breast milk; therefore, this therapy could theoretically be 
passed from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. For this reason, even 
though monoclonal antibodies are not known to be teratogenic, women of 
childbearing potential m ust agree to use a highly effective method of birth control 
from enrollment through the study follow -up period .  Should a woman become 
pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should

Administration.  
 
Rescue Treatm ents 
 
If study subjects develop COVID -19, they may receive rescue treatment for COVID -[ADDRESS_472262] -exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as per the local stan dard of care. If study subjects 
develop COVID -[ADDRESS_472263] sotrovimab dose but prior 
to receiving their second sotrovimab dose, they will not receive the second dose of sotrovimab. 
Completion of the study and othe r study assessments will be performed according to the study 
schedule. These rescue treatments will not be provided as part of the study.  
 
5.2. Pre-Treatment Criteria  
The screening period is the window between day -7 (7 days prior to Treatment Day 1) and 
Treat ment Day 1. The purpose of the screening period is to assess the eligibility of study subjects 
to participate in this study.  
Screening procedures include:  
● Confirmation that the potential study subject meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria 
outlined in  Sections 3.1  and 3.2. 
● Participants must have a negative or low -positive (<50 U/mL) SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472264] result within 28 days of consent, using an assay available under U.S. Food

5.3.Agent Administration  
 
Study subjects will receive  sotrovimab 500mg as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 minutes 
on Treatment Day 1 and 2000mg as an intravenous (IV) infusion over [ADDRESS_472267]  a one-hour monitoring period  following their dose, as long as there 
are no grade 3 or 4  infusion -related reactions or other SAEs potentially related to the sotrovimab 
dose in the 2000mg dose lead -in safety cohort.  If there are any grade 3 or 4 infusion -related 
reactions or other SAEs potentially related to the sotrovimab dose in this cohort,  infusion time 
may be extended beyond 60 minutes, and the monitoring time may be maintained at 2 hours 
following this dose for subsequent patients.  
 
Sotrovimab is not a vesicant or irritant.  
 
Vital signs  (including body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO 2), 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be collected according to the schedule outlined in Section 10  (Study 
Calendar) , including prior to and following sotrovimab dosing on Treatment Day [ADDRESS_472268] (supi[INVESTIGATOR_103169]). Vitals 
signs that are obtained following each sotrovimab dose should be obtained within 30 minutes  
after drug administration has been completed.   
 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained according to the schedule outlined in Section 10  
(Study Calendar), including prio r to each dose of sotrovimab.  
 
Serum sotrovimab levels  will be measured for PK assessment according to the schedule outlined 
in Section 10  (Study Calendar), including prior to the second do se of sotrovimab on Treatment 
Day [ADDRESS_472269] be available 
for immediate use if needed during the infusion of study drug. Infusion -related reactions  are

Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472270] (AESIs).  
 
Pre-medications should not be given  routinely  prior to the first dose of sotrovimab. If a n 
infusion -related reaction occurs during the first dose of sotrovimab that is not severe enough to  
warrant discontinuation of the study treatment for a participant, the study team may decide to 
administer  pre-medications prior to the second sotrovimab dose for that participant , 
administering an oral antihistamine agent (e.g. diphenhydramine, loratadine, famotidine) at least 
[ADDRESS_472271] 5 minutes prior to starting the  second sotrovimab dose . 
 
Management of Local Infusion Site Reactions  
 
Patients may develop local infusion site reactions, including erythema, soreness, pruritus, or 
bleeding, which should be managed according to the table below:  
 
Table 1 : Management of Lo cal Injection/Infusion Site Reactions  
Signs and Symptoms  Management  
Redness, soreness or 
swelling at the 
injection site  Apply a cold compress to the injection site(s)  
Consider giving an analgesic (e.g., ibuprofen, acetaminophen, 
paracetamol)  
Itching and redness  Consider giving an anti -pruritic (e.g., diphenhydramine)  
Observe patient closely for the development of generalized 
symptoms  
Slight bleeding  Apply pressure and an adhesive compress  
Continuous bleeding  Place gauze pads over the site and maintain direct and firm pressure  
 
Recognizing Systemic Reactions or Anaphylaxis  
 
As with any monoclonal antibody therapy, hypersensitivity reactions to sotrovimab  are possible. 
In the COMET -ICE pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076], all hypersensitivity reactions were non -serious, of Grade 1 
(mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) severity and reported in 2% of participants who received 
sotrovimab and in <1% who received placebo (9 participants trea ted with sotrovimab and 5 
participants treated with placebo) [48]. None of the reactions in either arm led to pausing or 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
21 discontinuation of the infusions. No anaphylaxis events were reported in the COMET -ICE study 
in participants with mild to moderate COVI D-19 not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377325].  
 
A potentially life -threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) was observed in one adult 
participant who received sotrovimab in a study of individuals hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 (the 
ACTIV -3 TICO study). The anaphylaxis was considered by [CONTACT_76956]. The participant was treated for the allergic reaction and recovered. Another 
patient who received sotrovimab under an emergency expanded access basis developed 
anaphylaxis  shortly after the start of infusion and required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. No further details 
were provided.  
 
Therefore, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must 
be immediately available, and study personnel must be traine d to recognize and treat 
anaphylaxis.  
 
Interruption of the Intravenous Infusion  
  
The infusion should be paused if any of the following adverse events occur at grade ≤ 2  (mild or 
moderate) severity , as defined in the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2 .1 [73]: 
 
● Sustained coughing  
● Rash or pruritus  
● Chills/Rigors  
● Urticaria  
● Diaphoresis/Flushing  
● Hypotension  
● Dyspnea  
● Vomiting  
These reactions should be treated symptomatically (e.g. antihistami nes, IV fluids), and the 
infusion may subsequently resume at 50% of the original rate at the investigator’s discretion  
when symptoms of these adverse events improve to  ≤ grade 1 . 
If investigators feel there is a medical need to interrupt or discontinue th e infusion for any 
reasons other than those listed above, they should use their clinical judgment in responding to 
these potential infusion -related reactions.  
Termination of the Intravenous Infusion  
  
The infusion should be terminated and not restarted  if any of the following grade 3 or 4 
adverse events occur , as per DAIDS grading criteria  [73]. In addition, if any of these grade [ADDRESS_472272] should not receive the second dose , but should 
continue all other follow -up through end of study visit.  
 
● Anaphylaxis : The most common signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are cutaneous (e.g., 
sudden onset of generalized urticaria, angioedema, flushing, pruritus). However, 10 -20% 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472273] 
develops the acute onset of an illness with skin and/or mucosal tissue involvement (e.g. 
urticaria, lip swelling, tongue/uvula swelling, or pruritus ) with at least one of the 
following:  
 
○ Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (dyspnea, st ridor, wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxemia)  
○ Hypotension or associated symptoms suggestive of end -organ dysfunction (e.g. 
syncope, incontinence)  [74]. 
 
● Laryngeal or pharyngeal edema  
● Chest pain  
● Seizure  
● Persistent, symptomatic hypotension  (defined as a systolic blood pressure ( SBP) < 
90mmHg with symptoms consistent with hypotension (e.g. lightheadedness, syncope) that 
persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_377326])  
● Other neurologic symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, para lysis)  
● Any other symptom or sign that warrants termination of the IV infusion , according to 
the judgment of the investigator.  
 
Management of Suspected Anaphylaxis  
 
The following procedures should be followed in the event of a suspected anaphylactic reactio n 
[75]: 
 
1. Call for additional medical assistance; activate emergency medical services.  
2. Ensure appropriate monitoring is in place, such as continuous ECG and pulse oximetry  
3. First-line treatment:  
a. Administer epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1.0 mg/ml) aqueous solution (1:1000 dil ution) – 0.5 mg 
(0.5ml) IM in the anterolateral thigh OR if using an epi[INVESTIGATOR_107528] -injector – 
use 0.3 mg IM into the anterolateral thigh.  
b. May be repeated every 5 -15 minutes up to 3 times.  
4. Optional treatment (antihistamine):  
Diphenhydramine 50 mg oral/IV /intramuscular (IM) OR Hydroxyzine 25 mg 
oral/IM.  
5. Administer supplemental oxygen (8 -10 L/minute) via facemask, as needed.  
6. Normal saline rapid bolus – treat hypotension with rapid infusion of [ADDRESS_472274] until emergency medical services arrive.  
 
5.4. General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
Patients are not permitted to receive any medication specified in the exclusion criteria for study 
enrollment ( Section 3.2 ), including active enrollment on another interventional research study of 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472275] of care.  
 
If patients are due for another dose of SARS -CoV -2 vaccination during the study period, patients 
may receive this dose any time after receiving sotrovimab , outside of the 2 -week period before 
their second sotrovimab dose [76]. Patients may receive other available anti -SARS -CoV -2 
monoclonal antibodies authorized for pre -exposure prophylaxis, such as tix agevimab/cilgavimab, 
≥ [ADDRESS_472276] 
50% of participan ts with a serum concentration above EC90 of BA.2 at 14.76 µg/mL for 10 weeks, 
assuming a lung:serum ratio at 15% and  assuming 100% of SARS -CoV -2 infections are caused by 
[CONTACT_377357].2 variant at this time.  
 
Patients may otherwise continue their normal regimen of  medications and procedures.  
 
Sotrovimab is neither renally excreted nor metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 (CYP) enzymes , and 
interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, 
or inhibitors of CYP enzymes ar e unlikely.  
 
5.5. Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Protocol Therapy  
 
The study will last approximately  44-50 weeks  (see Section 10  for the schedule of study visits, 
assessments, and sample collection):  
  
● Screening window : patients will have a screening period that lasts up to 7 days (Day -7 to 
Treatment Day 1).  
● Study period : From Treatment Day [ADDRESS_472277] an in -person end of treatment (EOT) visit for sample collection and assessments.  
● Final remote visit : Patients will have a remote/telephone end of study (EOS) visit 36 
weeks/252 days after their final dose of sotrovimab, which corresponds to approximately 
5 half -lives of sotrovimab since the final dose.  
 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study drug  (but continue to follow study procedures) for 
any of the following reasons:   
 
• Occurr ence of an AE that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], warrants discontinuation of the 
subject from receiving further study drug.  
• Pregnancy or initiation of breastfeeding.  
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
24 • Treatment with other monoclonal antibodies active against SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_472278] be 
documented in source documents and in the eCRF.  
 
Participants removed from protocol therapy prior to dose 2 of study drug for any of the reasons 
listed above will not receive a second dose of sotrovimab, but they  will be asked to complete all 
other study assessments according to the study calendar ( Section 10 ).  
 
When a participant is removed from protocol therapy and/or is off of the study, the participant’s 
status must be updated in OnCore in accordance with REGIST -OP-1. 
 
5.6. Duration of Follow Up  
 
Participants wi ll be followed for 36 weeks after their second dose of sotrovimab (corresponding 
to approximately 5 half -lives of sotrovimab since the final dose) or death, whichever occurs first.  
 
Participants removed from protocol therapy due to unacceptable adverse event(s) will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
 
5.7. Criteria for Taking a Participant Off Study  
 
Subjects may be discontinued from the study  for any of the following reasons:   
 
● Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_3184]/or the subject’s legally authorized 
representative.  Any patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any 
reason, and without repercussions. As excessive with drawals might threaten the 
interpretability and generalizability of the results, withdrawal of patients should be 
avoided whenever possible.  
● Loss to follow -up (every attempt should be made to contact [CONTACT_423]).  
● Intercurrent illness that prevents furthe r administration of treatment.  
● Death.  
 
Participants who are discontinued from the study will be asked to complete an early termination 
visit (with study procedures as per the Treatment Day 2 + 168 day/end of treatment visit) at the 
time of study discontinu ation.  
 
The reason for a subject’s discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study will be 
documented clearly in the source documents and in the eCRF. In addition, the study team will 
ensure the participant’s status is updated in OnCore in accord ance with REGIST -OP-1. 
 
 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
25 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Study subjects will receive two doses of sotrovimab, on T reatment Day 1 and Treatment Day 2. 
Dose modification s for individual patients are not allowed.  
 
Interruption of the Intravenous Infusion  
  
The infusion should be paused if any of the following adverse events occur at grade ≤ 2  (mild or 
moderate) severity, as defined in the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table for Grading the Severity 
of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 2.1  [73]: 
 
● Sustain ed coughing  
● Rash or pruritus  
● Chills/Rigors  
● Urticaria  
● Diaphoresis/Flushing  
● Hypotension  
● Dyspnea  
● Vomiting  
These reactions should be treated symptomatically (e.g. antihistamines, IV fluids), and the 
infusion may subsequently resume at 50% of the original rate at the investigator’s discretion 
when symptoms of these adverse events improve to  ≤ grade 1.  
If investigators feel there is a medical need to interrupt or discontinue the infusion for any 
reasons other than those listed above, they should use their clinic al judgment in responding to 
these potential infusion -related reactions.  
Termination of the Intravenous Infusion  
  
The infusion should be terminated and not restarted  if any of the following grade 3 or 4 
adverse events occur, as per DAIDS grading criteria  [73]. In addition, if any of these grade [ADDRESS_472279] should not receive the second dose , but should 
continue all other follow -up through end of study visit.  
 
● Anaphylaxis : The most common signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis are cutaneous (e.g., 
sudden onset of generalized urticaria, angioedema, flushing, pruritus). However, 10 -20% 
of patients have no skin findings. Anaphylaxis should be considered if the study subject 
develops the acute onset of an illness with  skin and/or mucosal tissue involvement (e.g. 
urticaria, lip swelling, tongue/uvula swelling, or pruritus ) with at least one of the 
following:  
 
○ Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, bronchospasm, hypoxemia)  
○ Hypotension or associated symptoms suggestive of end -organ dysfunction (e.g. 
syncope, incontinence)  [74]. 
 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
26 ● Laryngeal or pharyngeal edema  
● Chest pain  
● Seizure  
● Persistent, symptomatic hypotension  (defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 
90mmHg with symptoms consistent with hypoten sion (e.g. lightheadedness, syncope) that 
persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_377326])  
● Other neurologic symptoms (confusion, loss of consciousness, paresthesia, paralysis)  
● Any other symptom or sign that warrants termination of the IV infusion , according to  
the judgment of the investigator.  
 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of reported and/or potential AEs ( Section 7.1 ) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE ( Section 7.2 ) will determine whether the event requires expedited  repor ting in 
addition  to routine  reporting.  
 
Following the first dose of sotrovimab on Treatment Day 1 and up to the end of study visit (36 
weeks after Treatment Day 2), study investigators must promptly record  and report all  
treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs), grade 2 unexpected and related 
treatment -emergent AEs, grade 3 or 4 treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) . All adverse 
events of special interest (AESIs) , regardless of grade, must be reported.  
 
These events may b e directly observed, unsolicited (reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_102]), or 
solicited by [CONTACT_377358] -person and remote study visit. Patients 
should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any spe cific 
symptoms. The assessment of SAEs , TEAEs , and AESIs  will be conducted by [CONTACT_377359] -investigators to determine causality and severity.  
 
Events should be:  
 
● Clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with the investigator’s signature.  
● Followed up proactively at subsequent visits or contacts until the SAE , grade [ADDRESS_472280] to 
follow -up. 
● Preferably reported as a diagnosis term. W hen a diagnosis term is unavailable, a primary 
report with a sign or symptom as the AE term should be entered until the diagnosis becomes 
available.  
 
Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic results or findings should be 
reported as TEAEs if they fulfill reporting criteria for the study or require corrective treatment.  
 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472281] be reported 
as the serious adverse event (diagnosis or symptom requirin g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
 
Adverse Event  Definition  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether it is or is not 
considered related to the  study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention  [77]. 
 
Events that meet the defi nition of an AE include:  
 
● Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase 
in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
● New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even thoug h 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
● Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention or intervention 
interaction.  
● Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a  concomitant medication. Overdose per se  will not be reported as an 
AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming 
intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
● Clinically significant changes in la boratory assessments.  
 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
 
● "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se  will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will 
be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SA E. 
● Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]'s condition.  
● The disease /disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant's 
condition.  
● Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that l eads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
● Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
28 ● Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the  start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
An unsolicited AE  is one that was not solicited using a diary or form with pre -specified criteria. 
Unsolicited AEs are obtained either by [CONTACT_7939] a general question or unprompted by a participant 
who has signed the i nformed consent. Unsolicited AEs include serious and non -serious AEs. 
Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses requiring a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). The partici pants 
will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_285147](s), 
as well as any events that, though not medically attended, are of participant concern. Detailed 
information about reported unsolicited AEs will be colle cted by [CONTACT_377360]'s records.  
  
Serious Adverse Event  Definition  
  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
● Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely u nrelated 
to the study drug (e.g., a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
● Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an adverse event that hypo thetically 
might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
● Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . In 
general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually involving 
at least an overnig ht stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication 
prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377327], the event is serious. When in 
doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be 
considered serious. Of note, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing 
condition tha t did not worsen from baseline  is not considered an AE.  
● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions). This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relativ ely minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which 
may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.  
● Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
● Is an important medical event – Important medical events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (e.g. 
invasive or malignant cance rs, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
29 allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of intervention dependency or intervention abuse).  
● Additional sponsor SAE:  Hy’s Law ca se: ALT ≥ 3x upper limit of normal (ULN) AND 
total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin)  OR INR >1.[ADDRESS_472282] be reported as a 
SAE.  
● Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_377361] o ther situations such as significant medical events that may 
jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.  
Criteria for reporting SAEs ( Section 7. 3) must be followed for these events.  
7.1. Expected Toxicities  
 
7.1.1.  Adverse Event  List for Sotrovimab  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest in Study Su bjects Receiving Sotrovimab  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be assessed from patient consent until the end of 
study visit (36 weeks after Treatment Day 2).  
Adverse events of special interest are defined as relevant known toxicities of therap eutic 
monoclonal antibodies and will be monitored by [CONTACT_377362], including:  
● Hypersensitivity reactions  or anaphylaxis. See Section 5.3  for guidance on the 
management of suspected hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis.  Hypersensitivity 
reactions any time following sotrovimab dosing developed in 2% of patients who 
received sotrovimab and <1% who received placebo, with a rash developi[INVESTIGATOR_377328] 12 days after the sotrovimab dose in a patient with pre -
existing asthma; all events were considered non -serious and most were grade 1 in 
severity. There were no anaphylaxis events in COMET -ICE. 
 
A potentially life -threatening allergi c reaction (anaphylaxis) was observed in one adult 
participant who received sotrovimab in the study of individuals hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121058] -19 (the ACTIV -3 TICO study), however. The anaphylaxis was considered by [CONTACT_377363]. The participant was treated for the allergic 
reaction and recovered. Another patient who received sotrovimab under an emergency 
expanded access basis developed anaphylaxis shortly after the start of infusion and 
required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. No further d etails were provided.  
● Infusion related reactions . See Section 5.3  for guidance on the management of 
suspected infusion -related reactions.  Infusion -related reactions developed in 1% o f 
patients treated with sotrovimab and 1% of patients treated with placebo within 24 hours 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
30 of dosing in COMET -ICE. Events reported within 24 hours of study treatment were 
pyrexia, chills, dizziness, dyspnea, pruritus, rash, and infusion -related reactions; all 
events were Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) and none led to treatment interruption 
or discontinuation.  
● Immunogenicity -related adverse events  (development of anti-drug antibodies ( ADA) ). 
Unwanted immunogenicity may lead to the production of ADA by [CONTACT_40689], which may 
inactivate the therapeutic effects of the treatment and, in rare cases, induce adverse 
events.  
 
Immunogenicity will be characterized by [CONTACT_377364] ( Section 10) over the study period, at the baseline/Treatment Day [ADDRESS_472283] sotrovimab dose, day 29, at the sotrovimab second 
dose visit prior to the administration of the second sotrovimab d ose, day 29 after the 
second sotrovimab dose, and day 168 after the second sotrovimab dose (the EOT visit). 
The ADA response categories and titer categories are defined as follows:  
 
○ Negative : Sample with a confirmed negative result.  
○ Positive : Sample with a confirmed positive result.  
○ Treatment -induced: Subject that develops ADA de novo  following drug 
administration (baseline negative or missing).  
○ Treatment -boosted : Subject with pre -existing ADA that are increased relative to 
baseline following drug adm inistration (e.g titer ≥ 9x baseline titer).  
○ Transient ADA : Subject with treatment -induced ADA detected at only one time 
point (excluding baseline and final visit) or subject with two or more time points 
that are separated by [CONTACT_23818] [ADDRESS_472284] ADA 
positive samples (irrespective of any negative samples in between) and the last 
sample is ADA negative.  
○ Persistent ADA : Subject with treatment -induced ADA detected at two or more 
time points where the first and last ADA positive samp les (irrespective of any 
negative samples in between) are separated by [ADDRESS_472285] with 
treatment -induced ADA detected at the final time point.  
 
● Adverse events potentially related to antibody -dependent enhancement  (ADE) of 
COVID -19 infection.  
 
Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease theoretically can occur by 
[CONTACT_146569], by 
[CONTACT_139129], enhancing viral repl ication in these cells, or 
by [CONTACT_146570] -antibody related immune complex 
deposition or complement activation and immune cell recruitment in target organs. This 
study will include participant follow -up for a period of 5 s otrovimab half -lives to assess 
for the potential of enhanced disease in the context of waning sotrovimab levels, which 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472286] to follow -up. ADA will be assessed 
at the end of the study in serum samples collected over the study period.  
 
 
7.2. Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
 
Determining the Severity of Adverse Events  
 
The severity of adverse events (including test findings classified as adverse events) will be graded 
for each AE using the current version of the DAIDS grading criteria  [73]. All appropriate treatment 
areas should have access to  a copy of the DAIDS grading scale; a copy can be downloaded from 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at: 
https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default /files/daidsgradingcorrectedv21.pdf .  
 
Assessing the Causality of Adverse Events  
  
The investigator must provide an assessment of causality, determining whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or 
facts, clinical judgement, and the following definitions:  
 
● Related : the adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug 
administration and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_25045], patient’s 
clinical, or other external factors OR the adverse event follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from study drug administration and is a known reaction to the drug under study 
or its class of drugs or is predicted by [CONTACT_25046].  
○ Definite  – the AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
○ Probable  – the AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
○ Possible  – the AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
● Not likely to be related : the adverse event does not follow a reasonable sequence from 
study drug administration or can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_25045], 
patient’s cli nical state, or other external factors.  
○ Unlikely – the AE is unlikely to be related  to the study treatment.  
○ Unrelated – the AE is clearly not related  to the study treatment.  
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, [ADDRESS_472287] be made based on the available information and can be updated if 
new information becomes available. The investigator should consider the temporal relationship 
(time to AE onset vs. time drug was administered), nature of the reaction (immediate vs. long 
term), clinical and pathological features, concomitant  medications, underlying disease, and past 
medical history of the patient, while assessing causality.  
 
All treatment -emergent SAEs , grade 2 AEs that are both unexpected and thought to be related to 
the study treatment , treatment -emergent grade 3 or 4 AEs  (TEAEs), and all adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs), regardless of grade, must be reported with:  
 
● The investigator’s assessment of the event’s seriousness, severity, and causality in relation 
to the study drug.  
● A detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, 
treatment, and outcome should be provided on the AE eCRF.  
● Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution.  
 
Source documents (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_884], diagno stic reports, etc.) will be 
summarized in the narrative on the AE eCRF and retained at each study site, and available upon 
request for review.  
 
 
7.3. Adverse Event Reporting  
 
 
7.3.1.  In the event of an unanticipated problem or life -threatening complications , treating  
investigators must immediately notify the sponsor -investigator . 
 
 
7.3.2.  Investigators must  report to the sponsor -investigator  any adverse event (AE) that occurs 
after the initial dose of study treatment, during treatment, within [ADDRESS_472288] dose 
of treatment on the local institutional SAE form , and for this study, through the end of 
study visit 36 weeks after the second dose of sotrovimab .  
 
 
7.3.3.  Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
 
All participating sites  will report AEs  to the Sponsor -Investigator  per D F/HCC requirements,  and 
the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of record  for each site  as applicable per IRB policies . The 
table below indicates which events must be reported to the DF/HCC Sponsor -Investigator.

35 8.1. Sotrovimab  
 
8.1.1.  Description  
Sotrovimab (VIR -7831, [COMPANY_004]4182136, Xevudy) is a dual action engineered human IgG1κ 
monoclonal anitibody derived from the parental monoclonal antibody  S309, a potent neutralizing 
antibody  that binds  to a highly conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_377331] -CoV and SARS -CoV -2 spi[INVESTIGATOR_377332]. The amino acid sequence of the complementarity -determining 
regions of sotrovimab is identical to the parent  molecule S309, with the exception of one amino 
acid modification (N55Q) introduced to aid antibody developability. The Fc domain of 
sotrovimab  has been engineered to provide extended half -life through the introduction of the 
well-characterized LS modifica tion (M438L and N444S) , which extends antibody half -life and is 
also expected to enhance distribution to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_276910]. Sotrovimab has a molecular 
weight of 150 kDa.  
Intensive lead -in PK data from the COMET -ICE trial indicates that sotrovimab has  a median 
terminal half -life of 48.8 days.  
Sotrovimab, as a monoclonal antibody, is degraded into small peptides and individual amino 
acids. The high molecular weight of sotrovimab (approximately 150 kDa) suggests that renal 
elimination of intact sotrovima b is unlikely to be of importance and the clearance of sotrovimab 
is predicted to be largely mediated by [CONTACT_377365].  
No formal interaction studies have been conducted with sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is neither 
renally excreted nor metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P 450 (CYP) enzymes; therefore, interactions 
with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or 
inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely.  In in vitro pharmacodynamic studies with remdesivir or 
bamlanivimab, sotrovimab showed additive virologic effect and no antagonism with either agent.  
 
8.1.2.  Form  
 
Sotrovimab is supplied in single -dose vials containing 500mg of sotrovimab in a volume of 8mL 
(62.5 mg/mL). Sotrovimab is a clear, colorless or yellow to brown solution. Sotrovim ab is 
manufactured in compliance with cGMP regulations  by [CONTACT_139099], Inc.  
 
8.1.3.  Storage and Stability  
 
Study drug will be stored at each site at 2°C to 8°C [36°F to 46°F].  Vials should be stored 
upright and protected from light. Vials should never be frozen.  
 
Sotrovimab is preservative -free; therefore, once diluted, the infusion solution should be 
administered immediately. If immediate administration is not possible, the diluted solution of 
sotrovimab may be stored for up to 4 hours  at room temperature  (20°C to 25°C [68°F to 77°F]),

11.3.2.  COVID -19 Symptom Assessment  
 
An assessment of COVID -19-related symptoms  will be performed at each in -person or remote 
study visit, using the CDC’s list of symptoms commonly associated with COVID -19 [8]:  
 
● Fever or chills  
● Cough  
● Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing  
● Fatigue  
● Muscle or body aches  
● Headache  
● New loss of taste or smell  
● Sore throat  
● Congestion or runny nose  
● Nausea or vomiting  
● Diarrhea.  
 
Study participants will be asked if they have any of these symptoms de novo or worsening from 
their baseline at each in -person and remote visit, us ing a questionnaire ( Appendix D ). Due to the 
contagiousness of the BA.2 Omicron variant, the study team will also proactively reach out to 
study participants on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_377370] -
19 symptoms following the second sotrovimab dose.  If they report any of these symptoms (new 
or worsening from baseline) at an in -person visit, they will have a nasopharyngeal swab obtained 
for local labor atory RT -PCR testing for SARS -CoV -2. If they report any of these symptoms at a 
remote visit, they will be asked to go to a local laboratory for SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR testing.  
 
Study participants will also be asked to report any emergency department (ED) visits  and inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], including intensive care hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], over the study period.  
 
The greatest extent of COVID -19 symptoms, as assessed using the 8 -point National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases ordinal scale (NIAID -OS), wil l be assessed in each study subject 
who develops COVID -19, either at the end of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109], in those who are not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
14 days after the diagnosis of COVID -19 (Appendix E ) [80]. 
 
In addition to symptom -triggered testing, study participants will obtain self -collected anterior nasal 
swabs every other week for SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR testing, using the binx health At -home Nasal 
Swab COVID -19 Sample Collection Kit and user interf ace, available under a FDA EUA [7 8]. 
These samples will be shipped at ambient temperature to authorized laboratories designated by 
[CONTACT_377371], Inc., which are certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
1988 (CLIA) and meet requireme nts to perform high complexity tests and run the specimens

who do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 14 days after the diagnosis of COVID -19 (Appendix E ) [80]. 
 
11.3.4.  Quality of Life Questionnaire  
 
Health -related quality of life measures will be assessed prior to the first and second dose of 
sotrovimab and on day 168 after the second sotrovimab dose (the EOT visit) using the RAND 
36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) instrument [ 81]. Sur veys will  be completed at study 
visits by [CONTACT_377372], with answers entered into the eCRF.  
 
 
12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7  
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  
 
12.1. Data Reporting  
 
12.1.1.  Method  
 
Syneos  Health will provide electronic data capture services. Syneos Health will monitor and 
perform quality checks on  data collect ed for this study .  
 
12.1.2.  Responsibility for Data Submission  
 
Investigative sites are responsible for submitting data and/or data forms into the electronic case 
report forms designed to capture specific and relevant study data.  
 
Case Report Form Requirements  
 
Data obtained during the study will be recorded on electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) within 
the EDC system by [CONTACT_1146]. All required eCRFs must be completed for every patient 
enrolled in the study within [ADDRESS_472319] 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A

12.2. Data Safety Monitoring  
 
This is a sing le-arm, open -label, non -randomized study conducted at three sites within DF/HCC 
(Dana -Farber/Harvard Cancer Center), with the sponsor -investigator and central study team 
having access to all data, so a Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has been deemed t o be 
unnecessary. Instead, a qualified independent study monitor (ISM) will evaluate enrollment data 
and all grade 2 or higher unexpected adverse events in the study twice a year. The ISM will issue 
a written monitoring report to the study team after each review, addressing any questions about 
participant safety with the sponsor -investigator and study team and issuing a final 
recommendation as to the study’s continuation.  
 
Monitoring of Study Sites  
 
In accordance with International Council for Harmonisation  of Technical Requirements for

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
While the current medical approach to preventing COVID -19 consists of several widely 
available vaccine products, individuals with impaired humoral immunity due to a range of 
immunocompromising conditions may fail to develop detectable antibodies even in th e setting of 
repeat vaccination. As such, alternative approaches to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection are needed 
for this population. Sotrovimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody that targets a highly 
conserved epi[INVESTIGATOR_377342] -CoV -2 and has received FDA EUA for the 
treatment of mild -to-moderate COVID -19 [4 9]. This is a Phase II open -label safety and 
tolerability study of sotrovimab for the pre -exposure prophylaxis of SARS -CoV -2 infection in 
immunocompromised individuals . 
 
13.1. Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The primary objective  of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sotrovimab as 
pre-exposure prophylaxis for immunocompromised individuals. As such, the primary endpoints 
of this study are:  
 
(1) The safety and tolerability of sotrovimab in immunocompromised patients with impaired 
humoral immunity against SARS -CoV -2 as defined by : 
a. The proportion of study subjects with treatment -emergent grade 3 -4 adverse 
events (TEAEs), as defined in the DAIDS grading criteria [66] . 
NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
59 b. The proportion of study subjects with treatment -emergent serious adverse events 
(SAE) , as defined in Section [ADDRESS_472321] (AESI), 
including infusion -related and hypersensitivity reactions, the development of anti -
drug antibody (ADA) levels, and antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) of 
COVID -19 disease , as outlined in Section 7.1.1 . 
(2) Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of sotrovimab in immunocompromised patients with 
impaired humoral immunity against SARS -CoV -2. 
 
The secondary objectives  of this study are to describe COVID -19 infection and quality -of-life 
outcomes in immunocompromised individuals receiving  sotrovimab prophylaxis. The secondary 
endpoints of this study relevant to COVID -19 infection include:  
 
(1) The proportion of study subjects that develop COVID -19 (of any severity) over the study 
follow -up period.  
(2) The proportion of study subjects with severe COVID -19, with any of the following 
criteria:  
a. Dyspnea, respi[INVESTIGATOR_135890] 30 or more breaths per minute, blood oxygen 
saturation of 93% or less, a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the 
fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401] (PaO 2:FiO 2) < 300 mm Hg, or infiltrates in more than 
50% of the lung field).  
b. Emergency department (ED) visit, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or ICU 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21342] 28 days of a new diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2.

COVID -19 [80]. 
(4) Health -related quality of life measures using the Short Form Health Surv ey (SF -36) 
instrument, assessed at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks [ 81]. 
 
Exploratory objectives  of this study are to describe transplant -specific outcomes in 
immunocompromised individuals receiving sotrovimab prophylaxis, including:  
 
(4) The proportion of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_377343]-onset 
cellular or antibody -mediated rejection events.  
(5) The proportion of  hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_377344]-onset or

These participants will be accrued in three stages:  
 
(1) A 10 -patient pharmacokinetic lead -in cohort to determine the optimal dosing interval 
between two sequential doses of intravenous sotrovimab, administered as prophylaxis in 
immunocompromised patients with impaired humoral immunity to COVID -19. 
(2) A 50 -patient safety  and tolerability lead -in cohort (including the 10 patients in the 
pharmacokinetic lead -in cohort) to examine the safety and tolerability of intravenous 
sotrovimab administered over a 30 -minute infusion period.  
(3) An expansion  cohort for further assessment of  the safety and tolerability of intravenous 
sotrovimab. If there are no grade ≥ 2 infusion -related reactions in the 50 -patient safety 
and tolerability lead -in cohort, patients in this expansion cohort will receive their 
intravenous sotrovimab doses over a 15-minute infusion period; if there is at least one 
patient with a grade ≥ [ADDRESS_472323] sotrovimab dose, for a total study duration of  approximately 2 years . A total 
cohort size of 93 subjects (inclusive of the 10 patients in the initial lead-in PK cohort  and in the 
2000mg dose lead -in cohort ) will  provide a suitably precise assessment of the descriptive safety 
and tolerability profile f or a two -dose regimen of IV sotrovimab. This enrollment plan is 
consistent with similar ongoing clinical studies of COVID -[ADDRESS_472324] 95% Confidence Interval  Probability of Seeing at

NCI Protocol #:  N/A 
Version Date:  March  31, 202 2 
 
62 Where possible,  all analyses will be conducted in the full cohort and separately, stratified by 
[CONTACT_377374]: (1) solid organ transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], (2) participants with a history of hematologic malignancy requiring hematopoietic cell 
transplant and/or history of  chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) -T cell therapy,  and (3) participants 
with any other hematologic malignancy, autoimmune or inflammatory condition  requiring either 
use of anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody or other immunosuppressive medication specifically 
associated with a blunted humoral immune response to SARS -CoV -2, as outlined in the 
inclusion criteria. These analyses, including comparisons of the p rimary and secondary outcomes 
of interest across these three groups, will permit an exploration of specific differences that may 
be present between subgroups with varying immunological deficits.  
 
13.4. Interim Monitoring Plan  
 
As detailed above, this study will unfold in stages. First, an analysis of the 10 -patient 
pharmacokinetic lead -in cohort and theoretical pharmacokinetic modeling of the  duration of the  
antiviral efficacy of sotrovimab  based on the rising prevalence of the BA.2 variant will define the 
optimal dosing interval between two sequential doses of intravenous sotrovimab. The remaining  
participants will follow the dosing interval defined by [CONTACT_377375] -in cohort. Second, the 50 -patient 
safety and tolerability lead -in cohort (inclusive of these 10 patients) will inform the infusion 
period for the remaining participants. If there are no grade ≥ 2 infusion -related reactions in this 
initial group, patients in the expansion cohort will receive their intravenous sotrovimab doses 
over a 15 -minute infusion period; however, if there is at least one patient with a grade ≥ [ADDRESS_472326] will be disp layed in the form of 
listings, frequencies, summary statistics, and graphs, where appropriate. Binary data will be 
presented in the form of counts and proportions and continuous data will be presented using 
descriptive statistics (N, mean, SD, median and r ange). Similarly, descriptive statistics will be 
provided for selected PK parameters of interest for  the cohort. All PK parameters will be 
summarized in terms of means, standard deviation (SD), % coefficient of variation (CV), range, 
median, and number of samples.  Interpretation of these safety and tolerability data and PK values 
will be informed by [CONTACT_377376].

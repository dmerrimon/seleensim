 A. SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
More than 40% of children enrolled in federally funded programs are overweight or obese by [CONTACT_654] 5.1-[ADDRESS_264226] a 70% chance of becoming obese adults.5,[ADDRESS_264227] among low -income underserved children, in part because of limitations 
inherent to existing programs: 1) short duration and low intensity; 2) late timing of implementation, when children 
are already overweight or o bese; 3) delivery methods limiting their accessibility and sustainability; and 4) failure 
to address barriers such as a lack of culturally competent and in -language services, poverty, housing instability, 
and access to care, which int erfere with healthy lifestyle changes. To address these gaps, we have integrated 
simple, evidence -based nutrition and physical activity components as part of the services already delivered by 
[CONTACT_219938], Healthy Families America, with the long -term goal to deploy these efforts to Home 
Visitation Programs (HVPs)  nationwide.  Annually, over [ADDRESS_264228] four years, our transdisciplinary team of researchers, home visiting stakeholders, families, and 
community stakeholders (hereafter referred as the COPE team ), has integrated evidence -based nutrition and 
physical activity components into an engaging module that we call COPE : Childhood Obesity Prevention @ 
homE /Contrarrestar Obesidad: Programa para niños En casa . COPE is delivered in English and Spanish as an 
enhancement module  to the services of our HVP partner. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_219913], 
feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of COPE.  
The proposed study builds upon the momentum, resources, and research infrastructure of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_219914] -scale and sustained impact of COPE on infant’s and mothers’ obesity outcomes, and to study key 
mechanisms of maternal and social transmission on infants’ obesity risk . Specifically, 300 low-income 
mothers/infants enrolled in  Healthy Families America HVP will be recruited and enrolled in the study , for an 
effective final sample of 200 mothers/infants . Based on standard HVP procedures, mothers/infants will be 
matched to highly trained home visitors (nurses) based on their ethnicity/race and language preferences. Home 
visitors, in turn, will be randomly assigned to deliver the standard HVP curriculum only or the standard HVP 
curriculum + COPE as part of their weekly home visits for two years of HVP services. Comprehensive 
assessments of mothers/infants will be conducted at enrollment and after 6 and 12 months of intervention.  
Specific Aim 1 (maternal and infant outcomes). Test the direct effects of COPE on infants and mothers’ 
weight, metabolic risks, diet/energy intake, and physical activity. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_219939], metabolic markers, and eating and activity -related behaviors between infants/mothers 
across study arms (HVP only vs. HVP+COPE). These results will indicate whether HVP is an effective 
infrastructure for primary and secondary obesity prevention.    
Specific Aim 2 (maternal transmission).  Test whether breastfeeding and maternal diet and activity, feeding 
practices, and food insecurity mediate the effect of COPE on infants’ outcomes . This aim will test mechanisms of 
maternal transmission on infants’ obesity risks.   
Specific Aim 3 (social transmission).  Aim [ADDRESS_264229] of HVP+COPE 
(vs. HVP only) on the characteristics of  the social and community networks that surround mothers and infants 
(i.e., the density, composition, and quality  of “health support networks”).  Aim 3b  tests whether the characteristics 
of social networks mediate the effects of COPE on maternal and infant outcomes.  These findings will indicate if 
HVP obesity prevention efforts can alter and/or activate  social network mechanisms.   
Secondary Aim . Conduct a real -life economic analysis (costs, cost -savings , and non -monetary benefits) of 
integrating COPE into existing HVPs .  
This proposal addresses the impetus to develop interventions targeting at -risk infants  before obesity is 
established. A lthough maternal -infant interventions are much -needed, they present implementation and 
dissemination challenges , including limitations on compliance and retention , and limited potential for scalability  
and sustainability . Our proposed strategy overcomes these challenges through an innovative solution that 
merges evidence -based nutrition and activity compone nts into an existing, ongoing federally -funded 
infrastructure . The propos ed research is timely as the Institute of Medic ine, the [LOCATION_002] Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), and Health and Human Services (DHHS)  extend their recommendations to address key 
factors influencing obesity risk in children from birth to [ADDRESS_264230].  The proposed study tests whether delivering in -home obesity prevention 
as part of an ongoing, sustainable service delivery system (home visitation programs, HVPs) is an effective 
approach for primary (infants) and secondary (mothers) obesity prevention am ong low -income, underserved 
families. This research is poised to have a substantial impact because the delivery modalities of current obesity 
efforts disproportionally restrict the reach and engagement of children who are most  at-risk for obesity, and limit 
the development  and generalization of healthy habits in families’ home environment.  Our proposed strategy 
overcomes these challenges through an innovative and potentially cost-effective solution that merges evidence -
based key nutrition and activity components into an ongoing federally funded HVP. Our focus on understanding 
maternal and social determinants  of intervention effects increases the significance, innovation, and impact of 
this research by [CONTACT_219940] . This 
work will inform maternal and child health public policy initiatives that seek to address the intergenerational 
transmission of obesi ty efforts. If effective, this intervention can be readily disseminated to other HVP s sites 
nationwide.  
 
B.2. Focus on underserved segments of the population.  Although a recent nationally representative study 
found a decline in obesity for children ages [ADDRESS_264231], 40% of low -income children enrolled in federally -funded programs are overweight or obese by [CONTACT_219941].1-4 
In Los Angeles (LA) County there is a strong, positive association between the prevalence of childhood obesity 
and economic hardship.[ADDRESS_264232] 
the ability of at -risk families from diverse racial and ethnic backgro unds to adhere to lifestyle changes in real -
world settings.12,13 Initiating and maintaining healthy habits is ubiquitously difficult, especially for families who 
face a multitude of barriers such as a lack of access to linguistically and culturally competent services, poverty, 
housing instability, and food insecurity. These challenges highlight the dire need to re -conceptualize obesity 
prevention as an integral component of universal care, embedded in a comprehensive system of child and 
maternal health services.  
 
B.3. Focus on infant/maternal transmission. Rapid weight gain during the first [ADDRESS_264233] focused on modifying obesity -risk factors in infancy . Child -feeding practices  and early nutritional 
experiences play a key role in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_68243]’s health behaviors and weight outcomes.21-[ADDRESS_264234] that a range of maternal factors, including mothers’ feeding practices,37-41 mother’s 
energy intake and diet, food insecurity (as it relates to diet), and physical activity may impact child obesity 
outcomes.42-50 Positive changes in maternal health behaviors and food security are not only beneficial for 
mothers’ health, but are also a promising approach to address intergenerational transmission of obesity risk and 
health disparities. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to test the impact of key maternal 
mechanisms on obesity transmission and whether a comprehensive approach to maternal/infant health can alter 
children’s weight trajectories.[ADDRESS_264235] 
translated these concepts into practice.  Families are embedded in social 
networks and communities that influence their health behaviors and 
practices through several mechanisms, in particular via social influence 
and social support.52-59 These social factors can ultimately promote or 
impede behavior change and maintenance.60-62 Drawing on social 
influence and social network theories, as well as innovative "network -
mediated interventions" that have been successfully applied in other 
areas of public health ,60,62 the promotion of maternal and infant health 
behaviors to prevent childhood obesity ideally involves enhancing 
Figure 1.  Social network characteristics  relevant to 
healthy behavior change  
4 
 families’ social networks so that they support behavior change  (Figure 1 ). The intervention goal is to alter and 
enhance mothers’ s ocial networks so that they provide  greater (a) healthy social influence , with a larger proportion of 
individuals in their network  who engage in the desired health behaviors and so provide healthy behavior norms, 
modeling, cues, and opportunities;63-65 and (b) health -relevant social support , with an increase in the density of  
relationships  that encourage and support healthy behaviors.66,67 Obesity prevention initiatives that explicitly target 
families’ social networks (i.e., their connections to people and organizations) by [CONTACT_219942], 
health -supportive relationships to be fostered  and maintained , will help to promote healthy behavior change, and has 
the potential to improve the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of family -based 
interventions.62,[ADDRESS_264236] “diets” and promoted the development of healthy habits for life. Yet 
most (if not all) obesity intervention and prevention programs are generally short -lived (8 -12 weeks). We believe 
that the short delivery and low intensity of obesity interventions greatly decreases their potential impact. 
Specifically, the short imple mentation of interventions/programs is inadequate to cover pi[INVESTIGATOR_219915] -related developmental transitions that are not only critical for the development of healthy eating habits, 
but also highly challenging for children and parents (e.g., tra nsition from breast milk, to pureed foods, to solid 
foods).[ADDRESS_264237] challenge of healthy lifestyle interventions is not to initiate healthy practices 
in families, but to help them maintain healthy behaviors for a prolonged period of time. Even when obesity 
interventions directly plan or address this as part of their curriculum, the maintenance phase rarely (if ever) 
exceeds a few weekly one -hour sessions. This timeline is arguably insufficient to ensure mastery of learned skills 
into lifelo ng healthy habits.  
 
B.6. Focus on home visitation programs: an untapped opportunity to address childhood obesity. 
Consistent with a capacity building approach, we aim to extend the 
existing curriculum and mission of HVPs to address the important gaps 
reviewed above (see also Figure 2  and our concept paper70). The 
outcomes of the proposed research combined with our HVP partnership 
is likely to have  national implications. O ver 500 publicly and privately 
funded HVPs provide services to more than 650,000 low -income, 
underserved children and their families in the U.S. annually. HVPs are 
embedded in a comprehensive system of child and maternal health 
service that is designed to promote optimal child development and 
prevent adverse outcomes.71-75 Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
show that high -quality HVPs can effectively improve children’s physical 
and psychosocial health such as birth outcomes, breastfeeding, 
immunization rates, and overall cognitive and social development.75-93  
Although some HVPs provide basic information on infant nutrition, 
there has been no comprehensive , and sustainable effort to address 
childhood obesity prevention, nutrition, and physical activity as part of 
their services . This may be because the initial focus of HVPs, 40 years 
ago, was to decrease the incidence of low birth weight.94,95 The current 
high prevalence of overweight and obesity among HVPs children is likely to prompt a new national mandate that 
HVPs address childhood obesity prevention as a part of their services. This highlights the pressing need to re-
conceptualize the mission and capabilities of HVPs to address  obesity prevention for all children . The HVP 
structure is ideal to address obesity prevention among underserved families  for many reasons  (see also 70):  
a. HVPs have been in place for more than 40 years, with $1.[ADDRESS_264238],96 which speaks to the sustainability of the services provided .  
b. They provide culturally and linguistically tailored in -home services, which removes barriers to accessing the 
program (e.g., transportation, childcare), promotes the generalization of skills to the home environment, and 
enables ethnically and racially diverse families to access culturally competent health ser vices.  
c. HVPs have existing partnership with Women, Infants and Children (WIC) programs nationwide.  
d. HVPs already address many barriers to healthy lifestyles such as unemployment, family conflict and violence, 
housing instability, and neighborhood characteristics.  
e. The free and voluntary weekly home visits begin during pregnancy or shortly after birth, and continue until 
the child reaches 2 -5 yo, depending on the HVP model. The extensive timeframe for service delivery makes 
it possible to reinforce health knowledge, skills, and behavioral habits.

Obesity efforts have limited impact among 
underserved, low -income childre n at risk for 
obesity.  
Obesity prevention should be: Initiated in 
infancy, delivered in home , & embedded in an 
infrastructure serving at -risk families.  
The home visiting  model is ideal to provide 
scalable and sustainable early childhood 
obesity prevention.  
COPE will i ntegrate obesity prevention into 
ongoing home visiting services

 f. Support, referral, and advocacy is central to the HVP model of delivery, facilitating families’ development of 
social and community networks that support health outcomes.   
g. The widespread presence of HVPs across the US, and established infrastructures in nationwide  urban and 
rural areas,80,91,97,[ADDRESS_264239] -effective  as obesity prevention would be delivered as part of an existing 
infrastructure , with the potential to improve child health and reduce societal costs .  
 
B.7. Feasibility of delivering obesity prevention as part of HVPs’ services. Over the last four years, our 
transdisciplinary COPE team has integrated established nutrition and physical activity components and 
activities9,99-104 into a culturally sensitive, language specific, and community -forming model of implementation 
that we call COPE (see Intervention arms  below). COPE does not  target weight loss; rather it focuses on 
preventing the development of childhood obesity through the promotion of healthy behaviors in all mothers and 
infants/children from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of weight status.  
Drs. Salvy & de la Haye secured two pi[INVESTIGATOR_219916] ( CTSI [Salvy, #8UL1TR000130 ] and NIH Johns Hopkins 
Global Obesity Prevention Center  [de la Haye, # 5U54HD070725 -03]) and completed the following activities:  
1. Obtained IRB approval and developed all study material.  
2. Consolidated our partnership with Cyd Wessell, the National Director of Healthy Family America  (see letter s 
of support), laying the groundwork to enable the dissemination of COPE to other sites nationwide.  
3. Publish the concept paper  outlining the rationale and scientific premises underlying our initiative (see 70)  
4. Manualized  evidence -based nutrition and activity guidelines into educational material and hands -on activities 
that are culturally sensitive (e.g., recipes adapted to families’ preferences) and community engaging (e.g., 
leveraging resources and social networks endogenous to the community through community  gardening and 
communal cooking activities) to meet the needs and desires of HVP families.  
5. Trained home visitors  to implement COPE using science -based content and social -experiential approaches 
to elicit change talk and patient -centered goals; trained recruitment and data collection staff.  
6. Integrated COPE into the curriculum  of our HVP partner in Antelope Valley  (a chapter of Healthy Families 
America in Antelope Valley, CA) , and delivered the module in English and Spanish.  
7. Evaluated recruitment procedures and retention rates, and documented characteristics of the families’ social 
networks that could be targeted to optimize healthy changes.  
8. Enrolled our target pi[INVESTIGATOR_219917] 50 HVP mothers/infants and randomized families to receive HVP 
curriculum with or without COPE for [ADDRESS_264240] the feasibility  of integrating COPE into HVP services 
(see Preliminary findings  below).  
9. Formed our COPE Community Advisory Board  (families, Antelope Valley Partners for Health home visitors, 
stakeholders, physicians ), which provides feedback on the project every 6 months.  
 
Preliminary data: Baseline characteristics and social networks . Mothers (average age = 25 years) in 
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_219918] 70% Hispanic/ Latino, 13% African American, 8% White, 5% American Indian/Alaskan, 
and 4% mixed/other race. All were low -income and were receiving federal support through WIC. Mothers’ social 
connec tions were predominantly family and household members, who were the key providers of health -related 
support. Mothers  were somewhat socially isolated from their broader 
community: they  reported few connections to same -age friends, 
spouses/romantic partners  (<50%) , or other (non-family) community 
members. Specific characteristics of mothers’ social networks  were 
identified as potential barriers to healthy behavior change . For example, 
having a larger proportion of social ties  who were female or who lived 
in the same household, and a smaller proportion of friends, was 
associated  with poorer health indicators (i.e., greater gestational weight 
gain, pre -pregnancy and baseline BMI; greater soda intake; and less 
fruit and vegetable intake). These findings have informed the proposed 
study design, which aims to alter and enhance mothers’ social networks 
so that they are more suppor tive of healthy behavior change. For  
example, the proposed intervention will foster new social connections 
to peers in the ir community who can provide support and serve as 
healthy role models.  0200400600800100012001400160018002000

 Preliminary data: infant  and mother  outcomes . To date, our pi[INVESTIGATOR_219919] [ADDRESS_264241] completed 6 months of intervention. Children’s 
weight velocity was 18% lower in COPE than in the control group (0.61 + 0.1 kg/month vs 0.75 + 0.1 kg/month), 
although this difference was not statistically significant. Interestingly, 
there were no group differences in infants’ energy intake at baseline or 
at 6-month, which raises the possibility that maternal factors, such as 
breastfeeding and maternal diet acco unt, at least in part, for infants’ 
weight trajectories. This hypothesis will be tested in the proposed study.   
As part of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we also assessed maternal energy intake 
(Figure 3 ) and consumption of sugar -sweetened beverages ( Figure 4 ) 
as we hypothesize that these variables impact children’s obesity 
outcomes (as outlined in Aim 2 ). Mothers’ food intake was assessed via 
24-hour food recalls and converted into energy intake (Kcal) by a 
research assistant blind to group assignment. These preliminary trends 
that suggest an improvement in maternal dietary intake in COPE vs. 
control are promising.  
 
B.8. Theoretical Framework.  Our overarching model promotes maternal 
healthy weight, healthy family behaviors  and home environment, and 
supportive family and community social networks, as key pathways affecting 
child outcomes during the important developmental period of infancy/early 
childhood.105,106 This theoretical framework  and underlying scientific premise  
informs our specific intervention model  (Figure 5 ). Our approach is based on 
the Ecological Systems Theory , Family Systems Perspective  and on the Life 
Course Perspective . These frameworks provide the rationale for targeting the 
maternal and social mechanisms to initiate, reinforce, and maintain healthy 
behaviors in infancy/early childhood.  The Ecological Systems Theory  and 
Family and Community Systems  perspective emphasize the need to consider 
the impact of individual, family, community, and societal factors on health and 
social outcomes.107 Social networks, which include parent -child dyads as well 
as other family, friends, and important individuals and organizations, exert 
influence on obesity and related behaviors that should be harnessed.108 Finally, the Life Course Perspective  
underpi[INVESTIGATOR_219920] , the importance of interven ing 
during critical life stages, and addressing differential exposures to risk / protective factors at key points across 
the lifespan contribute to health disparities.109-113  
 
B.9. Innovation. This study is both theoretically and clinically innovative in:  
1. Focusing on primary prevention of childhood obesity by [CONTACT_219943].  
2. Using an existing infrastructure that is providing culturally -, family -, and community - oriented services to a 
high-risk segment of the population to address the limitations of current childhood obesity efforts, and 
focusing on scalability, sustainability and cost effectiveness, all of which are critical issues to consider for the 
delivery of health services.  
3. Testing key social and maternal mechanisms in the intergenerational transmission of obesity, and thus 
evaluating whether changes maternal behavior and social networks affect infant outcomes and ultimately 
contribute to childhood obesity pre vention.  
4. Providing weekly in -home obesity prevention to optimi ze the generalization of skills and behaviors in the 
family  environment, and to modify the home environment . 
 
 C. APPROACH  
This research is designed to integrate and leverage  our team’s expertise ( Table 1 ), as detailed in the Personnel 
Justification  section, Multiple PI [INVESTIGATOR_219921],  and Biosketches .  
 
C.1. Design overview. Table 2  depi[INVESTIGATOR_219922] , and demonstrates its scientific rigor . 
Healthy Families America home visitors (see Intervention arms  below for their qualifications) will be randomized 
to deliver the HVP curriculum with or without COPE for 12 months (standard HVP duration). Mothers/infants will

The assessment of 
participants after they ceased to receive servi ces for a given period of time (i.e., “true” follow -up) is impossible 
because of the  ongoing nature of HVP services . We believe that asking home visitors to withhold the delivery of 
the COPE material to allow for a “no COPE” period would be unrealistic in terms of potential contamination, and 
also create an uncomfortable situation for families and HVP staff.

C.2. Technical merits of our study approach.  Our formative and pi[INVESTIGATOR_219925] . Intervention dosage. By [CONTACT_219945]-home  services initiated in infancy and maintained for a sustained period of 
time ( 12 months ), we resolve many limitations of existing obesity prevention programs. The proposed model of 
delivery makes it possible to: (1) cover key child developmental periods for healthy eating and activity; (2) deliver 
the material gradually , over a sustained period of time , to avoid burdening families and home visitors; (3) guide 
parents to implement changes in their homes to promote generalization  and address ecologically relevant cues 
related to habit formation , (4) and ensure that the skills and knowledge gained are reinforced and mastered to 
promote long -term maintenance. Treatment fidelity.  Intervention fidelity encompasses integrity ( interventions 
are implemented according to established procedures) and differentiation (interventions are distinct from one 
another).[ADDRESS_264242] that our strategies  are effective in preserving integrity and differentiation:

 complete rigorous training to learn the HVP curriculum and meet the requirements of Healthy Families America 
(the HVP model we are partnering with). They receive weekly supervision to review progress and address issues.

further reviews 25% of the sessions to monitor fidelity.  (4) Weekly  supervisions (home visitors) and bi -annual 
focus groups (families, home visitors, and Community Advisory Board) are conducted to review progress, dosage 
and timing of delivery, and provide the opportunity to resolve problems or issues encountered. (5) Intervention  
components are delivered in the home  or at spe cified  community -run settings (e.g., community garden) , and meetings 
and supervisions with home visitors implementing different arms are held on separate days (at Antelope Valley Partners 
for Health) to minimize the risks of contamination . COPE supervision is embedded in the weekly supervision home 
visitors already receive to monitor their services. Potential  burden or weakening of HVP curriculum . Potential 
concerns related to adding material to the existing HVP curriculum include (1) diluting or weakening HVPs’ 
outcomes in other areas (e.g., parenting skills, maternal depression) , and (2) increasing the burden on HVP staff 
and families . Our formative evaluation and pi[INVESTIGATOR_219926] . COPE was 
designed collaboratively w ith our HVP partner s (who are experienced in integrating new enhancement modules  
into the HVP curriculum ) so that it would complement other program goals. For instance, home visitors report 
that COPE cooking and tasting activities  are used to strengthen mother -child bonding and parenting skills  (a 
standard HVP benchmark area). HVP directors also found no differences between HVP+COPE and HVP only 
families on HVPs’ benchmark areas set by [CONTACT_219946]  (i.e., maternal and 
newborn health; child abuse and neglect and emergency department visits; crime or domestic violence; family 
economic security; and coordination and referrals for other community resources and support) . Concerns that 
COPE may overly burden families and lead to greater attrition was also not supported, as the dropout rate was 
considerably lower among mothers in the HVP+COPE group than among  mothers in the HVP only group in our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. These findings suggest that the addition of COPE does no t weaken  other HVPs’ targeted outcomes , 
or overly burden families and home visitors . We will continue to monitor these outcomes throughout the 
implementation.  
 
C.3. Participants. Participants will be low -income mothers/infants (6mo at 
enrollment) who are already receiving services from our HVP partner  (Figure 6 ). 
Thus, study enrollment does not require that we recruit more families than our  
HVP partner is already enrolling. Mothers are enrolled in HVP services through 
outrea ch and screening pre -partum, in English or Spanish,  at community health 
centers and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In order to be eligible mothers must meet a number of (but 
not all) risk criteria (e.g., low -income, housin g instability ). Enrolled mothers are 
matched to a home visitor (nurse) based on culture and language. Recruitment . 
Assessment workers (distinct from home visitors delivering services) who enroll 
families into services will introduce the study to mothers and obtain written 
consent. They will clarify with mothers that their refusal to participate in the study 
will not affect their receipt of any other services provided by [CONTACT_219947]. In our 
experience, families feel comfortable refusing if they are not willing to participate. 
Mothers/infants will be ineligible if they have any of the following conditions:  
eating disorders (e.g., bulimia nervosa), schizophrenia, and obesity -related 
syndrome (e.g., Prader Willi). Participants enrolled in a weight -loss program will 
be ineligible . Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we expect to recruit 70% Hispanic/Latino, 
13% African American, 8 % White, 5% American Indian/Alaskan, 4% mixed 
race. Retention . We have learned a great deal about retention through our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732] . For instance, most attrition 
from HVP services occurs in the first six months of services. Therefore, to maximize retention, mothers will be 
invited to participate in the study  after six months of home visits . The unique relationship between home visitors 
and mothers facilitates subsequent retention , as m any of these mothers are socially isolated and home visitors 
are important confidants and supports. We will use multiple strategies that are effective for high -risk populations 
to further retain the study sample: (1) gift cards of $25 at each data collection, with all incentives paid after each 
assessment; (2) frequent contacts to maintain engagement and foster open communication; (3) quarterly 
newsletters to update subjects about study act ivities; (4) acknowledging birthdays and milestones; (5) reminder 
phone calls the day before the weekly visits and assessment sessions.  Randomization . Randomization will be 
at the level of home visitors, who deliver the HVP  (cluster randomization) . Home visitors who serve mothers that 
are participating in the proposed study will be randomly assigned to deliver either HVP only or HVP+COPE.

 bias is reduced due to the homogenous population enrolled in HVPs (e.g., income, ethnicity/race). Second, to 
reduce contamination, the training and supervisions of home visitors assigned to each arm will be held on separate 
days. All analyses will control for home visitor work experience (number of years in HVP).  
 
C.4. Intervention Arms  (Table 4 ).  
HVP curriculum . Our HVP partner s are two  of 400 
nationwide Healthy Families America  (HFA) sites/chapters, 
housed at Antelope Valley Partners for Health  and the 
Antelope Valley Children’s Bureau . The HFA model meets the 
DHHS criteria for an “evidence -based early childhood home 
visiting service delivery model” ( See 
http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov ). HFA services begin prenatally 
and continue until children are 2 -5yo depending on the HVP 
model . The curriculum  focuses on strengthening parent -child 
relationships and family functioning, promoting positive child 
development, and linkage to community resources (e.g., medical providers, financial/housing assistance, 
childcare, substance abuse treatment , community programs ). HFA accredited home visitors  (Nurses) are 
matched to families on cultural background and language (English or Spanish), to provide culturally sensitive 
services.  Home visitors are selected because of their personal characteristics ( e.g., non-judgm ental, 
compassionate, ability to establi sh a trusting relationship ), their experience working with culturally diverse 
communities, and their  skills to do the job. HFA home visitors are expertly trained and experienced in handling 
situations encounter ed while working with at -risk families. They  receive training in cultural competency, 
substance abuse, reporting child abuse, domestic violence, and linkage to services in their community. Home 
visiting  staff also receive intensive training specific to their role ( e.g., identifying at -risk families, standardized 
assessments, phlebotomy, mental health  referrals, promoting preventive health care, utilizing creative outreach 
efforts, establishing and maintaining trust with families, building upon fami ly strengths, developi[INVESTIGATOR_219927], teaching parent -child interact ion, managing crises ). Staff also receive weekly supervision, 
ongoing developmental training, and have limited caseloads (10 -15 families) to meet their families’ needs.  
COPE  is a culturally sensitive, language specific , and community -forming model of implementation to deliver 
key nutrition , activity and feeding practice  components as part of HVP services in a way that is engaging for 
families. COPE key components are summarized in Table 4 , and outlined in detail below. Although 
mothers/infants are the focus of HVPs and  COPE, visits are delivered in the home and, as is standard practice 
with HVPs, will engage other household members if possible (e.g., spouse) .  
1. Maternal nutrition . Home visitors teach mothers to prepare and store foods they receive from WIC and the 
Food Bank , and to gradually build healthier nutrition and activity goals congruent to their cultural practices and 
ethnic specific food palate: (a) increasing intake of vegetables and fruits (≥5 servings/day of fruits and vegetables) 
and integrating nutrient -dense ingredients in their families’ meals/recipes; (b) limiting intake of high -saturated fat 
and sugar in modifying families’ favorite recipes ( the material is adapted to families’ cultural and personal 
preferences); (c) eliminating sugar -sweetened beverage intake , supported by [CONTACT_219949], long -term effects of high sugar consumption, importance of drinking water, and 
impact of advertising;115-121 (d) teaching healthy portion sizes using different visual activities.  2. Infants/young 
children nutrition . The curriculum promotes sustained breastfeeding for the first two years and the gradual 
integration of complementary feeding (pureed and age -appropriate solid foods) that support healthy eating for 
infants . Mothers learn about feeding/eating developmental stages and transitions, and healthy feeding7-9,122 
practices to promote: (a) responsiveness to child hunger and fullness cues; (b) the consumption of nutrient -
dense foods (as opposed to energy -dense); (d) the transition to structured schedule for meals/snacks from 
complementary feeding; and (d) the use of  non-food related child soothing techniques. Mothers also learn 
strategies to address neophobia,123,124 such as repeated multi -sensory (i.e., smell, touch, taste) exposures to 
nutrient -dense novel foods,125 gradual texture shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], parents/caregivers modeling, and involvement of children 
in food selection and preparation; and strategies to handle meal -related tantrums (e.g., redirection, positive 
reinforcement of appropriate behaviors ).126,127 3. Maternal/child physical activity.  Although there is no 
unequivocally  accepted guidelines for the number of minutes children 0 -2yo should be active each day,128 the 
DHHS has summarized recommendations from the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, 
the American College of Sports Medicine,  and the National Institutes of Health: (a) daily planned physical 
activities, including tummy time, that safel y support the infant’s developmental milestones (e.g. head and neck 
self-support, rolling, floor sitting, kicking, crawling, reaching and graspi[INVESTIGATOR_219928], etc.); (b) engage in 30

further suggests limiting screen time.129 COPE is premised on the above guidelines in addition to CDC guidelines 
for adults (150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity/week). COPE teaches parents to make activity/play 
a daily habit for their entire family by [CONTACT_219950] (e.g.,  taking the stairs, walking to the shop). 
Home visitors help parents design activities around their local environment, schedule, and preferences, and to 
optimize their use of safe spaces. Parents are provided with information about resources and f ree group activities 
conducive to physical activity (e.g., parks, walking clubs, outings, etc.), and classes they can take with their 
children and with other HVP families. The curriculum emphasizes the importance of parents co -engaging in 
activities with t heir children to set a good example through modeling and to provide opportunities for their children 
to be physically active.  
 COPE d elivery format . Our formative work and pi[INVESTIGATOR_219929]’s health.   
 1. Didactic education  focuses on in -home individualized coaching to help mothers implement changes in their 
“natural environment”. A strong emphasis is placed on  gradual goal setting  in which mothers set objectives for 
their own and/or their children’s weekly activity and diet (e.g., decreasing by “x” the number of sugar -sweetened 
beverages) and on parent modeling  healthy behaviors (i.e., co -engaging in healthy behaviors with their children). 
Parents are taught behavior management and cognitive -behavioral  strategies  to change cues in their home 
environment . Mothers receive individual coaching to gradually eliminate high -energy dense foods from the home 
environment, and to modify the home to make it more conducive to exercising (e.g., removing 
computer/televisions from sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_181896]) .129 2. Social experiential activities  (Table 5 ) were selected in response 
to: our theoretical framework that empha sizes social network influences;  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_219930];  and families’ desire to learn through hands -on, social activities . 
These activities  are already built into the service infrastructure at Antelope Valley Partners for Health, are 
integrated across all key content are as of COPE , and will be promoted to participants in the intervention arm 
(but not to participants in the control arm)  by [CONTACT_219951] . Participation by [CONTACT_219952]. One central  purpose of the communal activities is to  foster new , yet 
sustainable  social and community connections that  will provide increased healthy behavior role models  and 
social support  for mothers. This will 
be achieved through activities that 
provide a context for repeated social 
connection among consistent groups 
of COPE participants in their 
neighborhoods , and  through 
activities designed to foster g roup 
learning, discussi on, and shared 
experiences that are aligned with the 
individual didactic learning in home . 
These social activities are similar to 
those delivered as part of the 
National Institute of Food and 
Agriculture’s Expanded Food and 
Nutrition Education Program .130   
 
C.5. Measurements . HVP Assessment Workers (registered  nurses who can draw blood) who enroll families into 
standard HVP services, have been trained to screen and recruit eligible families for the proposed project. They 
will administer the assessments (English or Spanish ; Table 6 ) in the families’ homes o r at the HVP clinic (as 
needed)  at baseline/enrollment, and after 6mo and 12mo of services. Home visitors  will be trained to gather 
interim (objective) weight measurements for the purpose of  generating more frequent  data points , triangulated 
with the assessment workers’ measurements.  
Medical and family history.  A thorough family history and physical examination will be conducted at baseline. 
We will collect demographic data , including socioeconomic status ( education, income, eligibility for SNAP).  
Infant growth & waist trajectories.  Weight will be measured on a digital scale (Tanita) accurate to the nearest 
5g. Length will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using an infanto -meter using the standardized WHO approach,

length and weight -for-age z -scores (WHO 
Standards), as recommended by [CONTACT_219955] <24 mos. Infant growth rates will be 
examined as the change in WLZ from baseline to 
follow up ( 12mo) Waist circumference will be 
measured at the umbilicus (nearest 1 -mm) using 
a non -stretch measuring tape.  
Infant diet &  activity . To fully capture infants’ diet  
(e.g., breastfeeding, use of formula, fruits / 
vegetables, fat/ sugar intake), we will use multiple 
tools. Diet recall. . Mothers will be interviewed 
about their infants’ intake  of fruits, vegetables, 
friend foods, and sugared beverages. Mothers will 
comp lete items from  the Diet and Behavior 
Questionnaire  (DBQ)132 of the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey  to capture 
breastfeeding/ feeding history  and introduction to 
formula and solid foods. Infants’ activity . Because of validity issues related to accelerometry in infants/young 
children, we opted to capture time engaged in sedentary activities and structured/unstructured physical activity.  
Mothers will report their child’s activities  (e.g., tummy time ,).133-135  
 
Infants  and maternal  biomarkers  for metabolic  risks . Blood  will be drawn  at the Antelope Valley Partners for

attempt. Plasma  will be stored  at -70°C for analysis . Biomarkers  of type 2 diabetes  risk, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , and inflammatory  
markers . CRP  will be measured  using  the Millipore  Multiple  assay  kit at the USC DORI  Core  Laboratory . Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_219931]  (Johnson  & Johnson  Clinical  Dinostics  [COMPANY_002]ster , NY) for 
cholesterol , triglycerides  and HDL-cholesterol . Sitting blood pressure (mothers) using auscultation and heart rate 
will be measured on the right arm after a [ADDRESS_264245] will be recorded.  
 
Maternal weight & waist circumference . Weight and height will be measured by [CONTACT_219958]’ homes using an electronic scale (Model BWB -800S, Tanita, Portage, MI) and stadiometer (Model 
PE-AIM-101, Perspective Enterprises) according to standard procedures.[ADDRESS_264246] 1 mm using a non -stretch measuring tape. 
Maternal obesity prior to pregnancy will be derived from pregravid BMI (recall during pregnancy at recruitment). 
Gestational weight gain will be defined  as the last weight obtained before delivery minus the pregravid recalled 
weight or the weight recorded at the first prenatal visit during the first trimester using electronic medical record 
data.  
 
Maternal diet & activity . Mothers’ dieta ry intake and activities will be assessed using several items from 
NHANES (2017), including intake of fruits and vegetables, fried foods, and sugary -sweetened beverages, and 
time mothers engage in moderate physical activity.  
Maternal social networks & support.  Using egocentric social network methods141 and EgoWeb software 
(http://www.rand.org/methods/egoweb.html , developed with PI [INVESTIGATOR_219932]), we will assess the characteristics of 
the social actors (people, organizations) and relationships that surround mothers.142,[ADDRESS_264247] name 
[CONTACT_219979],143,144 participants are asked to identify 20 important adults in their lives, and then report on the 
attributes of each person (demographics,  health attributes /behaviors) and types of relationships they share. 
Relationship characteristics of interest include how they know the person (e.g., family, friend from a community 
program , etc. ), frequency of interaction, and provision of  support for health behaviors (e.g., encoura gement for 
or co -engagement in s pecific behaviors)52,53,145. Social Support measures from the PROMIS database will be  used 
to assess emotional and instrumental support, and social isolation. Egocentric network data is used to compute 
network composition variabl es (e.g., proportions of family/ friends  in the network ), and variables that represent 

12 
 important network structures (e.g., sparse or dense support). Respondents will also be asked about health -
related relationships (e.g., information seeking, support) they have with community organizations. Social network 
analysis (SNA) will be used to compute summary statistics for each mother’s network, such as the p roportion of 
network members that engage in regular exercise or that provide health -relevant support, and the density of 
supportive relationships.[ADDRESS_264248] of COPE on infants’ outcomes, as energy intake and weight 
are related to food insecurity.42-50  
 
C.6. Analytic Plan .  
General strategy.  Three waves of data will be collected (baseline/enrollment, 6 and 12- months of 
intervention ). Analyses will be carried out according to the intention -to-treat rule consistent with standard practice 
in most clinical  trials. We will conduct standard statistical diagnosis and descriptive statistics  of demographic and 
background variables, and examine f requencies for reasonableness, sparseness (categorical data) and non -
normality (continuous variables) of the data. Missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation and/or full 
information maximum likelihood estimation. Psychometric properties of th e study scales will be investigated to 
ascertain appropriate validity  and reliability. Preliminary analyses will test group equivalence on  baseline  
characteristics . Categorical methods of analysis (e.g., cross tabulations, chi -square) will be used for discrete data 
while t-tests will be used for continuous data to test the comparability of the prevention arms. Factors found to be 
different at baseline will be adjusted for in subsequent analyses. The following covariates  will be entered in all 
analyses: home visitor, home visitor experience (years), number of visits, househol d composition, race/ethnicity, 
acculturation, mother’s age, medical history/gestational diabetes, post -partum depression.  
Social network analysis (SNA). Network data will be analyzed using SNA packages in R (e.g., SNA, igraph) 
to produce visualizations and statistics that summarize the characteristics of each mothers’ network. We will 
compute the following network statistics: the proportion of network memb ers that provide specific types of health 
relevant support, and that engage in specific health behaviors; and the density of supportive relationships within 
each network (i.e., the number of supportive relationships among net work members that are reported, as a 
proportion of the total number of possible supportive relationships where all network members provide 
support).149,150 These statistics will be computed for each assessment period (as well as change statistics across 
periods), and included in the analyses, as described below.  
Statistical Models Aims 1 -3. Our conceptual model includes three types of variables: Intervention arms 
(HVP vs. HVP+COPE) and covariates, mediators, and outcome variables.  We will use multiple statistical 
procedures tied to the analytic objectives of each of our specific aims, including generalized linear modeling, 
path analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) approaches.  To control for potential cluster effect due to 
home visitors as families are nested with visitor, statistical models will be devel oped based on multilevel path 
analysis to test direct and indirect (or mediational) effects hypothesized in the model.151,[ADDRESS_264249] of the 
data. The multilevel path model can involve all variables from the family level in the analysis. The model can also 
incorporate distal predictors and mediator s from the visitor -level (Level -2) and outcomes from family -level (Level -
1) data. The aims of the proposed study focus on the Level -1 units. Following Bentler -Weeks153 modeling 
notation, the path model can be expressed as: =β+, with all exogenous (distal) variables defined as  and 
all endogenous (mediators and final outcomes) variables as . The parameters in β and  matrices can be 
specified according to the hypotheses of each Aim. Models to be developed are discussed in greater detail below 
for each Aim. Mplus software154 will be used model estimation and evaluation.  
Aim 1 (maternal/ infant outcomes).  Change in weight -related outcome s over the [ADDRESS_264250] at each follow -up assessment point. Longitudinal 
analyses with all follow -up points ( 6 and 12 months) will then be conducted to examine profiles across time to 
investigate the effects of program conditions on trends of outcome measures.  
Aim 2 (maternal transmission).  To estimate the mediational effects of maternal transmission, multilevel 
path models will be developed and evaluated per our hypotheses. The model specification will be guided by [CONTACT_219959] t 
mother’s weight, diet and behavior as mediators, which in turn may influence infants’ outcome. While the 
intervention program will be at the Level -2 unit, all other variables included in the multilevel path models will be 
Level -1 variables obtained from mothers and children. Using breastfeeding and maternal diet on infants’ weight 
trajectories as an example, the mediation mechanism of maternal transmission can be expressed by [CONTACT_219960]: 
COPE→ breastfeeding * maternal diet → weight. The path model will allow the test of both the direct effect of 
COPE on infant weight trajectory and its indirect effect on through breastfeeding and maternal diet.  
Aim 3 (social transmission) . A multilevel path model similar to the one described in Aim 2 will be specified. 
Mediators can be specified in a process to more appropriately represent the mechanism of social transmission. 
For example, the model can contain a sequence of influences such as: COPE → density of social network 
support→ maternal outcomes → infant  outcome. A direct effect of social network on infants ’ outcomes can also 
be specified to investigate if social network has direct and indirect effect on infants’ outcomes.   
Power Analysis Aims 1 -3 (Figure 7). A total of 30 home visitors will be recruited and randomized to HVP 
or HVP+COPE. With an average o f [ADDRESS_264251] a retention rate of 75% of families, which will result in a final sample of 200 mothers/infants. We have 
calculated power using G*Power158 based on an effective sample of N= [ADDRESS_264252] size of .4 (Cohen’s d) on our main outcome of children’s weight velocity and smaller effect 
on energy intake at [ADDRESS_264253]. No previous study has investigated the long -term ( 12 months ) delivery 
of in-home obesity prevention on 0 -2yo children’s growth trajectory, diet and activity. However, an in -home 
intervention compared to outpatient pediatric counseling 
resulted in a large effect size of 1.64 (Cohen’s d) for 
changes in zBMI at [ADDRESS_264254] at the home visitor level, we assume the intraclass 
correlation (ICC) of .05 to .1 161 with inflation factors (1+(n -
1)*ICC) of 1.[ADDRESS_264255] sizes based 
on Cohen’s f163 between .17 and .20. More comprehensive 
path model will be specified in each aim for model 
evaluation and hypothesis testing. We are aware of the 
sample size limitation and will be cautious in the number of 
variables and the size of the model involved. We used the 
hypothesis -testing framework of RMSEA164 to estimate 
power of model fitting in our study. With  = .05, a null hypothesis RMSEA of .00 (almost exact fit for path model), 
an alternative hypothesis RMSEA of .08 (criterion of not acceptable models) and degrees of freedom (size of the 
model) ranging from [ADDRESS_264256] of a set of pre -selected parameters associated with 
mediators and outcomes with sample size of 200.165 
Secondary Aim ( Real-life economic analysis ). We will document the costs of adding COPE to HVP’s 
services through cost logs and interviews with HVP directors. We will consider the costs of labor (the time home 
visitors spent in training and in administering COPE, times their wage rate) and of material s (training and 
intervention manuals for home visitors), and evaluate how these costs can be absorbed through the ongoing 
funding from the Affordable Care Act. We will calculate infants and mothers’ weight, metabolic, and beha vioral 
trajectories and how they differ by [CONTACT_219961], household structure, and other observables. These analyses 
will be conducted at two levels. First, we will calculate the cost -effectiveness of HVP+COPE (vs. HVP only) by 
[CONTACT_219962], metabolic, or behavioral outcomes with 
the cost per unit of improvement in these outcomes vs. alternative obesity programs with similar aims (e.g., 
prevention delivered in outpatient settings). This will provide a m easure of the effectiveness of COPE vs. 
Figure 7. Required sample size by [CONTACT_219963]  
[ADDRESS_264257] long-term outcomes and/or evaluate the cost -effectiveness of healthcare 
interventions. We have developed a simulation model to predict BMI trajectories and associated medical 
expenditures over the life cycle  (e.g., 166). The model utilizes data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 
(MEPS) to model yearly changes in BMI and healthcare costs associated with each possible initial BMI state. 
The model was validated using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examin ation Survey (NHANES). This 
work shows that reducing by 10% the risks of overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 85th percentile) in ages [ADDRESS_264258] medical costs between $2,830 (men) and $3,000 (women) in adulthood.

 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
A. Participants  
This comparative effectiveness research involves the enrollment of 300 mothers/infants for a final effective 
sample of 200 mothers and their infants  (age 6mo at enrollment).  
Inclusion of women. Women are represented by [CONTACT_219964], which will be about half of the 
infant sample. Based on our projected effective sample of 200 mothers and their 200 infants (N= 400), we 
anticipate that 75% of our sample will be women (1 00 children  + 200 mothers = 300).  
Inclusion of racially and ethnically diverse families.   The families enrolled in the Home Visiting Program 
(HVP) from which the sample is drawn is culturally, racially and ethnically diverse, reflecting the population of 
low-income families enrolled in home visiting services in the Antelope Valley, CA area. Based on our HVP partner 
(Healthy Families America site in Southern [LOCATION_004]: Antelope Valley Partners for Health  and Children’s 
Bureau ) clients’ demographics and on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we anticipate the following ethnic and racial distribution: 
70% Hispanic/ Latino, 13% African American, 8% White, 5% American Indian/Alaskan, and 4% mixed/other 
race.   
It is important to note that Health Families America  (HFA)  home visitors are matched to families based on 
language and cultural background. Home visitors are rigorously trained to understand, acknowledge, and respect 
families’ cultural differences. Home visitors are selected because of their personal characteristics (i.e. non -
judgmental, compassionate, ability to establish a trusting relationship, etc.), their experience working with 
culturally diverse communities, and their skills to do the job.  
Inclusion of children.  Infancy and early childhood are important developmental periods given that nearly 
one-third of American children two years and older are already overweight or obese167-169 and these rates are 
even higher among low -income children of color. Once obesity is established, it is difficult to reverse,170 and 
obesity in childhood and adolescence are independent risk factors for adult obesity.6 Children develop eating 
and activity habits in the context of their family, and parents influence the child’s health trajectories through their 
own behaviors (e.g., modeling) and through the shared family environment. This proposal addresses the impetus 
to develop interventions targeting at -risk infants before obesity is established, to avoid the significant public 
health implications associated with obesity by [CONTACT_219965] -risk individuals and 
reducing financial burdens for t he society as a whole. The services and obesity module  being evaluated in this 
proposed research involve the provision of home visi ting services to infants/ children  and their mothers. 
Therefore, a  number of the outcomes that will be measured as part of the proposed research will involve children. 
Specifically, c hildren will be represented by [CONTACT_941] 200 infants that will be the offspring of the mothers, as well as 
mothers who are 18 years of age or younger. A significant proportion of mothers enrolled in home visiting 
services (50%) are ≤ [ADDRESS_264260] the total number of participants ≤ 18 
years of age at enrollment will be: 200 infants + 100 mothers = 300.  
The research team is well trained and experienced in conducting research in children. [CONTACT_219980] (MPI) is a 
Clinical Psychologist with expertise in pediatric and child psychology, and she has been a member of the 
children’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) for several years at the Women and Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219933], 
NY. She will ensure the quality of the treatment implementation. The involvement of minors as participants in 
this research is in compliance with all subparts of [ADDRESS_264261]  confidence . 
Data  from human  subjects  include :  
• Clinical  evaluation  and medical  history  via questionnaire /interview ; 
• Demographic  information , via questionnaire  (mothers ) 
• Anthropometry : body  weight , waist  circumference , height  (mothers /infants ) 
• Blood  pressure  (mothers ) and blood  samples  (mothers /infants ); 
• Variables  derived  from dietary  intake , via recall  interviews  (mothers as respondents for themselves and for 
their infants) ;  
• Physical  activity  via interview /recall  (infants ) and accelerometers  (mothers );  
• Social  networks  and support  via questionnaires  (mothers ); 
• Maternal  feeding  style & practices  via questionnaire  (mothers ); 
•  Maternal  food insecurity  via questionnaire  (mothers ); 
 
Records . Mothers’ pre -pregnancy weight and infants’ birth weight will be obtained from our HVP partner. All 
other data used for this study will be collected during the implementation of the study protocol.  
 
B. Potential Risks/Adverse Events and Procedures Used to Minimize the Risks  
For purposes of monitoring and reporting adverse events, the following definitions will be used:  
16 
 Adverse event (AE):  any untoward medical occurrence that may present itself during treatment or 
administration of an intervention, and which may or may not have a causal relationship with the treatment. 
Adverse events could arise from the study (e.g., breach of confidentiali ty) or could arise because of the 
population under study (e.g., a mother reports extensive use of drugs).  
Serious adverse event (SAE):  Any medical occurrence that results in death; is life -threatening; requires 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889]; creates persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Such an even t could include suicidal ideation or 
attempted drug overdose or withdrawal, etc.  
Adverse events monitoring . Each participant (mother and infant) will be evaluated for any adverse events. 
All events will be graded by [CONTACT_219966] (unrelated to protocol; or possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
protocol). Any event reported to the Principal Investigato rs or to designated research associates by [CONTACT_219967], which also meets the event criteria, will be 
carefully documented in a report submitted to the IRBs. The report will include a descrip tion of the event; when 
and how it was reported; any official charts, records, or documentation to corroborate the event or the reporting 
of the event; and an action plan to prevent future occurrences. All adverse events will be graded as mild, 
moderate, o r severe. Any severe and/or unanticipated adverse event will be immediately reported to the IRBs 
(within 48 hours of occurrence or recognition) and NIH. All adverse events will be summarized annually and 
submitted to the IRBs and NIH. Any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of this study (e.g., 
IRB actions) will be reported to the NIH.  
Physical risks.  There are minimal physical risks added from participating in this study. All lifestyle dietary 
and physical activities suggested are in line with national guidelines. Recommended physical activities are low 
impact and unlikely to create discomfort for par ticipants.  
Psychological risks.  Though n one of the questionnaires contain items that are particularly sensitive, 
personal, or potentially upsetting, i t is possible that a participant may become upset thinking about some of the 
questions or topi[INVESTIGATOR_164205]. Trained assessors  will be conducting the assessment sessions to address any 
potential incident. All participants will be informed that they are free to refuse to answer any particular questions 
or questionnaires. They will also be informed that they can withdra w from the study at any time without penalty. 
Staff will immediately report any AEs connected to the implementation of the intervention to Drs. Salvy and de 
la Haye who will keep a log of AEs and SAEs. Drs. Salvy and de la Haye will file a written report w ithin [ADDRESS_264262], we will keep a log to provide information about all AEs in annual progress 
reports to the IRB and NIH. Drs. Salvy and de la  Haye will monitor outcomes for AEs, and outcome information 
will be entered into a log for inclusion in reports to the IRB and NIH.  
Social risks . There are no social risks for participating in this study.  
Legal/other risks . None.  
Postpartum depression. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)[ADDRESS_264263]. Round oversees the physical and psychosocial safety and well -being of families 
enrolled in home visiting services.  The decision to i nclude/exclude mothers with postpartum depression will be 
taken on a case -by-case basis with the counsel of one of the PI ([CONTACT_219980], Psychologist), Antelope Valley 
Partners for Health directors, the Safety Officer ([CONTACT_219981], DO) and our CAB  (which includes mental health 
professionals and [CONTACT_219982], MD) . We believe that some mothers may benefit from engaging in positive 
and reinforcing activities such as cooking and lifestyle activities. Physical activity has been shown to improve 
moods and alleviate symptoms of depression.  
Trauma and domestic violence . If we suspect that mothers are victims of intimate partner violence, either 
through completion of the questionnaires or through mother report or staff observation, we will implement the 
following procedures: (1) we will make mothers aware of resources av ailable to them in their communities, such 
as shelters; (2) we will work with mothers to develop a safety plan for addressing violence and seeking shelter; 
(3) we will ascertain risk to the child. If we suspect that the child ha s been abused or witnessed domestic violence, 
we will make a report to child protective services. We will work closely with the home visitor and our HVP partner 
to coordinate efforts in the best interests of the mother and child. Mothers who are victims of  domestic violence 
will not be dropped from the study.  
17 
 Suicidal behavior.  As we will be measuring depression in mothers, we will potentially identify participants 
who are suicidal. We follow the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAFE -T: Suicide 
Assessment Five -Step Evaluation and Triage approach to deter mining risk and clinical response. The five steps 
are Identify Risk Factors, Identify Protective Factors, Conduct Suicide Inquiry, Determine Risk Level/Intervention, 
and Document (which includes intervention and follow -up).  As per Practice Guidelines, we will estimate suicide 
risk as Low, Moderate, or High. All potentially suicidal mothers will be provided an emergency plan with numbers 
to call, including local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219934], suicide hotlines, and home visitor contacts. Each plan will be 
individ ually tailored to the needs and resources of the mother. Family members will be incorporated into the plan. 
We will be available to home visitors and our HVP partner to work with them as to how to proceed if their clients 
present with suicidal behavior. Ho me visitors also have ready access to supervisors in their agencies to help 
them respond to mental health needs, and some of the agencies run separate mental health programs, thereby 
[CONTACT_219968]. Mothers who experience 
psychiatric emergencies such as suicidal behavior will not be dropped from the study.  
Alternative treatments . Parents who do not want to receive the nutrition and physical activity module (i.e., 
COPE), will receive the standard home visitation program curricula.  
 
C. Recruitment and Retention  
Participant recruitment.  Low-income mothers and their infants (N= 300, for a final effective sample of 200) 
will be participants in the study. Active participants will be low-income mothers  and their infants ( 6mo-old at 
enrollment) drawn from mothers who are enrolled in HVP services at the Healthy Families America site/chapter in 
Antelope Valle y, CA. Home visitors providing the  HVP services will introduce the study to mothers , and study 
Assessment Workers will  obtain written consent. Home visitors will clarify with mothers that their refusal to participate 
in the study is not affecting the services they provide. In our experience from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_93553], families feel 
comfor table to refuse if they do not wish to participate. Of note, 90% of families receiving Healthy Families America  
HVP services choose to enroll in enhancement studies when offered (i.e., when a module is added to the core 
curriculum and evaluated). These rates are consistent with our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732].  
Inclusion/ exclusion criteria. Participants will be ineligible if either parent and/or child have a Dx of eating 
disorders (e.g., Anorexia Nervosa), Schizophrenia or Obesity -related syndrome (e.g., Prader Willi) . Participants 
enrolled in a weight -loss program will be ineligible.   
Retention . Using conservative estimates, we anticipate that 25% of mothers enrolled will drop out of home 
visiting services over the 12-month study.  Consequently, we will oversample at enrollment (N= 300) to ensure an 
effective sample of [ADDRESS_264264] learned a great deal about retaining mothers through our 
prior pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]. We attribute retention in part to our persistent efforts and abilities of the HVP home visitors, 
but also believe that there are unique features of home visited mothers that facilitate retention in a research 
study. For example, many of these mothers are socially isolated, and opportun ities to exchange with their home 
visitor can be highly rewarding for mothers . We will use multiple strategies to retain the sample over the 
12months of the implementation and assessments. We will rely on approaches widely used in studies of high -
risk populations: (1) a gift card in the amount of $25 at each data collection, with all incentives paid after each 
assessment/data collection  regardless of whether they complete the study ; (2) frequent contact [CONTACT_219969]; (3) quarterly newsletters to update participants about study activ ities; (4) acknowledging birthdays; (5) 
participants are given a reminder phone call the day before the weekly visits and assessment sessions (or on 
Fridays for Monday assessment sessions).  
Informed consent procedure . Informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_19821], will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_219970]. All mothers that 
are enrolled in HFA’s HVP services by [CONTACT_219971]’s Bureau  will receive a 
detailed explanation of the protocol, including any potential benefits and risks (in English or Spanish). Mothers 
will be required to sign the consent form (in Spanish or English) and provide consent for their infants. Only 
participants from whom consent is obtained will be involved in the study. Signed consents will be kept in the 
participants’ files in locked filing cabinets. Each participant will receive a copy.  
Waiver . No waiver or modification of consent is being requested from the IRB.  
 
D. Protection Against Risk  
 
 Safety reviews . The PIs will review the safety and progress of this study on a monthly basis. The PIs and 
the IRB s will review this protocol on a continuing basis for subject safety and include results of the review in the 
annual progress reports submitted to NIH. The annual reports will include a list of adverse events and address: 
1) whether adverse event rates are consistent with pre -study assumptions; 2) reasons for dropouts from the 
18 
 study; 3) whether all participants met entry criteria; and 4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the 
basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study.  
It is also important to note that Healthy Families America home visitors are  expertly trained and experienced 
in handling situations they encounter while working with at -risk families. All home visitors receive extensive 
training in cultural competency, substance abuse, reporting child abuse, domestic violence, drug -exposed infants  
and children , and linkage to services in their community. Home visiting  staff further receive intensive training 
specific to their role (i.e., assessment, home visitation, identifying at -risk families, completing standardized 
assessments, phlebotomy, mental health  referrals, promoting preventive health care, securing medical homes , 
immunizations, utilizing creative outreach efforts, establishing and maintaining trust with families, building upon 
family strengths, developi[INVESTIGATOR_219935], determining the safety of the home, teaching parent -
child interaction, manag ing crisis situations, etc.).  Staff further receive weekly supervision, ongoing 
developmental training, and have limited caseloads (10 -15 families) to meet families’ needs.  
 
Monitoring plan.  The study’s data safety and monitoring plan will entail several components, overseen 
Principal Investigators (Drs. Salvy and de la Haye):  
1. All University of Southern [LOCATION_004] (USC) and University of Alabama at Birmingham IRB policies and 
continuous reporting requirements  will be followed in conducting the proposed study.  Any actions taken by 
[CONTACT_219972].    
2. The PIs will implement and monitor procedures to ensure that each mother provides informed consent  and 
that all data remains confidential . This will also include a rigorous data management protocol to optimize 
data entry, accuracy/checking, and retrieval. Data will be stored in password -protected files accessible only 
to the investigators and staff under their supervision. In the database, only an ID code number will identify 
subjects. A list linking names and other identifiers with their ID codes will be s tored in a separate file with a 
separate password. All original paper surveys and case report forms will be stored in locked file cabinets. 
The PIs will review all data collection forms for completeness and accuracy of the data and for protocol 
compliance.  In the case of a breach of confidentiality or other adverse event, the Principal Investigators will 
report the event to the IRB and the appropriate NIH officials, and appropriate procedural changes will be 
implemented to prevent future breaches or adverse  events.  
3. An internal committee  comprised of the projects’ Principal Investigators (Dr. de la Haye will serve as the chair 
of the committee and [CONTACT_219980] will act as clinical training and supervisor chair) and the On -Site Project 
Director (Michelle Kiefer at Antelope Valley Partners for Health) will meet quarterly to assess: participant 
recruitment, accrual, and retention; data quality and timeliness; participant risk versus benefit; and the 
development of external conditions that could potentially affect the study.   Significant problems or adverse 
events will be reported immediately to the USC and UAB IRBs, NIH, or FDA (if relevant).    
4. As part of their training for the study, all personnel who will interact with subjects will receive instruction in 
the completion of an  adverse event reporting form . In response to any adverse event, these forms will be 
completed promptly and returned to the corresponding study team supervisor, who in turn will report the 
information to the Principal Investigators.    
5. An external Data Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB), not connected to USC, UAB or the research project, will 
convene twice annually, via teleconference, to review the progress of the study, ensure adequate recruitment 
of minority subjects, and to monitor safety concerns.   Key members of the research  team will co -participate 
in the conference calls.   The DSMB will consist of five to -be-named individuals from outside USC:  (1) a home 
visitation program consumer (parent, most likely a mother) (2) a child services a dvocate; (3) a layperson; (4) 
a home visitation program stakeholder ; (5) a health disparities researcher and (6) a mental health 
professional.  The DSMB will meet by [CONTACT_219973]’s [ADDRESS_264265] 
implementation for resolution with investigators.  
 
Additional protections for pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates involved in research . This 
study involv es parents and their infants ( 6mo at enrollment). This research does not involve women who are 
pregnant. If a mother becomes pregnant during the study, she will continue to receive HVP services, but she will 
not be involved in the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_264266] to the individual and society greatly outweigh the risks.  
 
Importance of the knowledge to be gained.  HVPs serve at -risk families, including low socioeconomic 
status (SES) and minority families, who are also at the highest risk of obesity. HVPs currently address multiple 
areas of mother and child health and development ,71,72,74,75,[ADDRESS_264267], including the adoption of 
healthier behaviors for mothers and their infants, healthier growth trajectories for children at high -risk for 
overweight/obesity, and the evaluation of a model for obesity prevention through ex isting home visitation 
programs, outweigh the risks.  
 
E. ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
The project will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov  no later than [ADDRESS_264268] is enrolled. Reporting 
of summary results information (including adverse events) will be reported no later than 1 year after the 
completion date. The ClinicalTrials.gov  registry number (also known as NCT number), brief lay public title, and 
a certification that all required submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov  were completed will be provided in progress 
reports.  The PIs ([CONTACT_219980] at UAB and de la Haye at USC) will assume responsibility for these aspects of the 
trial.  
  
[ADDRESS_264269]. Salvy (MPI) has been 
trained in Pediatric and Child Psychology and she has been a member of the children’s Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) for several years at the Women and Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219933], NY. She will ensure the quality 
of the treatm ent implementation. The involvement of minors as participants in this research is in compliance with 
all subparts of 45 CFR Part 46 as well as with Federal laws and regul ations.  
 
 
21 
 INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES  
Women are represented by [CONTACT_219964], which will be about half of the infant sample. Based on 
our projected effective sample of 200 mothers and their infants (N= 400), we anticipate that 75% of our sample 
will be women ( 100 infants/children + 200 mothers = 300). The families enrolled in the Home Visiting Program 
(HVP) from which the sample will be drawn is diverse, reflecting the population of low -income families enrolled 
in home visiting services in the Antelope Valley, CA area. Based on our HVP partner ( two Healthy Families 
America site s in Southern [LOCATION_004]: Antelope Valley Partners for Health  and Children’s Bureau ) clients’ 
demographics and on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we anticipate the following ethnic and racial distribution: 70% Hispanic/ 
Latino, 13% African American, 8% White, 5% American Indian/Alaskan, and 4% mixed/other race. It is important 
to note that Health Families America  (HFA)  home visitors are matched to families based on language and cultural 
background. Home visitors are rigorously trained to understand, acknowledge, and respect families’ cultural 
differences. Home visitors are selected because of their personal characteristics (i.e. non -judgmental, 
compassionate, ability to establish a trusting relationship, etc.), their experience working with culturally diverse 
communities, and their skills to do the job.

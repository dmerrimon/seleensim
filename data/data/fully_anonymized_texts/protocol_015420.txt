5.[ADDRESS_867597] common metabolic disorder in the [LOCATION_002] and it 
is estimated that approximately 19% of women and 4% of men over the age [ADDRESS_867598] annual medical costs are estimated to be approximately 
17 to 20 billion dollars in the [LOCATION_002] alone [1]. Therefore, i t is important to 
accurately identify those at high risk.   
 
The present gold standa rd to diagnose osteoporosis is the Dual -energy X -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA scan) [2] with a diagnosis based on a T -score of -2.[ADDRESS_867599], accurate 
reference ranges for age and demographic groups that result in missing large 
groups of people at risk for osteoporosis. The Fracture Risk  Assessment Tool 
(FRAX score) is one tool that identifies those at higher risk of fracture that may 
benefit from therapy [3]. It was designed and released in 2008 and has been a 
great asset in clinical practice in stratifying risk and guiding management of  
osteopenic  patients. However, FRAX may miss many individuals that may benefit 
from therapy due to its limited inclusion criteria [4].  
   
Bone markers have been shown to predict fracture risk in postmenopausal women 
independent of bone mineral density  and may help identify high risk 
individuals . Amino -terminal cross -linking telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) 
reflects osteoclastic bone resorption. NTX can be measured in both the serum and 
in urine.  
 
The accuracy of the serum NTX is unclear. It may be les s sensitive than urine NTX 
in detecting bone density changes [5]. The urine NTX overcomes circadian rhythm 
changes to bone density and is less sensitive to dietary collagen intake [6,7]. At 
present, urine markers need to be checked as a second void of the day which may 
be cumbersome for patients.  Serum levels drawn with other bone labs would be

approval and patient informed consent. Enrollment will include patients diagnosed 
with osteopenia on DEXA scan who have not been on any medical therapy in the

 Statistical Analyses  
Pearson or Spearman correlations will be used to measure the association 
between serum and urine markers. Similar correlation measures will be used to 
measure associations with DEXA scan results, and Comparisons of the 
correlations were performed using the cocor package in R software (version 4.0; 
Title: A comparison of Serum and Urine Bone Marker     
IRB #    Revision:  01 Page 10 of 13 
Vienna, Austria) using the methods by [INVESTIGATOR_89053], Rosenthal, and Rubin (1992)  to 
compare the correlations and calculate 95% confidence intervals for their 
difference.   As an exploratory analysis, associations between serum and urine 
levels with fracture risk will be evaluated using two -sample t -tests and, if feasible, 
ROC analyses will be used to compare the predictive ability of each marker.   If the 
number of fractures is small, this analysis will not be performed.   If the follow -up 
through [ADDRESS_867603] a moderate 
correlation (r=0.5) between serum and urine levels.   With 40 patients, there will be 
90% power to detect moderate correlations based on a two -sided test of the 
Fisher’s Z test of the Pearson correlation  (Image 1) .  Power calculations were 
performed using SAS software (version 9.4; Cary, NC). (8)   
 
6.0   DATA MANAGEMENT  
The Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for ensuring that all data are 
submitted in a timely fashion.  

Title: A comparison of Serum and Urine Bone Marker     
IRB #    Revision:  [ADDRESS_867604] of the study, if a question regarding the da ta arises, the 
Monitor and/or Delegate will work with the site to resolve the issue. All 
communications will be documented in a query via the electronic database.  
7.0   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
Unanticipated Non -Serious Adverse Event Reporting:  
Unanticipated n on-serious adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_647816], or related to, the study procedures, will also be reported using the 
Adverse Event Report form.   
 
The following adverse events are anticipated as a result of the blood collection 
required per the study procedures:  pain, bruising, bleeding or infection at the site 
where the blood was collected from the subject.  Fainting may also occur as a 
result of blood collection. Because these events are anticipated, they do NOT need 
to be reported  using the Adverse Event Report form as long as they are not 
assessed as serious . If assessed as serious, then they need to be reported.  
 Date of Awareness  
A test site becomes aware of an MDR reportable event when medical personnel 
who are employed by [CONTACT_647823] a reportable event has occurred.  
Medical personnel include persons who are licensed, registered, or certified to 
administer healthcare, who have received a d iploma or a degree in a professional 
or scientific discipline, or who are responsible for receiving medical complaints or 
adverse event reports or who supervise such persons.

1. Background and Objectives - Describe the purpose of the study. Describe any past studies that are related 
to this study (short literature review).  
 
Quadriceps muscle dysfunction persists for years after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).9  Restoring 
quadriceps function after ACLR  is critical as quadriceps performance is related to better self -reported function, reduced 
risk of reinjury, and better movement patterns.4,5,10,12 –14  Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_340549] (CSE) persist after ACLR, and these alterations are related to poor quad riceps performance (i.e. less strength 
and slower rate of torque development (RTD)).3,7,[ADDRESS_1069575] -operative rehabilitation (Zarzyc ki, in review, 
JOR; Zarzycki, in review, JOSPT).  More specifically, patients after ACLR demonstrated reduced thresholds and altered 
excitability, which suggests that the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_778598] a higher recruitment threshold with potentially steep 
activat ion curves. Reduced thresholds and steeper recruitment curves may limit a more graded activation of the 
quadriceps necessary for functional movement and stability. The fact that the alterations in CSE did not change from [ADDRESS_1069576] current stimulation (tDCS) increases short -term CSE and isometric strength in healthy 
participants and stroke surviviors.6,16,17 In the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], tDCS will be used as an intervention to determine its 
effects on CSE and quadriceps muscle performance in patients recovering from ACLR.  We will incorporate two measures 
of quadriceps performance, isometric strength and rate of torque development (RTD) as both measures are altered and 
related to functional outcomes after ACLR.  However, to the best of my knowledge, no studies have determined the 
effectiveness of tDCS on CSE and quadriceps performance in patients after ACLR, an d no studies to date have evaluated 
the relationship between multiple measures of quadriceps performance and CSE in patients after ACLR. Evaluating new 
interventions with potential to mitigate alterations in CSE (i.e. active motor thresholds (AMT) and slop e of the 
recruitment curve (SLOPE)) and quadriceps muscle performance (i.e. isometric strength and RTD) in patients recovering 
from ACLR are critical to improving outcomes in this population. Therefore, the aims of this study are to:  
 
Aim 1 : Determine the effects of a single session of tDCS on two measures of CSE and two measures of quadriceps 
performance in patients after ACLR.  
Hypothesis 2.1: Patients after ACLR will demonstrate increased CSE (lower AMTs and steeper SLOPEs) after one session 
of active tDC S and no changes in CSE after placebo tDCS.  
Hypothesis 2.2: Patients after ACLR will demonstrate greater RTD/isometric strength after one session of active tDCS 
and no changes in RTD/isometric strength after placebo tDCS.   
 
Aim2 : Determine the relationshi p between two measures of CSE and two measures of quadriceps muscle performance in 
patients after ACLR.  
Hypothesis 1.1: Greater CSE will be associated with greater quadriceps isometric strength and greater RTD.  
Hypothesis 1.2: The correlation between CSE and RTD will be greater than the correlation between CSE and isometric 
strength.   
 
Current outcomes following ACLR are less than optimal with patients demonstrating chronic quadriceps dysfunction 
related to altered movement patterns and the development of  post-traumatic knee OA.  Emerging evidence suggests that 
quadriceps dysfunction after ACLR is related to alterations in CSE. Therefore, interventions targeting CSE have the

potential to mitigate chronic quadriceps dysfunction, improve movement patterns, a nd improve outcomes. The proposed 
study is a logical and essential first step in determining the effect of tDCS, an intervention known to induce changes in 
excitability, on CSE and quadriceps performance in patients after ACLR.  Upon completion of this stu dy, I will have 
obtained the pi[INVESTIGATOR_778599] a larger grant to investigate the effects of multiple sessions of tDCS on CSE 
and quadriceps muscle performance, generating the evidence needed to introduce this intervention into the clinical 
practice.

8. Procedures Involved -  Describe procedure s including:   
 
Procedures  
This study will consist of two collections separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1069579] current stimulation (tDCS).  The primary investigator ( Ryan Zarzycki) will collect all data.  
Doctoral students will assist data collection.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_778608].   
 
Individuals <18 years old will only complete strength testing and questionnaires at one testing session.   
 
Demographic Data  
Each participant will be asked to self -report their leg and hand dominance, describe sport participation, date of 
birth, age, height, weight, and sex.   
 
Central Nervous System testing  
Cortical excitability (via TMS) and cortical activation (via fNIRS) will be evaluated during 2 different tasks: 1) 
While seated in a dynamometer (strength testing device)  and activating their quadriceps muscle at 5% of their 
maximal torque, and 2) during a single limb stance position.  Participants will be secured into a h arness system 
during the single limb stance task to prevent loss of balance.  See next 2 sections for spec ific TMS and f NIRS 
procedures.  Participants < 18 years old will not undergo TMS testing .  A separate consent form has been created 
for participants < 18 years excluding the TMS procedure.   
 
TMS testing  
TMS will be delivered using a MagStim 200 Stimulator with a double circular coil (Magstim Ltd, Wales, [LOCATION_006]). All 
TMS testing procedures will b e performed for both hemispheres  and during both of the tasks mentioned above .  
Electrical activity from multiple lower extremity muscles will be collected using surface EMG electrodes placed 
on the skin.  One or more of the following muscle groups will be  collected: quadriceps, hamstrings, triceps surae.  
Subjects will wear a closely fitting cap. First, the site on the scalp where a TMS pulse of ~50% maximum 
stimulator output produces the greatest muscle response (hotspot) will be identified.  The active m otor threshold

(AMT) will be determined by [CONTACT_778615] 5/10 motor 
evoked potentials that exceed 100 µV.  Patients will be activating the target muscle at 5%  their MVIC during each 
pulse by [CONTACT_26777] v isual feedback of their force.  After determining the AMT, 10  pulses at int ensities between 
80% AMT a nd 14 0% AMT  (at 10% intervals)  will be delivered.  
 
Each time the stimulus intensity is changed, a test stimulus will be triggered away from the participant to ensure 
the correct intensity and that no noise is present in the EMG signal.   
 
Strength testing  
Testing will take place in the Exercise Testing Lab  (Room 109 , Health Sciences Building).  Strength testing will 
consist of maximal voluntary contractions of the quadriceps muscles of both legs.  This testing is performed 
routinely during physical therapy for individuals with knee pathology.  Participants  will be seated upright in a 
dynamometer  (HUMAC N ORM) , a device that secures their pelvis and limbs and resists the patient’s attempt to 
straighten the knee from [ADDRESS_1069580] the arm of the dynamometer to calculate their maximum volitional isometric contraction (MVIC).  The 
amount of force/torque produced will then be recorded.  Prior to the  MVICs , a series of three sub -maximal 
practice trials will be performed to familiarize e ach participant with the task . Three MVICs will then be 
performed and recorded for analysis .  Two additional (one warm up and one test set) sets of five repetitions will 
be performed to test both quadriceps and hamstring strength through the patients full available range or motion.   
 
Questionnaires  
Multiple questionnaires  will be administered to examine pain, knee function, emotions and fear of reinjury, and 
activity level.  See appendix B . 
 
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)  
a-tDCS (Soterix 1x1, Soterix Medical Inc, NY, NY) will be delivered over the primary motor cortex 
contralateral to the surgical limb (i.e. hot spot for the vastus medialis muscle representation found 
during TMS testing).  A pair of carbon electrodes placed in saline -soake d sponges (surface area: 5 x 7 
cm2) will be secured to the scalp using straps (Soterix EASYstrap).  The anode will be centered over the 
hotspot while the cathode will be placed on the right supraorbital area.  a -tDCS will be administered 
while the particip ant rides a stationary bike for [ADDRESS_1069581] 5 minutes will 
serve as a warmup with the patient maintaining a rate of perceived exe rtion (RPE) of light or 1 out of 
10.  Over the next 10 minutes, the resistance will be increased to maintain a RPE of moderate or 3/10.  
The last 5 minutes will serve as a cool down at the same intensity/resistance as the warm up.  Active a -
tDCS will be ap plied at an intensity of 2mA with a [ADDRESS_1069582] 30 seconds.   
 
 
Data Analysis  
Independent t -tests will be used to examine demo graphic differences between the two groups.  A 2 (limb) x 2 
(group) ANOVA will be used to evaluate differences in strength, TMS, and fNIRS measures.  Regression analyses 
will be used to determine the relationship between the CNS measures and quadriceps str ength, and the 
relationship between the TMS and fNIRS measures.  
                                      Institutional Review Board (IRB)

9. Compensation or Credit - Describe the amount and timing of any compensation or credit to participants.  
Identify the source of the funds to compensate participants  
 
Each participant (≥18 years of age) will be paid $[ADDRESS_1069583] 
complete both sessions to  receive the compensation.  
 
Each participant (<18 years of age) will receive $[ADDRESS_1069584] the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, or inconveniences related to 
participation in t he research. Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.  
 
Risks associated with Testing Procedures  (TMS, strength testing ) 
 
There are no known long term risks of TMS.  There is a very small risk of seizure, syncope, and change in 
auditory thresholds.  A recent study examining adverse events of TMS concluded: “Our data suggest that 
single/paired -pulse and repetitive TMS, conducted within the published guidelines pose a very small increment 
over the background risks of everyday life to subjects without known risk factors.”8 Screening potential 
participants for a prior history of seizures, syncope, and hearing impairments will allow us to exclude individuals  
at increased risk.  Participants with be offered ear plugs if the sound from the TMS pulse is uncomfortable.   
 
In the very unlikely event of a seizure, the following steps will be taken:  1) The participant will be positioned in 
the safest position to ma intain an open airway (i.e. laying supi[INVESTIGATOR_778609]), 2) emergency personal will be 
contact[CONTACT_778616] 911  (research assistant) , 3) any objects will be moved away from the participant to prevent 
additional injury, 4) monitor vitals until emergency pe rsonal arrive.   
 
Most subjects report no discomfort from TMS although some do report mild discomfort over the site of 
stimulation.  Some subjects report a mild headache following the procedure.  This typi[INVESTIGATOR_36065] 24 
hours and can be treated with over the count er analgesics (i.e. Tylenol, ibuprofen).  If subjects do experience 
discomfort over the stimulation site, the intensity of the stimulator can be reduced to minimize this.  The session 
will be terminated immediately if the subject reports discomfort that is  beyond their tolerance.  Subjects may 
experience mild muscle soreness [ADDRESS_1069585] current stimulation (tDCS)  
 
TDCS have been used in a growing number of laboratories worldwide since 1985. In the present protocol, only a 
non-significant risk protocol is being employed by [CONTACT_778617]. TDCS is very safe and there have been very few 
incidences of adverse events with tDCS.  A recent meta -analysis of adverse effects associated with tDCS reviewed 
209 experiments (3836 subjects).11  The main adverse events were itching, tingling, headache, discomfort, and 
burning sensation.  Poreisz et al summarized findings from 567 sessions involving 102 participants to 
demonstrate that adverse effects were  quite minor in severity .2 For example, mean ratings of itching during 
stimulation were 1.6 out of 5. Similar ratings were given for tingl ing (1.74), burning (1.59), headache (1.4), pain 
(1.41), difficulties in concentrating (1.73), nervousness (1.0), and unpleasant sensation (1.24). The highest rated 
adverse effect was fatigue (2.17), although the authors note that this factor was likely in fluenced by [CONTACT_778618].  
 
 There is a strong evidence that tDCS is extremely safe. A recent review reported that “To date, based on over a 
total 33,[ADDRESS_1069586] (IRB)                                                                                        
                         Application for Expedited/ Full Board Review   
 
  
 
irreversible injury produced by [CONTACT_778619] a wide range of stimulation parameters (≤40 
min, ≤4 mA, ≤7.2 C).”1 In our protocol, the dose of tDCS is significantly below the dose  (≤2mA, 20 min)  
described here. An even more recent systematic review (2018)  concluded that “Little evidence was found to 
suggest that repeat ed sessions of active tDCS poses  increased risk t o participants compared to sham tDCS within  
the limits  of parameters used to date.”[ADDRESS_1069587] appropriate 
measures to ensure participant safety and comfort. If there is any discomfort during the tDCS procedure, we will 
double -check our electr odes and machine settings. In case of a headache/neck pain after tDCS, the participant 
will be advised to take an over -the-counter pain medication. In an unlikely event of skin burn, participant will be 
referred/ directed to a physician for medical managem ent. Patient and/or his/her medical insurance will pay for 
the care. This will be made clear in the informed consent.  
 
We will assess any discomfort or adverse event before, during or after tDCS in patients and age -matched 
controls. We do not anticipate any major adverse events. Only minor discomfort in less than 5% of subjects 
undergoing tDCS experience is transient headaches or soreness at the site of stimulation.  These side -effects are 
believed to be due to stimulation of muscles and nerves near the stimulating coil. During and following every 
tDCS session, we will ask the participant about any incidence of headache. If the participant complains of any 
discomfort or pain during the tDCS session, the session will be terminated at once. Participants wil l be informed 
that if they should feel a tingling sensation below the electrodes. If they feel any other uncomfortable sensation 
such as burning, they should inform the investigators.  If the participant informs us of uncomfortable sensation, 
we will ensur e electrode/machine settings are correct. If the uncomfortable sensation continues, we will stop the 
procedure.  
 
In order  to ensure participant safety  following the session , we will use the questionnaire proposed by [CONTACT_778620]. [ADDRESS_1069588] any adverse effects, and follow -up with participants the day after each 
session if they report scores of 3 (moderate) or 4 (severe) for any of the symptoms or side effects.[ADDRESS_1069589] (4) will be withdrawn from the study.    
 
Risks associated with stationary bike riding  
 
There is very minimal risk involved with  stationary bike riding in our population o f athletic individuals.  
Additionally, stationary bike riding is part of standard physical therapy early (prior to [ADDRESS_1069590] time that we would recruit a participant) after ACLR. During the in tervention (stationary bike with 
tDCS), participant tolerance will be assessed subjectively (rating of perceived exertion, symptoms) at regular 
intervals, and the exercise will be terminated if signs or symptoms indicate poor tolerance.  In addition, the 
protocol will include warm -up and cool down phases to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal injury. If required, 
the participants will be provided with water before, during or after the exercise.    
 
 
 
11. Potential Benefits to Participants - Realistically descr ibe the potential benefits that individual participants 
may experience from taking part in the research. Indicate if there is no direct benefit. Do not include 
benefits to society or others.  
 
Results  of the strength test will be provided to participants in  both groups.  The results of the strength test will 
benefit participants in the ACLR group as the  findings indicate whether additional strengthening is required  and 
if progression into the next stage of rehabilitation is warranted .  The results do not provide any benefits to 
participants in the uninjured  group.

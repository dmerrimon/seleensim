Objective  The objective of this trial  is to evaluate safety of 3-month dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in subjects at high risk of bleeding 
(HBR) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with 
XIENCE.  
 
Primary Objective:  to show non- inferiority of the primary endpoint 
of all death or all MI (modified ARC) from 3 to 12 months following 
XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects treated with  3-month DAPT 
compared to a historical control after propensity score adjustment.   
Secondary Objective:   
• To show superi ority of the major secondary endpoint of major 
bleeding ( Bleeding Academic Research Consortium [BARC] 
type 2-5) from 3 to 12 months following XIENCE implantation 
in HBR subjects treated with 3 -month DAPT  compared to a 
historical control after propensity sc ore adjustment.  
• To evaluate stent thrombosis  (ARC definite/probable) from [ADDRESS_921670]  a performance goal (PG) . 
Targeted Number 
of Subjects  Approximately 2,[ADDRESS_921671] 50% of subjects in the [LOCATION_002]. Subject 
registration is capped at 300 per site.  
Clinical Trial 
Design  A prospective, single arm, multi -center, open label, non -randomized 
trial to evaluate the safety of 3- month  DAPT in HBR subjects 
undergoing PCI with XIENCE.  
Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is a composite rate of all death or all 
myocardial infarction (modified 4Academic Res earch Consortium 
[ARC] ) from 3 to 12  months. 
Major  Secondary 
Endpoints  • Major bleeding rate  (BARC type 2 -5) from 3 to 12  months.  
• Stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) from 3 to 12 months  
Secondary 
Endpoints  The following endpoints will be assessed from 3 to 12  months:  
• All death, cardiac death, vascular death, non-cardiovascular death  
 
 
   
4 Patients present any of the following clinical or imaging evidence of ischemia ( symptoms of ischemia;  ECG 
changes  indicative of new ischemia -  [new ST -T changes or new LBBB],  development of pathological Q 
waves;  or  imaging evidence of a new loss of  viable myocardium or a new regional wa ll  motion abnormality), 
AND confirmed with elevated cardiac biomarkers  per ARC criteria  (periprocedural MI: CK -MB > 3x URL or 
Troponin > 3x URL within 48 hours after PCI; CK- MB > 5x URL or Troponin > 5x URL within 72 hours after 
CABG; Assessment of CK -MB is preferred over troponin for the diagnosis of periprocedural MI, if possible. 
For spontaneous MI:  CK-MB > URL or Troponin > URL) (Circulation 2007; 116: 2344 -2351)   
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #16 -308-Redacted   
May 25, 2018   
 
 
• All myocardial infarction (MI) and MI attributed to target vessel 
(TV-MI, modified ARC)  
• Composite of cardiac death or MI (modified ARC)  
• All stroke, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke  
• Clinically -indicated target lesion revascularization (CI -TLR)  
• Clinically -indicated  target vessel revascularization ( CI-TVR)  
• Target lesion failure (TLF, composite of cardiac death, TV -MI 
and CI -TLR)  
• Target vessel failure (TVF, composite of cardiac death, TV -MI 
and CI- TVR)  
• Major b leeding defined by [CONTACT_196552] (BARC) type [ADDRESS_921672] index procedure, upon confirmation 
of the following:  
• Signed informed consent has been obtained;  
• Subject has met all the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria (including both general and angiographic criteria).  
Planned staged procedures are allowed (recommend to be performed 
within 30 days). The site may consent the subject after the initial procedure. Subject registration will occur once the last staged procedure is performed and the last staged procedure is considered as the index procedure.  
Subject Follow -
Up Subjects registered in the trial will receive the following clinical 
follow -up: 
• 3 months (90 ±  7 days): office visit (Note: A formal office visit is 
required at 3- month follow -up to ensure a thorough clinical 
evaluation. A telephone contact [CONTACT_680914]-up due to being unable to 
complete an office visit, but a formal follow- up visit is still 
preferred at 3 months. ) 
• 6 months (180 ±  14 days): office visit/ telephone contact  (office 
visit is strongly recommended whenever possible) 
• 12 months (365 ±  28 days): office visit/ telephone contact  (office 
visit is strongly recommended whenever possible)  
Primary Analysis 
Sample Size Justification  To evaluate the safety of the 3 -month DAPT, non-inferiority (NI)  
will be tested comparing  3-month DAPT to XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] 
historical control for the primary  endpoint of all death or all 
myocardial infarction (modified ARC) from 3 - to 12- month follow -
up in a “3 -month clear” population (defined as subjects who are free 
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #16 -308-Redacted   
May 25, 2018   
 
 
from myocardial infarction [modified ARC], repeat coronary 
revascularization, stroke, or sten t thrombosis [ARC 
definite/probable] within 3 months (prior to [ADDRESS_921673] 
90 days) after stenting AND have been compliant with 3 -month 
DAPT without interruption of either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor 
inhibitor for > 7 consecutive days).  
This analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_680915]: 
 
• True event rate for the primary endpoint is assumed to be 
approximately 6.1% for both arms  
• One-sided alpha = 0.025 
• Attrition rate of 15% due to using “3-month clear” population for 
the XIENCE 90 3-month DAPT arm  
• Sample size: ~2,000 for the XIENCE 90 3-month DAPT arm and 
~1,150 for the XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] control arm  
• Non-inferiority margin = 2.8% 
• Approximately 87% power   
Major  Secondary 
Analysis  Given the success of the primary analysis for the primary endpoint, 
the following major secondary analyses will be performed:  
• Superiority test for major  bleeding rate ( BARC type 2 -5) from 3 - 
to 12- month follow -up will be tested between  XIENCE 90  and 
the XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical control stratified by [CONTACT_680916]. 
 
• Stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) from 3- to 12-month 
follow -up of XIENCE [ADDRESS_921674]  a pre-
specified PG.   
 
Details of the above major secondary analyses could be found in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Antiplatelet 
Medication  Antiplatelet Medication Loading Dose:  
• Subjects must receive a loading dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_680896] a P2Y12 
inhibitor (Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], Prasugrel or Ticagrelor). The dosages of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] P2Y12 inhibitor shall be determined by [CONTACT_680917]. The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196510].  Per 
physician’s discretion, a loading dose of P2Y12 inhibitor may be 
omitted if the subject was on chronic usage for ≥ 7 days .   
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #[ADDRESS_921675] -Procedure Daily Dose:  
• All subjects must receive ≥75 to ≤[ADDRESS_921676] maintain a minimum of 
75 mg of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196511] 5 or 10 mg of prasugrel daily ([ADDRESS_921677] subjects*) or [ADDRESS_921678] 3 months following the procedure.  
­ The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196512]. 
­ For subjects taking chronic anticoagulants, dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196513]) may be considered for the first 3 months after 
index procedure per investigator’s discretion .  
• At 3-month follow up, subject will be assessed for their 
eligibility of P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation. Eligible subjects 
will discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor and receive ≥75 to ≤100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196514] 1- year follow -up during the study if they 
are “3 -month clear”, defined as subjects who are  free from 
myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat coronary 
revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC 
definite/probable) within  3 months (prior to [ADDRESS_921679] 90 days)  after stenting AND have been compliant with 3-
month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without interruption of 
either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7 consecutive 
days.  
­ Peri-procedural MI  (occurred within [ADDRESS_921680] index 
procedure) without any clinical symptoms will not be 
considered exclusionary event for the definition of “3-
month clear”.  
­ Dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_680897]) within the first [ADDRESS_921681] 
index procedure for subjects w ho are on chronic 
anticoagulants is acceptable for the definition of “3 -
month clear”.  
• Subjects who are not “3-month clear” are NOT  eligible for 
P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation at 3-month. These subjec ts will 
be treated per the investigator's discretion an d will continue to be 
followed up through 12 months.  
*For prasugrel subjects < 60 kg in weight or ≥ 75 years of age, a 
maintenance dose of 5 mg per day for 12 months is allowable.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Trial Design  
XIENCE 90 study is a prospective, single arm, multi -center, open label trial to evaluate the 
safety of 3-month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in  subjects at high risk of bleeding (HBR) 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the approved XIENCE family of 
coronary drug- eluting stents . 
The XIENCE family stent systems include commercially approved5 XIENCE Xpedition 
Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System (EECSS),  XIENCE Alpi[INVESTIGATOR_680898], XIENCE 
PROX EECSS (OUS only)6, XIENCE PROA EECSS (OUS only)7, and XIENCE Sierra 
EECSS, which are all manufactured by [CONTACT_196551], Inc., Santa Clara, [LOCATION_003] .  The above 
XIENCE family stent systems will hereinafter be called “ XIENCE ” in this study.  
Approximately 2,[ADDRESS_921690] 5 0% of subjects in the [LOCATION_002] (US).  Study population consists of 
non-complex HBR subjects with up to three  native coronary artery lesions ( a maximum of 
two lesions per epi[INVESTIGATOR_196518] ) with reference vessel diameter between 2.25  mm and 4.25 
mm. Eligibility of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor discontinuation will be assessed at 3 -month 
follow -up. Subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat 
coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) within  3 
months (prior to 3-month visit but at least 90 days) after stenting AND have been compliant with 3 -month DAPT  without interruption of either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for 
> 7 consecutive days are considered as “3 -month clear”, and will discontinue P2Y12 receptor 
inhibitor and continued with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_680899] 3-month follow-up.   
All registere d subjects will be followed at 3, [ADDRESS_921691]-approval study to evaluate the safety  of XIENCE 
V EECSS in “all -comer” population under real-world setting.

Primary Objective:  to show non- inferiority of the primary endpoint of all death or all MI 
(modified ARC) from 3 to 12 months following XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects  
treated with  3-month DAPT compared to a historical control after propensity score 
adjustment.  
Secondary Objective:   
• To show superiority of the major secondary endpoint of major bleeding ( Bleeding 
Academic Research Consortium [BARC] type 2 -5) from 3 to 12 months following

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
2.1 Background and Rationale 
Although drug-eluting stents (DES) have been shown to effectively reduce restenosis 
compared with bare- metal stents (BMS), there was a concern that DES might lead to an 
increased risk of stent thrombosis based on data from first -generation DES1-4.  This increased 
risk has been attributed, in part, to polymer hypersensitivity reactions, delayed arterial healing, endothelial dysfunction, and late acquired stent malapposition.  Stent thrombosis generally will manifest in serious clinical outcomes of MI and/or death. As a result of this 
concern, the previous 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guidelines recommend a prolonged duration of DAPT, a continuation of at least 1 year of DAPT following DES implantation as compared to a minimum of 1 month of DAPT following BMS implantation for patients without acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS)
5.  However, these recommendations were based primarily on 
observational dat a with the first generation DES . Compared with first-generation DES, 
currently used second -generation DES have a lower risk of stent thrombosis. Data from five 
RCTs 6-10of primarily low -risk patients (non -ACS) treated with DES comparing shorter-
duration (3 to 6 months) DAPT with [ADDRESS_921693] recently published 2016 ACC/AHA guideline updated their 
recommendations to decrease the minimum DAPT duration from 12 months to 6 months after DES implantation in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD)
17. 
Long- term DAPT is known to increase the risk of bleeding. Multiple studies have 
demonstrated the relationship between bleeding and an increased risk for short- and long-term mortality
18,19, with major bleeding being identified as an independent predictor of 
mortality with a weight similar to o r event greater than MI20. This was confirmed in a recent 
meta -analysis by [CONTACT_196559] 12 trials comprising > 34,000 patients randomized to 
different duration strategies of DAPT21. In this meta -analysis (including patient level data of 
11,[ADDRESS_921694] trials), bleeding was an independent predictor of mortality occurring within 1 year of the bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (hazard ratio: 6.93; 95% CI: 4.53 to 10.60; p < 0.0001). More importantly, shorter DAPT was associated with low er rates of all -
cause mortality compared with longer DAPT, which was driven by [CONTACT_680918] -
related deaths with shorter DAPT duration. This important finding may underlie the potential mortality benefit with shorter DAPT, which is especially relevant for patients who are at high risk of bleeding  (HBR) . 
HBR patients represent approximately 15% or more of patients undergoing PCI
22,23.  This 
patient population is of a significant size but is usually excluded from traditional DES approval trials .   The traditional standard treatment for HBR patients who undergo 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is often stenting with BMS followed by 1 month of DAPT. While this strategy aims to minimize the risk of bleeding in  such patients, the use of 
BMS poses a higher risk of restenosis and re-intervention. Therefore, stenting with DES followed by a shortened course of DAPT may represent a more favourable treatment option providing that the potential risk of stent thrombosis  can be addressed.  With advances in stent 
technology, second-generation DES is equipped with novel stent materials and designs, 
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #[ADDRESS_921695], the European ESC/EACTS guidelines have recommended 3 months of DAPT with second-generation DES for HBR patients undergoing PCI
24.  Consistent with the European guideline, 
the updated 2016 ACC/AHA guideline also provided a class IIb recommendation of 3-month DAPT in SIHD patients with high risk of bleeding following DES implantation
17.  
The second generation everolimus- eluting stent (EES) has been the subject of extensive 
clinical studies across multiple geographies. A consistently low late and very late stent thrombosis rate has been demonstrated with EES from randomized controlled studi es 
25-[ADDRESS_921696]- and second-generation DES, including Cypher, Taxus, Endeavor, and Resolute, XIENCE V was also associated with significantly lower rates of definite stent thrombosis than BMS at both 1 year (odds ratio [OR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [ CI]: 
0.13-0.41) and 2 years (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0 .69), a result not duplicated by [CONTACT_680919].  The reduction in stent thrombosis with XIENCE V compared with BMS was apparent both early (0 -30 days) and late (31 days-1 year), suggesting the reduction was not caused by [CONTACT_680920] V and BMS as the reduction was already evident as early as 30 days when all patients should be treated with DAPT regardless of device types.    
Another recent large meta -analysis involving 106,427 patients from 126 RCTs was conducted 
to compare the safety and efficacy of these biodegradable polymer DES (BP -DES) with those 
of durable polymer DES and BMS
34.  Amo ng all the stents compared, XIENCE V was the 
safest with a lower risk of clinical events when compared to DES, including BP -DES and 
other first and second generation DES. Even when compared to BMS, XIENCE V was still 
associated with significant reductions in the rates of definite stent thrombosis (rate ratio: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.53), MI (rate ratio: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.75), and death (rate ratio: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.90).   
Even in the setting of elevated risk for thrombosis such as acute coronary syndrome, 
XIENCE V still demonstrated a favourable safety outcome as reported in the EXAMINATION trial, which was an all -comer trial randomizing 1,[ADDRESS_921697]-
segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a 1: 1 ratio to XIENCE V or BMS (Vision).  This study demonstrated that XIENCE V was associated with reduced rates of stent 
thrombosis compared with BMS at [ADDRESS_921698] 
comparable to that of BMS even in this high risk STEMI population. 
The excellent safety profile of XIENCE in terms of stent thrombosis is likely attributed to the 
unique combination of its thin struts (81 µ m), the thromboresistant nature of the 
biocompatible fluoropolymer37, and a low loading dose and release kinetics of the anti-
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #[ADDRESS_921699] 
complete coverage (90.4%) for EES compared with other stents at 14 days40.  The rapid strut 
coverage by [CONTACT_196560] V was confirmed in humans in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) cohort of the MECHANISM- Elective study
41, which showed 93.6% strut 
coverage at 1 month (N=49) and 98% strut coverage at 3 months (N= 46) in subjects with 
stable coronary artery disease receiving XIENCE V.   
The XIENCE family of stents is unique from other currently marketed stents in featuring a 
fluorinated co- polymer coating [poly (vinylidene fluoride -co-hexafluoropropylene)] (PVDF -
HFP). This polymer coating not only serves as the vehicle for the controlled elution of 
everolimus, but just as importantly the fluorinated co- polymer offers a non -thrombogenic 
surface through a mechanism known as fluoropassivation42. Pre-clinical models comparing 
inflammation and platelet adhesion among XIENCE V, BMS and Resolute showed that XIENCE V had a lower  propensity for inflammation and platelet adhesion
43,44.  In a series of 
ex vivo  studies using porcine ar terio-venous shunt model to assess and compare the 
thrombogenicity of XIENCE to different stent platforms, XIENCE showed a significant reduction in acute thrombus formation (measured as platelet adhesion) in comparison to BMS as well as new generation of bioresorbable polymer-coated stent (Synergy) and polymer- free 
stent (BioFreedom)
8. The high degree of stent coverage within 1 and 3 months of implant, 
together with the results of ex vivo  studies which consistently showed low thrombogenic 
potential of XIEN CE through the unique properties of its fluorinated co-polymer coating, 
provides further evidence to support the safety of shorter DAPT with XIENCE.   
Short- term DAPT has been recently studied in HBR patients. The ZEUS study is a 
randomized, single-blind trial evaluating Endeavor DES vs. BMS combined with a tailored 
course of DAPT for treating subjects who were considered uncertain DES candidates, 
including HBR patients, patients at high risk for thrombosis, and patients at low risk for restenosis
45.  A total of 1,606 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either Endeavor or 
thin-strut BMS (strut thickness < 100 µm).  DAPT duration was prescribed based on patient 
characteristics, rather than stent characteristics, and a personalized regimen of 1 -month 
DAPT was allowed.  The primary endpoint of the study was MACE (death, MI, or target vessel revascularization [ TVR] ) at 1 year.  In this s tudy, approximately half of the enrolled 
subjects were HBR patients (51.6%), who were  qualified for 1 -month DAPT. In the pre -
specified HBR subgroup analysis from ZEUS trial, MACE occurred in 22.6% of the Endeavor group and 29% of the BMS group with a hazard ratio 0.75 (p=0.033)
46.  The 
definite or probable ST was also significantly reduced in the Endeavor group (2.6% vs. 6.2%, p=0.016). 
The LEADERS FREE study is a randomized, double- blind trial evaluating BioFreedom 
combined with 1 month of DAPT for treating HBR patients undergoing PCI as compared to 
BMS
47.  A total of 2,466 HBR patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BioFreedom or a 
very similar BMS (Gazelle). All patients received 1 month of DAPT and were to be followed at 1, 2, and 4 months, and 1 and 2 years.  The primary safety endpoint, tested for both non-inferiority and superiority, was a composite of cardiac death, MI, or stent thrombosis

(definite/probable).  The primary effic acy endpoint was clinically driven target lesion 
revascularization (CD -TLR).  At 1 year, the rate of the composite of cardiac death, MI, or 
stent thrombosis was significantly lowered in the BioFreedom group than in the BMS group (9.4% (112/1221) vs. 12.9% (154/1211); P < 0.001 for noninferiority and P=0.005 for superiority).  The 1 -year rate of CD -TLR was also significantly lower in the BioFreedom 
group than in the BMS group (5.1% (59/1221) vs. 9.8% (113/1211), P <0.001).  There was also a significant reduction in the 1- year rate of MI with BioFreedom compared with BMS 
(6.1% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.01), whereas no differences in the 1- year rates of stent thrombosis were 
observed between the two groups (2.0% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.75). 
Results from both ZEUS and LEADER FREE suggest that DES can be as safe or even safer 
choice for HBR patients than BMS with short duration of DAPT. The confirmed safety of 
Endeavor and BioFreedom with short- term DAPT for HBR patients in the ZEUS and 
LEADERS FREE studies are of particular releva nce to the safety of the proposed study of 
XIENCE.  XIENCE V has consistently been shown to have a better safety profile than Endeavor based on results from several meta- analyses
33,34.  Pre -clinical studies of 
endothelialization also demonstrate that XIENCE V had a faster rate of strut coverage following stent implantation than Endeavor 
40, and was equivalent to BioFreedom48.  
Additionally, XIENCE showed a significant reduction in platelet adherence compared to BioFreedom stents in ex vivo  studies
9. Taken together, these clinical data of Endeavor and 
BioF reedom indirectly support the safety to evaluate short- term DAPT  with XIENCE.  
There is also clinical data exclusively evaluating short DAPT duration with XIENCE.  STOPDAPT trial is a prospective multi -center , single -arm study evaluating 3 -month DAPT 
duration after XIENCE implantation in 1,525 patients
49 . Using the XIENCE gr oup in the 
RESET trial as a historical comparison group, where nearly 90% of patients were on DAPT at 1 year, the cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint (a composite of cardiovascular 
death, myocardial infarction, stroke, definite stent thrombosis an d TIMI major/minor 
bleeding) at 1 year tended to be lower in the STOPDAPT than in the RESET (2.8% vs. 4.0%, 
p = 0.06). The difference is driven by [CONTACT_680921], myocardial in farction, stroke and definite stent 
thrombosis rate (2.1% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.045) while the TIMI major/minor bleeding rates were similar between the two groups (1.0% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.4). The cumulative incidence of definite/probable stent thrombosis was also lower in the STOPDAPT (0% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.03). The STOPDAPT trial data support the safety of short- term DAPT following XIENCE 
V implantation.   
To assess the relationship between stent thrombosis and DAPT usage, a patient -level pooled 
analysis was conducted  on a total of 11,219 patients who had complete DAPT usage data 
through the 2- year follow -up period from seven Abbott Vascular-sponsored XIENCE V trials 
(including three pre- approval trials: SPI[INVESTIGATOR_591969], III, IV, and four post-approval single- arm 
registry studies: XIENCE V [LOCATION_003], XIENCE V India, SPI[INVESTIGATOR_61192] V and SPI[INVESTIGATOR_680900])

with DAPT in terruption /discontinuation for patients implanted with XIENCE V.  In this 
pooled analysis, the overall rate of definite/probable stent thrombosis at 2 years was 0.75%, with 0.36% for early stent thrombosis (within 1 month), 0.29% for late stent thrombosis (1 -12 
months) and 0.11% for very late stent thrombosis (after 1 year).

The benefit/risk ratio of a shorter 
duration of DAPT following XIENCE implantation in this population has not been thoroughly evaluated. Therefore, the XIENCE 90  study is designed to prospectively evaluate 
the safety of XIENCE followed with  3-month DAPT in HBR patients .

Assessment of eligibility of DAPT discontinuation will occur at 3-month follow-up. 
3.3 Measures Taken to Avoid and Minimize Bia s 
All the clinical endpoint events will be adjudicated by t he Clinical Events Committee (CEC). 
The CEC is an independent adjudication body comprised of qualified physicians who are not participants in the trial. The CEC will review and adjudicate events as defined in the CEC charter and according to definitions provided in this protocol.  
3.4 Early Termination of the Clinical Trial  
No formal statistical rule for early termination of the trial is defined.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the cl inical trial/investigation at any stage or 
reduce the follow up period with suitable written notice to the investigator. Possible reason(s) 
may include, but are not limited to:  
• Unanticipated adverse device effect (e.g., UADE) occurs and it presents an 
unreasonable risk to the participating subjects.  
• Any oversight committee (e.g., Steering/Executive Committee, Data Safety 
Monitoring Board [DSMB]) makes a recommendation to stop or terminate the trial (such as higher frequency of anticipated adverse device effects).  
• Further product development is cancelled.  
Should the clinical trial be discontinued by [CONTACT_1034], subjects will be followed up as per routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196527]/commer cial reporting requirements.

4.0 ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is a composite rate of all death  or all myocardial infarction (MI, 
modified ARC ) from 3 to 12 months.  This composite endpoint was chosen because death  
and MI are important safety endpoints to evaluate short- term DAPT after PCI.  
4.2 Major Secondary Endpoint(s)  
• Major bleeding rate (BARC typ e 2-5) from 3 to 12  months 
• Stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) from 3 to 12 months  
4.3 Other Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The following endpoints will be assessed from 3 to 12 months: 
• All death, cardiac death, vascular death, non-cardiovascular death   
• All MI (modified ARC) and MI attributed to target vessel (TV -MI, modified ARC) 
• Composite of cardiac death or MI (modified ARC) 
• All stroke, ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke  
• Clinically -indicated target lesion revascularizatio n (CI-TLR)

research coordinator) previously trained to the clinical trial protocol and if applicable will be entered into a site specific screening log .  
Subjects meeting the general inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to sign an informed consent. Pre -procedure (or baseline) imaging will be used for the final assessment 
of subject eligibility (details are described in S ection 5.3). Subjects who do not satisfy the 
angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria are considered screen failures and will not be registered and proceed further in the trial. These subjects will be entered into the screening log. Also, the reason for screen failure as well as supporting data will be entered into the log.  
Patient  data wil l be collected following registration into the trial/investigation.  
5.2.2 Informed Consent  
The Investigator or designee, who has been trained on the Protocol, will explain the nature and scope of the trial, potential risks and benefits of participation, and answer questions for the subjects. All subjects (or legally authorized subjects’ representatives if applicable) must sign and date  (and time , as per applicable local standards) the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) approved informed consent (ICF)  prior to any clinical 
trial/investigation -specific procedures. All efforts should be made to consent a subject prior 
to index procedure . However, it is acceptable for the subject to provide consent prior to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196516] 3 days after the index procedure, only if the site confirms that the protocol required DAPT regimen is site’s standard of care.  If staged procedures are needed for a subject, the site may consent the subject after the initial procedure.  
Obtaining the consent an d provisioning of a copy to the subject, along with the date and time 
must be documented in the subject’s medical records. The ICF must be signed by [CONTACT_680923] (if allowed per country specific regulations). In addition, the signed inform ed consent must be kept in the subject’s medical records/ research chart and a copy 
must be given to the subject or the legally authorized representative. 
In addition, an authorization for use and disclosure of the subject’s protected health 
information, in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), must be obtained from the subject or their legally authorized representa tive (US 
only). 
For Live cases at congresses the patients need to sign a specific Live Case ICF, approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]/EC . The investigator must notify Abbott Vascular prior to performing a Live Case.  
FDA approval is also required for a live case conducted in US.

However, if a subject withdraws from the study  due to problems related to the investigational 
device safety or performance, the investigator shall ask for the subject's permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical investigation.  
Lost -to-Follow -up:   
If the subject misses two consecutive scheduled follow up time points and the attempts at contact[CONTACT_150744], then the subject is considered lost -to 
follow -up. Site personnel shall make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with 
the subject (and document these efforts in the source documents), including the following, at each contact [CONTACT_7206]:  
• A minimum of [ADDRESS_921719]. 
• If these attempts are unsuccessful, a letter (certified if applicable) should be sent to the subject. 
• If a subject misses one or more non -consecutive follow -up contact [CONTACT_196565] a missed visit. The subject may then return for subsequent visits. If the subject misses two con secutive time points and the above -mentioned attempts at communicating 
with the subject are unsuccessful, the subject will be considered lost -to-follow -up.  
Note : Telephone contact [CONTACT_150747], non- study  cardiologist or relative without 
presence of subject or indirect documentation obtained via discharge letters will not be considered as subject contact . 
Missed Visits:  
• If a subject misses one or more non -consecutive follow -up contact [CONTACT_150746], the visit 
will be considered a missed visit and subject is not lost- to-follow -up.

• If subject responds via written communication (including email correspondence), providing the protocol  required data, these data will be collected in the case report form 
and the visit will not be considere d a missed visit.   
5.[ADDRESS_921720]’s Participation  
The expected duration of each subject’s participation in this clinical investigation is 
approximately [ADDRESS_921721] be completed when: 
• the subject is considered lost to follow-up per the above defi nition or  
• the subject withdraws from the Clinical Trial or  
• the investigator withdraws the subject from the Clinical Trial or  
• the subject has died or  
• upon Clinical Trial completion or 
• sponsor termination of trial.  
Sponsor must be notified of the reason for subject discontinuation. The site will provide this information on the eCRF. Investigators must also report this to their EC/IRB as defined by 
[CONTACT_1385]’s procedure. Subjects will not be replaced.  
6.0 TREATMENT AND EVALUATION  
6.1 Baseline and Pre -procedure  
6.1.1 Laboratory Assessments  
Baseline 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory assessments (such as blood counts, 
chemistry panel and lipid panel, cardiac enzymes, etc.) should be obtained per site’s standard of care. Baseline laborato ry results related to inclusion/exclusion criteria should be available 
and reviewed prior to the index procedure for screening. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_921722] demographics (age, gender, race), height, weight, family history of coronary artery 
disease ( CAD) , smoking status, cardiac history  (myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and previous PCI /CABG information ), subject’s current 
cardiac status ( presentation of CAD and multivessel disease)  and indication of high bleeding 
risk (per criteria specified in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) will be obtained and recorded in electronic case 
report form (eCRF).   6.1.3 Pre-procedure Antiplatelet Medication 
Antiplatelet loading dose is required in this trial: 
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #16 -308-Redacted   
May 25, 2018   
 
 
• Subjects must receive a loading dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_680896] a P2Y12 inhibitor (Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], Prasugrel or Ticagrelor). The dosages of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] P2Y12 inhibitor shall be determined by [CONTACT_196567]. The choice of P2Y12 inhibitor is per site standard of care, but clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196510].  Per physician’s discretion, a loading dose of P2Y12 inhibitor may be omitted if the subject was on chronic usage for ≥ 7 days .  
The details o f the antiplatelet loading dose, including type of drug, dosage, date and time, 
will be recorded in eCRF.  
6.2 Index Procedure 
Only XIENCE stent can be used for target lesion(s). Stent implantation procedure should be 
performed according to the instruction for use (IFU) of the XIENCE family stent used . If 
XIENCE stent is delivered beyond the guide catheter but not implanted, the subject should not be registered  in the study. If oth er DES was implanted, the subject should not be 
registered in the study.  
In this study, a maximum of three  target lesions may be treated  with a maximum of two target 
lesions per epi[INVESTIGATOR_196518] . Non -target lesion  (i.e., lesions that do not meet the angiographic 
eligibility criteria) treatments are not allowed during the index procedure.  
Planned staged procedures are allowed (recommend to be performed within 30 days). The 
site may consent the subject after the initial procedure. Subject registration will occur once the last staged procedure is performed and the last staged procedure is considered as the index procedure. Post- procedure DAPT duration will be measured from the last staged 
procedure.  Any planned stenting procedure must be done prior to subje ct registration. The 
subject must not have any additional stenting procedure planned after the index procedure.    
Subjects may receive appropriate anticoagulation and other therapy according to standard 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13707].  
Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_680904], whether planned or for bailout. Subjects who 
received overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_680905].

­ For subjects taking chronic anticoagulants, dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196517]) may be considered for the first 3 months 
after index procedure per investigator’s discretion.  
• At 3-month follow up, subject will be assessed for their eligibility of P2Y12 inhibitor 
discontinuation. Eligible subjects will discontinue P2Y12 inhibitor and receive ≥75 to 
≤100 mg of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_196514] 1- year follow -up during the study if they are “3 -month 
clear”, defined as subjects who are free from myocardial infarction (modified ARC), repeat coronary revascularization, stroke, or stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) 
within 3 months (prior to 3- month visit but at least 90 days) after stenting A ND have been 
compliant with 3 -month dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) without interruption of either 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251]/or P2Y12 receptor inhibitor for > 7 consecutive days.  
­ Peri-procedural MI (occurred within [ADDRESS_921728] index procedure) without any 
clinical s ymptoms will not be considered exclusionary event for the definition of 
“3-month clear”.  
­ Dual therapy (oral anticoagulant and a P2Y12 inhibitor, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_196517]) 
within the first [ADDRESS_921729] index procedure for subjects who are on chronic 
anticoagu lants is acceptable for the definition of “3 -month clear”.  
• Subjects who are not “3 -month clear” a re NOT  eligible for P2Y12 inhibitor 
discontinuation at 3- month . These subjects will be treated per the investigator's discretion 
and will continue to be followed up through 12 months. 
*For prasugrel subjects < 60 kg in weight or ≥ 75 years of age, a maintenance dose of 5 mg 
per day for 12 months is allowable.

• Any adverse events  
• Use and compliance of protocol required antiplatelet medication  
• Details of any subsequent coronary interventions (e.g., repeat PCI or CABG) 
If an unscheduled visit is conducted due to a suspected i schemic cardiac event, cardiac 
enzymes and ECG may  be performed per site’s standard care . CK and CK- MB are preferred. 
If CK and CK-MB are not available, troponin should be collected. 
All efforts must be made to obtain follow -up information on subjects who have undergone 
procedures or have been treated for adverse events in a non -trial-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307](s).  
7.[ADDRESS_921733] definitions and reporting timelines to be used and adhered to by [CONTACT_473]. 
7.1 Definition  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or 
untoward clinic al signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other 
persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Note 1 : This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator. Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. 
Note 3 : For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product .  
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #16 -308-Redacted   
May 25, 2018   
 
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event (SAE).  
a) Led to a death,  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in health that either:  
1) Resulted in a life- threatening illness or in jury, or  
2) Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 3) Required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 4) Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening ill ness or  
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
c) Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
d) An important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49200], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note 1 : This includes device deficiencies that might have led to a serious adverse event if a) 
suitable action had not been taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate. These are handled under the SAE reporting system. 
Note 2 : A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_5941], without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be a 
serious adverse event.  
7.1.3 Device Deficiency/Device Malfunction  
Device deficiency  (DD) is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note : Performance 
specifications include all claims made in the labeling of the device.  
A device malfunction (DM) is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended, when used in accordance with the instructions for use or the study protocol. 
7.[ADDRESS_921734] or 
device caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by [CONTACT_680925]. Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and patient condition (pre-existing conditi on). 
7.2.1 Unanticipated (Serious) Adverse Device Effect  
Unanticipated (serious) adverse device effect [U(S)ADE] refers to any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a 
device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

9.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical Overview  
The XIENCE 90  trial is powered based on primary endpoint of all death or all myocardial 
infarction [modified ARC]  (Death/MI ) from  3- to 12- month follow -up.  
Primary endpoint analysis for 3- month DAPT  
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #16 -308-Redacted   
May 25, 2018   
 
 
The primary endpoint of Death/MI  between  3-month and 12- month follow -up will be 
evaluated  based on the “3 -month clear” population (as defined in section 9.2). The hypothesis 
test is designed for non- inferiority of [ADDRESS_921740] 
DAPT  duration up to 12 months from XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical control for the primary 
endpoint with one-sided alpha of 0.025 after propensity score  stratification . The null (H 0) and 
alternat ive (H A) hypothesi s are of the following form:  
                        H 0: Death/MI 3m-DAPT  -  Death/MI Xience V [LOCATION_003]   ≥ δ 
HA: Death/MI 3m-DAPT  -   Death/MI Xience V [LOCATION_003]  < δ  
A stratified statistical  method through propensity score will be performed to test non-
inferiority (NI) of [ADDRESS_921741] on the primary endpoint 
Death/MI for the “3-month clear” population.  
Major secondary endpoint analyses for 3- month DAPT  
If the hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint is successful, the following major 
secondary analyses will be performed.  
A superiority test for the major secondary endpoint of BARC type [ADDRESS_921742] will be based on one-sided alpha of 0.025. The null (H 0) and alternative (H A) 
hypotheses are of the following form: 
                  H 0: B3m-DAPT  –B Xience V [LOCATION_003]  ≥ 0 
HA: B3m-DAPT  –B Xience V [LOCATION_003]  < 0  
B3m-DAPT  and B Xience V [LOCATION_003] are major bleeding rates  (BARC type 2 -5) between 3-month and 12-
month follow -up for XIENCE 90  and X IENCE  V [LOCATION_003] historical control, respectively .

3-month DAPT in XIENCE 90  to X IENCE  V [LOCATION_003] historical control for the primary 
endpoint of death/MI at a 0.025 significant level .  
Major se condary analyses wi ll be performed only if the primary hypothesi s testing is  
successful.  
Analyses of other secondary endpoints and additional endpoints will be descriptive in nature.  
For binary variables such as TLR, TVR, counts, percentages and 95% confidence intervals 
will be calculated, and p -values may be presented for hypothesis generating purposes. 
Pearson’s Chi -squared test of Fisher’s exact test will be performed when appropriate.  
For continuous variables such as age, means, standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals for the mean will be calculated and p -values may be presented for hypothesis 
generating purposes. For time- to-event variables, such as time to Death/MI, survival curves 
will be constructed using Kaplan- Meier estimates, and log rank  test results will be displayed. 
Unless specified, analyses will be performed with pooled data across all study sites.  
For further details,  refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP ). 
9.4.[ADDRESS_921750] will be performed on the primary endpoint of Death/MI between 3-month and 12-month follow up for the “3-month clear” population of XIENCE 90 3-month DAPT arm and the XIENCE V [LOCATION_003] historical control stratified by [CONTACT_10501] s. 
Details of the analyses for the powered primary endpoint can be found in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.4.2 Major Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
• Superiority will be tested for the major secondary endpoint of major bleeding ( BARC 
type 2-5) between 3 -mont h and 12-month follow up for the “3- month clear”

15.[ADDRESS_921763] to HBR patients which represent approximately 15% or more of patients undergoing PCI
22,23. The default management of care for HBR patients who 
undergo PCI is often stenting with BMS followed by 1 month of DAPT. The European ESC/EACTS guidelines have recommended 3 months of DAPT with second-generation DES for HBR patients undergoing PCI
24.  Consistent with the European guideline, the updated 
2016 ACC/AHA guideline also provided a class IIb recommendation of 3-month DAPT in SIHD patients with high risk of bleeding following DES implantation
17. Studies with some 
DES (Endeavor, BioFreedom) have demonstrated  safety of short -term DAPT for HBR 
patients45,47. 
 XIENCE has consistently been shown to have the best safety profile among the coronary stents, even when compared to BMS, in both clinical trials and commercial data analysis. However, the benefit/risk ratio of a shorter duration of DAPT following XIENCE implantation in the HBR population has not been thoroughly evaluated. There is clearly an unmet medical need to be addressed for the HBR patient population as the possible benefits of extended DAPT therapy to prevent late stent thrombosis and the progression of 
Abbott Vascular  Version 3.0  
XIENCE 90 Protocol #[ADDRESS_921764] the increased risk of bleeding in an individual patient. Therefore, the XIENCE 90  study is designed to prospectively evaluate the 
safety of XIENCE followed with 3-month DAPT in HBR patients . 
15.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
The excellent safety profile of XIENCE family of stents has been well demonstrated. Stent implantation and the following medical treatment are the same for subjects registered in this study as if they are not participating in this clinical study , except fo r DAPT duration. Short-
term DAPT may decrease the risk of bleeding in HBR subjects. Participation of this study contributes to defin ing the optimum duration of DAPT in  HBR subjects treated with 
XIENCE . 
15.2 Foreseeable Adverse Events and Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Observed and potential adverse events occurring with the XIENCE family of stents are listed in the IFUs. The incidence of these adverse events is comparable to other PCI devices. There may be risks related to the device that are unknown a t present.  
Please refer to the drug labelling (most recent versions available at www.fda.gov
 – drugs - 
drugs@fda and www.ema.europa.eu  – find medicine – human medicines), and publi shed 
guidelines on PCI and DAPT use17,24 for information on bleeding and other risks associated 
with DAPT use.  
Short- term DAPT use may decrease the risk of bleeding in HBR subjects, but may increase 
the risk of late stent thrombosis and progression of atherosclerotic disease.  
15.3 Residual Risks Associated with the Investigational Device, as Identified in the Risk  Analysis Report  
The XI ENCE Risk Assessment Report
12 utilizes the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis 
(FMEA) tool to systematically identify potential hazards associated with the process, design, components, and use of the XI ENCE product family. Based upon preclinical, clinical, bench 
data, and commercial post -production data, all residual risks are appropriat e and acceptable. 
The benefit of treatment from the XIENCE outweighs the potential risks to the patient. 
Comprehensive analysis of product level clinical data, including clinical trial, post-marketing, and literature data, confirms that any undesirable ris ks identified are outweighed by [CONTACT_680932]
[ADDRESS_921765] of care. There are no a dditional 
risks to the subjects, except that short- term DAPT may increase the risk of stent thrombosis 
and ischemic events.  
15.5 Possible Interactions with Protocol  Required Concomitant Medications  
Other than DAPT, the study protocol does not require concomitant medications.

CLINICAL ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
 DEATH (Per ARC Circulation 2007; 115: 2344-2351) All deaths are considered cardiac unless an unequivocal non -cardiac cause can be established. 
Specifically, any unexpected death even in patients with coexisting potentially fatal non-cardiac disease (e.g. cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.   Cardiac death :  
Any death due to proximate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low- output failure, fatal arrhythmia), 
unwitnessed death and death of unknown cause, all procedure related deaths including those related to concomitant treatment.  
 Vascular death:  
Deat h due to non- coronary vascular causes such as cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary 
embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting aneurysm, or other vascular cause.    
Non-cardiovascular death:  
Any death not covered by [CONTACT_196590], malignancy, 
sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide or trauma. 
 
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI)  
 MI Definition  (Modified  ARC) 
 Patients present any of the following clinical or imaging evidence of ischemia:  
• Clinical symptoms of ischemia;  
• ECG changes indicative of new ischemia - new ST -T changes or new left bundle branch 
block ( LBBB), development of pathological Q waves*;  
• Imaging evidence of a new loss of viable myocardium or a new regional wall motion 
abnormality)  
 
AND confirmed with elevated cardiac biomarkers ** per ARC criteria (Circulation 2007; 115: 
2344-2351): 
• Periprocedural MI:  
• Within 48h after PCI: CK -MB >3 x URL or Troponin > 3 x URL with baseline value 
< URL  
• Within 72h after CABG: CK -MB >5 x URL or Troponin > 5 x URL with baseline 
value < URL  
• Spontaneous MI (> 48h following PCI, > 72h following CABG):  CK- MB > URL or 
Troponin > URL with baseline value < URL 
 
* Pathologic Q waves may be defined according to the Global Task Force, Minnesota code, or Novacode  
**The assessment of CK-MB is preferred over the assessment of troponin for the diagnosis of peri -procedural MI, if possible.

TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention of the target lesion or by[CONTACT_196595]. All TLR should be classified prospectively as clinical ly indicated [CI] or not clinically indicated 
by [CONTACT_196596]. The target lesion is defined as the treated segment from 5 mm proximal to the stent and to 5 mm distal to the stent.  
Target Vessel Revascularization (TVR)  
TVR is  defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention or surgical by[CONTACT_196597]. The target vessel is defined as the entire major coronary vessel proximal and distal to the target lesion  which includes upstream and downstream branches and the target 
lesion itself  
Non Target Lesion Revascularization (Non- TLR)  
Any revascularization in the target vessel for a lesion other than the target lesion is 
considered a non- TLR.  
Non Target Vessel Revascularization (Non -TVR)  
Revascularization of the vessel identified and treated as the non -target vessel at the time of 
the index procedure.  
Clinically Indicated [CI] Revascularization (TLR/TVR) A revascularization is considered clinically indic ated if angiography at follow-up shows a 
percent diameter stenosis ≥ 50% and if one of the following occurs:  
• A positive history of recurrent angina pectoris, presumably related to the target vessel;  
• Objective signs of ischemia at rest (ECG changes) or during exercise test (or 
equivalent), presumably related to the target vessel;  
• Abnormal results of any invasive functional diagnostic test (e.g., Doppler flow 
velocity reserve, fractional flow reserve);  
• A TLR/TVR with a diameter stenosis ≥70% in the absenc e of the above mentioned 
ischemic signs or symptoms.  
 TARGET LESION FAILURE (TLF)  
TLF is defined as a composite of all cardiac death, myocar dial infarction attributed to target 
vessel or clinically -indicated TLR.

TIMI (THROMBOSIS IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION) FLOW GRADES  
0. No contrast flow through the stenosis.   
1. A small amount of contrast flows through the stenosis but fails to fully opacify the artery beyond. 
2. Contrast material flows through the stenosis to opacify  the terminal artery segment. 
However, contrast enters the terminal segment perceptibly more slowly than more proximal segments. Alternatively, contrast material clears from a segment distal to a stenosis noticeably more slowly than from a comparable segment not preceded by a significant stenosis.  
3. Anterograde flow into the terminal coronary artery segment through a stenosis is as prompt as anterograde flow into a comparable segment proximal to the stenosis. Contrast material clears as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_680910] l segment as from an uninvolved, 
more proximal segment.

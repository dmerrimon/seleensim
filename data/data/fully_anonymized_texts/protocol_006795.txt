> [ADDRESS_244191] the underlying sleep disturbances both pathophysiologically as
well as therapeutically.  
The minor risk to confidentiality and privacy and adverse effects of ramelteon are low compared to the potential
benefits of elucidating the mechanism and treatment options for these patients and potentially improve their QOL.
13. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained  
Sleep quality is a major concern in patients with cirrhosis and this impacts their quality of life immensely . Patients with
sleep problems are not able to function normally and this is often mistaken for hepatic encephalopathy . This leads to
unnecessary treatments and can in turn worsen their quality of life. A study with treatment with an FDA-approved
medication, will be able to identify and possibly correct the underlying sleep disturbances both pathophysiologically as
well as therapeutically.  
The minor risk to confidentiality and privacy and adverse effects of ramelteon are low compared to the potential
benefits of elucidating the mechanism and treatment options for these patients and potentially improve their QOL.

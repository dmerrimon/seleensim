STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Analysis Populations:  
Enrolled:  The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who signed the informed consent to 
participate in the study, and had Screening visit electronic case report form s (eCRFs) collected.  
Randomized:  The Randomized Population will consist of all Enrolled su bjects who w ere randomized at 
Baseline/Visit 2  (Day 1) 
Intent-To-Treat (ITT):  The ITT Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at least one 
dose of study medication.  
Per-Protocol (PP) : The PP Population will include all ITT subjects who had adequate exposure to the 
randomiz ed study medication (>85%) during the [ADDRESS_1012780] adequately complied with the protocol as assessed by [CONTACT_740844].  The final definition of the PP Population will be 
documented in an addendum to the prospectively developed statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to 
unblinding any data. 
 
Analysis Endpoints : 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:   The primary efficacy endpoint is percentage change from Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day1) to Study Termination/Visit 8  (Day 168/Week 24) in body weight  
Primary Safety and Tolerability Endpoint:   The primary safety and tolerability endpoint is the incidence 
of all treatment -emergent adverse events.  
 Statistical Analyses:  
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, median, min, and max) will be used to summarize values of the 
primary efficacy endpoint, change in percent body weight  from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1 ) to Study 
Termination/Visit 8 (Day 16 8/Week 24 ) and intermediate study visits as applicable by [CONTACT_1570].  
These summaries will be presented for the PP Population with observed data and the ITT Population with 
Last Observation Carried Forward  (LOCF) approach.   A mixed-model of analysis of variance (ANCOVA) 
will be used to analyze change in body weight over the study duration in PP and ITT Populations.  The 
ANCOVA will include treatment group and time as the main effects with baseline weight as the covariate.   
The LS means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) for the changes from b aseline to 
Week 24 will be derived from the model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed- dose combinations of 
leucine, sildenafil, and /or metformin  treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) will be compared  to 
placebo group (Treatment A), and the LS means for the treatment difference (Treatment B, C D or E  minus 
Treatment A), the SEs, the associated 95% C Is, and the p -values will be computed.  
 SAMPLE SIZE 
 
A sufficient number of individuals will be screened to enroll at least 250 subjects (~50/treatment arm).  With an assumption of 20% dropout rate, approximately 200 subjects (~40/treatment arm) are expected to complete treatment through Study Termination/Vi sit 8 (Day 168/Week 24).   
Using a two -sided, two -sample comparison (t -test) of means at the alpha=0.05 level of significance, sample 
sizes of 23 subjects per treatment will provide approximately 90% power to detect a mean treatment difference of 3 kg body  weight (~3.0- 3.3% weight loss over 24 weeks), assuming a common standard 
deviation of 25%.  However, detection of significant changes in obesity co -morbidities require a higher 
sample size; detection of a 6 mm Hg change in blood pressure will require a sample size of 40 subjects per treatment group at 80% power; accordingly, the sample size has been increased to 40/treatment arm to enable assessment of this secondary endpoint. These assumptions of effect size and standard deviation are based on data derived from the previous clinical trial of NS -0200 (NS -0200-01) and represent  the 
anticipated treatment effect of effective fixed -dose combinations of leucine and sildenafil, with or without 
metformin, compared to placebo .

Sirt [ADDRESS_1012793] three decades, and the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_740828] a significant public health risk in the US and other developed countries as well as in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19744].  In the US, >35% of the adult population and 17% of the pediatric and adolescent populations are obese, and ~70% of the population is overweight or obese [1,2]. 
Obesity is associated with significant mortality risk, as shown by a 9 -13 year reduction in 
lifespan and >300,000 obesity- related deaths annually in the US  [3–7].  Further, obesity 
increases the risk of co -morbidities, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], obstructive sleep apnea, and some cancers  [4–8].  The risk of 
obesity-related co -morbidities increases with increasing body mass index (BMI); conversely, 
even modest reduction in BMI resulting from a 5-10% weight loss reduces the risk and severity of these co -morbidities  [9,10]. 
 Lifestyle intervention focused on reducing caloric intake and increasing caloric expenditure are the first -line approach to obesity management; however, patient adherence is generally 
poor and obesity control through lifestyle intervention alone rarely exhibits sustained success.  Accordingly, pharmacotherapy is an important adjunct to diet and exercise to achieve sustained weight reduction.  The proposed fixed dose combination of the amino acid leucine and two well characterized agents with established good safety profiles is expected to modulate energy metabolism and facilitate sustained weight loss.  
 AMPK and Sirt1 are well known regulators of lipid and energy metabolism. Activation of Sirt1 and AMPK stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation with concomitant suppression of lipid synthesis and storage [11–16]. NuSirt Biopharma has demonstrated that L-leucine has a unique role as an activator of the Sirt1/AMPK pathway, serving as a partial 
mimetic of caloric restriction, and thereby [CONTACT_740845]1 -dependent lipid and energy 
metabolism [17–19] . NuSirt has shown that addition of L-leucine to metformin (fixed dose 
combination, NS-0100) results in a novel synergistic interaction that enables significant dose reduction of metformin with no loss of anti- diabetic efficacy  (IND# 121112) and that a triple 
combination of L- leucine with low -dose metformin and sildenafil (NS-0200) regresses 
steatohepatitis in preclinical studies  [19,20] and reduces hepatic fat in non- alcoholic fatty liver 
disease patients with elevated liver enzymes (IND #126214). Further, data from the Phase 2A trial conducted under this IND also provided a robust weight loss signal accompanied by [CONTACT_740846] -morbidities.  This finding is supported by [CONTACT_740847] a rodent obesity model.  NuSirt also has preclinical data which suggests that metformin may not be a necessary component to achieve weight loss; we therefore will evaluate a related fixed dose combination of leucine and sildenafil in the absence of metformin (NS-0300) in this study.  The superior combination will then be utilized for f urther development.

4 STUDY POPULATION  
 
4.1 Population to Be Studied 
A sufficient number of obese subjects will be exposed to study screening procedures  to 
enroll approximately  250 subjects , with a maximum of 70% female , with a goal of having

deviation and allowed to continue study participation. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_1012797] follow the medication  restrictions  outlined in the inclusion and exclusion  
criteria (Section 4.3) during the study. Dosages for certain concomitant medications  should 
be maintained  constant during the study (Section 4.2 and 4.3) unless instructed  otherwise  by 
[CONTACT_1720] a treating physician.  Any change in regimen for any concomitant 
medication,  including restricted concomitant medications,  must be reported to the sponsor 
and recorded in  the eCRF. 
The sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_740851].  The sponsor will decide whether the subject will be allowed 
to continue study participation.  
 
5 STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Study medications  administered  in this protocol include either placebo or one of four  
combinations of leucine, sildenafil  and/or metformin (See Section 5.1) .  All drugs will be 
provided as tablets with identical appearance to double-blind the medications  to subjects 
and study personnel.  Study medication is to be kept at ambient temperature at all times.  
Any deviations will require the drug to be temporarily quarantined and the deviation 
reported to NuSirt.  NuSirt will then make an assessment as to how to proceed. 
 
5.1 Formulation, Packagi ng, and Storage  
Fixed Dose Combination  Arms: Each dose of study medicatio n will consist of three tablets , 
two tablets containing either 550 mg L -leucine alone or 550mg L -leucine in combination with 
250 mg of Metformin an d one tablet either 1.0 mg or 4.0 mg of sildenafil.  
Placebo Arm: Each dose of placebo will consist of three tablets , identical in appearance 
to those used in the two active treatment arms, containing 93.5% Microcrystalline cellulose PH 102, 5.0% Crospovidone XL 10, 1.0% Silica gel (Syloid 244), 0.5% Magnesium stearate I MF3V for the leucine matched placebo and 99.5% Avicel PH200 , 0.5% magnesium stearate (w/w) and Opadry II White coating 3% weight gain for the 
sildenafil matched placebo.  
 
5.2 Dispensing  of Study Medication  
Study materials will be provided to subjects by [CONTACT_093], medically  qualified sub- 
investigator named on form FDA 1572, or other qualified study-site personnel. Under no 
circumstance will the investigator  or sub-investigator(s) allow the study medication  to be 
used other than as directed by [CONTACT_740852]-WM-[ADDRESS_1012798]. Subjects will be assigned to one of five treatment groups ( Table 1) based 
on the randomization schedule. 
Subjects will be assigned a randomization number on Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) . The 
randomization  numbers will be allocated in strict chronological order. The number will 
uniquely identify the subject and dictate the assigned, blinded treatment group. 
The sponsor  personnel involved in study conduct, study staff and subject will be blinded to 
the identity of study medication  during the study. The study medication  will be provided to 
the study centers in a blinded fashion. The study center pharmacist  will use the subject’s 
assigned randomization number to ensure that the appropriate blinded study medication  is 
allocated at each visit. The study centers will  be provided with sufficient study medication  to 
supply all randomized subjects.  
 
5.5 Drug Accountability  
The investigator listed on form FDA 1572 will be responsible for all clinical supplies 
(study medication) accountability. Upon receipt of all study medication, the contents of 
each shipment will be verified against the enclosed shippi[INVESTIGATOR_52861]. After verification, the 
form will be signed and dated, a copy will be retained for the investigator’s file, and the 
original will be returned to the sponsor. The sponsor will be notified immediately if any irregularities, discrepancies, or damages are identified.  
The investigational materials will be prescribed only by [CONTACT_9940] -
investigators. Under no circumstances will the investigator or sub -investigators allow the 
investigational drug to be used other than as specified in the protocol. 
Drug dispensing and returns will be recorded on a sponsor-provided or sponsor-approved 
drug disposition form, to provide a complete accounting of the receipt, disposition, and 
return of study medication. At the completion of the study, all remaining used and unused study medication, empty containers, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_740832].

Visit 4 (Day 56/Week 8), Visit 5 (Day 84/Week 12), Visit 6 (Day 112/Week 16), Visit 7 
(Day 140/ Week 20) and Study Termination/ Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) or Early 
Terminatio n.  Waist circumference is measured at the end of several consecutive natural 
breaths, at a level parallel to the floor, midpoint between the top of the iliac cres t and the 
lower margin of the last palpable rib in the mid axillary line.  Measurement s are made with 
a stretc h‐resistant tape (which will be provided by [CONTACT_740856]) that is wrapped snugly around 
the subject, but not to the point that the tape is constricting.   The tape is kept level and 
parallel to the floor at the point of measurement.  Subjects will be  standing upright during 
the measurement, with arms relaxe d at the side, feet evenly spread apart and body weight 
evenly distributed.  All measurements are to be made and reported in centimeters  to the

[ADDRESS_1012811] that this represents the second  systematic  administration of the 
leucine, sildenafil and metformin combination and the initial systemic administration of the 
leucine and sildenafil combination to humans, constant attention to safety monitoring is 
warranted.  The following issues need careful attention throughout the course of the study. 
 
8.1.1 Metformin Associated Lactic Acidosis  
Although its occurrence is extremely rare, lactic acidosis has been reported in patients using full do se metformin (1 500 to 2500 mg/day).  Given that lactic 
acidosis is a serious condition and the possibility that the leucine- metformin -
sildenafil combination might potentiate this effect, study staff need to have a 
heightened awareness of this possibility.   
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-[ADDRESS_1012812] material.  Study medication should then be resumed once the patient has returned to their usual 
diet and fluid intake.  
8.1.3 Risk of Hypoglycemia in Patients Taking Metformin 
While metformin is a gl ucose lowering agent, it is unusual for patients taking 
only metformin to experience hypoglycemia.  (Hypoglycemia associated with 
metformin use is seen almost exclusively when used in combination with a 
sulfonylur ea or insulin.)  However, since  the experie nce is limited with  leucine, 
metformin and sil denafil administered together, it is possible that the risk of 
hypoglycemia could be observed.  Therefore, patients will be instructed 
regarding the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and advised to ingest carbohydrate should they encounter the symptoms of hypogly cemia as well as 
to notify the study site. Study medication should be stopped immediately if any 
evidence of hypoglycemia is seen.  
8.1.4 Hypotension  
Sildenafil , at doses as low as 5mg TID, has been shown to cause hypotension. 
Although rare, if any signs of hypotension are present , in addition to reporting 
as an adverse event, please notify the medical monitor within 24 hours. Study medication should be stopped immediately if a ny evidence of hypotension is 
seen. 
8.1.5 Changes in Vision  
Sildenafil, at doses of 50 to 100 mg, has been associated with sudden loss of 
vision.  In addition, patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_740835].   While it is unlikely that macular edema will be an 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 30  
issue in this study of only 24- weeks duration .  Should a patient report blurry 
vision and/or a change in color vision, they should be referred for evaluation to 
an ophthalmologist. 
Sildenafil, at doses of 50 to 100mg, has been associated with non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy . Although rare, if any signs of non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy  are present ,  in addition to reporting as an 
adverse event, please notify the medical monitor within 24 hours. Study 
medication should be stopped immediately if any evidence of non- arteritic 
anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is seen.  
8.1.6 Leucine Toxicity  
Leucine, when consumed as a dietary supplement at high doses (>500 
mg/kg/day), has been associated with an increase in blood ammonia levels.  While it’s unlikely that the doses employed in this trial are adequate to elevate 
blood ammonia levels, the potential for synergism between leucine, metformin 
and sildenafil exists.  Also, the potential exists for the combination to magnify the hypoglycemic effects of metformin.  
Therefore, any study participant presenting with neurological symptoms should 
be evaluated for low blood glucose val ues and elevated ammonia levels.  If 
either are found, in addition to reporting as an adverse event, please notify the 
medical monitor within 24 hours. Study medication should be stopped immediately if any evidence of leucine toxicity is seen.  
8.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reported in accordance with the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.  (Appendix 2).  The 
CTCAE grades the severity of the AE based upon Grades 1 through 5 and lists unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE. 
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL.  
Grade 3:   Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care ADL  
Grade 4:   Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5:   Death related to AE  
In the event of the occurrence of a same category of three or more grade III CTCAE or [ADDRESS_1012813] caused death. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
ANY SAE THAT OCCURS  AFTER THE SIGNING  OF THE ICF THROUGH [ADDRESS_1012814] BE REPORTED  IMMEDIATELY  (WITHIN  24 HOURS OF 
KNOWLEDGE)  TO THE SPONSOR’S MEDICAL  MONITOR  ([PHONE_15468]). FAX 
THE SAE REPORT  FORM TO THE NUMBER LISTED ON THE FORM 
An adverse event is considered "Serious"  if, in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death 
• A life-threatening  adverse event 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]  
• A persistent or significant  incapacity  or substantial disruption  of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment,  
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention  to 
prevent one of the outcomes  listed in this definition.  
Any SAE, unexpected  events or death encountered  during the course of the investigation and 
for a reasonable time thereafter will be reported to the principal and/or co -investigators by 
[CONTACT_423] (immediately  by [CONTACT_582779] (5) days). The 
investigator will immediately  report the SAE/unexpected event or death within 24 hours of 
being notified to the sponsor for review and assessment/causality  confirmation, and to the 
IRB (per FDA requirements).  
 
Unexpected  Adverse Event:  
An adverse event is considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or 
is not listed at the specificity  or severity that has been observed. 
FDA guidelines recognize that: 
1. “Individual adverse event reports generally require an evaluation  of their relevance and 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 32  
significance  to the study, including an evaluation of other adverse events, before they can 
be considered  to be an unanticipated  problem,” and 
2. “All reports to the IRB of unanticipated  problems should explain clearly why the event 
described  represents  a ‘problem’ for the study and why it is ‘unanticipated.’’ 
Investigators are required to report unexpected adverse events that fit the following criteria 
within 10 working days of the time the investigator  has become informed of the event(s) to 
the IRB and sponsor. 
The following guidelines  provide further definition  to unexpected  adverse events: 
• Event is unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures  that are described  in the protocol- related documents,  such as the IRB- 
approved research protocol and informed consent document,  or the investigator 
brochure; and (b) the characteristics  of the subject population being studied, 
• Related or possibly related to participation  in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the incident, experience,  or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]);  and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic,  or social harm) than was previously 
known or recognized.  
If the adverse event is clearly not related  to the study drug, device, procedures,  or washout  
process, it would not represent a risk to other subjects in the research or a “problem” for the 
study and, therefore,  does not have to be reported to the IRB. 
 
Intensity:  
The intensity of each adverse event will be characterized  as mild, moderate, or severe, as 
follows: 
• MILD: Usually transient, requires no special treatment,  and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• MODERATE:  Usually causes a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject 
and may interfere with daily activities,  but is usually ameliorated  by [CONTACT_740861].  
• SEVERE:  Interrupts  a subject’s usual daily activities and generally requires 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
Causality: 
The investigator  will grade the association  of the adverse event as UNRELATED  or 
RELATED  to study medication.  The following criteria should be considered  for determining  
relatedness:  
• UNRELATED:  The adverse event is judged to be produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical 
state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_740836]. 
• RELATED:  The adverse event is judged to be related to the administration  of study 
medication.

Pregnancy : 
If a patient becomes pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_1012815] the Exp osure In Utero form 
to the Investigator for completion. A patient becoming pregnant while on study drug will 
immediately be withdrawn from the study and Early Termination study procedures will be performed. A patient who becomes pregnant should be fol lowed by [CONTACT_740862]. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify NuSirt Medical Monitor . At the completion of the 
pregnancy, the Investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome 
of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum 
complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly) the 
Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  If a pregnancy occurs during the study , the data is to be gathered regardless of the conclusion of the study and 
provided to NuSirt immediately after collection.

Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed  after at minimum [ADDRESS_1012819] in another 
position (sitting, standing, etc.), the investigator  should record the alternate position on the  
ECG eCRF page. This data also needs to be in the medical record. The investigator  should 
date and sign the ECG tracing and record the clinical significance of any abnormal result 
on the tracing. ECGs will be interpreted  by a qualified physician  (the investigator or 
qualified designee)  at the clinical study site. 
 
9 BLOOD VOLUME  
During this study, blood w ill be drawn for various analytes  and panels, including chemistry,  
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hematology, and efficacy assessments.  The total amount of blood to be drawn 
(during the  entire study) is expected to be <90mL or ~[ADDRESS_1012820] all protocol- required procedures  to complete the 
study. Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Withdrawal  of Consent - Subject wishes to withdraw from the study as outlined in the 
informed consent. All subjects reserved the right to withdraw from the study without  
prejudice to themselves or their future medical care. 
• Adverse Event - Subject experiences  an adverse event which, in the investigator’s  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], necessitates  withdrawal  from the study.   
• Investigator Decision - Investigator  assessment  that it is in the subject’s best interest 
is to terminate participation.  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 36  
• Protocol Violation – Includes subject non-compliance,  documented pregnancy,  study 
entry violation, and/or start of an unacceptable concomitant medication.  
• Lost To Follow-Up - Subject fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached 
with reasonable attempts. 
• Administrative  Reason – Includes discontinuation  of the study protocol by [CONTACT_103], the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), or other regulatory  
authority,  and/or discontinuation  of the study site’ participation in the study 
protocol. 
• Pregnancy  
 
Any withdrawal from the study will be fully documented on the subject’s eCRF and in 
the subject’s study record at the site. The documentation will include reasons for the 
withdrawal and details of any sequela e (followed through until the symptoms resolved or 
returned to baseline levels) if the reason was an adverse event.  
Every effort will be made to conduct all protocol specified procedures and examinations 
required to complete the study. Optimally, all procedures should be performed within 24 to 48 hours of termination and, if possible, prior to initiating new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Diligent attempts will be made to follow through endpoint assessment those patients who do not withdraw consent and/or are not lost to follow up. 
Only withdrawls for withdrawal of consent or lost to follow-up will not continue to be 
followed. For all other patients – regardless of whether or not study drug is discontinued – 
every effort should be made to continue all visits in the study for safety and should be 
encouraged to complete all study procedures.Subjects who discontinue from the study after randomization and prior to completion of Study Termination /Visit [ADDRESS_1012821], investigator  (including all study-site personnel),  and sponsor will be blinded to 
the identity of the assigned study medication  during the 24- week treatment period (Visit 2 
to Visit 8). Every effort should be made to ensure that subjects remain blinded to their 
treatment.  The investigator  is to notify the sponsor’s medical monitor if an event occurs 
that requires a subject’s treatment assignment  to be unblinded. The code may be unblinded 
only after an irrevocable  decision has been made to withdraw a subject from the study and 
if immediate  knowledge of the study medication  is needed to optimize the clinical 
management  of the subject. 
  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-[ADDRESS_1012822] research organization (CRO) will perform all data management  
activities, including the writing of a data management plan , outlining the data management 
system and procedures to be used. The data management plan will detail the procedure for 
handling and documenting protocol deviations. 
Clinical study data will be recorded (captured)  electronically by [CONTACT_740863]. The eCRF will be a validated  clinical data management system according  to 
procedures  that comply with the Code of Federal  Regulations  21 Part 11 and the 
International  Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice 
(Topic E6, April 2000) Section 5.5.3. The eCRF data will be entered by [CONTACT_3449]-site 
personnel  and then reviewed and electronically  signed by [CONTACT_740864] 1572. All study-site personnel must use an electronic  signature [CONTACT_740872], review, or correct study data. Electronic  signature [CONTACT_740873] 21 part II and the ICH guidelines for good clinical practice (GCP) (Topic E6, 
April 2000) section 5.5.3. Passwords  and electronic signatures  will be strictly confidential. 
All eCRF data will be downloaded from the electronic  data capture (EDC) system and 
reformatted  into SAS data sets. The sponsor’s data management  department  will receive 
electronic transfers of laboratory data from a central laboratory as well as other data from 
third-party vendors as appropriate. The electronic  data format of all transfers will be agreed 
upon with the sponsor. 
The clinical monitoring staff will verify data recorded in the EDC system with source 
documents  at the clinical study sites according  to the data management  plan and clinical 
monitoring plan. The data will be subjected to consistency  and validation checks within the 
EDC system with supplemental validation following  download to a SAS data set. 
Adverse events will be coded using a current version of medical dictionary for regulatory  
activities (MedDRA),  and concomitant  medications  using a current version of the WHO drug 
dictionary. The sponsor will perform a medical safety review of the coding. Completed  
eCRF images with a date- and time-stamped electronic audit trail indicating  the user, the data 
entered, and any reason for change (if applicable)  will be archived at the investigator’s  site 
and archived with backup at the sponsor’s site. 
 
12 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing each of the planned analyses in detail w ill 
be prepared  and signed before any of the data are unblinded.  
12.1 Analysis Populations:  
Enrolled: The Enrolled Population will consist of all subjects who signed the informed consent 
to participate in the study, and had Screening visit electronic case report form (e CRF) 
collected. 
Randomized: The Randomized Populations will consist of all Enrolled subjects who w ere 
randomized at Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1)  
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 38  
Intent-To-Treat (ITT): The ITT Population will include all randomized subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study medication.  
Per-Protocol (PP): The PP Population will include all ITT subjects who had adequate exposure 
to the randomize d study medication (>85%) during the 24- week period , completed Visit 8 
(Day 112/Week16)  and have adequately complied w ith the protocol as assessed by [CONTACT_740844].  The final definition of the PP Population will 
be documented in the prospectively developed SAP prior to undertaking any data analysis.  
 
12.2 Study Subjects  
Demographic and ba seline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490].  Demographic and baseline characteristics include, but are not limited to:  gender, age, 
race, ethnicity, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, and fasting  glucose. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing observation obtained prior to the administration of 
the first dose of randomized study medication at Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1) . 
 
12.3 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary ef ficacy endpoint is  percentage body weight change from Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 
1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24) . 
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, SE, median, min, and max) will be used to summarize 
values of the primary efficacy endpoint, percentage body weight change  from Baseline/Visit 2 
(Day 1) to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24)  and intermediate study visits as 
applicable by [CONTACT_1570].  These summaries will be presented for the PP Population using 
only observed data and the ITT Populatio n employing the  LOCF approach. 
A mixed-model of analysis of variance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyze change in body 
weight over the study duration in PP and ITT Populations.  The ANCOVA will include treatment group and time as the main effects with baseline weight as the covariate.  The LS 
means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the changes from 
baseline to Week 24 will be derived from the model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed -dose 
combinations of leucine, sildenafil, and/or metformin treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) will be compared to placebo group (Treatment A), and the LS means for the treatment 
difference (Treatment B, C D or E minus Treatment A), the SEs, the associated 95% CIs, and 
the p-values will be co mputed. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1012823] -baseline 
data minus the log -transformed baseline data.  These changes from baseline data will be 
examined as the dependent variable and the log of the baseline covariate will be included as a 
covariate.  The LS means, SEs, and the corresponding 95% CIs for the changes from 
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 39  
Baseline/Visit 2 (Day 1)  to Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 168/Week 24)  will be derived from 
the ANCOVA model for each treatment.  Each of the fixed -dose combinations of leucine and 
sildenafil and leucine, sildenafil and metformin treatment groups (Treatment B, C, D and E) 
will be compared to placebo group (Treatment A) , and the LS means for the treatment 
difference (Treatment B, C, D and E minus Treatment A), the SEs, and the associat ed 95% CIs 
and p-values will be computed.  The resulting estimates will be exponentially transformed 
back to the original scale to yield geometric LS mean ratios, SEs of the geometric mean ratios  
(calculated as geometric LS mean ratio multiplied by [CONTACT_740865] -
transformed data), and the 95% CIs of the geometric LS mean ratios.  
 
12.5 Safety Analyses  
All reported terms (investigator descriptions) for AEs will be coded using the most recent 
version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  TEAEs are defined as adverse events with an onset or worsening after the first randomized dose.  Number and 
percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], system organ 
classification, and preferred term.  AEs occu rring prior to receiving the first randomized dose 
(e.g., during the Screening and Pre -Treatment Periods) will not be summarized but will be 
provided in listings.   
TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study, TEAEs possibly or probably related to stud y 
treatment, serious TEAEs, death, TEAEs by [CONTACT_926] (or intensity), and TEAEs with maximum severity (or intensity) and causality, will be summarized.   
Additionally, TEAEs of special interest, e.g., specific gastrointestinal symptoms, will be summarized separately if deemed necessary.  
All hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis results will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject, and visit, including scheduled and unscheduled/repeat measurements.  Laboratory assessments that are outside of normal ran ges and/or with potential clinical importance will be 
flagged.  Baseline values, the values at each visit, and changes from baseline values will be summarized descriptively for each of the quantitative laboratory assessments by [CONTACT_1570].  Additionally, shift tables of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis  results will 
be generated to summarize the normal and abnormal (abnormal high and abnormal low) status 
changes from baseline to each post -baseline visit.  
For vital signs, baseline values, t he values at each visit, and changes from baseline values will

ECG and physical examination data will be provided in listing. 
 13. SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATION 
A sufficient number of individuals will be screened to enroll at least 250 subjects (50 /per 
treatment).  With an assump tion of 20% dropout rate, approximately 200 subjects (40/per 
treatment) are expected to complete treatment through Study Termination/Visit 8 (Day 
168/Week 24) .   
NuSirt Biopharma  
Clinical Study Protocol NS-WM-01 Page 40  
Using a two -sided, two -sample comparison (t -test) of means at the alpha=0.05 level of 
significance, sample sizes of 23 subjects per treatment will provide approximately 90% 
power to detect a mean treatment difference of 3 kg body weight (~3.0- 3.3% weight loss 
over 24 weeks), assuming a common standard deviation of 25%.  However, detection of significant changes in obesity co -morbidities require a higher sample size; detection of a 6 
mm Hg change in blood pressure will require a sample size of 40 subjects per treatment group at 80% power; accordingly, the sample size has been increased to 40/treatment arm to 
enable assessment of this secondary endpoint. These assumptions of effect size and standard 
deviation are based on data derived from the previous clinical trial of NS -0200 (NS -0200-01) 
and represents the anticipated treatment effect of effective fixed -dose combinations of 
leucine and sildenafil, with or without metformin, compared to placebo

• Copy of the IRB approved authorization to use and disclose protected health 
information form, consistent  with HIPAA legislation,  if applicable.  
 
Upon receipt of all necessary  paperwork, the sponsor will arrange for all study materials to 
be delivered to the clinical study site. The sponsor or designee will train all personnel  
expected to be involved in the study. This training may include a review of the study 
protocol, instructions for eCRF completion,  and a review of overall responsibilities,  
including drug accountability  and study file maintenance.  
The sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time for any of the following  reasons: 
• Non-adherence of study- site personnel to the protocol or GCP 
• Unavailability  of the investigator or study- site personnel to the sponsor’s  monitoring 
personnel or designee(s)  
• Other administrative  reasons 
Additionally,  individual  subjects may be excluded from the study if a medical records review 
indicates protocol violations  or if other factors appear to jeopardize the validity of the study. 
Throughout the course of the study, the investigator  is to make a reasonable effort to 
maintain the enrollment  rate that was agreed upon with  the sponsor. The investigator  will 
also make a reasonable effort to enroll appropriate subjects. The sponsor may elect to 
terminate the study at a given site if the enrollment  rate lags or if significant numbers of non- 
evaluable subjects are enrolled.

Confidential   Page 14 of 58 2 INTRODUCTION  
Currently,  there  is no treatment  availa ble to stop or reverse  the progression  of Alzheimer’s  
(AD)  and Parkinson’s  disease  (PD) . Neurodegenerative  diseases  such as AD and PD share  
many  common  characteristics,  including  the central  role of neurotoxic  aggregating  proteins  
in their  pathogenesis.  Amyloid  β (Aβ)  and tau aggregates  (senile  plaques  and neurofibrillary  
tangles , respectively)  have  been  traditionally  associated  with AD, while  α-synuclein  (αSYN)  
aggregates  (Lewy  bodies)  have  been  associated  with PD.  However,  it is becoming  
increasingly  clear that all these  proteins  are involved  in both diseases  and that aggregati on 
of one can lead to accumulation  of another.  Furthermore,  in several  studies  of brains  from  
older  patients,  a high percentage  of all AD brains  present  mixed  pathologies,  such  as Lewy 
body  disease.  Several  clinical  trials  targeting  just one (often  Aβ) of the neurotoxic  
aggregating  proteins  have  failed.  Finally,  other  fragments  of Amyloid  β Precursor  Protein  
(APP)  have  been  implicated  in AD pathology.  Collectively,  these  facts  point  to the need  for 
development  of combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_875193],  if we are to have  a good  chance  of at least  halting  disease  progression.  
Posiphen  has a unique  mechanism  of action,  in that it inhibit s the translation  and, therefore,  
reduces  the levels  of several  neurotoxic  aggregating  proteins  both in vitro  and in vivo, including  
α-Synuclein  (αSYN),  Amyloid  Precursor  Protein  (APP),  its fragments,  and tau. All three  proteins  
have  been  implicated  in the pathogenesis  of PD.  Furthermore,  at older  ages,  there  is a high 
incidence  of patients  with mixed  pathologies,  such as PD dementia.   Therefore,  it is reasonable  to 
hypothesize  that inhibiting  expression  of all three  proteins  should  lead to a better  efficacy  
outcome  in PD patients  than inhibiting  just one. 
Posiphen’s  safety  has been  established  in three  Phase I clinical  studies  by [CONTACT_875206]. 
Importantly,  Posiphen  normalized  levels  of αSYN,  APP,  and tau in the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_155456]  (CSF)  
of mildly  cognitively  impaired  (MCI)  patients  at a dose of 4x60  mg/day  (Protocol  QR12001) . 
Preclinical  data proves  Posiphen’s  efficacy  in restorin g colonic  motility  in a human  SNCAA53T tg 
mouse  model  of early  PD, in restorin g memory  and learning  in an APP/PS1  transgenic  (tg) 
mouse  model  of AD, restoring  axonal  transport  in DS trisomic  mice,  preserving  memory  and 
learning  in traumatic  brain  injury  rats and preserving  the retina  in acute  glaucoma.  
αSYN,  APP,  and tau contribute  to the progression  of AD and PD in similar  ways:  they impair  
axonal  transport  and lower  neurotransmitter  and neurotrophic  factor  release,  they cause  
inflammation,  they form  aggregates,  and, finally,  they lead to nerve  cell death. In our in vitro  and 
in vivo preclinical  studies,  Posiphen  has normalized  all those  actions . 
We have conducted a proof -of-concept study in mildly cognitive impaired patients at 4x60 
mg/day  (Protocol QR12001)  and found that Posiphen lowers levels of neur otoxic proteins and of 
inflamm atory markers.  Presently, we are testing Posiphen in the DISCOVER study at 1x60, 
2x60 and 3x60 mg/day for up to 25 days to see if it changes the synthesis and degradation

Confidential   Page 15 of 58 kinetics of Aβ in a stable isotope labelling kinetic ( SILK) study.  The DISCOVER stu dy is on -
going through the ADCS and is planned for 24 patients to be enrolled; currently, approximately 
half of the study has been enrolled, and there have been no severe AE s or SAE s attributed to 
Posiphen reported.  
From our animal data, we found that P osiphen works in more than Alzheimer animals, because it 
inhibits more than one neurotoxic protein.  We found that in transgenic AD and PD animals it 
lowers levels of neurotoxic proteins and restores the affected functi on.  Therefore, we want to 
test Posip hen in a comparison study of AD and PD patients and measure not just target 
engagement, but also pathway engagement.  
From our animal data, we also found that the doses used to show an effect on neurotoxic proteins 
are very high and that we can see an effe ct of Posiphen at much lower doses. Therefore, we are 
testing Posiphen in a randomized dose de -escalation study to see what the lowest effective dose 
is in humans.  
In this study, we want to find out if the animal Posiph en data can be replicated in humans  and 
show target and pathway engagement in CSF.  Target engagement means that Posiphen would 
lower and normalize the levels of neurotoxic proteins in CSF .  Pathway engagement means that 
Posiphen would increase levels of neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factor s, and lower levels of  
inflammatory and neurodegeneration markers in both AD and PD patients .  By [CONTACT_875207], we will specify the biomarkers that change with 
Posiphen treatme nt, which will be used in late r phase  studies.  Additionally, we will assess 
function and cognition, so we can make sure that Posiphen has no deleterious effect and 
potentially identify any improvement.  Collectively, these endpoints will help assess the e fficacy 
of Posiphen and drive it to l ate phase clinical studies.

The f ollowing is a brief summary of the available  information on Posiphen. D etailed information  
can be found in the current Posiphen Clinical Investigational Brochure . 
3.1 Summary of Non -Clinical Findings  
In wild type mice, Posiphen lowered brain APP and A β levels by [CONTACT_8622] 60% ( Lahiri 2007 , 
Cullen  2006 ). In APP transgenic AD mice, Posiphen led to a decrease in APP levels, improved 
neuronal stem cell survival and increased le vels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor  (BDNF ) 
(Marutle 2007 ; Kadir 2008 , Lilja 20 13). Chronic administration of Posiphen to APP transgenic 
mice totally prevented decline in memory and learning as well as in long -term potentiation at 
brain and plasma con centrations that are 10 times lower than originally published. These plasma 
levels a re attainable with low oral dosing in humans ( Teich 2018 ). In alpha -synuclein  (αSYN) 
transgenic PD mice, Posiphen restored gut motility to normal and lowered aSYN  in the brain and 
gut of the tg PD mice. Again,  the efficacious levels were 10 times lower than originally 
published (Kuo 2019 ). In DS trisomic mice Posiphen fully restored axonal transport in vitro  and 
in vivo  (Mobley Lab, UCSD, 2019; manuscript submitted  for publication).  In summary, Posiphen 
is a translational inhibitor of APP and aSYN and fully restores function at doses that are very 
low and very safe.  
Posiphen was not m utagenic or clastogenic as assessed by [CONTACT_397761].  
The cardiac electrophysiol ogical properties of Posiphen tartrate were negative in vitro  using 
human ether -a-go-go related gene  (hERG ) transfected human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 
293). Posiphen did not adversely af fect the interval seen in an electrocardiogram (E CG) test ( QT 
(or QTc) ) interval.   
Toxicity studies in dogs showed brain toxicity (ataxia and tremors/twitching) and gastrointestinal 
(GI) toxicity at 30 mg/kg/day, which was dose -dependent an d reversible. The no observed 
adverse effect level  (NOAEL ) was 20 mg/kg/day in  dogs. Posiphen readily crosses the blood -
brain barrier. The signs/symptoms noted at high doses of Posiphen may be related to cholinergic 
manifestations. In in vitro assays, Posi phen showed minimal inhibition of AChE or BChE 
(Butyrylcholinesterase) activit y, however, a metabolic product of Posiphen, N1-norposiphen 
demonstrated acetyl cholinesterase inhibitory activity ( Yu 2013 ). There were no effects on the 
reproductive organs ass ociated with [ADDRESS_1222310] been conducted  with Posiphen  (IB 2019). The first was a single 
ascending dose ( SAD ) study in healthy volunteers; the second w as a multiple ascending dose 
(MAD ) study in healthy volunteers , and the third one was a pharmacokinetic 
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-2020  
 
Confidential   Page 19 of 58 (PK)/pharmacodynamic  study of CSF obtained from mild cognitively impaired participant s 
(Protocol QR12001) .  
In the MAD  trial, Posiphen was administered orally in doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg 4 times a day 
(QID). The first two treatments were administered for [ADDRESS_1222311] in the 60  mg group discharged because of nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and “feeling warm .” The incidence of adverse events, all e ither m ild or 
moderate severity , also occurred with similar frequency in the placebo group. The most common 
AEs were dizziness, headache, and nausea/vomiting.  
Posiphen was absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], achieving maximum plasma and CSF 
concen tration  (Cmax) within 1.2 - 1.5 hours. For the 40 and 60 mg doses, with fully defined 
plasma profiles, the mean terminal t ½’s were 3.80 ± 0.88 and 5.23 ± 1.24 hours, respectively after 
a single dose and 3.53 ± 1.03 and 4.104  ± 0.91 hours, respectively, a fter re peat dosing. The half-
life ( t½) of the plasma concentrations at the lower doses could not be calculated accurately. The 
Cmax increased disproportionally with dose (24, 144, and 2310 ng.h/mL after a single dose of 20, 
40, and 60 mg, respectively and 110, 13 4, and 2101 ng.h/mL after multiple doses of 20, 40, and 
60 mg, respectively).  
In the proof of mechanism of action study  (Protocol QR12001) , the PK of Posiphen was 
measured after 10 days of administration (4x60 mg) over [ADDRESS_1222312] dose  at day 11 of Posiphen administration.  We 
found that the plasma concentrations of Posiphen overlapped with the plasma  concentrations 
found in the MAD study. In this study, the N1 metabolite reach ed about 10 to 15%, while the 
level of the N8 metabolite reac hed about 20 to 25% of the Posiphen levels measured in plasma.  
Because a substantial proportion of the adverse event s observed in AD patients treated with 
cholinesterase inhibitors appear to reflect the cholinomimetic properties of molecules in this 
class , Posiphen’s highest tolerated dose is determined by [CONTACT_458853] N 1-norposiphen in 
blood and brain.  
While the t1/2 of Posiphen in plasma was 5 hours as seen in the SAD and MAD studies, the t1/2 in 
CSF/brain was longer than [ADDRESS_1222313].

Confidential   Page 20 of 58 4 BACKGROUND AND STUDY OVERVIEW  
4.1 Background  
A major pathological hallmark of AD is the appearance of plaques and tangles in the brain and of 
PD the appearance in the gut and in the brain of aSYN aggregates that form Lewy bodies . In 
both diseases t hese aggregates  are thought to occur one o r two decades prior to overt symptom 
development . Recent research has shown that soluble forms of phospho rylated tau (p -tau) and 
Aβ may also contribute to neuronal loss and that PD as well as AD carry a high load of 
inflammation a nd microglia activating factors that contribute to neurodegeneration.  
For small molecules that target biomarker levels, studies using CSF and plasma sampli ng in 
humans can provide data to demonstrate that a drug crosses the blood -brain barrier and engages 
the relevant target, and to describe the relationship between blood levels and CNS effects. 
Repeated sampling through a lumbar CSF catheter for 6 hours  can mirror image, what happens in 
the brain as to the levels of aSYN monomers and dimers, Aβ monomers an d dimers as well as 
other biomarkers and help guide the development of drugs targeting neurotoxic aggregating 
proteins .  
Posiphen is the (+) enantiomer of p henserine, an AChE  inhibitor which had been tested in 
several AD studies without significant evidence of efficacy . While phenserine inhibits AChE, 
Posiphen has no AChE activity itself and develops some activity in vivo with the metabolism to 
N1-bisnorposip hen. In vivo phens erine has about 200 times more AChEI activity  than 
Posiphen’s metabolite N1 -bisnorposiphen. Posiphen absorption is affected by [CONTACT_8208]; however, at 
steady state there is no effect on the PK analyses results.  
Posiphen has been found to signif icantly reduce soluble APP and A β as well as tau, p -tau and 
αSYN  in the rodent brain and  in human CSF. In preliminary studies in animals and humans , 
inhibition of APP, A β, tau, p -tau and αSYN  occurs at levels [ADDRESS_1222314] s at the 5’UTR of the  aSYN and  APP mRNA and lowers their protein expression 
levels in animal models ; it also  decreased aSYN and sAPP levels in human CSF. Our data 
suggests that these effects are achieved via the same mechan ism: the 5’UTR s of these mRNAs 
form a complex with iron regulatory protein [ADDRESS_1222315] in PD, AD as well as other neurodegenerative 
disorders.  
4.2 Study  Overview  
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-2020  
 
Confidential   Page 21 of 58 Study population:  The study will be condu cted in patients  with early  AD or early  PD. 
Dose selection : In Part 1 Posiphen will be tested at 80 mg QD  and in Part 2, Posiphen will be 
tested at 5, 10, 20, 40 mg QD , for 25±[ADDRESS_1222316] any cholinomimetic effects.  
Study Design:  Part [ADDRESS_1222317] ration of 80 mg of Posiphen  or Placebo .  Period 2  consists of an at hom e dosing 
period of 25±[ADDRESS_1222318] will undergo study 
procedures that include safety assessments (AE and concomita nt medication monitoring, 12 -lead 
ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and physical examinations), the last 
dose of Posiphen  or Placebo , and 6 hours of PK blood and CSF sampling .  At the end of 
blood/ CSF sampling, the subjects will need to stay for a minimum of 1 hour of observation but 
may stay if necessary for observation until the following  day (e.g., if the  subject has blood/CSF 
sampling on Day 25, he/she may stay for observation until Day 26 ).   After all  end-of-study 
procedures are complete , the subject will be discharged to home.   A [ADDRESS_1222319] of the study in Part 1, 
recruitment will continue uninterrupted.  The only potential change between Part 1 and Part 2 are 
the biomarkers to be measured . 
Part 2  is a study wit h 40 Early PD patients , 10 patients each  who are randomized to one of 4 
treatment conditions  of Posiphen  (5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg) . They will undergo a 
Screening Visit, and if they provide informed consent and are considered eligible per the  
inclusion  and exclusion criteria, will proceed to participate in the treatment period .  Period [ADDRESS_1222320]-time dosing in clinic with administration of 5, 10, 20 , or 40mg  of Posiphen .  
Period 2  consists of an at hom e dosing period of 25±[ADDRESS_1222321] will undergo study procedures that includ e safety assessments (AE and concomitant 
medication monitoring, 12 -lead ECGs, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs assessments, and

hour of observation but may stay if necessary  for observation until the following  day (e.g., if the 
subject has blood/CSF sampling on Day 25, he/she may stay for observation until Day 26).  After 
all end-of-study procedures are complete , the subject will be discharged to home.   A 24 -hour 
follow -up call will occur to assess the par ticipant ’s current condition and if there are any 
additional adverse eve nts to report.   
For both parts, s ubjects who drop out  during the initial 3 -week at home treatment period will be 
discontinued and replaced by [CONTACT_160516].  If 4 subjects are discontinued due to adverse events 
a safety review will be  conducted.  
Outcome measures  to assess pharmacodynamics : Trans lational  inhibition of the aSYN mRNA 
will result in decreased production of aSYN , which may be reflected by [CONTACT_875208][INVESTIGATOR_872] . Similarly, translational inhibition of the 
APP mRNA will result in decreased produc tion of APP and its fragments, which may be 
reflected by [CONTACT_875209] Aβ monomers and oligomers into the spi[INVESTIGATOR_872]. We 
also will measure secr eted sAPP α and sAPP β and levels of tau and p -tau in CSF. sAPP  reflects 
processing of APP by α-secretase to produce sAPP α and β-secretase (BACE) to produce sAPP β. 
Tau levels are being measured since  we found that  tau translation may be under the regulation of 
a similar iron-responsible element (IRE) that may also be affected by P osiphen treatment . In fact, 
we have measured in human CSF and in mouse brain that tau and p -tau levels are lowered by 
[CONTACT_798056].  
Safety outcome measures: Reports of adverse events ( AEs) and serious adverse events ( SAE s) 
during exposure to Posiphen will be collected  to ev aluate if there are any significant clinical 
safety issu es for  the study population.  All SAEs occurring up to [ADDRESS_1222322] for Posiphen ; therefore , this approach will be sufficient in the 
proposed study.  
Clinical , functional  and cognitive assessment measures:  Although clinical benefit is unlikely 
due to the sho rt duration of this study , AD and PD specific tests will be performed . It is predicted 
that cognition and function will remain stable over the course of drug exposure; however, this 
will be assessed formally in the clinic.  For both populations, the MMSE (Folstein  1975 ) will be 
administered as a global meas ure of cognition and  the Coding subtest from the Weschler Adult 
Intelligence Scales, 4th edition  (WAIS -IV) will serve as a sensitive measure of CNS dysfunction .  
The subjec ts with AD will also be administered the ADAS -Cog 14 (Schafer 2012 ).  The subjects 
with PD will be administered the Hoehn & Yahr (1967)  for determination of inclusion into the 
study .  Functional impairment will be evaluated using the Clinical Dementia Rating  (CDR)  scale  
(Berg1988 ) for AD and the MDS -UPDRS  (Goetz 2008 ) for those with PD.    
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-[ADDRESS_1222323] placebo (non -lactose compound ) will be provided.  The placebo  
used for the study consists of  microcrystalline cellulose  which is generally recognized as safe 
(GRAS), with no known side effect s anticipated.  
In clinical studies to  date, Posiphen has been well tolerated with single doses o f [ADDRESS_1222324] higher single doses . Aside from nausea and vomiting, which 
are well -known responses to treatment  with ChE inhibitors, the only consistent pattern of AEs 
entailed dizziness/faint ing, headache, and reduction in tota l serum protein. These effects w ere 
seen to varying degrees at all doses of Posiphen and also in the Placebo group. There was a 
tendency, but no definitive pattern of increased incidence of AEs with increasing dose of 
Posiphen. There have been no  SAEs in p rior clinical studies with Posiphen.  
Definitive reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
Posiphen.  As a result, w omen of childbearing potential will be excluded from participati ng in 
this study.  
5.2 Risk/Benefit Associated with Blood Collections  
Phlebotomy is associated with mild to moderate discomfort due to pi[INVESTIGATOR_458820]. This can 
be minimized with the use of a well -trained phlebotomist/nurse. Sometimes the blood draw site 
may beco me discolored with a “br uised” appearance that is transient and not painful. Rarely, the 
blood draw site may become infected and require antibiotic treatment.  
5.3 Risk/Benefit Associated with  CSF Sampling  
The most frequent adverse event associated with these s tudies was post -lumbar p uncture 
headache . This was successfully managed by [CONTACT_798057] a participant is unresponsive to 
orally administered fluids and/or caffeine.   
Other potential risks include meningitis, pain or tingling sensation in the lower ext remities, 
temporary eye weakness or double vision, infection or bleeding at the site of catheter insertion,

6 SAMPLE SIZE AN D STATISTICAL PLAN  
For P art 1:  A sample size of up to 2x14  subjects ( 10 randomized to Posiphen and 4 to Placebo 
for AD and PD respectively) is planned.  
For Part 2:  A sample size of up to 40 Early PD patients  is planned to be randomized to 
Posiphen , 10 p atients each dosed  at 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg .   
Definitions of the analys is populations  and a detailed description of the analysis rules will be 
presented in a separate  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

The statistical evaluation of our previous study in MCI patients with soluble APPα and β levels 
measured in spi[INVESTIGATOR_875194] (Protocol QR12001) can be 
used to power this study (Maccecchini 2012 ). All assay data collected were analyzed using a 
repeated measure  mixed model analysis of variance. The model included Day (Day 11/Day0) as 
a fixed effect, Time (9 t ime points per person between 0 and 6 hours) as a repeat measure effect

The statistical evaluations were undertaken by [CONTACT_875210] (Salisbury, [LOCATION_006]).  
 
 
Analysis  of sAPPα  and β using  type,  day and id as variables  shows:  
The results  of the 10 days at 8 hours  on sAPPα and β is SD = 0.1695.   
Assuming type one error, α=0.05 and type two error, β=0.2, or a power of 0.8, the calculated 
sample range of delta eff ect sizes was 0.3 to 2 SD.

Using the above data,  we can calculate that a power analysis of APPα shows the requirement of 
9 people to see a 36% change in sAPPα levels at a statistical significance level of >0.05
 
sAPPβ  
Using the above data,  we can  calculate that a power analysis of A PPβ shows the requirement of 9 
people to see a 24% change in sAPPβ levels at a statistical significance level of >0.05 . We are 
expecting changes in sAPPα and β levels to be between 20 and  50% and  for the higher doses  an 
n<[ADDRESS_1222328] the changes in alpha -synuclein and in neurotransmitters to be that 
pronounced. Therefore, we chose an n=10. If dropouts are to occur,  they will be replaced to 
allow the full sa mple size of 5 x 10 participants to be achieved.  
6.3 Safety and Tolerability Analysis  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed with physical examinations, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory values, 12-lead ECG, use of c oncomitan t medications, and AE reports. The 
frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events and laboratory abnormalities between the 
participants across the treatment  groups  will be compared . The severity of cholinergic adverse 
events will be careful ly evaluated  taking the criteria in Appendi x 2 into consideration (modified 
from the latest version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) ) as 
there  is potential for an interaction  between Posiphen and Donepezil throu gh the inhibit ion of 
AChE, thereby [CONTACT_875211] g in increas ed cholinergic activity.

and replaced by [CONTACT_160516]. If 4 subjects are discontinued due to adverse events  a safety 
review will be  conducted.  
6.4 PK An alysis  
Plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental metho ds using SAS 
version 9.4 or greater.   Calculations  will be based on the actual sampling  times  recorded during  
the study.  Since the study is blinded , all subjects ’ plasma will be included in the  PK analysis .  
From the plasma  concentration -time data, the  following  PK parameters will minimally be 
determined, as data  permit: Area under the curve ( AUC ), Cmax, Tmax, t½, and CL .  Dose -
proportion ality may be assessed on Cmax  and AUC  as appropriate. Serial pre -dose trough  
concentrations C max will be assessed for  the attainment of steady state . 
Plasm a concentration -time data for Posiphen will be listed and summarized descriptively  
(number of  subjects  (N), mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum (min), and 
maximum (max))  and graphically  presented.   PK parameters will be listed and summarized 
descr iptively  (N, mean,  median, SD, min, max, and 95% CI) by [CONTACT_636003].   In addition, 
geometric means and between -subject  coefficients of variation (CV)  will be  calculated .

7.2 Dosage  
The study drug is to be taken orally;  one caps ule, once a day in the morning , with or without 
food, for 25 days ± 2  days at home  (dependin g on when the confinement visit is scheduled ).  
Participants must take 80% of all doses (across 25±2 days).  Bottles  will be examined  in clinic  at 
the pre -confinement visit  to assess compliance overall and in the last week .  
7.3 Packaging/Dispensing/Labeling  
The study drug ( Posiphen  capsules  and placebo capsules ) will be manufactured under cGMP, in 
a manner to preserv e the blind, i.e., identical color and shape opaque HPMC hard capsule shells  
and packaged 30 capsules per bottle .  
The investigational drug supply  will be shipped directly  to the clinical sites to dispense to 
participants .  
The dosing schedule and storage requirements will be clearly explained to the partici pants and 
caregiver before dispensing the study drug , and it will be printed on the labels.  
All clinical trial material dispensed under this protocol will bear the requis ite cautionary

been achieved to continue with the confinement visit procedures.  
Site personnel will assess compliance at the pre-confinement visit and again at  the time of 
admission for the c onfinement v isit. If participants are found to be < 80% compliant  the site must 
consult with the Project Directors and/or Medical Monitor  regarding timing and conduct of the 
confinement visit procedures. It is possible that subjects will be discontinued early from the 
study d ue to insufficient drug compliance.

the blind to be unmasked for a subject for any reason, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_875212]/or Project Directors  to obtain an approval. If the blind is broken,  whether it be by 
[CONTACT_458869] t or for the welfare of the participant , the investigator MUST  contact [CONTACT_22955].   Refer to the study procedures manual for detailed procedures related to breaking the 
blind and reporting . 
7.8 Overdose  
No specific antidote for the overdose of  Posiphen is known; however, signs or symptoms of 
possible overdose should be noted and treated .  The Medical Monitor and Project Directo rs 
should be notified as well. Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually 
evolving, it is advisa ble to contact a poison control center to determine the latest 
recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug.  Although P osiphen is a weak 
AChE inhibitor, based upon overdose information published in prescribing information fo r 
related products, overdose  with AChE inhibitors can result in cholinergic crisis characterized by 
[CONTACT_798067], vomiting, salivation, sweating, brad ycardia, hypotension, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], 
collapse and convulsions. Increasing muscle weakness is a possibility and may result in death if 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_798028].  Tertiary anti -cholinergics such as atropi[INVESTIGATOR_875196]. Intravenous a tropi[INVESTIGATOR_798030].  Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_875197] ( BP) and HR have been reported with other cholinomimetics when

whether dialys is (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or hemofiltration) is an effective treatment 
for overdose.  
7.9 Concomitant Medications  
7.9.1  Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Current use of anti -coagulants (e.g., warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradax a) or anti -platelet 
drugs (e.g., Plavix )see section 12.1.1 , other than aspi[INVESTIGATOR_155752] a dose of 325  mg per day, is 
prohibited.  Prospective subjects who in consultation with the prescribing physician  can safely 
discontinue these medications for 4 weeks before screening  and remain off these medications 
throughout the study , can be considered for inclusion in the study .    
Use of the following medications is prohibited within 4 weeks of screening and throughout the

Period  1: Admission  
Subjects should arrive fasted in the early morning af ter an overnight fast.  Clinical safety labs will 
be drawn and sent to the central  lab for analys is.  
Study d rug c ompliance over the pr eceding days will be assessed. If there is an insufficient level 
of drug compliance  (less than 80% overal l), the site must  consult with the Project Directors and

It is possible that subjects will be discontinued early from the study due to insuff icient  study drug 
compliance.  
Admission  visit procedures include  conducting a Physical and Neurological Exam , administering 
functional and cognitive  evaluations and C -SSRS, collecting v ital signs , ECG , clinical labs , 
reviewing and recording a dverse events and concurrent medications . 
Perio d 2: 6-Hour Sampling  
If no medical or compliance concerns are identified during the admission procedures, the subject 
will move on to the 6-Hour Sampling Phase, which entails the following procedures:  
1. Place an intravenous line for blood  sampling .  Alternatively, blood may be sampled by 
[CONTACT_875213].   
2. Place the CSF catheter .  
3. Collect initial samples of blood and CSF  (Hour 0) . 
4. Administer last dose of assigned study drug after the  [ADDRESS_1222358] CSF  (6 mL)  and blood (10mL) every hour at the following time points: 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours . 
i. CSF and blood should be taken within ± 10 mins of hourly times . 
ii.  If unable to obtain a total of 6 mL CSF at any given collection time (e.g. 
due to participant headache or participant’s CSF productio n level), reduce 
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-2020  
 
Confidential   Page 41 of 58 the collection volume to a tolerated amount (minimum 2mL). If there  is 
poor flow at any of the time points, then the next collection could be 
skipped to allow for better flow at the subsequent collection time. For 
example, if less than 2mL  of CSF is collected at the 1 -hour time point, 
then the 2 -hour CSF collection could be skipped, and CSF collection 
would resume at the 3 -hour time point.  
b. Perform periodic safety monitoring  during the collection period . This includes 
questions  about any symptoms  in relation to the CSF catheter (inclu ding potential 
adverse events such as leg or back pain, dizziness or headaches) and vital sign 
monitoring.  Participants also should be asked about pain, red ness or swelling at 
the blood collection  site in the arm.  
c. Subjects remain on bed rest throughou t the CSF sampling period of [ADDRESS_1222359] been collected, remove the blood 
collection line and LP catheter . 
6. Perform final safe ty monitoring , a physical , and a neurological exam. 
The site should complete the LP catheter via their local practice/ procedures;  however , sites can 
refer to the LP catheter supporting documentation which will be provided.  
If the subject exp eriences intolerable AE(s) that require early discontinuation of the sampling 
procedures and remov al of the LP catheter, contact [CONTACT_875214]. If feasible, the standard 6-hour observ ation and 
discharge procedures should be followed to allow for management and follow -up on the adv erse 
events.   
Period  3: Observation  
The subject should be observed for at least [ADDRESS_1222360] nous fluids,  caffeine, and/or mild 
analgesics (e.g., Ibupro fen, N aproxen or Tylenol).  All unused study drug should be returned to 
the clinical site for final accountability.

However, if an investigator removes a subject from treatment or study, or if a subject declines 
further treatment or st udy participation, an early discontinuation visit will be completed as soon 
as possible following discontinuation. The early discontinuation visit will contain the same 
assessments  as the confinement  (admission)  visit. If an in -person visit is not possible , site 
personnel will complet e as much of the early discontinuation visit as possible by [CONTACT_756].  
Subjects who discontinue from the study prior to completing all protocol procedures  may be 
replaced at the discretion of the Coordinating Center, in consult ation with the Sponsor.  
10.1 Reaso ns for Early Discontinuation

14 ADVERSE EVENTS  (AEs)   
14.1 Definition  
An AE is defined as per the US Code of Federal Regulation, Title 21, Part 312.32 
[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=312.32 ]. An AE is any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in hu mans, whether or not 
considered drug related.  
Collection of adverse events will begin once infor med consent is signed and will continue until 
the follow -up phone call performed on the day after discharge.  Adverse events include but are 
not limited to: (1)  worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions or 
symptoms present at the start of the study; (2) Subject deterioration due to primary illness; (3) 
intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction. An abnormal laboratory value will only  be reported 
as an AE if the investigator considers it clinically  significant, or if it leads to  the Subject being 
withdrawn from the study.  
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and or other clinic al information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE 
and not the individu al signs or symptoms. Symptoms and conditions present at the beginning of 
the study will be characterized, so that A Es can be defined as any new symptom, or any  increase 
in frequency or severity of an existing symptom. Adverse events should be described wi th 
medical terminology so that the event can be matched against a medical coding dictionary, such 
as MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities).  
Investigators should report their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to the 
protocol  procedure, and to the investigational product, and/or drug delivery system used in the 
protocol.   
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-[ADDRESS_1222370]’s 
records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice, and on the AE electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ). 
14.[ADDRESS_1222371]  subsided, the 
conditions are considered medically stable, or the subjects are no longer available for follow up. 
Subjects who discontinue due to adverse experi ences will be treated and followed according to 
established medical practice. All pertinent info rmation will be entered into the eCRF. Adverse 
events will be reported to the Medical Monitor, Sponsor, and  DSMB , per Coordinating Center 
SOPs and the DSMB Char ter. 
Because of the potential of additive cholinergic adverse events caused by a combination of 
Posiphen and cholinesterase inhibitors in some subjects , the severity of such adverse events 
should be carefully evaluated taking the criteria in Appendix 2 into consideration (modified from 
CTCAE version 4.03.)  
15 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
15.1 Definition  
A SAE is defined as per the US Code of Federal Regulation, Title 21, Part 312.32 
[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=312.32 ]. 
An adverse event or suspected adverse react ion is considered “serious ” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5183] o f existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171763], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the Subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
15.2 Reporting SAEs  
Collection of serious adverse events will b egin once informed consent is signed (regardless of 
study drug exposure) and will continue until [ADDRESS_1222372] Directors and the 
Coordinating Center wi thin 24 hours of learning of the event. This in turn will trigger an alert to 
Protocol ANVS [ZIP_CODE]   Ver. 3.0; 8-21-[ADDRESS_1222373]  (DSMB)  
A DSMB will review the safety information from the study  on an ongoing basis. The DSMB, 
will identify the study -specific data parameters and format of the information to be reported , as 
well as the timing of reports based on the enrollment status of the study . The DSMB will initially 
be provided with data blinded to treatment status, but they may request unblinded  data if there is 
a safety concern.  
Additionally, the DSMB will  be informed of the occurrence of any serio us adverse events within 
[ADDRESS_1222374]  of the study. These may include amending safety monitoring procedures, modifying the 
protocol or consent, terminating the study or continuing the study as designed. Using the Safety 
Review Process (review of lab data, vitals, and adverse events) and the D SMB, there is 
substantial oversight and case review to alert the investigators, in a timely manner, to any  safety 
issues that may arise. Further details  will be provided in  the DSMB charter.

the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_325567]’s legally acceptable representative, and by [CONTACT_875220] t discussion. Subjects will be provided a copy of the signed ICF.  
The informed consent will not only cover consent for the trial itself, but for the genetic 
samples/data/storage and biomarker samples/data/storage as well. Consent fo rms will specify 
that DN A and biomarker samples are for research purposes only; the tests on the DNA and 
biomarker samples are not diagnostic in nature and subjects will never receive results.  
19 STUDY MONITORING   
The clinical monitor is responsible for inspe cting the case report forms  (CRFs)  and source 
documentation at specific time points throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol, 
completeness and accuracy of the data, and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research.  The monitoring visits must be conducted according to the applicable ICH and 
FDA guidelines to ensure protocol adherence, quality of data, drug accountability, compliance 
with regulatory requirements and continued adequacy of the investigational site and its f acilities. 
The Site Investigator will cooperate in the monitoring process by [CONTACT_875221], source documents and other necessary documents at the time of the monitoring visits. Site 
Investigator will promptly address any matters bro ught to his/her attention by [CONTACT_2037]. The 
Site Investigator may also be asked to meet in -person with the site monitor during certain visits.  
20 AUDIT  
In accordance with ICH E6 (Good Clinical Practices) representatives of the Coordinating Center 
and/or Spo nsor and/or regulatory agency may select this study for audit. The investigator and 
study staff are responsible for maintaining the site master file containing all study -related 
regulatory documentation as outlined by [CONTACT_875222] , Sponsor, its designees, and/or regulatory agencies. Inspection of site 
facilities (e.g., pharmacy, laboratories) to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with the 
protocol may also occur.

EVENTS (ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST)   
Because of the potential of additive cholinergic adverse events caused by a combination of 
Posiphen and cholinesterase inhibitors in some subjects the severity of such adverse events 
should be carefully evaluated taking the criteria below into consideration (modified from 
“CTCAE vers ion 4.03.)  
Adverse 
Event  Mild  Moderate  Severe

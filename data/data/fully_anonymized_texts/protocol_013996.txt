Trial Design This is an exploratory, Phase 2, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, multisite trial, which will compare the safety and 
efficacy of a 10 mg/kg/day dose of GWP42003-P versus placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. 
Patients will be screened and if they meet eligibility criteria, they will be 
randomized to receive GWP42003-P or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. 
Patients will be stratified based on their age (6 to 11, 12 to 17), use of antipsychotics (on versus off), and region (North America versus Rest of the World). Patients will be adminis tered 5 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P or 
matching volumes of placebo for 1 week and then 10 mg/kg/day 
GWP42003-P or matching volumes of placebo for 11 weeks. At the end of treatment, patients will taper the medication over 1 week. 
In order to facilitate trial execution in the context of infectious diseases or 
other transmissible conditions (e.g., COVID-19), the trial will involve a combination of clinic, remote (includi ng a video call and a home nurse visit) 
and telephone visits, as specified in APPENDIX 1.
Sample Size 160 patients randomized to  allow for 144 evaluable patients 
(72 evaluable patients pe r arm) at trial end.

3.[ADDRESS_31021] approximately 1 in every 54 children aged 8 years 
and is reported to occur in all racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups1. Associated comorbid 
symptoms can include intellectual disabilit y, language impairment, motor abnormalities (for 
example, motor delay, hypotonia,  catatonia and deficits in c oordination), gastrointestinal 
problems, sleep disorders, psychiatric comorbidities (most commonly anxiety and depression) 
and behavioral dysregulation such  as aggression, impulsivity, irr itability, and self-injurious 
behavior2. Autism Spectrum Disorder is approximate ly 4 times more common in boys than in 
girls1.
Autism Spectrum Disorder is diagnosed through developmental screening (18 and 24 months, 
although additional screening might be  needed if a child is at high risk for ASD [e.g., an affected 
sibling] or if symptoms are present) and comprehensive diagnostic ev aluation. Diagnostic tools 
usually rely on parents’ or caregivers’ desc riptions of their child’s development and a 
professional’s observation of the child’s behavior2,3.  
There is currently no single st andard treatment for ASD. Curre nt options for these patients 
include early intervention services, behavioral management therapy, educ ation and school-based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], nutritional therapy, a nd medication treatment. Medications are often used to manage 
certain behaviors, such as irr itability, aggression, and self-injury3,4. To date, the US FDA has 
approved 2 drugs for treating irritability associated with  ASD (risperidone [RISPERDAL®] and 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] [ABILIFY®]); however, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of the core 
ASD symptoms (repetitive behavior; communication and social issues). Selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (fluoxetine [PROZAC®], fluvoxamine [LUVOX®], sertraline [ZOLOFT®], 
and clomipramine [ANAFRANIL®]) can help to reduce repetitive behaviors and increase social 
contact, yet these drugs carry an FDA black box warning regarding potential increased risk of 
suicidal thoughts or attempts in  children and adolescents. Anti-ep ileptic drugs are also required 
in patients with seizures.

GWP42003-P is the substance code for the IM P, purified CBD under development by [CONTACT_31661] a number of conditions, incl uding childhood onset epi[INVESTIGATOR_31627]. 
GWP42003-P is extracted from Cannabis sativa  L. plants, has a defined chemical profile, and 
contains consistent leve ls of CBD as the principal phytoca nnabinoid. Extracts from these plants 
are processed to yield pure ( &%'WKDWW\SLFDOO\FRQWDL QVOHVVWKDQZZ7+& . 
The pure CBD is subsequently dissolved in exci pi[INVESTIGATOR_31628]. 
Cannabidiol demonstrates anticonvul sant, antipsychotic, anxiolytic, neuroprotective, antioxidant, 
and anti-inflammatory activity5.Anti-seizure effects of GWP42003- P have been demonstrated in 
clinical trials of childhood onset epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629]6and GWP42003-P has received FDA approval and 
by [CONTACT_31662] 
2 years of age and older (EMA approval is for treatment in conjunction with clobazam).
Cannabidiol possesses very low affinity and lacks appreciable functional activity at CB 
receptors; CB1 and CB26. In addition, CBD does not signifi cantly interact with enzymes 
responsible for the synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, at clinically relevant 
concentrations7,8. Other data exist describing th e polypharmacology of CBD at multiple 
7-transmembrane receptor systems, ion channels, transporters and enzymes7,8although this is 
often at concentrations (> 10 M) that are unlikely to be clinically relevant.
At least [ADDRESS_31022] is modulation of 
intracellular Ca2+ mobilization via antagonism of GPR 55 and/or activati on (and subsequent 
desensitization) of TRP channels, particularly TRPV 16. The second is inhibition of adenosine 
reuptake6.
Importantly, CBD does not produce THC-like euphoric effects. 
 Cannabidiol oral solution has been studied in placebo-controlled clinical  trials as adjunctive 
treatment of seizures associated with LGS and DS  and is being used on a compassionate basis, as 
part of a series of expanded access IND applica tions in variety of refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_31630], 
mainly in pediatric patients. This meaningful c linical trial exposure has yielded safety data on 
over 1,419 unique patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_31631], with 391 patients with more  than 1 year of continuous 
exposure. 
In general, the key risks identified from the c linical development program for LGS and DS are 
broadly expected to be the same for the AS D population – as the patient demographics and 
comorbidities have a significant amount of overlap. It  is important to note that several of the key

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep15risks for CBD-OS are dose related, as such the lower doses planned for the current trial may 
improve the tolerability of CBD-OS:
Hepatocellular injury is anticipated to be an important risk for CBD-OS in ASD patients, 
although to date the transaminase elevations obs erved with CBD-OS trea tment have generally 
been asymptomatic, with no Hy’s law cases re ported from any source. The proposed dose level 
of 10 mg/kg/day may provide an improved tolerability compared to the 10 and 20 mg/kg/day doses employed in the LGS and DS program. Furthermore, the transaminase elevations in LGS and DS patients were markedly more frequent and of a greate r magnitude in patients taking 
concomitant VPA. Of note, VPA use is expected  to be less frequent in the ASD population than 
in the LGS and DS populations, providing an add itional avenue to an imp roved tolerability to 
CBD-OS with respect to potential hepatocellular injury. 
Somnolence type events are anticipated to be  important risks for CBD-OS in ASD patients; 
however, from experience in LGS and DS patient s, such events were manageable, and only a 
minority needed to discontinue CBD-OS. Dose ad justment should help miti gate any events of 
somnolence and sedation if needed. The somnolence may also diminish with repeated dosing 
over time.
Cannabidiol oral solution has been shown to cause loss of weight in clinical trials, however the 
incidence of a significant loss of weight (> 5%) was noted to be similar between the CBD-OS 
dose of 10 mg/kg/day and placebo in placebo-co ntrolled trials. There was no impact on growth, 
as measured through BMI or height in these trials. 
In DS/LGS studies, aggression was reported in 2.2% of patients in th e 10 mg/kg/day group while 
irritability was reported in 7.2% of patients in the 10 mg/ kg/day group. The majority of cases 
reported were of mild or moderate severity with only few cases leading to withdrawal from these 
trials.
A higher incidence of pneumonia was noted w ith CBD-OS in LGS and DS controlled trials, 
although incidence does not appear to be dose rela ted, majority of patient s has risk factors for 
pneumonia and no plausible mechanism has been identified. 
Rash has been reported more of ten in CBD-OS patients compared with placebo patients in the 
controlled trials in LGS and DS. Importantly, none showed syste mic involvement or involvement 
of mucous membranes; generally, the rash events have be en self-limiting without serious 
outcomes.

Both FDA-approved agents (risperidone [RISPERDAL in 2006] and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] [ABILIFY in 
2009]) are indicated for irritability and associated  with potential for neurological and metabolic 
adverse effects; in Europe none of these drugs are specifically approved for use in ASD. There 
are no approved drugs for the treatment of the core ASD symptoms. 
CBD has the potential to modulate some of the pathophysiological mechanisms thought to 
underly ASD. CBD has also shown benef it in a range of pharmacological, brain 
injury-associated and genetic m odels of relevant medical cond itions, which exhibit behavioral
deficits similar to those seen in ASD, including deficits in social be havior, cognition, language, 
motor abnormalities,  and seizures6.
There is clinical literature on open-label investigations of cannabinoids extracts, containing CBD 
and THC, in ASD9,10,11,12. Data from these investigations  suggest some positive effects on 
behavior however data have generally been co llected using non-validated measures, flexible 
dosing schedules and variable cannabinoid content formulations, all of which render the results 
difficult to interpret. To date, data from 1 single placebo-controlled trial of a formulation containing CBD and THC in a ratio of 20:[ADDRESS_31024] of GWP42003-P on core symptoms ASD and major

Efficacy Measures
The core symptoms of autism are the symptoms required for its diagnosis. Per DSM-5, the core 
symptoms cover 2 domains: persis tent deficits in social communication and social interaction
AND restricted, repetitive patterns of be havior, interests,  or activities. 
Effects on the core symptom ‘persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction’ 
will be evaluated using the Vineland-3. The challenges measuring social communication are well 
reported14. Measures such as the widely used SRS have been shown to be highly susceptible to 
placebo effect, other measures are limited in scope or age range. The Vineland is a well validated

disabilities (although the majority of  published studies used the prev ious version Vineland-2). It 
was identified by [CONTACT_31663]14as an appropriate measure with  conditions with one of the 
limitations being possibly requiring a longer period to show sensitivity to change. Since, the 
Vineland-2, and in particular the socialization and communica tion domains, were reported to 
detect improvement over a 12-week treatment15. Importantly these [ADDRESS_31025] concern to caregivers16. The 
ABC-I is a well validated questi onnaire with excellent reliability17, which will be used to 
evaluate effects in these problem  behaviors. The ABC was designe d to measure treatment effects 
and has been used extensively in clinical trial in autism and other neurode velopmental disorders. 
The ABC-I in particular has been shown to be sensitive to treatment change, having been a primary endpoint for both risperidone and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_31632]. 
The remaining subscale scores of the ABC (social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, 
hyperactivity/noncompliance,  and inappropriate speech) assess ot her aberrant behaviors relevant 
in ASD.
The CGI-S and CGI-I are widely used outcome measures in clinical trials with well accepted 
face validity
18.The CGI-I in particular is known to be sensitive to treatment  changes. Being a 
global measure, changes CGI-I reinforce the clinically meaningfulness of  changes reported in 
symptom specific outcomes.

2 Choice of Dosing Regimen
Doses of up to 50 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P have been adminis tered in the GW clinical 
development programs for GWP42003-P. At the time of protocol authoring, a total of 
approximately 4,[ADDRESS_31026] received GWP42003-P from blinded and open-label GW-
sponsored trials and supportive programs (e xpanded access and other compassionate use 
programs), including patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (data cutoff date: Feb 2020). From  these data sources 
the following warnings and precautions were established: hepatocellular injury, somnolence and 
sedation, suicidal behavior and ideation, hypersensitivity reacti ons, and withdrawal of AEDs. Of 
note, routine liver monitoring is required with th e use of CBD-OS. To date, the available safety 
data collected showed that the reported AEs were usually mild or moderate in severity and resolved. There have been few withdrawals due to AEs. 
Efficacy of CBD against cognitive and social behavioral deficits in relevant animal models has 
been found over a range of doses from 2 to 200 mg/kg in a model a nd endpoint dependent 
manner
6, with the top dose of the tested dose range overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_31633] 50 to 200 mg/kg/day in nonclinical models6.It is therefore expected that clinical 
anticonvulsant doses (10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/da y as per studies in LGS or DS patients) 
should provide meaningful exposures  to explore efficacy in ASD. 
The doses used across the investigations reported in the literature referencing the use of CBD 
and THC in ASD are variable but mostly fall between 2 and 10 mg/kg/da y CBD. In particular, 
the target dose in the randomized, placebo-controlled trial9was 10 mg/kg day CBD (with a 
maximum CBD daily dose of 420 mg and an  average daily dose of 5.5 mg/kg/day). 
The GWND19189 trial will evaluate the efficacy a nd safety of 10 mg/kg/day CBD-OS (dosed as 
5 mg/kg/day b.i.d.) versus placebo. The dose of 10 mg/kg day was selected as it is within the

Protocol Version 2.0, 24 Nov 2020

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep15clinical therapeutic range for GWP42003-P in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_25280] (LGS and 
DS).
The IMP solution contains 7.9% w/v anhydrous etha nol, which is required as sucralose is not 
soluble in sesame oil. The proposed dose of 10 mg/kg/day (administered as 5 mg/kg b.i.d.) will 
result in a BAC of 0.0065 g/L whic h equates to ethanol inges tion of 3.95 mg/kg. Both these 
amounts are well under the threshold for BAC of  0.125 g/L and ethanol ingestion of 75 mg/kg 
for patients 6 years and older. Twi ce daily (b.i.d) dosing is recommended for this clinical trial in 
accordance with the approved FDA label fo r CBD-OS (GWP42003-P) in the treatment of 
seizures associated with LGS or  DS in patients 2 years of age and older. Twice daily dosing 
should also minimize the potential risk of acute AEs related to C max. Further, peak trough ratios 
would be reduced, and improved pa tient adherence may reduce the potential clinical risks of a 
 patient/care psychological viewpoint. 
Concomitant administration of CBD-OS with a high fat meal resulted in a predictable increase in 
CBD exposure and less total subject  variability. The IMP will theref ore be taken preferentially 
with food i.e., within 30 minutes after the end of a meal/snack, and the time of IMP 
administration in relation to food should be  kept consistent throughout the trial. 
3.3.3 Benefit-Risk
There are no approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD and there are limited options 
for the management of comorbidities. 
Nonclinical and clinical data indicate that  CBD-OS may benefit pa tients with ASD (see 
Section 3.3 ).
The key risks identified from the CBD-OS clin ical development program for LGS and DS 
(described in Section 3.2 ) are broadly expected to be the same for the ASD population, as the 
patient demographics and como rbidities have a significant amount  of overlap. Importantly, the 
risk of raised transaminases is reduced in the context of this ASD trial, where the lower dose of 
CBD-OS will be used and VPA use is expected to be lower in this population. 
In the context of the anticipated benefit of CBD-OS in ASD patients, the key risks identified 
from the CBD-OS clinical deve lopment program in LGS and DS are acceptable given the 
proposed dose level of 10 mg/kg/day and the age range of 6 to 17 years. Thus, the overall 
benefit-risk for the development of CBD -OS in the ASD population is favorable.

4.1 Trial Design
This is an exploratory, Phase 2, double-blind, ra ndomized, placebo-contro lled, multisite trial, 
which will compare the safety and efficacy of a 10/mg/kg/day dose of GWP42003-P versus 
placebo in children and adolescents with ASD. 
Patients will be screened  and if they meet eligibility criteria will be randomized to receive 
GWP42003-P or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients will be stratif ied based on their age 
(6 to 11, 12 to 17), use of antipsychotics (on v ersus off), and region (North America versus Rest 
of the World). Patients will be administered 5 mg/kg/day GWP [ZIP_CODE]-P or matching volumes of 
placebo for 1 week and then 10 mg/kg/day GW P42003-P or matching volum es of placebo for 
11 weeks. At the end of treatment, patients will taper the medication over 1 week.A schematic ( Figure 1-1 ), presented at the end of Section 1 , depi[INVESTIGATOR_31634]. More 
detailed information on tr eatment and trial proced ures is provided in Section 8 and Section 9 , 
respectively. Eligible patients may be randomi zed 7 to 14 days after the screening visit (Visit 1), once all 
required assessments have been completed and laboratory results have been reviewed; if 
required, screening assessment may be spi[INVESTIGATOR_31635] 2 visits; however both visits must fall into the 
7 to 14 day window prior to randomization (Visit 2). One week and 2 weeks following 
randomization, there will be 2 safe ty telephone visits (Visit 3 and 4). The patient will return to 
the clinic or video call and home nurse visit, 4 weeks after randomization (Visit 5). Six weeks after randomization, there will be another safety call (Visit 6), and th en the patient will return for 
a clinic visit or video call visit (Visit 7) [ADDRESS_31027] 12 weeks after randomization (Visit 8) . If at any point it is decided to withdraw a 
patient from the trial, the patient should return to the clinic as soon as possible and complete Visit 8 procedures. At Visit 8, patients will commence to taper the medication (unless in case of withdrawal the medication was already discontinue d or continued dosing is  inadvisable, e.g., due 
to an AE). At the end of taper, the patient will return to the clinic or video call and home nurse 
visit (Visit 9). All patients will ha ve a follow-up safety telephone vi sit, 14 days after Visit 9 or 
Visit 8 (in case the patient did not taper the medication).
Visit windows are allowed as defined in the sc hedule of assessment. Visit 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 
8 days and windows are counted from the day of randomization (Visit 2). Visit 9 day and 
window is counted from the day of Visit 8. Vis it 10 day and window is counted from the day of

Before patients may be entered into the trial, GW requi res a copy of the relevant center’s
IRB/EC written approval of the protocol, informed consent/assent forms and other patient
information material. Patients will be considered enrolled in the trial from the time of providing 
written informed consent/assent. All patients and/or parent(s)/legal representatives, where appropriate, must personally sign and date the consent/asse nt and, if allowed per local 
regulations, prior to any proce dures being performed (refer to Section 9.1.1  and Section 15.2 ).
7.1 Treatment Assignment
At the start of Visit 1, enrolled patients will be allocated a unique patient number. After 
confirmation of e ligibility at Visit 2, patients will be stratified and randomly allocated to 
GWP42003-P or matching volumes of placebo using the RTSM in a 1:1 ratio. GW will provide 
all IMP in a packed and labeled state and the RTSM will identify the pack number to be 
dispensed to the patient at each relevant visit, according to the treatment assigned in the 
randomization schedule.

8.[ADDRESS_31040] Dos age, Administration and Schedule
For details regarding IMP formulations, see Section 5 . 
8.1.1 Dose Administration
GWP42003-P or placebo will be administered orally b.i.d. (morning and evening) using the 
syringe(s) provided, preferentially with food i.e., within 30 minutes after the end of a 
meal/snack. The first dose of GWP42003-P or pla cebo is taken at home in the evening. The time 
of IMP administration in relation to food should be kept consistent  throughout the trial. Volume 
of IMP to be determin ed by [CONTACT_4676]’s weight. 
The daily volumes of IMP solution to be taken will be calculated based on the patients’ weight 
and the dosing schedule will be provided to the caregiver. 
8.1.2 Dose Escalation, Adjustments, and Taper
Patients will be administered 5 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P or matc hing volumes of placebo for 
1 week and then 10 mg/kg/day GWP42003-P or matching volumes of placebo for 11 weeks. 
If an unacceptable AE develops at any time during the dose escalation or treatment periods, 
dosing should be reduced, at the i nvestigator’s discretion and in a blinded manner, until the event 
has resolved or is well tolerate d. The end of treatment taper sche dule should be used to guide 
dose adjustment. If required, dosing may be susp ended. Patients whose dose has been decreased 
should have their dose increased again, if the tole rability improves. Patients unable to tolerate the 
target dose may stay at a lower dose. If a patie nt cannot tolerate a dose of 5 mg/kg/day, the 
investigator should discuss with the medical mon itor whether patient con tinuation in the trial is 
recommended. Single dose volumes must be at least 0.1 mL. 
Transaminase elevations should be  medically managed by [CONTACT_31670], following discussion with the medical monitor, by [CONTACT_31671] (as per Section 10 ). For potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury see Section 12.9 . 
Dose adjustments should be di scussed with the GW medical monitor. The final decision 
regarding dose adjustments should be taken by [CONTACT_093]. 
At the end of treatment, patient s will taper the medication in steps of -2.5 mg/kg/day every 
2 days.

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep158.2 Concomitant Therapy
It is theoretically possible that GWP42003-P may modify the metabolism of other drugs 
(including AEDs) administered concurrently and there remains the possibility of 
pharmacological interactions between GWP42003-P and other concurrently administered drugs. 
Doses of any concomitant medications for ASD related symptoms must have been stable for at least [ADDRESS_31041] ma nagement. Decisions should be based on clinical 
symptoms and not plasma levels of concomitant medications. Further information on drug 
interactions can be found in the IB
6. Dose reductions for concomitant medications for ASD 
related symptoms are permitted on clinical grounds (e.g., due to AEs or transaminase elevations 
not meeting withdrawal criteria specified in Section 10  and Section 12.8  following discussion 
with the medical monitor). 
Any non-pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., psychos ocial interventions, dietary supplements, 
probiotics, speech therapy, etc.) must also be stable up to [ADDRESS_31042] be recorded on the CRF. 
8.3 Prohibited Therapy During Trial Period
The following medications are prohibited for the duration of the trial beginning from the date of 
the screening visit. However, any patients ta king these medications after randomization should 
not be discontinued from treatment unless there are safety concerns. 
Care should be taken with drugs, or their metabolites, that are cytochrome P450 2C19 substrates, 
such as N-desmethylclobazam and are excluded as indicated below. Care should also be taken 
with drugs, or their metabolites, that are solely or primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_31672]-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 and 2B7.

visit and documented accordingly with in the patient’s source documents. 
Records of IMP accountability will be maintained according to Section 5.3.4 . 
8.5 Access to Blinded Treatment Assignment
The identity of IMP assigned to patients will be held by [CONTACT_31673]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12758], or 
his/her designee, is responsible for ensuring that information on how to access the RTSM system 
is available to the relevant staff in case of an emergency and unblinding is required. A patient’s 
treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of th e treatment is essential to 
make a decision on the medical management of the patient. Unblinding for any other reason will 
be considered a protocol deviation. 
The investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_31674]. However, to prevent delays to the investigat or or medical personnel 
responding to a potentially emergent situati on, unblinding of trial me dication will not be 
dependent upon the investigator receiving a pproval from the medical monitor (i.e., the 
investigator will be able to obtain the code break information independent of contact[CONTACT_31675]).
If the investigator does unblind, they must contact  [CONTACT_22840] [ADDRESS_31044] document the time, date and reason(s) for unblinding in the patient’s medical

In order to facilitate trial execution in the context of infectious diseases or other transmissible 
conditions (e.g., COVID-19), the tria l will involve a combination of  clinic, remote (including a 
video call and a home nurse visit) and telephone visits, as specified in APPENDIX 1 . The 
investigator will determine in discussion with the caregiver by [CONTACT_765] 2 which visits will be performed at clinic or remotely. If at any point  there is motive for concern (e.g., AE of concern, a 
score of 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS) the patient should attend the clinic for fu rther assessment (either 
for a scheduled visit or for an unscheduled vis it). Unscheduled visits and assessments may be 
performed in the event of a safety concern, as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Data from any unscheduled visits or assessments should be reported on the unscheduled visits eCRF. 
When remote visits are agreed thes e may require (as per visit schedule): 
xA home nurse visit to collect blood and urine samples (including urin e dipstick), and vital 
signs. 
xA video call with the child and the caregiver to review IMP usage, adverse events, changes 
in concomitant medications, perform clinical interviews (C-SSRS and Vineland-3), and 
patient observation for assessm ent of CGI-S and CGI-I. 
xThe caregiver to complete the caregiver questionnaires electronically (ABC and ). 
xIMP review by [CONTACT_31676]/collection.
All events must take place within the protoc ol window; further guidance will be provided in a 
site manual. 
A list of the required trial procedur es is provided in the subsections that follow; refer also to the 
schedule of assessments ( APPENDIX 1 ). 
Patient functional assessments, i.e., th e WASI-II, ADOS-2,  
 should be performed prior to any invasive assessments being carried out. All 
assessments should reflect the patie nt’s regular state; therefore, it should be ensured the patient 
had adequate time to settle prior to each assessment.
Assessments or tests that are not  done and examinations that are not conducted must be reported 
as such on the electronic CRF.

9.1.1 Informed Consent
The parent(s)/legal representativ e of minor patients must pers onally sign and date the IRB/EC
approved ICF before any trial-specific procedures are performed or any patient-related data is 
recorded for the trial. In addition, assent will be taken (if allowed pe r local regulations) along 
with parent(s)/legal representative consent, using IRB/EC-approved forms. It is expected that the 
majority of patients w ill have sufficient understanding to provide assent; if the investigator 
assesses the patient as not ha ving sufficient understanding or co mmunication ability to provide 
assent, this must be clearly recorded in the pa tient notes. The explicit wish of a minor, who is 
capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_31638], to re fuse participation in 
or to be withdrawn from the clinical trial at a ny time must be considered by [CONTACT_093]. 
Investigators must record in the patient notes any reason(s) why a minor is unable to sign a form.
The original signed ICF should be retained and a copy provided to the patient and/or 
parent(s)/legal representative. Patients/parent(s) /legal representative will be given the option of 
being informed about the summary outcome and results  of the trial as part of the ICF. For further 
details, see Section 15.2 .

willing to use highly effective contraception for the duration of the trial and for 12 weeks 
thereafter. Highly effective methods of contra ception are defined as those, alone or in 
combination, that result in a low failure rate (i.e ., less than 1% per year) when used consistently 
and correctly
20. Such methods include hormonal c ontraception (the use of hormonal 
contraception must be supplemented with a barrier method [preferably male condom]), an 
intrauterine device/hormone-rel easing system, bilateral tubal oc clusion, vasectomized partner 
(provided that partner is the so le sexual partner of the trial pa tient and that the vasectomized 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success), or sexual abstinence21.

sterile by [CONTACT_31657]) must have agreed that they are willing to use male contraception (condom) or remain sexually abstinent during the tr ial and for 12 weeks thereafter. 
Abstinence, as referenced above, is only acceptable as true abstinence, i.e., when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Pe riodic abstinence (calendar,

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep15The CGI questionnaire is split into 2 scales; the CG I-S scale and the CGI-I scale. The CGI-S is a 
7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinic ian’s experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. The 
clinician is asked: Considering your total clinical experience with this particular population, 
how ill is the patient at this time? This is rated as: 1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 
3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; or 7 = extremely ill.
The second section, the CGI-I, is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much 
the patient’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the 
intervention. The clinician is asked: Compared to the patient’s condition at admission to the 
project, how much has the patient changed? This is rated as: 1 = very much improved; 2 = much 
improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worse; 6 = much worse; or 7 = very much worse. 
The CGI will be completed by [CONTACT_093].

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep1512 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING
12.1 Definitions
12.1.1 Adverse Event
For the purposes of this trial an AE is defined as:
Any new unfavorable/unintended signs/symptoms (including abnorma l laboratory findings when 
relevant), or diagnosis or worsening of a pre-existing condition, which occurs following 
screening and at any point up to the post-treatment, safety follow- up visit, which may or may not 
be considered to be related to the IMP. Any even t that is the result of a trial procedure must be 
recorded as an AE. 
Surgical/Investigational procedures are not AEs. The medical reason for the procedure is the AE. 
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643]-trial existing cond itions or elective procedures are not AEs. The 
exception may be if the patient has an AE duri ng hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31644] w ould be considered a SAE (refer to Section 12.2 ). 
If reporting a fatal event, the SAE term should be the underlying cause of the death (e.g., disease 
or medical condition leading to death). 
12.1.[ADDRESS_31059] the IM P is developed (e.g., change in 
dose, population, monitoring need, consent forms). Th is is particularly true for events that 
threaten life or function. Such SAEs will be reported promptly to regulatory authorities, 
applicable IRBs/ECs and investig ators (expedited reporting) by [CONTACT_31694]. 
An AE must only be classed as serious, i.e., a SAE, when the event falls into one of the 
following criteria:
xResults in death. 
xIs life-threatening*. 
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31645]. 
xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
xIs medically significant**.

Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep15*The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which, hypothetically,
might have caused death if  it were more severe.
**Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations. Important medica l events may not be immediately life-threatening 
or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31646]. These should also usually be 
considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscras ias or convulsions that do not result in

event. GW PVD will be automatically notified that an SAE has been recorded. Any additional 
information required for a case (follow-up or corrections to the original case) will be requested 
by [CONTACT_31695].
The investigator should continue to document all AEs which occur up to the last formal 
follow-up observational period. If the investigator subsequently becomes aware of any deaths or 
a new IMP-related SAE after the last formal fo llow-up period of the trial, these should still be 
reported to the GW PVD.Any other problem discovered after the follow-up visit which is deemed to be an unexpected 
safety issue and is likely to have an impact on patients who have taken part  in the trial must be 
treated as an SAE and reported to the GW PVD. Such post-trial SAEs do not need to be recorded 
on the patient’s eCRF if editing rights to the eCRF have been removed due to final trial data lock. GW PVD may request safety follow-up information after the final trial visit in order to 
investigate a potential safety issue.

The GW PVD will be automatically notified that a pregnancy has been recorded. Any additional 
information required for a case (follow-up or corrections to the original case) will be requested 
by [CONTACT_31697]. The investigator is not obliged 
to actively monitor for any pregnancies that comm ence more than 90 days after the final dose of 
IMP. However, if the investigator becomes aware of a new pregnancy outside this time limit, 
then he/she should report it as above. The GW  PVD will follow-up for all pregnancy outcomes.
12.[ADDRESS_31062] be reported as such. The expression “reasonable causal 
relationship” is meant to convey in general that ther e are facts (evidence) or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship.
The following question which must be answered by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator for all AEs is used to capture 
the reasonable causal relationship of an event to the IMP:
“In your opi[INVESTIGATOR_31647] a plausible relationship to the IMP?” The answer is either “yes” or
“no”.
Events that start before the first dose of IMP (pre-treatment) should be considered as not causally 
related. Where a pre-treatment event worsens in severity following the first dose of IMP, a new 
event record should be entered into the eCRF.
Considering the explanation given above, investigators are strongly  encouraged to express their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_31648]. For individual patients, the investigator is usually 
in the best position to assess the underlying susp ected cause of an AE. For all AEs and especially
SAEs, it is important that the investigator assess not only the possible role of the IMP but also 
other potential contributing factors. Factors for consideration of the underlying cause may 
include:

12.6 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events
All AEs (including SAEs) occurring during the tr ial will be reported on the running logs in the 
AE section of the eCRF. This includes all events from the time following screening up to and 
including the post-trial follow-up visit, whether or not attributed to IMP and observed by [CONTACT_31698].
The following information will need to be provided for all AEs:
A) Adverse Event (Diagnosis or Syndrome if Known, or Signs and Symptoms)
Where the investigator cannot determine a diagnosi s, signs or symptoms should be recorded in 
the AE section of the eCRF. Once a diagnosis has been determined the AE section of eCRF must 
be updated to reflect the diagnosis in replacement of the original symptoms. In circumstances 
where only a provisional diagnosis is possible (wor king diagnosis), the eCRF must be updated to 
reflect the provisional diagnosis in replacement of the original symptoms. In some circumstances 
it may be relevant for the inve stigator to include the symptoms alongside the diagnosis in the 
verbatim event description. However, the diagnosis (full or provisional) should be clearly stated,e.g., fever and malaise due to respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092].
B) Adverse Event Start Date and Stop Date
The start and stop dates of the event must be provided. All AEs require these fields to be 
completed in full. Partial dates or missing da tes are not normally acceptable and significant effort 
must be undertaken to obtain any unknown in formation. If a precise date is not known an 
estimated date should be provided instead. When a complete date cannot be given, record as 
much information as possible (i.e., month and year  or, in exceptional circumstances, just year). 
When the actual start date becomes known the eCRF must be updated to replace the previously recorded date.

Confidential Page 62 of 88
Clinical Protocol Template (Phase 2–4) V1, 24Sep15C) Outcome
The outcome of the event must be recorded accurately and classified into one for the following 
categories:
xRecovered/Resolved. 
xRecovered/Resolved with Sequelae. 
xNot Recovered/Not Resolved. 
xFatal. 
D) Severity
When describing the severity of an AE the te rms mild, moderate, or se vere should be used. 
Clinical judgment should be used when dete rmining which severity  applies to any AE. 
If the severity of an AE fluctuates day-to-day, e.g., a headache or constipation, the change in 
severity should not be recorded each time; inst ead, only the worst observed severity should be 
recorded with AE start and stop dates relating to the overall ev ent duration, regardless of 
severity. 
A severe AE is not the same as a SAE. For ex ample, a patient may have severe vomiting, but the 
event does not result in any of the SAE criteria above. Therefore, it should not be classed as 
serious. 
The severity of an AE will be recorded as one of the following: 
xMild: easily tolerated, does not interfere with normal daily activities, does not require 
intervention. 
xModerate: causes some interference with da ily activities; minimal, local or non-invasive 
intervention indicated. 
xSevere: daily activities limited or completely halted; intervention indicated.
E) Causality
See Section 12.6 above. 
F) Action Taken with Trial Medication
This question refers to the ac tion taken with the IMP due to an AE. The action with the IMP 
must be classed as:

xDose Reduced. 
xDrug Interrupted. 
xDrug Withdrawn.

The investigator may be aske d to provide follow-up information to the GW PVD for any AEs 
reported or during the investigation of potential safety issues. Such  requests for additional safety 
information may occur after a patient has finished a trial. 
Additional information may also be requested by [CONTACT_31699] a patient experiences any adverse 
events that is considered an AESI, these include any events that may infer to hepatic enzymes 
increased, rash, pneumonia, cognitive disorders and self-injurious ideation or intentional self-

AEs considered related to the IMP by [CONTACT_31700]. 
It will be left to the investigator’s clinical j udgment whether an AE is of sufficient severity to 
require the patient’s removal from treatment. A patient may also voluntarily withdraw from 
treatment due to what he or she perceives as an intolerable AE. Further details of withdrawal are 
presented in Section [ADDRESS_31063] the investigator fo r additional follow-up information. 
12.8 Potential Cases of Drug-Induced Liver Injury
All investigational centers are required to submit to the GW PVD the laboratory results for any 
patient after randomization that meets the criteri a for the selected laboratory parameters as 
follows: 
xALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearan ce of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, feve r, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).
xALT or AST > 8 × ULN.
xALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than [ADDRESS_31064] > 3 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN orINR > 1.5). 
These reports must be sent to the GW PVD via email for SAE reporting (see APPENDIX 2 ) 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the results. In addition, please send a copy of the patient’s 
baseline laboratory results with all reports to the GW PVD.
Abnormal values in AST and/or A LT concurrent with abnormal elev ations in TBL that meet the 
criteria outlined above are considered potential ca ses of drug-induced liver  injury and will be 
considered as protocol-defined criteria for withdrawal and important medical events. The 
investigator will arrange for the patient to return to the investig ational center as soon as possible

examination; patients should be followed in this way until a ll abnormalities have  normalized (in 
the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) or returned to the baseline state. 
Elevations in ALT or AST > 3 × ULN orTBL > 2 × ULN alone are not considered potential 
cases of drug-induced liver injury, but will be  followed as detailed above, within 72 hours’ 
notice of abnormal results. If the patient cannot return to the investigational center, repeat 
assessments may be done at a local laborat ory and the results sent to GW PVD. 
12.9 Notification of Safety Information to Investigators, Regulatory Authorities 
and IRBs/ECs
In accordance with the EU Clinical Trials Directive30,relevant parts of the FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations32and any national regulations, GW will inform investigators, regulatory authorities 
and relevant IRBs/ECs of all re levant safety information. This will include the reporting of 
relevant SAEs and all S[LOCATION_003]Rs. 
This information will be provided through 3 sources: 
1) IB6: a compi[INVESTIGATOR_31649]. The IB is updated annually or when important new safety 
information becomes available. 
2) Development core safety information: this  document forms the safety section of the IB6, 
or is updated as an addendum to the IB6. This document is revised if necessary, when 
new important safety information becomes available (potentially up to a few times a year).
3) CIOMS reports: these reports are issued ev ery time a S[LOCATION_003]R is reported to GW. They 
provide information on individual case repor ts and are sent to all the regulatory 
authorities, the relevant central ECs which have approved the trial and investigators. As required, the investigator should notify th eir regional IRBs/ECs of SAEs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs
occurring at their center and other AE reports , i.e., CIOMS reports and any additional 
safety documentation received from GW, in accordance with local procedures.
In the [LOCATION_003], investigators are normally require d to report promptly to their IRBs/ECs all 
unanticipated problems involving risks to patient s, or others, including AEs that should be 
considered unanticipated problems. Based on current FDA guidance
28the following clarification 
is provided in determining what constitutes an unanticipated problem: 
In general, an AE observed during the conduct of a trial should be considered an unanticipated 
problem involving risk to patient s and reported to the IRB/EC, only if it were unexpected, 
serious, and would have implications for the cond uct of the trial (e.g., re quiring a significant, and

including a new monitoring requireme nt, informed consent, or IB). An individual AE occurrence 
ordinarily does not meet these criteria because, as an is olated event, its implications for the trial
cannot be understood. 
The FDA guidance32states that, accordingly, to satisfy the investigator’s obligation to notify the 
IRB/EC of unanticipated problems, any investigat ors participating in a multicenter trial may rely 
on the sponsor’s assessment and provide to the IRB/EC a report of the unanticipated problem 
prepared by [CONTACT_456]. 
GW will inform investigators, regulatory authorities and relevant IRBs/ECs of any safety issues 
or case reports that are considered to be unan ticipated and provide such  reports as mentioned 
above. It should be noted that a single S[LOCATION_003]R repor t notified to investigator s in the trial does not 
necessarily constitute an unanticipated problem unless identified by [CONTACT_31701].

Further details of the proposed statistical analysis will be documented in SAP, which will be 
finalized prior to unblinding of the trial. Any deviations from the original SAP will be described 
in the final clinical study report.
13.1 Sample Size, Power and Significance Levels
Approximately 160 patient s will be randomized to receive GWP42003-P or matching volume of 
placebo on a 1:[ADDRESS_31065] at a 
Į -level, a total sample size of 160 patients ra ndomized to allow for 144 evaluable patients 
(72 patients per arm) at trial end will provide 80% power to detect a significant result assuming a 
WUXHWUHDWPHQWGLIIHUHQFH RIௗSRLQWVIRUWKH9$%6 -3 score in change from baseline to end of 
treatment between GWP42003-P a nd placebo. Allowing for a 10% drop-out rate, a minimum of 
160 patients need to be randomized into the trial.  Depending on the drop-out rate during the trial, 
this number may be increased to ensure a minimum of 144 evaluable patients at Week 12.
The size of this trial is more than enough to ensure > 99% power on the ABC-I scale assuming a 
common standard deviation for data of 8.27 with a true treatment difference in change from 
baseline to end of treatment between GWP [ZIP_CODE]-P and placebo of -8.26 and using a 2-sided 
K\SRWKHVLVWHVWDWDĮ -level. As this is an exploratory tria l, no adjustments for the type I error 
were considered for these calculations. 
13.2 Interim Analysis
Interim evaluations for futility and superiority may be performed as part of DMC operations (see 
Section 14 ).   
Bayesian analysis of the key variables of interest may be performed to evaluate the probability 
that GWP42003-P is different than  placebo. Details of the evalua tion criteria will be provided in 
a separate Statistical Analysis or Simulation plan.

The following analysis sets will be used for the statistical analysis:
Full Analysis Set
All patients who are randomized and receive at least [ADDRESS_31066] 1 dose of IMP in the trial will be included and analyzed 
according to the treatment received. Only patients for whom it has been confirmed that they did not take any IMP will be excluded from this safety analysis set. This analysis set will be 
used to report the safety data.
Per Protocol Analysis Set
If there are a sufficient number of significant protoc ol deviations in the trial, a PP analysis set 
may also be presented. Th e PP set is defined as:
All patients that are a subset of the FAS who have no major protocol deviations deemed to

l  Patients functional assessments, i.e., the WASI-II, ADOS-2,  should be performed prior to  any invasive assessments 
being carried out. All assessments should reflect the patient’s regular state; therefore, it should be ensured the patient had adequate time to settle prior to 
each assessment. WASI-II required if score w ithin 1 year of screening is not availabl e. ADOS-2 required if not performed at the tr ial site within 2years. 
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) where the ADOS -2 cannot be performed due to site restrictions (e.g., man datory use of face 
masks), eligibility can be confirmed using the Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI-R).
mIn cases where Visits 5, or 9 are car ried out at home, secure IMP delivery and collection will be organized.

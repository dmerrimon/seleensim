CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Response to treatment will be assessed with tools commonly use d in ADHD research.  
These include ADHD -RS-5, Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale  (ASHS ), Screen for 
Childhood Anxiety -related Emotional Disorders (SCARED ), and Clinical Global 
Impression of Severity (CGI -S) and Improvement (CGI -I). 
Safety and tolerability will  be assessed by [CONTACT_553998] (AEs) as well as the evaluation of changes in clinical laboratory values, vital 
signs, ECG recordings, and C -SSRS.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Efficacy:  
The primary endpoint for the assessment of efficacy will be the ADHD -RS-[ADDRESS_727987] the hypothesis that there is 
no difference between the treatments (ie, that th e difference is 0) against a 2 -tailed 
alternative.  Further exploratory analyses may be performed that include additional 
independent factors (eg, age, gender, and/or maintenance dose of study drug)  as well 
as covariates that are determined to be associated with the experimental results 
(eg, baseline value of the dependent variable ).  All quantitative endpoints will be 
described with traditional summary statistics and tabulated by [CONTACT_29013].  
Safety:  
Adverse events will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs  
(MedDRA)  and tabulated by [CONTACT_6657].  Adverse events 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_35043], severity, relationship to IP, and their effect on 
participation in the study.  
Clinical laboratory values will be compared to normal ranges and flagged for levels of 
clinical concern.  The analysis will focus on the frequencies of abnormal values as 
well as within -subject changes observed during the course of the study.  
Vital signs an d ECG recordings will also be examined for changes during the study 
that may be attributed to exposure to IP. 
The C -SSRS will also be examined for changes that may be attributed to exposure to 
IP. 
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  Enrollment of [ADDRESS_727988] size of 0.7, this number  will provide approximately 
90% power to detect a significant difference between the treatments based on a 
2-tailed α = 0.05 comparison of mean change  from Baseline.  
STUDY AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION  The sequence and maximum duration of the study periods will be as follows:  
 Screening period: approximately 21 days . 
 Wash -out period: if applicable, up to 14 days . 
 Dose optimization phase: 28 days . 
 Dose maintenance phase: 14 days . 
 Follow -up: 7 days ( +5 days) after the last dose of IP.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 17 of 58 5. INTRODUC TION 
5.1 B ackground and Rationale 
Several candidate genes related to dopamine and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems are 
associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) severity and subtypes 
(persistence, comorbidity, functional impairment, and treatment effects), such as DAT1 , DRD4, 
M
AO-A , ADRA2A , ADRA2C , NET , a nd COMT .  Recently, a large-scale, genome-wide study 
comparing copy number variations (CNVs) in 3,500  ADHD cases versus approximately 
13,000
 controls revealed that rare, recurring CNVs impacting specific glutamate receptor 
metabotropic (GRM) gen
es (ie, GRM1, GRM5, GRM7, and GRM8) were found in patients with 
ADHD at significantly higher frequencies compared to healthy controls.  
Originally developed by [CONTACT_553999]., fasoracetam monohydrate (NFC-1, previously 
referre
d to as NS-105) is an important candidate to explore for use in restoring metabotropic 
glutamate rec
eptors (mGluR s) activity in patients with ADHD exhibiting mGluR hypofunction.  
I
t has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and memory/learning in animal models.  
The drug activity is based on regulating the intracellular adenylyl cyclase-activity stimulated by 
[CONTACT_554002]-aminobutyric acid B (GABA) receptor 
stimulus response and enha
ncing the beta-adrenergic receptor response and the acetylcholine-
mediated neurologic system response ( 1). 
Data from animal m
odels, pharmacotherapeutic interventions, and brain and genetic studies in 
humans implicate glutamatergic system involvement in ADHD pathophysiology.  Interventions 
specifically targeting this system remain to be developed even though a recent, large-scale, 
genome-wide study revealed that rare, recurring CNVs impacting genes in the glutamatergic 
network (ie, GRM1, GR
M5, GRM7, and GRM8 ) were detected in approximately 10% of the total 
ADHD cases ( 2). 
Published preclinical studies indicate that NFC-1 exerts its bioactivity through mGluRs ( 3, 4, 5).  
NF
C-1 was also found to be efficacious in ameliorating learning and memory impairment, which 
can be interpreted in the context of improved attention span, and in reducing locomotor activity, 
which is a correlate of hyperactivity ( 6).  Thus, NFC-[ADDRESS_728009] being disrupted. 
5.2 Clin ical Experience 
Previously, NFC-1 was in phase 3 development for adults with cerebrovascular diseases and 
dementia.  The previous sponsor (Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.) performed the following studies: 
 Phase 1 dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. 
 Phase [ADDRESS_728010] or cerebral 
hemorrhage.

c Relationship to study treatment was categorized as unknown. 
 
Nippon Shinyaku terminated development because the phase 3 study failed to meet the defined 
efficacy e
ndpoints.  Although a written report is unavailable, information in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) ( 1) for this phase 3 study indicated that NFC-1 was well-tolerated over 8 weeks of 
c
ontinuous daily dosin
g at doses up to 450 mg/day.  The most frequently reported adverse events 
(AEs) were nausea (2% of subjects) and laboratory abnormalities including elevated liver 
function tests, including alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase (in 3% of the subj
ects each), and elevated creatinine kinase (in 1% of the subjects). 
Research ha
s also been conducted on NFC-[ADDRESS_728013] phase 1b study that evaluated adolescents with 
ADHD and disruptions in the mGluR
 gene network.  The objectives of the study were to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of NFC-[ADDRESS_728014] of NFC-1 on ADHD during 4 weeks of continuous treatment (at doses up to 
400 mg twice daily) following 1 week of placebo therapy. 
The study was condu
cted at the Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77354], Pennsylvania.  
S
ubjects were classified into three tiers, based on their mGluR mutations.  During the dose 
escalation phase of this stud
y, NFC-1 was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious 
adverse events (SAEs) reported.  All AEs were mild to moderate, and the most frequently 
reported treatm
ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were headaches in 17/30 subjects (56.7%),

tigue in 9/30 subjects (30.0%), upper abdominal pain in 7/30 subjects (23.3%), and irritability 
in 6/30 subjects (20.0%). 
I
n addition to several exploratory measures, efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global 
Impression of Se
verity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and the Vanderbilt Parent 
Assessment Score.  Clinical improvement, based on the CGI-S, CGI-I, and Vanderbilt scores, 
was demonstrated in ana
lyses of all subjects.  Improvement in the mean scores after 4 weeks of 
active treatment w as observed as follows: CGI-S scores decreased from 3.97 to 3.00 ( P < 0.001), 
C
GI-I scores decreased from 3.83 to 2.24 ( P < 0.001), and the Vanderbilt score decreased from 
29.1 to 22.5 ( P < 0.001).  Improvement was greatest in the Tier-1/Tier-2 mGluR mutation 
posi
tive subjects ( P < 0.001).  In this group, 80% of the subjects were deemed to be responders 
(de
fined a
s at least a 25% improvement in the Vanderbilt Score).  Approximately half of the 
participants opted to participa
te in the currently ongoing open-label extension study of NFC-1. 
5.3 S ummary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The potential benefits of study participation are that mGluRs mutation-positive subjects with 
ADHD (1) may ex
perience a reduction in symptoms as a result of treatment with NFC-1 and 
(2) will understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that may lead to 
e
xpansion of the treatment options for patients with genetic disorders impacting mGluRs 
together with ADHD.  No other benefits of participation are anticipated. 
The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to NFC-1 and 
the risks of medical eval
uation, including venipuncture. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of NFC-1 is provided in 
the current version of the
 IB (1).  The investigator must become familiar with all sections of the 
NF
C-1 IB before the start of the study.

8.[ADDRESS_728032] Withdrawal 
All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice.  Every reasonable attempt should be made by [CONTACT_554006]; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  Investigators must attempt to contact [CONTACT_554007].  Should this be the cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and 
followed as described in S
ection 11.2. 
The
 sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol violations or 
other reasons. 
The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for lack of 
therapeutic effect that is intolerable or otherwise unacceptable to the subject, for intolerable or 
unacceptable AEs, int
ercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, administrative 
reasons, or in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], to protect the subject’s best interest. 
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal and the date of 
discontinuation will be 
recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Whenever possible a
nd reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion 
of the study should be pe
rformed at the time of premature discontinuation.

The following IPs will be used in this study: 
 NF C-1 will be provided as white opaque size-2 capsules containing 100 mg or 200 mg 
NFC-1; no e
xcipi[INVESTIGATOR_490795]. 
 Dose, route, and frequency (NFC-1): 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg administered orally 
twice daily in the fed or fasting state. 
 Ma tching placebo will be provided as white opaque size-2 capsules containing 
microce
llulose instead of NFC-1. 
 Dose , route, and frequency: Placebo for 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg administered orally 
twice daily in the fed or fasting state. 
9.2 L abeling and Packaging 
All packaging and labelling operations will be performed by [CONTACT_554008] (GCP ) rules.  The IP will be sent to the study 
site by [CONTACT_36613].  Labelling will be in local language and dependent upon local 
regulations. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_728035] affixed a label that meets the applicable regulatory requirements and may 
include the following: subject i
dentifier, name [CONTACT_554045], dosage strength, lot 
identifier, protocol numbe
r, specified number of capsules, caution statement (“New Drug – 
Limited by
 [CONTACT_36974]”), storage conditions, and sponsor 
identification. 
The investiga
tor will be asked to save all empty packaging or packaging containing unused 
capsules for final disposition by [CONTACT_456]. 
9.2.2 P ackaging 
NFC-1 and placebo will be supplied by [CONTACT_456].  NFC-1 will be packaged in high-density 
polyethylen
e bottles of 20 capsules. NFC-1 and placebo will be packaged so that the investigator, 
the stud
y clinic personnel, and subje
cts are blinded to study treatment. 
9.3 T reatments Administered 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either NFC-1 or placebo for 6 weeks of treatment; a 
4-week stepwise dose-optimization period will be followed by a 2-week maintenance period. 
NFC-1 or placebo will be administered twice daily for a maximum of 6 weeks.  At Baseline, 
randomized subjec
ts will receive blinded IP to begin treatment the following day at a dose of 
100 mg twice daily.  Doses will be optimized to 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg twice daily over the 
following 4 weeks as de
termined by [CONTACT_093]’s assessment of clinical response and 
tolerability to 
IP.  Additional dose adjustments will not be allowed after Week 4, and if well 
tolerate
d, subjects will be maintained at their Week-4 dose. 
The objective of this period is to ensure subjects are titrated to an optimal dose of IP based upon 
the investigator’s review of efficacy, AEs, and clinical judgment.

MDGN-NFC1-ADHD- [ADDRESS_728036] 2016 Version: Final Version v4.[ADDRESS_728037] confirm the receipt of the IP with his/her signature.  A copy of this receipt 
must be kept by [CONTACT_093], and another copy will be stored at Medgenics and/or  
.  Until the IP
 is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 20-25°C and in a dry 
place in a securely
 locked area that is not generally accessible. 
The key to the storage area is to be kept by [CONTACT_88948].  
The storage area will be accessible only to those persons authorized by [CONTACT_554009]. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_728038] Management 
An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be employed in this study to register and 
randomize subjects, maintain the blind during the study, provide a mechanism for unblinding, 
dispense and manage investigational product, and track final subject disposition (ie, study 
completion or discontinuation). 
A user manual with specific functions and instructions for the IWRS will be provided to the site. 
9.5 M ethod of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
In this parallel-group randomized study, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_728039]’s treatment assignment. Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical 
monitor if possible.  For emergency unblinding, study personnel will access the IWRS 
unblinding module.  If the
 investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, 
then he/she must notify the medic
al monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident 
without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment.  The investigator or designee must record 
the date and reason for study
 discontinuation on the appropriate eCRF for that subject.  In all

ases that are not emergencies, the investigator should discuss the event with the medical 
monitor prior to unblinding the subjec
t’s treatment assignment. 
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subj
ect’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study.  Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised.  If a 
subject’s treatme
nt assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study.  The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor. 
9.7 S election of Doses in the Study 
Doses of 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg twice daily will be administered in this study.  These doses 
were found to be safe and well tolerated in a phase 1 study of adolescents with ADHD. 
Previous PK studies in both healthy adults (aged 26 to 48 years) and young adults (aged 20 to 
32 years) showed an elimination half-life (t ½) o f about [ADDRESS_728041] throughout the 
day. 
Administration of single oral doses of 100 mg NFC-1 after a meal to young adults (aged 20 to 
32 years) showed rapid absorption (time to maximum plasma concentration [T max] fr om 0.6 to 
1.5 hours), dose-proportional increases in exposure, and a t ½ of 3.7 to 4.4 hours in healthy male 
a
dults.  Comparison of dose
s administered under fed and fasted conditions to healthy male adults 
showed that food caused slowe
r absorption (T max of 1.5 versus 0.7 hours) and decreased the 
m
aximum observed plasma concentration (C max) (4.14 versus 5.65 μg/mL), but no difference in 
the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞) 
(29.3 versus 31.3 μg  h/mL) and t ½ (4.2 versus 4.3 hours).  In separate studies, similar 
PK parameters were obtained following administration of 100 mg NFC-1 to healthy male adults 
a
nd young adults, respectively, with T max of 1.0 versus 1.2 hours, C max of 2.57 versus 
2.14 μg/mL, AUC 0 -∞ of 17.0 versus 14.0 μg  h/mL, and t ½ of 4.4 versus 4.4 hours. 
Preliminary
 evaluation of PK data from the recent adolescent PK study is consistent with 
previous PK data and de
monstrated a linear dose/concentration profile with a t ½ of

dose and no more than one down-
titration to the previous dose, if necessary. 
Subjects will be instructed to take NF
C-1 or placebo each morning upon awakening (at 7:00 a.m. 
to 9:00 a.m.) and in the mid-
afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.).  On Day 1, all subjects will begin 
taking NFC-1 or plac
ebo and will be evaluated after 7 days (± 2 days) for tolerability and 
effecti
veness.  Subjects may be titrated weekly to the next available dose strength after 7 days 
(± 2 days) on the previous dose, based on the overall response of the subject.  Additionally, if 
ne
eded, a subje
ct may be down-titrated to the previous dose level in order to optimize tolerability 
and efficacy.  Subject response will be categorized by [CONTACT_1694] 1 of 3 conditions and 
associated actions, with ti
tration continuing until an “acceptable response” is achieved.  These 
conditions are defined as follows:

MDGN-NFC1-ADHD- [ADDRESS_728044] 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0 
AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 27 of 58 Intolerable response (ie, intolerable side effects):  Requires the subject to be tapered to a lower 
dose of NFC-1 (if available).  However, if this lower dose produces an intolerable response as 
well, the subject should be discontinued from the study. 
Ineffective response:  The subject is not showing a significant reduction in symptoms, and 
requires increasing titration of NFC-1 to the next available dose strength, provided tolerability is 
acceptable, followed by [CONTACT_554010]. 
Acceptable response:  A response is defined as acceptable if it shows a significant reduction in 
symptoms with tolerable side effects.  Subjects categorized as “acceptable” may be maintained at 
their current dose for the remainder of the optimization period. Subjects who are tolerating study 
medication at the
 highest available dose but do not achieve an acceptable response should 
continue in the trial at that dose. 
Further, if the “acceptable” dose is well tolerated and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the 
subject would potentially receive additional symptom reduction, the dose may be increased to the 
next higher dose level. 
If the subject expe
riences unacceptable intolerability, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the dose 
may be reduced (if available) by 1 dose level (to the previous dose).  If the subject tolerates the 
dose reduction well and maintains symptom control, the subject may be maintained at that 
reduced dose for the remainder of the optimization period (through Visit 6).  
Only [ADDRESS_728045] has reached an optimal dose, this dose will be 
maintained for the remainder of
 the dose-optimization phase of the study (through Visit 6).  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the IP will be discontinued.  After the dose optimization 
period, subjects will continue to receive the current optimized dose of IP for an additional

 Columbia Su
icide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS ( 10) is a se mi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and 
frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period.  The interview 
includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to 
determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior has occurred.  The interview and rating for the 
C-SSRS must be completed by a licensed clinician and is medically responsible for the subject.  
A licensed clinician is define
d as a doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathic medicine, or 
licensed psychologist with a PhD.  The C-SSRS has a “baseline” version which will be 
completed at Scree
ning (Visit 1) and a “Since Last Visit” version that will be completed at all 
subsequent visits.  There are a maximum of 19 items to be completed: 7 that are required, 
10 potential additional items if there is a positive response to a required item, and 2 items for 
suicide
/suicide behavior present during the interview.  The C- SSRS uses dichotomous scales 
(ie, yes or no), Likert scales, and text or narrative to further describe the thoughts or behaviors. 
T
ime of administration = 10 minutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided in 
S
ection [ADDRESS_728083] 2016 Version: Final Version v4.[ADDRESS_728084].  An A
E can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, c
linically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition (worsening of a 
pre-existing c
ondition is considered an AE). 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo or during treatment-free periods of the study 
are also considered AEs. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_728085]. 
An unexpected AE is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current 
I
B.  For example, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular 
accidents. 
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already doc
umented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events.  Examples would be (a) acute 
renal failure a
s an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial 
nephritis (interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of 
fulminant hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected). 
11.1.[ADDRESS_728086] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 R esults in death. 
 Is life-threatening. 
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
w
hich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have c
aused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
NOTE: Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] [ADDRESS_728087] 
drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_553994], organization, or accommodation problems and without medical 
background does not need to be considered an SAE. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 38 of 58  Is a congenital anomaly. 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the IP 
duri
ng pregnancy is an SAE.  However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that 
has received an IP is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the IP(s) 
interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.  
 Is an important medical event. 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropri
ate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_553995].  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
e
mergency room or at ho
me for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
11.1.4 Significant Adverse Events 
Other significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities 
(other than those meeti
ng the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, 
including withdrawal of test drug, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_728089] 
administration of
 IP (NFC-1 or placebo) and not more than [ADDRESS_728090] administration of 
IP. 
11.2 M anagement of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of signing informed consent form (ICF) through 
the Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs first. 
11.2.[ADDRESS_728091] visit or evaluation.  The investigator will 
then monitor and/or ask about or eva
luate AEs using nonleading questions, such as: 
 “How are you feeling?” 
 “ Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?” 
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs. 
11.2.2 Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS] Se
verity of Adverse Events 
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as: 
Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event  interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 39 of 58 Severe : Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs.  Severity is a classification of 
intensity where
as an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section 11.1.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]
 Seriousness 
The investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section 11.1.3.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action(s) Tak
en 
Action(s) taken may consist of: 
Dose increased : An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267]; 
either by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  
Dose not changed : An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
Dose reduced : An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_58413], 
either by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  
Drug interrupted : An indication that a medication schedule was  modified by [CONTACT_60269] a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Drug withdrawn : An indication that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Not applicable : Determination of a value is not rele vant in the current context.  
Unknown : Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 R ecovered/resolved. 
 R ecovered/resolved with sequelae. 
 R ecovering/resolving. 
 Not r ecovered/not resolved. 
 F atal* . 
 Unknow n. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than one AE is possibly 
related to the subject’s de
ath, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE.  
Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death

proven ). 
Unlikely related : An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to IP administration that makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, events or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Possibly related : An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the IP, but 
which could also be  explained by [CONTACT_256392].  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Related : An AE occurring in a plausible time relationship to IP administration, and 
which cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or 
events. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically 
reasonable.  
The AE relationship to IP will be assessed separately by [CONTACT_554017].

 AE  name [CONTACT_81620]. 
 W hen the AE first occurred (start date and time). 
 W hen the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”). 
 S everity of the AE.

11.2.[ADDRESS_728095] may continue in 
the study/should be withdrawn from the study and the reason must be documented in the eCRF.  
The
 decision about whether the subject may continue in the study will be made by [CONTACT_554018]/or medical monitor. 
If AEs occur in a subject that are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of IP is not 
reasonable in view of the potential benefit to subject, the investigator must decide whether to 
stop the study and/or treat the subject.  Special procedures may be recommended for the specific 
IP, such as the c
ollection of a serum sample for blood concentrations of IP, specific tapering 
procedures, or treatment regimens, as appropriate. 
For double- or triple-blinded studies, it is not necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment 
assignment in most circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred.  If unblinding is necessary, see 
Section 9.[ADDRESS_728096] 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0

 Follow- up 
Any AE will be followed (up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_728097] dose of the IP) to a 
satisfactory r
esolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by [CONTACT_554019](s) (ie, concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further 
evaluation is not warranted.  All findings relevant to the final outcome of an AE must be reported 
in the subject’s medical r

 The CGI–S rates illness severity on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill, 2 = borderline mentally ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 
5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, and 7 = among the most extremely ill subjects. 
e The CGI-I requires the investigator to assess how much the subject’s illness has improved or worsened: 1 = very much  improved, 2 = much improved, 
3 = minimally improved, 4  = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = muc h worse, and 7 = very much worse.

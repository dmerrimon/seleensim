 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
This is a  doubl e-blind ed, randomi zed trial. Its purpose is to compare the steroid cream 
mom etasone furoate 0.1%  (MF), with st andard emollient skin care, Eucerin, on the  prevention of 
grade [ADDRESS_1167138] wall and 
regional lymph no des. Patients will be  stratified based on two variables: the presence of a 
reconstruction in o rder to achieve a balanced pop ulation of  patients being treated with either 
photon or  electron beams, and bo dy mass ind ex (BMI <30 vs ≥30 ). 
 
Female breast cancer patients who h ave received mastectomy + axillary surgery and will und ergo 
postm astectomy radiation (PMRT) at our institution are eligible  for this study. Enrollment of [ADDRESS_1167139] over 3 years. 
 
Skin toxicities using the Common  Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4 scale 
will be  scored by [CONTACT_839693] . Ass essments will be  completed at baseline, weekly 
during radiation th erapy (RT), and 10-[ADDRESS_1167140] etion of RT.

al. 2005). Although the clinical benefits of PMRT are well established, there is a paucity of data 
available on the acute toxicities of PMRT, namely, skin toxicities. The majority of studi es that 
examine  quality of life after mastectomy focus primarily on cosmetic and psychosocial issues. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1167145] the intensity of the skin reaction to radiation 
(Tucker, Turesson et al. 1992 ). The majority of data available regarding side effects are 
generated from patients receiving radiation to the int act breast, not the chest wall after 
mastectomy. Side effects are generally categorized as acute if occurring during or within 6 
weeks of radiation t reatment and late if occurring >6 weeks after completion of treatment. A 
common  acute toxicity is dermatitis within the irradiated volum e. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the skin becomes 
erythematous and/or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_839676], and may desquamate, in particular in the area of skin 
folds such as the axilla, supraclavicular fossa, or inframammary fold. Desquamation may be 
dry  or  moist.  Progressive  erythema  may  be  seen  after  10-20  Gy,  depending  on  the 
fractionation schedule (Turesson and No tter 1975 ), and reaches maximal int ensity 
approxim ately 1-[ADDRESS_1167146] conservation therapy (BCT), as the skin itself is consid ered part of the radiation 
target with PMRT. There are remarkably little  data available on the incidence of radiation 
dermatitis in the post-mastectomy chest wall setting. The three large randomi zed trials 
investigating the use of PMRT either do not report toxicity or report late toxicity excluding skin 
toxicities (Overgaard, Hansen et al. 1997;  Overgaard, Jensen et al. 1999;  Ragaz, Olivotto et al. 
2005 ). One s mall retrospective series of [ADDRESS_1167147] 
desquamation (Hehr, Budach et al. 1999). In contrast, a series of 118 patients treated with a 
similar technique reported that 52% of patients developed grade 3-4 skin toxicity by [CONTACT_839694] (RTOG) criteria, and 31% of patients required an unplanned treatment 
break to recover from early radiation-induced skin toxicities (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_600159], Hong et al. 2004). 
 
The  developm ent  of  normal  tissue  toxicities  in  breast  cancer  patients  receiving  adjuvant 
external beam RT demonstrates significant heterogeneity among  individuals (Twardella, Popanda 
et  al.  2003),  which  can  be  attributed  to  a  variety of  individual,  tumor  stage,  cellular,  and 
molecular factors. Increasing evidence suggests that individual genetic variations  may also play a 
significant role in the developm ent of adverse radiation respons es (De Ruyck, Van Eijkeren et al.

 2005;  Andreassen, Alsner et al. 2006;  Alsbeih, El-Sebaie et al. 2007 ), but these remain poorly 
understood. Existing estimates on rates of radiation d ermatitis are extrapolated from patients with 
intact breasts, who have been treated with a variety of techniques that affect the developm ent of 
dermatitis. A  randomi zed  trial  investigating  the  use  of   intensity-modulated  RT  (IMRT)  in 
the setting  of  BCT  demonstrated  moist  desquamation  in  31.2% receiving IMRT and 47.8% 
with standard treatment, respectively (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_72014],  Olivotto et al. 2008 ). The primary factor that 
predisposed to moist  desquamation was large breast size; race-ethnicity and genetic factors were 
not assessed in this Canadian study.  In Table 1, we summarize the results from the few studies 
that  have  specifically evaluated  skin  toxicities  in  breast  cancer  patients  who  h ave  received 
PMRT.

3.3 Evidence for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_110841]’ Prevention and Treatment of Radiation-Induced Dermatitis 
 
 
Acute  radiation  dermatitis  has  been  attributed  to  the  combin ed  result  of  a  decrease  in 
functional stem cells, changes in the skin’s endothelial cells, inflammation, cell necrosis, and 
death (Hymes et al. 2006 ). Proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effect of 
corticosteroids include vasoconstriction, decreased capi[INVESTIGATOR_22425], and inhibition of 
leukocyte proliferation and migration (Yohn,199 0). Ho wever, all mechanisms are not fully 
elucidated. 
 
At the present time, there are no established standards for either the prevention  or management 
of radiation-induced skin reactions. Intervention is primarily based on clinician experience. 
Num erous products are used by [CONTACT_839695]. 
Biafene cream (Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Titus ville, NJ, [LOCATION_003]) was evaluated in a 
multi center randomi zed trial condu cted by [CONTACT_839696]-induced skin reactions (Fisher, Scott et al. 
2000). Generally, it is agreed that a key element of the prevention of radiation dermatitis is 
moisturizing the irradiated area with Eucerin, Aquaphor, aloe vera, or other hydrophilic  products 
(Maddocks-Jennings, Wilkinson  et al. 2005). The emphasis has been on teaching self care to 
minim ize skin trauma, irritation, and or/infection. In our department, we recommend the 
application of Eucerin BID to the breast or chest wall as standard care for our  breast cancer 
patients. Moist d esquamation is  treated with Silvadene cream or hydrocolloid d ressings. 
 
To  date,  five  t rials  have  evaluated  topi[INVESTIGATOR_839678] (Bostrom, Lindm an et al. 2001; Schmuth, Wimmer et al. 
2002; Shukla, Gairola et al. 2006;  Omidvari, Saboori et al. 2007;  Miller, Schwartz et al. 2011).

Mometasone furoate is a medium -strength topi[INVESTIGATOR_839682] a low atrophog enic potential, 
and has demonst rated greater anti-inflammatory activity and a longer duration of action than 
other medium -strength topi[INVESTIGATOR_839683] (Prakash & Benfield, 1998 ).  MF 
has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  reducing  clinically  appreciated  radiation  dermatitis  and 
pruritus in patients who are receiving whole breast radioth erapy in several randomi zed trials 
comparing MF with a placebo emolli ent (Bostrom, Lindman et al. 2001; Miller, Schwartz et al. 
2011). However, its applicability in patients who have undergone mastectomy and receive 
irradiation of the chest wall has not been establish ed. Only one  of these studies included patients 
who received chest wall radioth erapy but, because the sample  size was so small, they were 
unable to draw definitive conclusions  regarding the benefit of MF in this popul ation (Miller et 
al., 2011 ). The aim of this study is to elucidate the effect of mometasone furoate versus 
standard of care on patients receiving post-mastectomy irradiation, specifically.

Amended: 08 /07/[ADDRESS_1167150] widely used standardized method of recording provider-assessed toxicities 
is the CTCAE version 4. CTCAE h as been shown to result in stable assessments of toxicities 
among practition ers (Trotti, 2003 ). Using this  assessment tool, grade ≥2 radiation dermatitis 
encompasses an assessment of both the degree of erythema and desquamation, as gauged by [CONTACT_172336]. Grade 2 erythema is defined as “moderate to brisk,” and grade 2 
MD is d efined as “patchy, most ly confined to skin folds and creases” (CTCAE v4.03, 2009 ). 
 
There is evidence that patients and clinicians differ in their assessment of the severity of 
subjective skin toxicities (such as pruritus) during radiation (Neben-Wittich M. A., 2011). The 
Skindex-16 is a  tool designed to capture patient-reported assessments of subjective adverse 
effects. Skindex-16 is comprised of sixteen questions, which are sub-categorized into an 
emotional subs cale (six question s), a functional subs cale (five question s), and a symptom 
subscale (five questions ). Rankings of the questionn aire are then averaged to obtain a score of 
severity of patient-reported outcomes. This allows providers to gauge which aspects of the 
patient’s experience are most affected by [CONTACT_8235]. 
 
The Fitzpatrick Skin Classification is a  well-recognized tool for patients’ initial assessment of 
their general level of skin sensitivi ty. The scale ranges from category I to VI, representing a  range 
from p ale skin/ always burns to d ark skin/n ever burns (Fitzpatrick TB, 198 8).

5.3 Skindex-16 Ass essment Module 
The us efulness of patient-reported outcomes as an alternate means to measure side effects has 
been reported in the lit erature (Huschka, Mandrekar et al. 2007 ). The Skindex-16 is an analog 
scale  of  symptoms  and  functional  endpoints  related  to  skin  toxicity that  can  occur  in  the 
treatment area, and has been assessed for reliability: scale scores were reproducible after [ADDRESS_1167152] validity (Chren, Lasek et al. 2001 ). It has 
been used for patients to rate skin conditions  that have occurred within the previous week. It 
consists  of a short 16-item assessment completed by [CONTACT_102], using numerical analogue scales 
(0 = never bothered to 6 = always bothered). Respons es to the Skindex-16 are categorized into 
three subscales: symptom, emotio nal, and functional (Appendix 1).

be instructed to apply cream in a thin, uniform layer twice a day, in the morning and 
evening, and not within  the imm ediate [ADDRESS_1167161] 8 ho urs after each application. 
 
Patients will be instructed to wear soft, loose clothing to cover the treated areas, but not to 
use any occlusive dressings, and to avoid exposu re to the sun. The use of sunscreens should 
be discouraged, with a preference to using clothing  to cover the treatment area when 
exposu re to the sun is expected. Patients will be discouraged from scratching the treated 
area and using possible s kin irritants such as aftershaves, colognes, and perfumes. 
Aluminum -free deodorants will be permitted.   Topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic treatments for

 11.0 TOXICITI ES/SIDE EFFECTS 
 
The patient will be monito red for erythema and desquamation in the radiation field, which are 
expected side effects from chest wall radiotherapy. Some patients may develop moist 
desquamation, which usually heals within a few weeks and is treated with Silvadene cream 
and/or hydrocolloid  dressings.  Treatment breaks secondary to severe acute skin toxicities and/or 
cellulitis du ring radiation are not anticipated. 
 
If a patient develops grade [ADDRESS_1167166] of care 
management as determined by [CONTACT_102]’s provider.  These patients will continue  to be  evaluated 
according to study guidelines, and intervention  will be noted on the Provider Skin Toxicity 
Assessment form.   Patients who develop grade [ADDRESS_1167167] 
desquamation will continue  to use  study cream without d eviation from p rotocol guidelines. 
 
Side effects from MF are uncommo n. In controlled clinical studies of MF, the incidence of 
adverse reactions of burning, pruritus, and skin atrophy was 1.6%. Infrequent side effects 
include i rritation, dryness, folliculitis, hypertrichosis, acneiform eruptions,  hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], secondary infection, striae, and miliaria. Systemic absorption may 
produce reversible hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_323574]-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestations  of 
Cushing  syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria. 
 
Eucerin Original side  effects are rare but in clude skin redness, irritation, and itching. 
 
 
12.0 CRIT ERIA FOR TH ERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCO ME ASSES SMENT 
 
12.1 Ass essment of Primary Objective 
The grading of skin toxicity will be based on the CTCAE version 4.0 scale as defined in section 
3.4. To ensure unbiased skin toxicity measurement, both the  clinical team and patient will be 
blind ed to the treatment assignment. The type of skin toxicity (moist  desquamation or grade ≥2 
erythema), maximal score, its location within the target (chest wall or axilla), and time to 
occurrence will be recorded weekly during RT and at week [ADDRESS_1167168]-RT. 
 
The maximal reported toxicity score and time to occurrence will be assessed weekly and at 
the two w eek follow up.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
It will be  made clear to all participants th at they are allowed to withdraw from the  study at any 
time. If at any time the patient is found  to be  ineligible  from the protocol as designated in the 
section on  Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligi bility, the patient will be  removed from the  study.

 14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a doubl e-blind ed, randomized trial (see Section 15.2 for details of randomization) to 
compare MF 0.1% cream with standard skin care (Eucerin) on the prevention  of moderate to 
severe skin toxicities in b reast cancer patients receiving post -mastectomy radiation to  the chest 
wall and regional lymph nodes. A patient is deemed to have developed skin toxicity if she has a 
grade ≥2 skin toxi city as defined in Section 3.4 within 7 weeks from the  beginning of radiation. 
 
Based on estimates provided by [CONTACT_839700], the rate of grade ≥[ADDRESS_1167169] wall radiation is ≈ 50%. This estimate is slightly 
lower than the findin gs from the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_839690] 3.2, to reflect this study’s 
inclusion  of patients treated with photons  (in the p resence of reconstruction) as well as 
electrons.  We expect that the usage of MF can reduce this rate to 25%. [ADDRESS_1167170] been enrolled and evaluated using the O’Brien- 
Flemming procedure, which will declare significance if the test p-value is less than 0.005. 
Correspond ingly the final analysis will declare significance if the test p-value is less than 0.048. 
This design has a power of approximately 0.83 (i.e., detecting the true toxicity rate of 25% or 
lower) at the type I error (i.e., declaring MF more effective while  it yields the same toxicity 
rate as Eucerin) rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1167171] to follow-up (before toxicities can be 
evaluated), will be excluded from the comparison and new patients will be accrued for 
replacement. To this end we plan to enroll an addition al 15% of patients. Therefore our final 
proposed accrual is about [ADDRESS_1167172] for statistical significance 
levels. Maximum  reported skin toxicities will be tabulated and summary statistics will be 
provided. Time to occurrence of skin toxicity will be handled by [CONTACT_839701]-Meier estimation, log-rank tests, and/or Cox regression  models when comparisons 
are needed.

 16.2    Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_839704] (NCI) in September 2001. The plans address the new policies set forth by 
[CONTACT_30590] “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and 
Safety Monito ring of Clinical Trials,” which can be found  at 
http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/g rantspoli cies/datasafety.htm. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monito red by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC DSM Plans 
can be found on  the MSKCC Intranet at http://ms kweb2.m skcc.org/irb/ind ex.htm.  
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_540286], 
safety, and quality. There are institution al processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monito ring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research quality assurance) and departmental procedures for quality 
control, plus there are two institution al committees that are responsible  for monito ring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs: the Data and Safety Monito ring Committee for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for Phase III clinical 
trials, reporting to the Center’s Research Council and Institution al Review Board (IRB). 
 
During the protocol developm ent and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., National 
Institut es of Health sponso red, in-house  sponso red, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative 
group, etc.) will be addressed and the monito ring procedures will be established at the time 
of protocol activation.

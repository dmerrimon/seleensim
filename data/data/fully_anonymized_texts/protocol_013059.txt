Background  
Approximately 20% of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19 require intensive care and possibly invasive 
mechanical ventilation (MV)1,2. Patient preferences with COVID -19 for MV may be different, because intubation 
for these patients is often prolonged (for sev eral weeks), is administered in settings characterized by [CONTACT_407322]1,3. Supporting patients facing this decision 
requires providing an accurate forecast of their likely outcomes based on their individual characteristics.  
A number of COVID -19 clinical predic tion models (CPMs) have appeared in the literature, but none 
developed with high methodological rigor4. Collea gues have developed models tailored to their own systems5, 
but the validity and generalizability to other settings is unknown, and the variables used are not uniformly and 
reliably obtained across systems. More generally, most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (and systems) do not have a sufficient 
number of cases (and outcomes) to develop models fit to their local population. Therefore, pooling data 
resources and assessing genera lizability across different sites is urgently needed.  
In addition  to examining geographic transportability , since best practices are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_407315] 
(e.g., proning, minimizing paralytics, lung -protective volumes, remdesivir, dexamethasone or other treatments ), 
updating and recalibrating these CPMs over time is crucially important.  Changes in what patients are admitted 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407316]6. Models developed on abundant first  wave data may have little generalizability to the current situation. 
Thus this project will also focus specifically on temporal validation and updating.  
In our current PCORI Methods project, we developed a CPM evaluation and updating framework 
including b oth conventional and novel performance measures. We performed independent model validations 
and updating on over [ADDRESS_513632] and generalizable prognostic 
tools is needed to guide patient -centered decision making across diverse populations ,  settings  and phases of 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_901] .   
 
 
Aims: We therefore aim to :  
  
1) Develop  3 CPMs in each of 2 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355377] (i.e. [ADDRESS_513633] models) to predict : 
i) the need for MV in patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -19;  
ii) mortality in patients receiving MV;  
iii) length of stay in the ICU . 
 
2) Evaluate  the geographic and temporal transportability of these models and examine  updating 
approaches.

2 a.To evaluate geographic transportability, we will apply the evaluation and updating framework
developed (in our parent PCORI grant) to assess CPM validity and generalizability across the
different datasets.
b.To evaluate temporal transportability, we will examine both the main effect of calendar time and
also examine calendar time as an effect modifier.
3)Engage  stakeholders to facilitate best use of these CPMs in the care of patients with COVID- 19.
Approach
Study Populations 
We will include consecutive COVID- 19-positive patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], excluding those who 
were placed on MV prior to presentation. The sites include: (1) Erasmus MC (a partner in the parent PCORI 
grant) who is compi[INVESTIGATOR_407317] 5-[ADDRESS_513634] 46 00 
COVID-19 patients; (2)  The Northwell Health System with the largest reported COVID cohort in the US1, now 
with over 1 3,000 COVID -19-positive patients from 13 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407318]. A preliminary CPM 
has been developed using 6 features on a subset of this cohort ( 11,095  patients)7.  
Aim 1: Model development  
Three models will be developed at each of 2 sites to: 1) predict the probability of requiring MV; 2) predict 
mortality if placed on MV; 3) predict the length of stay in the ICU with a survival model. We will use variables 
that are reliably obtainable across sites, starting with a broad set including: patient characteristics ( e.g., age, 
BMI, smoking, co -morbidities), clinical parameters ( e.g., O 2 saturation, blood pressure, HR, RR ), and lab 
values ( e.g., CRP, LDH, lymphocyte count, d -dimer, high -sensitivity troponin, ferritin, lactate, hemoglobin and 
albumin).  The models will be developed “semi -independently” —i.e. , coordinated to facilitate cross -system 
testing, as a main finding from the parent PCORI grant was the ubiquity of model -database incompatibility f or 
validation.  
The Northwell Health site will use LASSO regression with L1-norm regularization to identify the subset of 
EHR measurements that, when linearly combined, best predict the primary outcomes8. The Erasmus MC 
(Dutch site) will use a multi -state regression model9,[ADDRESS_513635] health state transitions as a function of an 
individual participant’s baseline characteristics  including times to intubation and death (including discharge to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]) among intubated patients , with variable selection based on likelihood ratio test statistics . The models 
will initially be cross -validated across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407319]. Across sites, missingness will be 
accommodated by [CONTACT_407323] (MI). The advan tages and 
disadvantages of these two approaches will be explored.  
As of this writing, there are [ADDRESS_513636] 3 of these models.  Of these the following variables will not be considered 
because they are not well ascertained in one of the two sites: CT features  and the presence of comorbidities 
(e.g., hypertension, diabet es, cardiovascular disease, chronic respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], cancer) . Interaction terms 
will be considered on the basis of clinical reasoning. In general, predictors in both datasets were ascertained 
from routinely collected data from the electronic health rec ords. Continuous variables will be modeled 
continuously. Because some variabl es are available at the Northwell  site and not the Erasmus site (including 
predictor variables  collected after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_407320] 48 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) admission , not 
available at Erasmus) , we will consider an unrestricted Northwell model using a larger array of variables and a 
more restricted Erasmus -compatible model that can be externally validated.

Aim 2: Model evaluation  
To evaluate the geographic transportability of the models, t he Tufts team will incorporate these models 
into their PCORI -supported evaluation framework to externally validate each model  on the external datasets. 
This framework includes both conventional and novel measures and was tested across [ADDRESS_513638]. Models will be assessed for discrimination (c -statistic), calibration (plots, Harrell’s E) 
and net benefit (using decision curve analysis). Changes in discrimination will be evaluated by [CONTACT_407324] -based c -statistics11 – developed during the parent award – to assess the degree to which any decrement 
is due to model invalidity versus case mix  differences. A s models are intended to be used to align decisions 
with patients’ own values and preferences, measures of calibration (and net benefit) will be prioritized. We will 
also assess performance on external databases after updating procedures ( i.e., updating of  intercepts; of 
intercepts and slope and finally parameter re -estimation). Th is provide s critical information  on CPM  
robustness , how they generalize and how best to update models over time and in new settings . In addition, we 
will compare the performance of our COVID -specific CPMs  to promising models in the literature and to  generic 
(non-COVID) prediction models12 13. 
To examine the temporal transportability, we will test the effects of calendar time within each site (i.e., 
within the Dutch data and the Northwell data separately). This will be performed on data at both sites obtained 
prior to September 2020 (i.e., first  wave data). The effect of secular trends by [CONTACT_407325] a 
continuous variable in a two variable model that also includes the previously -derived linear predictor. Nonlinear 
time effects will be examined with splines. In addition, since patie nt selection and new treatments may 
influence the consistency of variable effects, we will explore interactions between calendar time and each 
variable  in a refit model. We anticipate obtaining second wave data (i.e., after September 2020) from both sites 
that can be used to test the models. Models will be tested by [CONTACT_407326].  
 
Aim 3: Stakeholder engagement  
We will convene two multi -stakeholder panel s of 6-[ADDRESS_513639] panel will  includ e COVID -

 19 survivors ; family members of COVID -19 patients; and caregivers for COVID -19 patients. The second panel 
will include  critical care physicians; palliative care physicians; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65266]; nurses; respi[INVESTIGATOR_407321]; 
leaders of our clinical ethics committees and pastoral care representatives. The goal of these discussions is to 
develop a full understanding of how accurate prognostic models migh it best support patients and clinicians in 
making these critical patien t-centered decisions. The panel will be convened at regular intervals to elicit 
stakeholder feedback at each phase. We will leverage our experience using online collaborative tools to 
maximize feedback opportunities from each member.

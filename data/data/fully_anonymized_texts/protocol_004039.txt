 1. SYNOPSIS 
Protocol number:  SNS0216 
Protocol title:  Phase I, Open -Label Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of 
SNS-301 in Cancer Patients  
Phase of development:  Phase I  
Objectives (Part 1):  Primary   
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SNS -301, based on the 
incidence of dose limiting toxicities (DLT) an d the maximum administered 
dose of SNS-301, when administered every 21 days in patients  with 
biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.  
 
Secon dary 
To assess the overall safety of SNS -301.  
Study design:  This is a Phase I, open- label, study of SNS -301, an HAAH- directed  
nanoparticle vaccine , given intra dermally in cohorts of patients  with 
biochemically relapsed prostate cancer , using a fixed dose -escalation schema 
every 21 days  to establish the MTD .  
Following informed consent and screening, archived prostate  tumor  tissue 
(if available), and patient  fresh serum will be tested for the expression of 
HAAH. Patients  who test positive for HAAH expression  in either archived 
tumor tissue  (if available), or fresh serum may be continued in the study . 
Baseline biochemical testing ( chemistry, complete blood count  [CBC] , 
coagulation panel, CH-50, and prostate -specif ic antigen [ PSA],) will be 
obtained prior to study treatment .  Patient s who are negative for HAAH in 
archived tumor tissue or fresh serum  can be followed for PSA levels over 
the next [ADDRESS_1008815] of single repeated doses of SNS -301 administered 
every 21 days for 3 doses. A traditional 3+[ADDRESS_1008816] 21- day interval following a 
single dose of SNS -301 in 3 dose cohorts. The MTD will be considered the 
dose level lower than the dose produc ing ≥2 DLT s in 3-6 patients . Patients  
who withdraw in cycle 1 for reasons ot her than safety or toxicity will be 
replaced. Any of the following, if jud ged to be associated with SNS-301 
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: 1 2 June 2018  Confidential  Page 7 of 47 
 (i.e., possibly -, probably -, or definitely related to), will be considered a DLT  
using the National Cancer Institute -Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE ) Version 4.03:  
1) Grade 4 non- hematological toxicities (excluding alope cia) of any 
duration  
2) Grade 3 non- hematologic (non-laboratory ) toxicity  lasting > 3 days 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_44782]  
3) Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematologic laboratory value if: a). 
Medical intervention is required to treat the patient ; b), the 
abnormality leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; c). The abnormality persists for 
>1 week.  
4) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity , other than those specified in criteria 5 
and 6 below , lasting > 7 days  
5) Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia  of any duration  
6) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in combination wi th a grade 3 or greater 
blood and lymphatic system disorder  
7) Grade [ADDRESS_1008817] or ALT that is as sociated with a grade 2 rise in bilirubin  
The recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be de fined as the highest dose 
administered  if no MTD is observed.  
Dose cohorts will be enrolled sequentially  and no dose escalation will occur 
until all patients  in the current cohort complete the first 21- day cycle. After 
the first patient  in each cohort has demonstrated adequate safety and 
tolerability for at least [ADDRESS_1008818] eligible patient  
able to be treated is assigned the treatment slot that is available for study.  
A safety assessment of administration site reactions (ASR)  will be made  by 
[CONTACT_738336] 30 minutes  (or later)  following each dose  of study 
drug using the ( NCI-CTCAE V4 .03). Enrollment will be held  if an ASR  of 
grade 3 or greater (NCI -CTCAE  V4.03) is observed , until the event resolves. 
In the event enrollment is held for an ASR , the Sponsor  and Investigator  will 
evaluate the outcome of the ASR  and must agree to continued enrollment.  
In patient s who tolerate SNS -301, additional treatment may be continued 
with single doses of SNS-301 at the ir current dose level , to maintain 
geometric mean titer (GMT) of HAAH antibodies  to no less than [ADDRESS_1008819] six months  (9 injections) . Treatment will be 
terminated with  the 9th  injection or will  otherwise  be terminated at any time 
upon the observance of PSA do ubling < 90 days or occurrence of 
unacceptable toxicity . After termination, p atients will be followed for an 
additional 6 months with monthly PSA levels and imaging studies as needed. 
If an unacceptable rise is detected in the patient’s PSA levels following 
treatment discontinuation, patients shall be eligible for imm ediate 
resumption of therapy.

Version Date: 1 2 June 2018  Confidential  Page 8 of 47 
 Once the MTD/ RP2D  is determined , patient s receiving  ongoing treatment 
may be escalated to that dose for subsequent treatments. These patient s will 
continue to be followed for safety and biochemical PSA monitoring.  
Pharmacodyn amic s:  
Exploratory pharmacodynamic ( PD) analysis will be performed using dose, 
vaccine- specific antibody response (geometric mean of titer ), antigen-
specific T and B cell indices, and the relative expression of HAAH in each 
patient’s  tumor. The PD will be balanced and optimized to the degree of 
antigen -specific immune response and minimized for the production of 
regulatory immune processes.  
Other Safety:  
Safety will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_738337] s, changes in 
biochemical safety measures, general incidence and types of AE s, serious 
adverse events (SAEs) , and other overt toxicities.  
Number of patients / 
centers:  This is a multi- center dose -escalation study with an extension study at the 
RP2D . Up to approximately 18 patie nts will be studied.

 Route of 
administration:  Intradermally: vaccine to be delivered by a single- use 3M® hollow micro 
structured  transdermal system (hMTS) device.  
Dose regimen : Escalating doses of 2.[ADDRESS_1008823] 6 
patients can be evaluated even if no DLTs are observed at the dose.   
Patients  in the dose -escalation phase may continue to receive single doses of 
SNS-301 at their original dose level every 21 days or until the PSA doubling 
is < 90 days or unacceptable toxicity as determined by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_738322] (either for tha t patient  or in their dose cohort). Once

 For the dose -escalation phase of the study , cohorts of 3 or 6 patients will be 
screened, registered and treated at each dose level. The actual sample size 
may vary depending on the incide nce of DLT during Cycle 1 at a given dose 
level. Once the MTD/RP2D is determined, additional patients  may be 
accrued to provide for 6 patients  in the MTD cohort. Approximately, 
18 patients will be screened, registered and treated in the trial.  
The prima ry safety analysis will assess MTD and AE s, clinical laboratory 
tests, and tolerability, based on the combined evaluation of immunogenicity 
and incidence of DLTs  in each patient . 
Study duration:  The duration of the study for each patient  will include an up to 8- week  
screening phase, 21 -day study treatment  cycles for 9 cycles and  6 months of 
follow up including monthly PSAs and an end of study visit  ([ADDRESS_1008827] dose of study treatment ).  
Patients may continue to receive single repeated doses of SNS -301 at their 
original dose level (or at the MTD when it is determined) every 21  days for 
a total of 9 doses or until the observance of PSA doubling <  90 days or 
unacceptable toxicity (either for that patient  or in their dose cohort). Patie nts 
who have received more than 9 injections due to the timing of the amendment 
limiting therapy to 6  months ( 9 doses), will be stopped at their last dose 
received and be followed for [ADDRESS_1008828] the option of immediately resuming 
therapy on study protocol.

 3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1  Primary Disease and Study Treatment  Information  
Human aspartyl -asparaginyl -β-hydroxylase (HAAH), also known as aspartate- β-hydroxylase, 
is an ~86 kDa type 2 transmembrane protein that belongs to the α -ketoglutarate -dependent 
dioxygenase family [ 1]. It is a highly conserved enzyme, which catalyzes the hydroxylation 
of aspartyl and asparaginyl residues in epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] -like domains of proteins 
including Notch and homologs [ 2]. HAAH was initially identified in a novel screen to identify 
cell surface proteins up-regulated in liver cancer. It has subsequently been detected in a diverse 
array of solid and blood cancers, including: liver, bil e duct, brain, breast, colon, prostate, 
ovary, pancreas, and lung cancers as well as leukemia. HAAH is not found in significant 
quantities in normal tissue or in proliferative disorders.   
Over -expression of HAAH has been demonstrated to be sufficient to i nduce cellular 
transformation, increase cellular proliferation and cellular motility  and suppression of HAAH 
expression ( small interfering ribonucleic acid ) or neutralized activity ( monoclonal antibodies ) 
returns cancer cells to a normal phenotype . In canc er cells,  it has been shown to be translocated 
to the cellular surface where it is not normally located. Because HAAH is an embryonic 
antigen, and as such presents self -antigen tolerance, it is relatively difficult to elicit a rob ust 
immune response agains t it. Thus, we posited that effective priming of antigen -presenting  
cells (APC)  by [CONTACT_738341]. Indeed, in vitro  
activation of dendritic cells with HAAH, prior to re -administration to patients  has shown 
promising results for liver cancer therapy [ 3]. Unfortunately, this process is cumbersome, 
expensive, time consuming and impractical for mass scale immunotherapy.   
Bacteriophage display is a simple, inexpensive and practical way of achieving favorable 
presentation of peptides to the immune system. The phage contains  deoxyribonucleic acid 
(DNA)  fragments that present the phage CpG motifs , which are known to stimulate the innate 
immune response and activate the major histocompatibility class ( MHC ) class II pathway in 
APC . Previous findings have revealed that recombinant bacteriophage can prime strong CD8+ 
T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses both in vitro and in vivo against epi[INVESTIGATOR_738323] [ 4], activate T -helper cell s [5] and elicit the production of specific 
antibodies [ 6, 7] all normally without adjuvant. Thus we have selected bacteriophage as a 
platform for eliciting anti -HAAH immune responses. Bacteriophage are ubiquitous and 
essentially innocuous to humans, howev er, as an added safety mechanism, they may be 
neutralized rendering them non -infective to host bacteria while retaining their 
immunostimulant properties. Once neutralized, the bacteriophage effectively becomes a 
nanoparticle, for enhanced delivery of prote in fragments to APC .   
We have designed a bacteriophage lambda system to display HAAH peptides fused at the 
C-terminus of the head protein gpD of phage lambda. The phage carry 200- 300 copi[INVESTIGATOR_738324] 25 kDa molecular 
weight fragment of HAAH on their surface.  The drug substance is one of these HAAH 
bacteriophage lambda constructs: HAAH -1λ (SNS-301).

and are described below . 
The nonclinical data generated to date include:  
• Demonstration of immunogenicity in mice and rats  
• Demo nstration of dose response to both amount of vaccine and number of doses  
• Demonstration of both humoral and cellular immunity  
• Demonstration of enhanced immunogenicity for intradermal compared to 
intramuscular immunization 
• Efficacy data in three rodent tumor  models, including solid tumors and metastases  
o Inhibition of solid tumor growth and metastases with the mouse hepatocellular 
carcinoma cell line, BNLT3  
o Inhibi tion of solid tumor growth, lung metastases and mortality with the mouse 
breast cancer cell line , 4T1 
o Inhibition of metastases with the rat prostate cancer cell line, MLLB -[ADDRESS_1008833] aff. It 
is important to note that there ha s been no local reactogenicity or adverse events  (AEs)  
associated with the administration of multiple doses of the HAAH Nanopar ticle Vaccine in 
mice and rats.  These vaccines are immunogenic, show efficacy in three  tumor model systems 
and are safe in the doses given to rodents. In total, the data strongly support the potential utility 
of the HAAH -1λ vaccine for the immunotherapy of cancer.  
It is anticipated that the HAAH Nanoparticle Vaccine will also prove to be safe in humans.  
Bacteriophages are ubiquitous in our environment. All humans are constantly exposed to large 
numbers of bacteriopha ge with no apparent harm. The relatively low dose  and dose frequency 
of a vaccine as compared to other cancer drugs, both chemical and biological, also predict that 
these materials should be quite safe in human subjects.   
Panacea has conducted a repeated dose study in rats that assessed the toxicity  of the SNS-301 
(previously named PAN -301-1) HAAH n anoparticle vaccine when administered 
intradermally at the same three dose levels (2 x 1010, 1 x 1011 and 3 x 1011 particles) and same 
dose schedule (3 doses given at 21 day intervals) as proposed for this hum an study , followed 
by [ADDRESS_1008834] on mortality, physical examinations, cage -side observations, dermal Draize 
observations, body weights or body weight changes, food consumption, body temperature, 
ophthalmologic observations, gross pathology, absolute and rela tive organ weights,

mononuclear or mixed inflammatory cell infiltrates in the dermis and/or subcutis.  These 
findings were considered non- adverse and resolved during recovery.   Additionally, the SNS -
301 vaccine demonstrated a significant antibody response that was dependent on both the dose 
level and number of doses administered.

3.4 Study Rat ionale  
Oncology trials frequently employ dose -escalation using a 3+3 schema; it is considered 
standard practice for determining the MTD  of a particular study treatment in humans. The 
starting dose for such studies is usually calculated from the results of toxicology studies, which 
are often not performed in humans [8]. In this study, the starting dose and the subsequent dose 
escalations were determined from the results of a repeated dose toxicology study conducted in 
rats that evaluated the same 3 intraderm al doses and dose frequency for the SNS-301 as 
proposed here. Only minimal toxicologic effects were observed in the animals at the higher 
two dose levels and these were resolved through the 2 - and 4- week recovery periods (see 
Section 3.2 ). 
The selection rationale for the specific dose levels proposed for this study is based on the in 
vivo results of this range of doses in mice and rats that have shown both immunogenicity and 
efficacy of the SNS -[ADDRESS_1008846]  demonstrated inhibition 
of metastases in a rat tumor model with the rat prostate cancer cell line, MLLB -2. 
The dose -escalation phase will be conducted in patients with biochemically relapsed prostate 
cancer because this is a cancer that generally takes a long time to develop. Further, archived 
patient tumor tissue will be tested for the HAAH epi[INVESTIGATOR_738325];

 5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
This is a P hase I, open- label, study of SNS -301, an HAAH -directed  nanoparticle vaccine,  
given intradermally in cohort s of patients  with biochemically relapse prostate cancer,  using a 
fixed dose -escalation schema every 21 days to establish the MTD.   
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan Description  
Figure 1: Dose -escalation study design (3+3 schema)  
 
 
 
Following informed consent and screening, archived prostate tumor tissue and patient serum 
will be tested for the expression of HAAH. Patients who test positive for HAAH expression  
in either archived tumor tissue  or fresh serum  may be continued in the stud y. Baseline 
biochemical testing ( chemistry, complete blood count  [CBC] , coagulation panel, CH50, and 
PSA) will be obtained prior to study treatment  administration .  
Treatment will consist of single repeated doses of SNS -301 administered every 21 days. A 
traditional 3+[ADDRESS_1008848] 6 patient s can be evaluated  even if no DLTs are 
observed at the dose. Planned treatment may continue for  two additional doses of SNS -301 
administered every 21 days.  Serum and whole blood samples will be obtained on the day of 
study treatm ent administration (Day 1) and [ADDRESS_1008849] 21 -day interval following a single dose of SNS-
301 in 3 consecutive dose cohorts. The MTD will be considered the dose level lower than that 

Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: 1 2 June 2018  Confidential  Page 25 of 47 
 dose wh ich produces ≥ 2 DLTs  in 3 or 6 patient s. A DLT will be considered a protocol -
specified drug-related grade 3 -4 (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE ] V 4.03) adverse experience ) (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The  RP2D will 
be the highest dose administered if  no MTD is observed.  
Dose cohorts will be enrolled sequentially.  
An evaluation period of  at least 21-days for the first patient  (sentinel patient ) in a new cohort 
is required to evaluate tolerability before adding additional patient s to the cohort. If 
safety/tolerability is adequate, then the remaining patients  will be dosed in the cohort.  A 
second evaluation will occur for the last patient  of each cohort of at least 21-days to evaluate 
safety/ tolerability before dose escalation to the next cohort will occur.  E nrollment will be 
held if an  administration  site reaction  (ASR ) of grade 3 or greater (NCI -CTCAE  V4.03) is 
observed until the event resolves.  In the event enrollment is held for an ASR , the Sponsor , 
Medical Monitor  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_738327].  
Dose -escalation will proceed once all patients  in a cohort (unless the MTD is observed) have 
completed a 21- day safety evaluation following the first  dose of study treatment  in the cohort.  
Planned treatment may continue for  an additional [ADDRESS_1008850] 6 
patients can be evaluated  even if no DLTs are observed at the dose   In patients who tolerate 
SNS-301, additional treatment may be continued with single doses of SNS-301 at their current 
dose level , to maintain geometric mean titer (G MT) of HAAH antibodies to no less than [ADDRESS_1008851] six months (9 injections). Treatment will be terminated 
with the 9th injection or will otherwise be terminated at any time upon the observance of PSA 
doubling < 90 days or occur rence of unacceptable toxicity as determined by [CONTACT_737] 
(either for that patient or in their dose cohort). After termination, p atients will be followed for 
an additional 6 months with monthly PSA levels and imaging studies as needed.  
Once the MTD/ RP2D is determined, patients receiving ongoing treatment may be escalated 
to that dose for subsequent treatments and receive a maximum of [ADDRESS_1008852] received more than 9 injections due to the timing of the amendment limiting therapy to  
6 months (9 doses), will be stopped at their last dose received and be followed for 6 months 
as with other patients. These subjects will continue to be followed for safety and biochemical 
PSA monitoring on a monthly basis for 6 months and are eligible to resume SNS -301 in case 
of increases in PSA doubling to < 90 days or other evidence of disease progression and decline 
in immunological parameters.  
Pharmacodynamic:  
Exploratory pharmacodynamic ( PD) analysis will be performed using dose, vaccine- specific 
antibody response ( geometric mean titer ), antigen- specific T and B cell indices, and the 
relative expression of HAAH in each patient’s tumor. The PD will be balanced and optimized 
to the degree of antigen -specific immune response and minimized for the produc tion of 
regulatory immune processes.  
Other Safety:  
Safety endpoints will be evaluated by [CONTACT_738343], changes in biochemical safety measures, general incidence and types of AEs, 
serious adverse events (SAEs) , and other overt toxicities.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling/ Responsibilities  
The study Treatment  administrator must store and administer the study treatment according to 
the instructions provided by [CONTACT_1034] . 
All s tudy treatments shall be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and 
it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of study treatment  issued 
and returned is maintained.  
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of a study treat ment  (deficiency in condition, 
appearance, pertaining document ation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], etc.) should be promptly notified 
to the Sponsor , who will initiate a complaint procedure.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply s tudy treatment  to a third party, allow the 
study treatment to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_204264], or dispose of 
study treatment in any other manner.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Investigational Treatment  Management  and Disposal  
All unused study treatments  should be discar ded at the investigational site a nd a destruction 
certificate obtained.  The study treatment  Administrator will submit the copy of Product 
Accountability Log to the Sponsor . 
A potential defect in the quality of the s tudy treatment  may be subject to initiation by [CONTACT_738352] a recall procedure. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly 
addressing any request made by [CONTACT_1034] , in order to recall s tudy treatment  and eliminate 
potential hazards.  
5.3.3 Method of Assigning Patients  to Study Groups  
This is an open- label dose -escalation study; no randomization will occur.  
All patients who sign the informed consent form  (ICF)  will be assigned a patient study 
number. Patient eligibility must be verified by [CONTACT_737] . If a patient fails to meet an 
eligibility criterion during the screening period, then the Investigator  will complete a screening 
failure form in the e -CRF.  
The study treatment  will be administered only to patients included in this study following the 
procedures set out in this clinical study protocol. Details of the exact time of administration 
of medication (day/month/ye ar, hour:minute) and the labe ling on SNS -[ADDRESS_1008859]  always 
be allotted a new patient number.

 5.3.4 Selection of Doses for the Study  
This is an open- label study. Sequential cohorts will be enrolled in the order they present . In 
the dose -escalation cohorts, 3 or 6 patients will be treated with successively higher doses of 
SNS-301: 2.[ADDRESS_1008860] 21 -day interval following a single dose of SNS-
301 in 3 dose cohorts. The MTD will be considered the dose level lower than that dose which 
produces ≥ 2 DLT . 
Dose -escalation will proceed when  once all patients in a cohort  (unless the MTD is observed) 
have completed a [ADDRESS_1008861] patient  of each dose level  will be enrolled and assessed for DLTs  
during cycle 1.  Subsequent patients in a cohort can be enrolled after a 21 -day review for 
tolerability by [CONTACT_1689], Sponsor and Investigator (s) has been completed in the 
first patient .  
After evaluation of the safety data of 3 patients in c ycle 1 of the 2.0 x 1010 particles per 
administration dose, if none of the firs t 3 patien ts experiences a DLT, then dose- escalation to 
the next level (1.0 x 1011 particles per administration ) can occur. When one patient shows a 
DLT , an additional 3 patients will be enrolled at the same dose level.  If no more than 1 out of 
6 patients experiences a DLT, patient enrollment to the next dose level can start.   
Patient s who withdraw from the study during cycle 1 (Day 1 – Day 22 pre -dose) for reasons 
other than safety or toxicity will be replaced.  
Subsequent dose -escalation will be conducted in the same manner.  
If the MTD  is not achieved at the dose level of 3.[ADDRESS_1008862] 6 patients can be evaluated  even if no DLTs are observed at the dose.  
Although the dose -escalation process is guided by [CONTACT_738353] c ycle 1, the 
global safety profile of SNS -301 at each dose level will be considered and discussed with the 
Investigator  before increasing doses.  
Planned treatment may continue  for additional  doses of SNS-301, administered every 21 days .   
In patients who tolerate SNS -301, additional treatment may be continued with single doses of 
SNS-301 at their current dose level  every 2 1 days , to maintain geometric mean titer (GMT) 
of HAAH antibodies to no less than [ADDRESS_1008863] six months (9 
injections).  
Treatment will be terminated with the 9th injection or will otherwise be terminated at any time 
upon the observance of PSA doubling < 90 days or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. After 
termination, p atients will be followed for an additional 6 months with monthly PSA levels and 
imaging studies as needed.  
Once the MTD/RP2D is determined, patients receiving on going treatment may be escalated 
to that dose for subsequent treatments and receive a maximum of [ADDRESS_1008864] received more than 9 injections due to the timing of the amendment limiting therapy to 
6 months (9 doses), will be stopped at t heir last dose received and be followed for 6 months 
as with other patients. These subjects will continue to be followed for safety and biochemical 
PSA monitoring on a monthly basis for 6 months and are eligible to resume SNS -301 in case 
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: 1 2 June 2018  Confidential  Page 31 of 47 
 of increases in PS A doubling to < 90 days or other evidence of disease progression and decline 
in immunological parameters.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose -limiting toxicities  
Any of the following, if judged to be associated with SNS -301 (i.e., possibly- , probably -, or 
definitely related to), will be  considered a DLT  which are based on the NCI-CTCAE V4.03  
criteria : 
1) Grade 4 non- hematological toxicities (excluding alopecia) of any duration  
2) Grade 3 non- hematologic (non- laboratory) toxicity lasting > 3 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_90528]  
3) Any Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematologic laboratory value if: a). Medical 
intervention is required to treat the subject; b), the abnormality leads to 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; c). The abnormality persists for >1 week.  
4) Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, other than those specified in cri teria 5 and 6 below , 
lasting > 7 days  
5) Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration  
6) Grade 3 thrombocytopenia in combination with a grade 3 or greater blood and 
lymphatic system disorder  
7) Grade [ADDRESS_1008865] or ALT that is associated with a grade 2 rise in bilirubin  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose delay or r eduction  
In case of non- DLT AE (grade 2 NCI -CTCAE V4.03 drug related AE), the dosing interval of 
3 weeks can be extended to up 42 days to allow the recovery from a related toxicity and the 
patient will resume at the same dose. If t he patient experiences the same toxicity requiring a 
dose-delay at the subsequent cycle, the patient should be discontinued.  
No sentinel safety assessment will be made;  however, enrollment will be controlled so that a 
21-day observation period is completed on the first  subject  in each cohort before any further 
enrollment is performed. Additionally, enrollment will be held if an ASR  of grade [ADDRESS_1008866] be 
documented in the a ppropriate screen of the e- CRF.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunological blood collection  
Antigen -specific anti -HAAH antibody titers  
Anti-HAAH antibody  titers from serum samples are determined by [CONTACT_6428] .  Patient sera are 
serially diluted and incubated in microplate wells coated with recombinant HAAH antigen.  
The plates are then incubated with anti -human immunoglobin G ( IgG)-peroxidase conjugate, 
followed by [CONTACT_738356].  The data are expressed as the reciprocal of the end -point titer.  
Antigen -specific CTL responses  
Cytotoxic  T-cells (CTLs) and APC  will be isolated from patient peripheral blood monocytes 
(PBMCs) by [CONTACT_738357] (MACS) on the basis of specific cell surface 
markers. APCs will be loaded with antig en (HAAH) for 3 hours and labeled  with a fluorescent 
dye, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) , and incubated with CTLs at varying 
effector to target cell ratios. Cell -mediated cytotoxicity is determined by [CONTACT_488] -specific 
release of dye.  
Cytotoxi c T-Lymphocyte Killing Assay  
Quantitation of specific cell lysis by [CONTACT_4676] -derived CD8+ T -cells will be determined using a 
flow cytometric assay employing two fluorochromes, 5 - (and 6- ) carboxyfluorescein diacetate 
succinimydyl ester (CFSE) and 7 -amino ac tinomycin D (7- AAD). CFSE is pre -loaded into 
target cells where upon internalization it is covalently linked to intracellular amine groups and 
thus does not leach from cells into the media nor is it transferred to adjacent cells. As such, 
CFSE can be used as a marker to differentiate between effector and target cells in the final 
assay. 7 -AAD is a membrane impermeable dye that when added subsequent to the period of 
cell lysis can only be incorporated only into dead cells (whose membranes have been compromis ed) and thus can be used to differentiate between live and dead cells.  
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: 1 2 June 2018  Confidential  Page 36 of 47 
 Target Cells: Patient derived antigen presenting cells (APCs) will be isolated from peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using magnetic assisted cell separation (MACS) 
technology  (Miltenyi Biotec). APCs may be loaded with antigen (HAAH) for 12- 16 hrs. prior 
to use in the CTL assay. Immediately prior to assay, target cells will be loaded with CFSE.  
Effector Cells: CD8+ T -cells will be isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cel ls 
(PBMCs) using magnetic assisted cell separation (MACS) technology (Miltenyi Biotec).  
Lysis: Effector and target cells will be co -incubated at varying effector to target cell ratios at 
37⁰C for 4 hours. Target cells are held constant at ~25,000 cells per  well of a 96 well plate 
while effector cells will be varied from a ratio of 1:1 with target cells up to 25:1. After 
incubation, cells are labeled with 7- AAD to differentiate between live and dead cells. Cells 
are subsequently analyzed by [CONTACT_738358]: those that 
stain with both CFSE and 7 -AAD, those that stain with CFSE but not 7- AAD, those that stain 
with 7 -AAD but not CFSE and those that do not stain with either fluorophore. Percent specific 
lysis is determined by [CONTACT_738359]/7 -AAD labeled cells to total CFSE labeled cells. 
The ratio of non- CFSE labeled cells vs. CFSE labeled cells is an indicator of the true effector 
to target cell ratio.  
Measurement of B cell and T cell response  
B cells will be isolated  from patient PBMCs  by [CONTACT_738357] (MACS) on 
the basis of specific cell surface markers. After several days of growth in culture, medium will 
be tested for antigen -specific anti -HAAH antibody titers as above. 
CD4+ T -cells responses w ill be determined by [CONTACT_738360]4+ T -cells and APC  from patient 
PBMCs  by [CONTACT_738357] (MACS) on the basis of specific cell surface 
markers. APCs will be loaded with or without antigen (HAAH) for 3 hours  and coincubated 
with CD4+ T -cells ov ernight. Antigen -specific T -cell activation will be determined by [CONTACT_738361]154 and interferon γ.  
Measurement of CD4, CD8, CD19 cell populations  
CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+ cell populations as a percentage of total PBMCs will be determined 
by [CONTACT_4133].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Administration  site reaction  
The area around the administration site will be  assessed by [CONTACT_738362] [ADDRESS_1008871] study drug administration. The Investigator will grade an y ASR s 
according to the NCI -CTCAE  V4.03 (excluding the actual expected micro- injection 
punctures) .  
Patients will be required to report any change in the administration site a nd return to the clinic 
for evaluation by [CONTACT_737].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ECOG performance score  
The health, activity and w ell-being of the patient was measured by [CONTACT_738363] a scale of 0 to 5 with 0 being fully active and 5 being dead. Full 
details are described in Appendix A . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related and occurs after the patient  is given the first 
dose of study drug .  Any AE that occurs prior to the first dose is part of the medical history.   
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_1008872] effects.  
Laboratory abnormalities (grade 1 and greater that are listed in the NCI -CTCAE  V4.03) 
should be recorded on the AE page regardless of their causality. Worsening of a pre -existing 
condition is also considered an AE as is the discovery of an abnormal finding during physical 
exam that w as not included in the medical history.  
Patients w ill be encouraged to spontaneously report any AE.  Study personnel will ask 
open- ended questions to obtain information about AEs at every visit.  Date and time of onset 
and resolution (if applicable) of the AE will be documented.  
Causality  
Events will be considered treatment  related if classified by [CONTACT_738364], 
probable, or definite ly associated with the use of the drug .  Association of events to the study 
treatment  will be made using the following definitions:  
 
Term  Definition  
Definitely  Not The event is definitely not associated with study treatment . 
Probably Not  The temporal association, patient history, or clinical condition is such that 
the study treatment  is not likely to have had an association with the 
observed event.  
Possible  The event: a) follows a reasonable temporal association with the study 
treatment  administration, but b) could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
clinical condition or other therapy.  
Probable  The event: a) follows a reasonable temporal association with the study treatment , b) abates upon discontinuation of study treatment , and c) cannot 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical condition or other therapy. 
Definite  The event: a) follows a reasonable temporal association with the study 
treatment , b) abates upon discontinuation of study treatment , c) cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical condition or other therapy, and d) reappears on re -exposure to the study treatment . 
 
Severity  
Signs and symptoms will be graded by [CONTACT_738365] -CTCAE V4.03 graded 
1-5. Grade refers to the severity of the AE. For events not described in the NCI CTCAE , the 
Investigator  will assign grades as 1= mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life- threatening, and 
5=fatal  based on this gener al guideline:  
Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*  
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**.

 Grade 5:  Death  related to AE.  (Grade 5 (Death) may  not appropria te for some AEs and 
therefore may  not an option.)  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.  
**Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is an AE that:  
• Is fatal  
• Is life -threatening, meaning the patient was, in the view of the Investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form or progressed, might have caused 
death  
• Is a persistent or significant disab ility or incapacity  or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Requires or prol ongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is a con genital anomaly or birth defect  
Other important medical events may be considered SAEs when, based upon appr opriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes as listed (# 1 -5 above) in this definition. 
All SAEs, including death  due to any cause, that occur  during this study a nd until [ADDRESS_1008873] 
be reported to the Medical Monitor immediately  upon discovery of the event, using an SAE 
Form .  
The Medical Monitor will advise the Investigator regarding the nature of any further 
information or documentation that is required.  The Investigator should provide the following documentation at the time of notification if available:  
• SAE Form  
• AE (CRF) page  
• Concomitant and support medication pages  
• Relevant diagnostic reports  
• Relevant laboratory reports  
• Admission notes  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458] (when available).  
The Sponsor  must notify FDA and all participating Investigator s (i.e., all Investigator s to 
whom the Sponsor  is providing drug under  its INDs or under any Investigator 's IND) in an 
IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as 
possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor  determines that the 
information quali fies for reporting under paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iii), or (c)(1)(iv) 
of 21CFR 312.32. T he Sponsor  must identify all IND safety reports previously submitted to 
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_1008874] a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:  
1. A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome);  
2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon  rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy)  that 
indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group.  
Submission of IND safety reports  
The Sponsor  must submit each IND safety report in a narrative format or on FDA Form 3500A 
or in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. FDA will periodically 
issue guidance on how to provide the electronic submission (e.g., method of transmiss ion, 
media, file formats, preparation and organization of files). The Sponsor  may submit foreign 
suspected adverse reactions on a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 
(CIOMS) I Form instead of a FDA Form 3500A. Reports of overall findings or pooled 
analyses from published and unpublished in vitro, animal, epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], or clinical studies 
must be submitted in a narrative format. Each notification to FDA must bear prominent 
identification of its contents, i.e., "IND Safety Report," and must be transmitted to the review 
division in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or in the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research that has responsibility for review of the IND. Upon request from 
FDA, the Sponsor  must submit to FDA any additional data or information that the agency 
deems necessary, as soon as possible, but in no case later than [ADDRESS_1008875].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction reports  
The Sponsor  must also notify FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected 
adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor 's 
initial receipt of the information.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Hematological  toxicities will be assessed in term of hemoglobin value, white blood cell, 
neutrophil, platelet , and lymphocyte count according to the NCI -CTCAE AE grading.  
Laboratory abnormalities (grade 1 and greater that are listed in the NCI -CTCAE  V4.03) 
should be re corded on the AE page regardless of their causality.

 5.5.4 Efficacy  (Clinical)  Measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PSA assessment  
Rising levels of PSA in serum are associated with prostate cancer [9]. Currently, PSA testing 
of serum is a standard test for indicating further investigation for prostate cancer.   
A cutoff of 4.0 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 67.5- 80% for detecting prostate cancer [10] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Failure  
Treatment failure  will be assessed by [CONTACT_738366] 90 days or 
unacceptable toxicity  as determined by [CONTACT_737].  
5.6 Data Quality Assurance  
At the study sites, all CRFs will be manually reviewed for completeness by [CONTACT_1034] 's 
Clinical Research Associates.  Site Staff will enter the required subject data into the provided 
Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR)  Part 11-compliant electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
Programmed computer edit checks will be run against the database to check for discrepancies and pla usibility of the data.  All issues resulting from the computer -generated checks will be 
resolved according to the Sponsor 's standard data management practices in conjunction with 
the medical monitor, clinical study personnel, and the study Investigator s.  
6. Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
6.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
No formal statistical analysis will be performed, however, statistical derivation of all data will be derived by [CONTACT_738367].  
For the dose -escalation phase of the study, cohorts of 3 or 6 patients will be screened, 
registered and treated at each dose level. The actual sample size may vary depending on the 
incidence of DLT during Cycle 1 at a given dose level. Once the MTD/RP2D is determined, 
additional patients may be accrued to provide for [ADDRESS_1008876] (IRB) / Ethics Committee  
Before the start of the study, the study p rotocol, ICF, and/or other appropriate  documents will 
be submitted to the IRB , in accordance with local legal requirements.  It is the responsibility 
of the Investigator to ensure that all aspects of the IRB review are conducted in accordance 
Sensei Bio therapeutics , Inc  Study Protocol No. SNS0216 Version 5.0  
 
Version Date: [ADDRESS_1008877] of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance  with the ethical principles of the current version of 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Sponsor  and Investigator will comply with their 
responsibilities as defined in 21 CFR 312.50- 312.70 and I nternational Conference on 
Harmonization Guidance for Industry : E6 Good Clinical Practice (April 1996).  
7.3 Patient Information and Consent  
The Investigator will obtain informed consent from each patient enrolled in the study, in 
accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations [ADDRESS_1008878] approve the ICF to be used by [CONTACT_737].  It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that informed consent is obtained from the patient or his/her guardian 
or legal representative before any activity or treatment is undertaken which is not part of 
routine care.  This includes, but is not limited to, the performance of diagnostic, screening, or 
therapeutic procedures and the administration of the first dose of study treatment .  The draft 
version of the ICF will be modified by [CONTACT_738368].  The terms of the consent and when it was obtained 
must also be documented in the patient’s CRF. A second copy of the current ICF will be 
reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_738369]-screen ing on study if archived tumor 
tissue or fresh serum  is initially negative for HAAH.  Over this [ADDRESS_1008879] 
be agreed to in writing, and signed, by [CONTACT_738370].  The changes then become part 
of the study protocol.  Any changes in the protocol, even local/site requirements, will be 
written in an amendment.  The IRB must be informed of amendments and, if necessary, 
approval must be sought for ethical aspects.  Approval of amendments must also be obtained 
from the local regulatory authority, if necessary.  
7.5 Confidentiality  
All local legal requirements regarding data protection will be enforced.  All study findings and 
documents will be regarded as confidential.  The Investigator and members of his/her research 
team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from Sensei .  The 
anonymity of participating patients must be maintained.  Throughout documentation and 
evaluation, the patients will be  identified on CRFs and other documents submitted to Sensei

  Version Date: 5/28/[ADDRESS_446229] demons trated 
impairment in nitric oxide (NO) metabolism of which several mechanisms have been postulated 
including: abnormally elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) level - a potent 
endogenous competitive inhibitor of NO 3, overp roduction of free radicals which have been 
identified in patients with elevated cholesterol and coronary artery disease and reduction in NO 
synthesis 4-6.  Impaired availability of NO has been implicated in the development of coronary 
artery disease, and poorly controlled hypertension 7.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_446230] recent report by [CONTACT_357628] (IOM) , most Americans 
consume an average of sodium in excess of 3400 mg.  This far exceeds the center for disease 
(CDC) recommendation8 of less than [ADDRESS_446231] that 
dietary sodium intake is an important variable that would need to be controlled  in future studies 
of endothelial function.  
2.0 REACTIVE HYPEREMIA PULSITLE ARTERIAL TONOMETRY (RH -PAT)  
2.1 RH-PAT Device  
  Version Date: 5/28/14  
 3 The principle of PAT, a finger plethysmographic  device that allows the isolated detection 
of pulsatile arterial volume changes, has been described  15, 16. This device (Itamar M edical Ltd., 
Caesarea, Israel) consists of two finger -mounted probes, which include a system of inflatable 
latex air -cushions within a rigid external case. The probe design allows the application of a 
constant and evenly distributed near -diastolic counter -pressure within the entire probe, which 
increases sensitivity by [CONTACT_357629], and prevents venous blood pooling to 
avoid venoarteriolar reflex vasoconstriction. Pulsatile volume changes of the fingertip are sensed 
by a pressure transduc er and transferred to a personal computer where the signal is band pass -
filtered (0.3 to 30 Hz), amplified, displayed, and stored.  
 
2.2 RH-PAT and Other Methods for Assessing Vascular Endothelial Function  in Vivo 
Reactive hyperemia, which is due to dilation of small resistance vessels, is partly 
mediated by [CONTACT_147021] -derived NO and, therefore, the magnitude of the hyperemic response 
serves as an 
indicator for the 
status of 
endothelial 
function 17, 18. 
Moreover, using 
strain -gauge 
plethysmography, 
an excellent 
correlation 
between peak 
forearm blood 
flow response 
during RH  and 
that to intra -
arterial infusion 
of the 
endothelium -
dependent 
vasodilator 
acetylcholine has been demonstrated, indicating that the magnitude of RH may serve as an index 
of peripheral endothelial function  19; RH -PAT permits the noninvasive assessment of perip heral 
vascular reactivity by [CONTACT_357630]. Notably, although 
local, systemic, and environmental factors may modulate digital pulse volume, this parameter 
also depends on the bioavailability of NO  20. Moreover, endothelium -derived NO has been 
shown to be particularly important for the regulation of vascular tone in areas rich in 
arteriovenous anastomoses, such as the finger tip 21. The effect of NO synthesis inhibition by Nω-
nitro --arginine methyl ester (  -NAME) on the PAT response to reactive hyperemia was 
investigated recently22. In that study, 19 healthy volunteers underwent RH -PAT testing, 
according to the same protocol as was used in the present study, before and after administration 
of -NAME [CONTACT_357648]. Importantly, -NAME [CONTACT_357649] 
a significant  61% reduction (p < 0.05) in the RH -PAT index values, indicating that this index 
depends on endothelium -derived NO and, therefore, represents a marker of peripheral 
 
Figure 5: RH -PAT responses before and after brachial artery occlusion.  
  Version Date: 5/28/[ADDRESS_446232] endothelial function, including various cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of 
CAD, influence RH -PAT index values in a similar manner as flow -mediated dilation  (FMD)  of 
the brachial artery, a widely -used method to evaluate periphera l endothelial function 15. 
Furthermore, a significant relationship between the PAT response t o reactive hyperemia and 
flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery has been shown, suggesting that vascular reactivity 
of the digital vasculature, as measured by [CONTACT_357631] -PAT index, is influenced by [CONTACT_357632] a magnitude and direction simil ar to that of the brachial artery 15. 
 
Vasodilatation of a peripheral conduit artery followin g an increase in luminal blood flow 
and internal -wall shear is know n as flow -mediated dilatation (FMD). In practice it is perform ed 
following a period of distant limb ischemia. Strong evidence suggests that FMD is a valid 
endothelium -dependent and NO -speci fic index of endothelial function. To measure FMD we will 
adhere to current guidelines  23, 24. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_446233] lo cally or at distant sites.  Among these substances nitric oxide (NO) is 
probably the most heavily studied , and its reduced bioavailability is widely accepted to be 
responsible for endothelial dysfunction. Reduction of NO bioavailability can result from a 
defective eNOS expression/activity or from an excessive NO degradation, usually through an 
interaction with superoxide (O-2) that generates peroxynitrites (ONOO-). Endothelial damage is 
the first step of vascular remodeling. Unfortunately, the endothelium ha s a limited ability to 
repair itself and hence prevent or reverse  endothelial dysfunction. In animal models, direct 
information on the anatomical and function integrity of the endothelium can be easily obtained. 
In humans, endothelial function is usually a ssessed indirectly as the NO -dependent vasodilatory 
capacity of a given vascular bed to an endothelial stimulus either mechanical (shear stress, 
reactive hyperemia) or pharmacological (NO -dependent vasodilators, NOS inhibitors).  This 
indirect approach is h owever subjected to intra -patient variability, confounding effects, and 
cannot distinguish between anatomical and functional alterations. Other clinical indicators of 
endothelial dysfunction are represented by [CONTACT_357633] -1, ICAM, 
vWF, ADMA, and thrombomodulin, indicating pathological activation of the endothelium in the 
setting of a low grade inflammatory state. Relatively recently, more direct ex vivo  approaches 
have been developed to study the human endothelium, these include the study of mature 
circulating endothelial cells that may detach at an increase rate due to ongoing endothelial 
damage and can be isolated and incubated.  Similarly, circulating endothelial progenitor cells, 
discovered in 1997, can be obtained and cultivated t o study mechanisms of vascular repair and 
regeneration. A third method involves the harvesting of viable endothelial cells via an 
endothelial biopsy, this allow the study of gene and/or protein expression.  
 
 Endothelial biopsy has been used to quantify eNO S expression (by [CONTACT_357634]), its activity [by [CONTACT_357635] -1177 phosphor ylated eNOS (P -eNOS)] and 
also NO -dependent reactive oxygen induced stress (by [CONTACT_357636] ). Ideally samples 
from a suspected damaged artery (coronary) should be obtained, either during routine cardiac 
catheterization or after the procedure has been performed, however this is not always possible to 
  Version Date: 5/28/14  
 5 do. Vein sampling has the advantage of its acc essibility and it has reported  a good correlation 
(r=0.7) for protein expressi on of eNOS, P -eNOS and  nitrotyr osine from samples obtained form a 
peripheral artery and the brachial artery.

6.0 ENROLLMENT , RANDOMIZATION & BLINDING   
6.1 Recruitment  
For the parent study, t he patients  with orthostatic intolerance  will be recruited from 
patients referred to the Vanderbilt University Autonomic Dysfunction Center.  Control subjects

not required to participate in this study even if they choose to particip ate in the parent study.  
 
6.2 Randomization  
There will be no randomization for this specific sub -study. The order of diets (low 
sodium vs. high sodium) will be performed as a part of the parent study, and not as a part of this 
sub-study.    
 
6.[ADDRESS_446235]  as a part of the parent study . Pregnant women will not be 
allowed to participate.  
 
The history will include (but not be limited to) :

7.[ADDRESS_446236] will be assessed  (as 
below) while on a very low -sodium (10 mEq/day)  diet compared with a very high -sodium diet.  
These acute dietary interventions will be part of the parent study ( “Dietary Salt i n Postural 
Tachcyardia Syndrome” funded by R01 HL102387) for 4 -5 days at the time of the study.  
  Version Date: 5/28/14  
 7 Dietary success will be assessed using a 24h urine for sodium and creatinine as a part of the 
parent study.  
 
7.2.1 Blood work  
 Blood will be drawn and collected in a fasting state  for future assay and analysis of the 
following tests:  
• Glucose, Insulin (glucose impairment, insulin resistance)  
• Fasting lipid profile  
• C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) (inflammatory state)  
• Inflammatory cytokine s (inflammatory state)  
• F2-isoprostanes (oxidative stress)  
• PAI-1 antigen, fibrinogen (prothrombotic state)  
 
7.2.2. Urine Collection  
 A morning urine sample will be collected , and an aliquot saved for urinary isoprostanes.  
 
7.2.3 Pulsitile Arterial Tonometry  (PAT)  Protocol  
• Performed on Day 6 of parent protocol (5 days of low/high sodium diet).  
• All studies will be performed in a fasting state or at  least 2 hours following a meal.   
• Subjects will be studied in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_357624] a 
comfort able, thermoneutral environment.  
• A blood pressure cuff will be placed on one upper arm (study arm ; non -dominant ), while the 
contralateral arm will s erve as a control (control arm).  
• RH-PAT probes will be placed on one finger (fing er II, III, or IV) of each hand (same finger 
on both hands). The fingers on either side of the one with the probe will be se parated using 
soft sponge rings.  
• Continuous recording of pulsatile blood volume responses from both h ands will be initiated.  
• After a  10-min equilibration period, the blood pressure cuff on the study arm will be inflated 
to 60 mm Hg above systolic pressure for 5 min. The cuff will then be deflated to induce 
reactive hyperemia,  PAT recording will be stopped.  
 
7.2.4 PAT Analysis  
 The RH-PAT data will be analyzed by a computer in an operator -independent manner. As 
a measure of the extent of reactive hyperemia , the RH -PAT index was calculated as the ratio of 
the average amplitude of the PAT signal over a 1 -min time interval starting 1 min af ter cuff 
deflation divided by [CONTACT_357638] a 3.5 -min time period b efore 
cuff inflation (baseline).  RH-PAT index values from the study arm were then normalized to the 
control arm to compensate for potential systemic changes.  
 
7.2.5 Calf Blood Flow in Reactive Hyperemia (CBF -RH) 
 Calf blood flow (CBF) will be determined using venous occlusion plethysmography and 
calibrated mercury strain -gauges (EC -6, D.E. Hokanson Inc., Bellevue, Washington, [LOCATION_003]) 
during reactive hyperemia after a [ADDRESS_446237] part of the non -dominant calf (~10 cm below patella). Participants will 
remain quietly supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 10 min with legs elevated on foam pads above the right atrium to 
achieve stable baseline measurements of CBF. The venous occlus ion cuff is inflated for 4 seconds at 
  Version Date: 5/28/14  
 8 8 seconds intervals, while monitoring the change in resistance in the system, pressure inside the 
measuring cuff, and 5 -10 determinations are performed  The plethysmograph output signal will be 
transmitted recorded usin g the WINDAQ data acquisition system (DI220, DATAQ, Acron, OH, 14 Bit, 
500Hz) and processed off -line. T he slope will be express as milliliters (ml) per minute per 100 ml 
of forearm tissue (ml/min/100 ml tissue).  After [ADDRESS_446238]’s systolic blood pressure to occlude ankle circulation, resting blood flow will be 
measured as the average of the last [ADDRESS_446239]’s systolic blood pressure, using a cuff located proximal to the patella. Again one minute 
before thigh cuff release, the ankle cuff will be inflated to [ADDRESS_446240]’s systolic 
blood pressure , and measurem ents of CBF will be repeated for the next 3 minutes.  
 
7.2.6 Protein expression of harvested endothelial cells  
 A 20 -gauge intravenous catheter will be inserted into a superficial forearm vein. Under 
sterile conditions, 3 J -shaped vascular guidewires will b e sequentially advanced into the vein up 
to 10 cm. Endothelial cells will be retrieved from the wire tips by [CONTACT_357639] (Invitrogen) at 4 C. Endothelial cells will be recovered by [CONTACT_357640] 
3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, washed twice with PBS, transferred to poly -L-lysine 
coated slides (Sigma), and air dried at 37 C. The slides will be then stored at -70 C until 
analyzed.  
 Using this procedure it is possible to measure basal eNO production and activ ity 
measuring venous endothelial expression of total eNOS and activated eNOS (P -eNOS) by 
[CONTACT_357641]. Vascular inflammation and oxidative stress can be determined 
by [CONTACT_357642] -B (NFB) an d nitrotyrosine.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_446241] 30 minutes after all 
instrumentation procedures are done. The arm will be kept extended and immobilized at heart 
level. Brachial artery diameter will be measured using a high resolution ultrasonography (iU22 
xMatrix Ultrasound System, Philips, Andover MA)  using a linear array probe with a 5 to 17 
MHz frequency range (L17 -5 Broadband Linear Array Transducer,  Philips, Andover MA ). The 
brachial artery will be imaged in long itudinal sections, [ADDRESS_446242] 1 mi nute. The rapid occlusion cuff (Hokanson)  will be inflated and maintained for [ADDRESS_446243] ’s systolic blood pressure  to produce transient ischemia . 
Measurement of post -deflation diameter will be initiated before cuff release  and continue for 5 
minutes following deflation.   
Flow velocity and brachial artery diameter will be continuously measure d using duplex 
ultrasound. Blood velocity will be assessed using an insonation  angle  <60. The B -mode will 
  Version Date: 5/28/[ADDRESS_446244] all images. Images will be digitized from the 
video output of the ultrasound machine using a frame grabber on a pers onal computer. Image 
acquisition will be gated with an ECG signal so that images will be captured at end diastole at 
each cardiac cycle.   
Brachial artery diameter will be assessed by a single trained operator using an automated, 
beat-by-beat edge detection  and wall -tracking image processing software (Vascular Tools 5.0, 
Medical Imaging Applications, [LOCATION_003]). Peak diameter will be calculated using automated 
mathematical algorithms. Data will be presented as absolute (mm) and relative FMD response 
(%). The area under the curve until peak diameter will also be measured and presented.  
 
7.3 Study Outcome Measures  
• RH-PAT index  
• Brachial artery diameter changes.  
• CBF -RH 
• Other b lood parameters (outlined in section 7.2.1) 
 
8.[ADDRESS_446245] of RH-PAT between all subjects ( POTS 
patients and control subjects ) on the high sodium diet vs. the low sodium diet.  
 
8.2 Secondary Analysis  
Secondary analyses will include non-parametric paired comparisons between low sodium 
and high sodium diets  of continuous outcome measu res (outlined in section 7.3). Secondary 
comparisons might also assess differences in the d ietary sodium induced changes between POTS 
patients and control subjects.  
 
8.3 Sample Size Calculation  
As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there are  no preliminary data available on the RH-PAT index  in 
different sodium diets . Published data indicate that the RH -PAT index in 39 healthy subjects 
without endothelial function is 1.78±0.08 (mean±SEM) 25. In the same study, RH -PAT<1.[ADDRESS_446246] discriminator of coronary endothelial function.  We will designate a more 
conservative Δ RH-PAT= 0.[ADDRESS_446247] deviation around the difference will 
be 0.5 (based on the above data) , for an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_446248] of continuous data , and a 0.05 two -sided significance level, a sample size of 44 
(combined POTS patients and control subjects ) would give 90% power to detect this difference  
26. To account for drop -outs, we propose to enroll  up to 50 subjects in total  from the parent study .  
Using the same assumptions, 33 subjects would give 80% power to detect the same difference (in 
case of enrollment difficulties for this sub -study).

Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________  
 
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any questions you 
may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this consent form.   
 
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn something n ew that may affect the 
risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide whether or not you still want to be in this study.    
 
     
1. What is the purpose of this study?  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because  you are healthy  and are taking part in another 
study ( Dietary Salt in Postural Tachycardia Syndrome). We want to measure chemicals in your blood while you are 
on a very high salt or a very low salt  diet. About 44 people will take part in this study.  
 
2. What  will happen and how long will you be in the study?  
   
If you agree to be in this study, we will use information you have given us for other studies , and we will look at your 
medical record. We will also use information you have given us for the Dietary Sa lt in Postural Tachycardia 
Syndrome study (called the parent study.)  
 
On Day 6 of each phase  of the parent study  (there are two phases) , we will study you either before you have eaten  
in the morning or at least [ADDRESS_446253] eaten . We will take bl ood from your arm with a needle ( about 1 
tablespoon  in each time.)  
  
We will then ask you to lie down. We will place a blood pressure cuff on one arm and small probes on one finger on 
each of your hands. We will place soft sponge rings on either side of t he probed fingers to keep them separated. 
The probes will measure your blood pressure. We will measure the diameter of the artery in your arm using 
ultrasound.  Ultrasound involves putting a probe on your skin to get measurements. It is not invasive and doe s not 
cause pain.  
 
After [ADDRESS_446254] for 9 minutes, your blood pressure and calf blood flow will be measured for 
one minute. For this, we wil l inflate the blood pressure cuff on your lower leg to a pressure high enough to stop the 
blood flow. After 1 minute the cuff will be deflated, and your blood pressure and forearm blood flow will be recorded. 
We will then inflate the cuff placed on your up per leg to stop the blood flow of your leg for 5 minutes (like a 
tourniquet). At the end of this 5 minutes the cuff will be released, and we will repeat the measurements of blood 
pressure and calf blood flow for the next 3 minutes.  
 
We will insert a small tube (catheter) into a vein in your forearm. We will then slide a tiny wire into your vein to 
collect cells from the walls of your vein. We will do this three times. Then we will remove the small tube.

 This study will then be complete. Th e study will las t about 2 hours on each study day.  
 
3. Costs to you if you take part in this study:  
 
 If you agree to take part in this research study, you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the tests and 
treatments that are being done only for research.  
For this  study it includes the research only procedures noted in section 2 above.  
However, you are still responsible for paying for the  usual  care you would normally receive for the  treatment of  your 
illness. This includes treatments and tests you would need even if you were not in this study . These costs will be 
billed to you and/or your insurance.  
 
4. Side effects and risks that you can expect if you take part in this study:   
 
Inconveniences:  It may be inconvenient to come to the CRC.  
 
Blood drawing and catheter in  vein:  Drawing blood with a needle in a vein may be painful and may cause 
bruising, bleeding, or rarely, infection.  Some people  may feel faint when having a needle  put in their arm.    
 
Blood pressure cuff:  Some may find it uncomfortable to hold their ar ms or legs with an inflated cuff placed around 
the forearm , finger, or thigh, in a mostly still  position, or have the cuff inflated frequently.  The finger probes may be 
tight and uncomfortable.  
 
5. Risks that are not known:  
 
None.  
 
6.  Payment in case you are  injured because of this research study:  
 
If it is determined by [CONTACT_357646] a direct result of the tests or 
treatments that are done for research, then you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the c ost of immediate 
medical care provided at Vanderbilt to treat the injury.  
 
There are no plans for Vanderbilt  to pay for the costs of any additional care. There are no plans for Vanderbilt to 
give you money for the injury.   
 
7.  Good effects that might res ult from this study:   
 
a) The benefits to science and humankind that might  result from this study. we may learn more about how the 
autonomic nervous system may affect people with POTS. This may lead to new treatments for this condition.   
b) The benefits yo u might get from being in this study. None.  
 
8.  Other treatments you could get if you decide not to be in this study:  
   
     This is not a treatment study.  You can choose not to be in this study, and nothing about your health care will change.

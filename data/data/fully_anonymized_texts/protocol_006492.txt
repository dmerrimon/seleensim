Implementation of 
Educational Resources (PRECISION Program) into Clinical Practice using Telehealth 
and In-Person Platforms 
 
 
Background/Rationale:  The [COMPANY_008] US PRECISION initiative formed an advisor 
network of scientific and clinical experts and healthcare practitioners (HCP) to develop a point-of-care tool
the for the 
identification of patients at risk for adverse outcomes from uncontrolled asthma. To date, the AIR
a variety of clinical practices (i.e. allergy, pulmonary and primary care) was evaluated in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_342394]-received by [CONTACT_342408].  A cross-sectional validation study was conducted that demonstrated the validity of the 
-
record documented prior-
points for levels  consists of 10 
yes/no items with the total score used to identify patients at risk for poor asthma outcomes. 
This study aims to evaluate the implementation of 
educational resources (PRECISION program) in clinical practice using telehealth and in-
person platforms. 
Objectives and Hypotheses: The primary objective of this study is: 
1. To assess the process (ease of use and challenges to HCPs and patients) and potential 
benefits (ability to capture and take action to remediate previously unrecognized 
morbidity) of implementing 
 Asthma Checklist, and educational 
resources (PRECISION program) into clinical  practice during telehealth and in-person 
visits. 
The secondary objectives of this study are: 
1. T clinic the Asthma 
Checklist, and educational resources (PRECISION program) are utilized as part of a 
telehealth or in-person visit with their HCP;

10 program in clinical practice (sustainability stage). The nine-month implementation stage will 
allow for the recruitment of approximately 50 patients at each site for an initial study visit, 
plus the potential for follow-up visit(s). The three-month sustainability stage will allow for sites to continue to implement the PRECISION program in their clinical practice and for sites 
to describe any continued benefits of using the PRECISION program at their site. 
Approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) clinical sites will be recruited to participate in this 
study, categorized into the following three practice clusters: (1) primary care site (e.g., private 
practice, FQHC; (2) specialty care site (pulmonary, asthma/immunology); and (3) novel sites 
(e.g., pharmacy, nurse practitioners, nurse educators, prescribers and Non-prescribers, telehealth component of Allergy and Asthma Network). While all sites will be able to conduct 
both in-person and telehealth visits, sites will aim to conduct a minimum of approximately 25% of their initial patient visit using a telehealth platform. Both platforms (in-person and 
telehealth) can be used for the follow-up visit(s) for all practice types. 
During the clinic visit (telehealth or in-person), HCPs will assess the 
 questions, discuss the results with the patient, and use the Assess component of the 
Asthma Checklist (as appropriate per HCP judgment).  Before completing the initial study 
visit, patients will be asked if they would be willing to complete additional questions and, for 
those who agree, sites will send them an electronic survey link (via YouGov) which will 
include the following questionnaires: the Asthma Clinic Experience (ACE) Questionnaire, 
and a Patient 
Sociodemographics Questionnaire. If a follow-up visit (telehealth or in-person) is conducted during the follow-up period
-month recall 
version (regardless of timing of follow-up visit). Sites/HCPs will complete a Clinical Case 
Report Form (CRF) after the initial visit and after the follow-up visit (if conducted) for each 
participant.  It should be noted that for all visits (initial and follow up), HCPs will be required 
to review the Assess component of the Asthma Checklist and provide their responses on the 
CRF; the Adjust and Review components of the Asthma Checklist will be available, along with the other PRECISION resources, on the study website as well, but will not be mandatory 
to complete,   
Additionally, Evidera will host a 30-minute conference call with each clinical site for up to 
four (4) time points (touchpoints) to discuss the implementation of PRECISION tools (i.e., 
frequency of visits to and the number of PDF views from study website), assess whether sites 
are meeting their targets for using the telehealth platform, address site questions, and discuss 
any challenges of implementing the PRECISION program. These meetings will take place at 
Months 1, 2, 3 (optional), and 6 and will also be used to identify any sites that may benefit 
from participating in a re-training session. The optional Month 3 touchpoint will be based on 
whether the site is having any difficulties with the study.  
Study Population:  Clinic staff will invite patients age >13 years with HCP-confirmed asthma 
diagnosis who are presenting for a clinic visit (telehealth or in-person) to complete the 
and participant questionnaires. Each site will aim to recruit approximately 50 patients 
with a total sample size ranging from approximately 750 to 1,500 patients. CCICCI

be conducted as part of the primary endpoint, and a formal sample size estimation is not 
applicable. Each site will target approximately [ADDRESS_424183], and educational resources (PRECISION program) among 
approximately 50 patients per site will provide sites with enough experience to provide 
feedback on the outcomes, barriers, benefits, challenges, ease of implementation, and areas for 
improvement for future integration as a telehealth platform. 
Statistical Analysis : Descriptive statistics (n, frequency, mean, SD) will be used to 
characterize the sample in terms of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The 
sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will be summarized for the sample overall as 
well as for each site and cluster. Descriptive statistics (n, frequency, mean, SD) will also be 
used to summarize the actions of HCPs (e.g., actions accessed/taken, step up/step down/no 
change in therapy, referral to a specialist, initiation of biologics), results from the 
responses on the Post-study Survey ACE Questionnaire and the

16 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Uncontrolled and severe uncontrolled asthma (SUA) are under-identified and sub-optimally 
treated. The clinical and economic burden of SUA is disproportionately high, accounting for 
nearly 40% of asthma-related costs (Moore et al. 2007; Nunes et al. 2017); uncontrolled 
asthma affects more than 50% of children and adults with asthma. With advances in asthma 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], an urgent need exists to optimize uncontrolled and SUA recognition and primary 
care management; and when indicated, referral to qualified specialists. 
The [COMPANY_008] [LOCATION_002] (US) PRECISION initiative formed an advisor network of 
scientific and clinical experts, as well as healthcare practitioners (HCPs), to develop a point-
of-care tool the Asthma Impairment and Risk Questionnaire  (AIRQ ). This is designed 
to identify patients living with asthma whose health may be at risk from uncontrolled asthma, 
and to facilitate shared decision-making between patients and HCPs. The AIRQ  is intended 
to be completed by [CONTACT_342410], or during an in-person clinic 
visit and includes questions that address medication use, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and asthma-related impairment. 
items, with the total score and control categories used to identify patients at risk for poor 
asthma outcomes. All response options are in an easy yes/no format. In addition to the 
, HCPs are provided with the Asthma Checklist and supplemental educational 
resources, based on the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, National Asthma 
Education and Prevention Program Guidelines (2007; 2020), and key expert reviews on 
asthma assessment and management to facilitate decision-making and developed by 
[CONTACT_342411]. 
The AIRQ , Asthma Checklist, and educational resources are for use among patients [ADDRESS_424185] precision 
medicine in practice. 
1.2 Rationale 
To date, the AIRQ  has been qualitatively evaluated among patients in an interview setting 
to ensure that it is understandable and easy to complete. The feasibility of implementing the 
AIRQ  into a variety of clinical practices (i.e., allergy, pulmonary, and primary care) was 
evaluated in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_342394]-received by [CONTACT_342412] D2287L00028 [EVA-[ZIP_CODE]-03] Version 2.0

Version 3.0 
Form Doc ID: AZDoc0059948 
Parent Doc ID: SOP LDMS_001_00164328 
[ADDRESS_424186]  (ACT ) score, plus medical-record 
documented prior-year exacerbations to derive the final AIRQ  items, scoring, and cut points 
of varying levels of asthma control (Murphy et al. 2020). The final AIRQ consists of 10 
yes/no items, with the total score and control categories used to identify patients at risk for 
poor asthma outcomes. 
The AIRQ  performs well in identifying patients who are well controlled vs. not well/very 
poorly controlled (with receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves of 0.93 for the 0 to 10 
summed score model) and identifies well/not well controlled vs. very poorly controlled 
asthma (ROC curves of 0.90 for the 0 to 10 summed score model), as reflected by [CONTACT_941] 
-
for separating well-controlled vs. all others, with a specificity of 0.96 for separating very poorly controlled from all others. A longitudinal study is being conducted to assess the 
predictive ability of the AIRQ
 as a screening tool for predicting future exacerbations as well 
as health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
This study aims to evaluate the implementation of the AIRQ , Asthma Checklist, and 
educational resources (PRECISION program) into  clinical practice using telehealth and in-
person platforms. 
2. OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES 
2.1 Primary Objective & Hypothesis

3.1 Study Design  General Aspects 
The purpose of this community program intervention study is to examine the process of 
 (PRECISION program) 
into clinical practice using either in-
treatment and asthma work-up and management, will be assessed. The duration of enrollment 
is nine months for each site (implementation stage), with an additional 3 months of follow-up 
to assess the sustainability of using the PRECISION program in clinical practice. The nine-
month implementation stage allows for the recruitment of approximately 50 patients per site 
for an initial visit, plus the potential for follow-up visits during the study. The three-month 
sustainability stage will allow for sites to continue to implement the PRECISION program in 
their clinical practice and for sites to describe any continued benefits of implementing the 
PRECISION program at their site. 
Approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) clinical sites will be recruited to participate in this 
study, categorized into the following four practice clusters: (1) primary care site (e.g., private 
practice, FQHC; (2) specialty care site (pulmonary, asthma/immunology); and (3) novel sites 
(e.g., pharmacy, nurse practitioners, nurse educators, prescribers and non-prescribers, 
telehealth component of Allergy and Asthma Network, pharmacy).  While all sites will be 
able to conduct both in-person and telehealth visits, sites will aim to conduct approximately 
25% of their initial patient visit using a telehealth platform (at a minimum). Both platforms 
(in-person and telehealth) can be used for the follow-up visit(s) for all clusters.  Each site will 
recruit a target of approximately [ADDRESS_424187] a 30-minute conference call with each clinical site for up to 
four (4) time points (touchpoints) to discuss the implementation of PRECISION tools (i.e., 
frequency of visits to and the number of PDF views from study website), assess whether sites 
are meeting their targets for using the telehealth platform, address site questions, and discuss 
any challenges of implementing the PRECISION program. These meetings will take place at 
Months 1, 2, 3 (optional), and 6 and will also be used to identify any sites that may benefit 
from participating in a re-training session. The optional Month 3 touchpoint will be based on 
whether the site is having any difficulties with the study. After the 9-month implementation 
stage is complete, each site will be followed for another 3 months (maintenance stage). 
After verbally consenting patients (or parent/guardian when applicable) and documenting 
consent in the Patient Verbal Informed Consent Script, a staff member at the participating

20 clinical sites will administer the AIRQ  to patients >13 years old with an HCP-confirmed 
asthma diagnosis who are presenting to the clinic (via telehealth or in-person). After 
completing the AIRQ , patients will be asked if they would be willing to complete an 
additional survey, sent as an electronic link via email, following the initial visit. For those participants who agree, clinical staff will 
database so that an electronic survey link from YouGov will be emailed to the patient within 
48 hours after the initial visit.  This survey includes the following questionnaires: 
, the ACE Questionnaire, , and the Patient Sociodemographics 
Questionnaire. Up to two (2) reminder e-mails will be sent to participants who have yet to 
complete the survey within approximately one week (7 days) of receiving the initial survey 
link e-mail.  
During the clinic visit (telehealth or in-person), HCPs will assess the 
AIRQ questions and discuss the results with the patient, use the full Asthma Checklist (as 
appropriate per HCP judgment), and access the educational resources (PRECISION program) 
either at the point of care or after the visit to guide assessments, adjustments, and follow-up 
for reviewing responses to patient education and management interventions. If a follow-up 
visit is conducted, the clinical site will administer the AIRQ  3-month recall version. 
Sites/HCPs will complete a Clinical Case Report Form (CRF) after the initial visit and after 
the follow-up visit (if conducted) for each participant.  It should be noted that for all visits 
(initial and baseline), HCPs will be required to review the Assess component of the Asthma 
Checklist and provide their responses on the CRF; the Adjust and Review components of the 
Asthma Checklist will be available on the study website as well, but will not be mandatory to 
complete,  
The study team originally planned to collect exacerbation data to compare [ADDRESS_424188] a 30-minute conference call with each clinical site for up to four-time points 
(touchpoints) to discuss the use of PRECISION tools, assess the mix of telehealth and in-
person visits, address site questions, and discuss a set of questions that focus on the challenges 
and efficiencies of using the PRECISION program. These meetings will take place at Months CCI

participating in a re-training session. The optional Month 3 touchpoint will be based on 
whether the site is having any difficulties with the study. After the 9-month implementation 
stage is complete, each site will be followed for another three months (maintenance stage). 
After patient enrollment and follow-up visits have been completed, prescribing providers at 
clinical sites (or the asthma coaches from the novel cluster of the Asthma and Allergy 
Network, or Non-prescribers, or nurse case-managers) will self-complete the Post-study 
Survey. The focus of this questionnaire will be to obtain feedback on the implementation of 
the AIRQ , Asthma Checklist, and educational resources (PRECISION program) as part of 
their clinical practice (telehealth platform and in-person). 
Finally, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_342396] (up to three staff members 
per site) will participate in a qualitative interview to gain a full understanding of the processes 
and issues related to implementing the AIRQ , Asthma Checklist and educational resources 
(PRECISION program) as part of their clinical practice (telehealth and in-person visits). 
Additionally, the interviews will explore the best practices that may have been unique to their 
site, as well as plans for continuing the use of the AIRQ  and PRECISION tools. The 
telephone interviews will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_424189] up to 60 minutes; all interviews will be audio-
recorded and transcribed. 
3.1.1 Data Source(s) 
Approximately fifteen (15) to twenty (20) clinical sites will be selected to implement the 
 educational resources (PRECISION program) into 
clinical practice using telehealth and in-person platforms. The sites will be selected based on 
part of their care practice, the number of asthma patients visiting the clinic via telehealth per 
week, the diversity of the asthma patients treated by [CONTACT_3652], the ability of the site to 
complete the study tasks in the allotted timeframe, and the anticipated unique component(s) 
used to contribute to the implementation process by [CONTACT_3452]. Each site will be 
responsible for recruiting approximately 50 asthma patients per site. 
3.2 Study Population 
Clinic staff will invite patients >13 years old with an HCP-confirmed asthma diagnosis who 
are presenting for a telehealth or in-person visit to complete the AIRQ . Each site will aim to 
recruit approximately 50 patients, with a total sample size of 750 to 1,500 patients.

Sites will be asked to ensure that the AIRQTM is completed before the patient sees the HCP.  
For in-person visits, the AIRQTM can be completed by [CONTACT_342413] (self-
administration) or completed by [CONTACT_342414]-administered. For telehealth visits, 
the AIRQTM can be sent to patients in advance of the visit (e.g., sent via email as a PDF or 
sent via a link to www.digitalairq.com) and completed by [CONTACT_342413] (self-
administration) or completed by [CONTACT_342414]-administered. In the case that the 
patient receives the AIRQTM in advance of their visit, the patient can provide their responses 
on the self-completed AIRQTM to the site staff who will then transpose patient responses to the 
CRF paper version of the AIRQTM and provide to the HCP at the start of the visit.  Examples 
of ways to administer the AIRQTM during a telehealth visit will be provided as part of the site 
training.

All analyses will be detailed in a Statistical Analysis Plan.  Additional exploratory analyses 
may be performed to further examine specific aspects of available clinical data. 
5.2 Bias 
5.2.1 Methods to Minimize Bias 
Given that completing the ACE Questionnaire is optional, the potential for response bias (e.g., 
patients who like the telehealth platform may be more inclined to complete the survey) may be 
introduced into this study. This will be noted when interpreting the results. Additionally, 
patients who have a follow-up assessment may be more severe than those who do not; thus, 
change scores may not be representative of the entire sample, which will also be noted when 
interpreting results.

sample size. The limitations of this study include that up to 20 clinical sites may not be 
generalizable to all clinical sites treating asthma patients across the US, and that the patient 
sample may not be generalizable to all asthma patients >13 years old across the US. 
5.3 Sample Size and Power Calculations 
As the aim of this study is to assess the process and feasibility of implementing the AIRQ  
using a telehealth platform, inferential statistics will not be conducted, and a formal sample 
size estimation is not applicable. Each site will target approximately 50 patients; however, 
some sites may be able to recruit more than 50 patients, resulting in a total sample size of 
approximately 750 to 1,500 patients. Further, each cluster (primary care, specialist, novel) will CCI

6.1.2 Procedures 
Patients will be recruited from approximately 15 to 20 clinical sites in geographically diverse 
locations across the US. Clinical site staff will identify and verify the initial eligibility of 
potential participants through a review of patient records. Clinical sites may identify potential 
participants through daily telehealth visit schedules, chart/database/emergency medical record 
reviews, or recruit via advertisement (Asthma and Allergy Network only) (Appendix X). 
Clinical site staff and/or prescribing HCPs will ensure the completion (either self- or 
interviewer-administered) of the  3-month Recall when follow-up 
visits may occur during the study follow-up period of [ADDRESS_424204], and implement educational resources 
(PRECISION program), as well as complete the Clinical CRF and the Follow-up Clinical 
CRF for all patients throughout the study. 
At the start of patient enrollment, Evidera will provide each clinical site with Participant 
Packets for all study participants. Each packet will be labeled with a unique participant 
identification (ID) number, and all forms included in the packet will have headers pre-
populated with the same unique participant ID number. The packet will include the Patient

46 Verbal Informed Consent Script, which includes consent/assent documentation, the AIRQ , 
the Clinical CRF, which includes the Assess component of the Asthma Checklist (page 1 
only), the AIRQ 3-month Recall, and the Follow-up Clinical CRF, which includes the 
Assess component of the Asthma Checklist (page 1). Note that the Assess component of the 
Asthma Checklist is mandatory for this study, while the Adjust and Review Responses 
component of the Asthma Checklist (pages 2-3) will be used at the discretion of the HCP. The 
 3-month Recall and the Follow-up Clinical CRF will be paper clipped and printed on 
yellow paper to differentiate these two follow-up forms from the baseline forms that are 
completed during the initial visit. The patient will complete the AIRQ  before seeing their 
HCP at the initial visit (telehealth or in-person), and the AIRQ  3-month Recall before 
seeing their HCP at the follow-up visit (telehealth or in-person). Training will be provided to 
sites on options available for administering the AIRQTM (i.e., digital vs paper formats). 
Before or during the initial visit, a clinical site staff member will introduce the study to the 
patient using the Patient Verbal Informed Consent Script. The scripts provide an overview of 
the purpose and nature of the study and will be used to obtain verbal consent from the 
patient/guardian, as well as assent from those participants under the age of 18 years. For 
patients 18 years or older, the site will document that the patient provided verbal consent. For 
patients aged 13-17 years, the site will document that the parent/guardian has granted consent 
and that the patient has provided assent. The clinical site staff will document patient eligibility 
and interest using the Recruitment Tracking Log (Appendix Y), including documentation of 
the number of patients who choose not to participate or are ineligible. 
Once the patient has provided verbal consent/assent to the clinical site staff to participate in 
this study, and the clinical site staff has documented that the patient has provided 
consent/assent (Patient Verbal Informed Consent Screening Script), the clinical staff will 
ensure that the patient completes the AIRQ  before seeing the HCP.  After the questionnaire 
has been completed, clinical staff will ask the participant if they would be willing to complete 
an additional brief survey following their visit and at 3-months. If participants agree to 
complete the additional survey, 
database at YouGov so that YouGov may send a survey link to the participant within 48 hours 
of enrollment (English Version: Appendix Z; Spanish Version: Appendix AA). The survey 
link will include the following questionnaires: the ACE Questionnaire,   
 and the Patient Sociodemographics Questionnaire. Participants will 
be asked to complete the survey within seven (7) days. Up to two email reminders will be sent 
to participants who have yet to complete the survey within approximately one week (7 days) 
of receiving the initial e-mail with the survey link (English Version: Appendix BB; Spanish 
Version: Appendix CC).  CCI

available in both English and Spanish. 
Upon completion of the AIRQ , the clinical staff member will provide ALL  materials in the 
enrollment packet to the HCP conducting the clinical visit (telehealth or in-person). The HCP 
will review the AIRQ  results and total score during the clinic visit. If the HCP feels it is 
appropriate, he/she may discuss with the patie nt his/her responses to individual screener 
questions. The HCP will then use the AIRQ  results in conjunction with the Asthma 
Checklist and education materials (PRECISION program) with the patient to guide the 
 Following the 
clinic visit (telehealth or in-person), the HCP and site staff will complete the Clinical CRF, 
which also includes responses to the Assess component of the Asthma Checklist and 
documentation of study eligibility and consent. 
If a follow-up patient clinic visit occurs after the initial visit, the site staff/HCP will be asked 
to ensure that the participant completes the AIRQ  3-month Recall, using the same 
procedures as the initial telehealth visit. A Follow-up CRF form will also be completed during 
this visit.  Note that patients will not be asked to complete additional questionnaires at the 
follow-up visit. 
The study team originally planned to collect exacerbation data to compare [ADDRESS_424206] a 30-
minute conference call with each clinical site for up to four (4) time points (touchpoints) at 
Months 1, 2, 3 (optional), and 6 to discuss the use of the PRECISION tools, address site 
questions, and discuss a set of touchpoint questions that focus on the challenges and 
facilitators of implementing the PRECISION program. These meetings will also be used to 
identify any sites that may benefit from participating in a re-training session (budget assumes 
up to six sites will need re-training). The optional month three (3) touchpoint will be based on 
whether the site is having any difficulties with the study.

53 This study involves participant-completed measures for information purposes only; the study 
does not involve the use of an investigational drug or device. There are no known risks or 
benefits to participants. During or following the research study, patients may become more 
aware of how they feel about their condition and how their condition may affect certain 
aspects of their lives. Patients will be encouraged to talk with their asthma provider about their 
questions or concerns. The elements of federal regulations about consent procedures, 
disclosure of potential risks and benefits, and patient confidentiality will be strictly observed. 
6.2.2 Health Care Practioner and Key Clinical Site Staff Informed Consent

asthma educator, care coordinator, physician assistant) and key clinical site staff (e.g., site 
coordinator) will be provided full and adequate written information before consenting to 
participate in the Post-study Survey and full and adequate oral information before 
participating in the semi-structured interviews about the nature, purpose, procedures, risks, 
and benefits of the survey and interview. HCPs/key clinical site staff participants will also be 
notified that they are free to withdraw from participating in the survey or interview at any time. Participants will also be informed that, should they choose not to participate in all or any 
part of the survey or interview, their current or future employment at the site will not be 
affected. HCPs/key clinical site staff participants will be given an opportunity to ask questions 
and given time to consider the information provided. Before completing the Post-study 
Survey, HCPs will consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_13158] a box that indicates that, by [CONTACT_342427], they are voluntarily agreeing to take part in the survey. 
HCPs/key clinical site staff participating in the semi-structured interviews will be required to 
provide verbal consent to participate in the interview. Research staff will be responsible for 
documenting the HCP and 
HCP/ script.

6.3 Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events/Adverse Drug 
Reactions 
This is a community program intervention study, with no requirements to actively collect AEs 
during the study, since study enrollment is based on disease diagnosis and does not require the 
administration of an AZ drug. However, if an investigator (or patient) would like to report an 
AE that is not required to be collected, this can be reported as a spontaneous report according 
to local regulations and procedures. 
It is also not required to report potential AEs based on answers to the following patient-

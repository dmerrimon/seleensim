Inhibitor-Related Fatigue 
Page 4 of 352.0 Objectives 
Our long-term goal is to develop an effective and scalable intervention to reduce fatigue 
and symptom-related suffering in women with advanced ovarian cancer on PARP inhibitors 
(PARPi). In this study, we propose a two-arm, multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_503604], acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of REVITALIZE, a 6-week 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) telehealth intervention vs. enhanced usual care 
(EUC) in up to 50 fatigued patients with ovarian cancer on maintenance PARPi. Designed to 
increase psychological flexibility and values-based behavior, we hypothesize that REVITALIZE 
will improve psychological flexibility and fatigue-related interference and reduce fatigue, 
psychological distress, and fear of cancer recurrence, while improving overall quality of life 
(QOL). Collaborating across three academic cancer centers, our Specific Aims are to: 
Aim 1: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of REVITALIZE in women with 
advanced ovarian cancer who experience PARPi-related fatigue. After pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_503605] a sample of up to [ADDRESS_648338] intervention vs. enhanced usual 
care (educational materials). Feasibility will be defined as ≥50% approach-to-enrollment rate 
of eligible participants and ≥70% completion of 3-month outcome assessments. Acceptability 
will be defined ≤20% withdrawing from the study overall, and ≤20% of participants on the 
intervention arm reporting high study burden.
Aim 2: To explore the effects of REVITALIZE on fatigue, emotional distress, fear of 
cancer recurrence, quality of life, and adherence in up to [ADDRESS_648339] that REVITALIZE will improve psychological flexibility 
and
fatigue-related interference reducing fatigue (primary outcome), psychological distress, and 
fear of cancer recurrence, while improving overall QOL (secondary outcomes), compared to 
enhanced usual care.

Inhibitor-Related Fatigue 
Page 5 of 35than chemotherapy, many women cannot tolerate PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503607].[1] In 
clinical trials of PARPi, 18% of patients experienced moderate fatigue, and nearly 10% had 
severe to disabling fatigue.[5] Yet, the prevalence of PARPi-related fatigue is likely higher than 
documented because clinical trials rely upon clinician-reported symptoms, single-item 
measures to assess fatigue, or exclude grade 1 levels of fatigue in QOL analyses.[6, 7] 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_503608], many patients cannot tolerate treatment due to 
fatigue, which may impact adherence, treatment discontinuation, and ultimately progression-
free survival.
Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common and distressing symptoms reported by 
[CONTACT_503653][8]. Fatigue compromises QOL, resulting in substantial physical, 
psychosocial, and economic losses for both patients and caregivers.[9] The National Cancer 
Institute has designated cancer-related fatigue a high-priority research area,[10] and national 
guidelines recommend routine screening for cancer-related fatigue and treatment with 
psychological or exercise interventions.[11] In prior work, we have demonstrated that more 
than 40% of women with ovarian and endometrial cancer in remission have clinically-
significant fatigue one year after diagnosis.[12] In another study, we demonstrated that 25% of 
patients on oral chemotherapy have moderate-severe fatigue,[13] and these patients 
experience more anxiety and depressive symptoms, compared with patients without fatigue, as 
well as decreased physical functioning. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not 
specifically examined the prevalence of cancer-related fatigue in women with ovarian cancer 
on PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503609], or tested interventions to reduce fatigue in this population.
Our qualitative research in women with advanced ovarian cancer demonstrates that 
PARPi-related fatigue is associated with significant symptom-related suffering and functional 
interference. Recently, we conducted 21 in-depth interviews with fatigued patients with 
advanced ovarian cancer on PARPi (18-315, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_246248]). While patients described their 
symptoms as milder than intravenous chemotherapy, they noted that fatigue insidiously limited 
their daily activities, interfering with their desire to participate in social events, physical activity, 
and work. One patient retired because she could not balance the PARPi- associated fatigue 
with her employment. Others reported the need for dose-reductions, treatment holidays, or 
changes in PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503610]. Although most patients wanted to continue on PARPi, 
many reported difficulty copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], which evoked psychological distress and fears of cancer 
recurrence. All participants endorsed the importance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_503611]-specific 
intervention and indicated a preference for telehealth over clinic-based delivery. Interventions 
that reduce PARPi-related fatigue may increase treatment tolerability, enabling more patients 
to remain on treatment.
CBT vs. ACT for treating cancer-related fatigue 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective, yet under-utilized, treatment for 
cancer- and treatment-related fatigue. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends 
CBT to address fatigue in cancer survivors.[11] Research has shown that CBT is effective in

IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06/14/2022
REVITALIZE: A Telehealth Intervention for Women with Advanced Ovarian Cancer and PARP 
Inhibitor-Related Fatigue 
Page 6 of 35reducing fatigue in patients with advanced cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.[14-16] In 
a multi-center study, Poort (MPI) demonstrated that CBT significantly reduced fatigue and 
improved QOL, compared with usual care, with effects sustained for 3-months post-
intervention.[17] However, only 5% of the participants had ovarian cancer; thus, it is unclear 
whether CBT is efficacious in this population. Moreover, 76/210 (36%) of eligible patients 
declined study participation because the required clinic visits were too burdensome. 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is another promising approach for treating 
fatigue, specifically in patients with ovarian cancer. ACT promotes actively facing and 
accepting distress and choosing life directions that reflect one’s values, enabling patients to 
address multiple concomitant problems simultaneously (e.g. fatigue, depression, anxiety, and 
pain).[18] While CBT typi[INVESTIGATOR_503612] (e.g. fatigue), ACT targets 
the functional underpi[INVESTIGATOR_503613]. ACT helps individuals to clarify who and what are most important to them (their 
values) to increase their ability to align their daily behavior with their values even in the 
presence of distressing thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations (e.g., fatigue, pain).[19] 
Instead of struggling to avoid fatigue (and the distressing thoughts and feelings that it evokes), 
ACT focuses on helpi[INVESTIGATOR_503614], an empowering stance that prevents fatigue from 
becoming a barrier to moving towards the people and activities that are most important to 
them, such as spending time with loved ones (e.g., values-aligned behavior).[19] 
Acceptance-based interventions such as ACT provide a strongly matched approach to 
patients with advanced cancer, who even under ideal care, will experience some degree of 
symptoms or side effects. In support, the one published randomized trial of ACT versus CBT 
for patients with late-stage ovarian cancer found that ACT led to superior outcomes, including 
for quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and acceptance, by [CONTACT_503654].[20] This study was small, did not target fatigue, and required [ADDRESS_648341] for the targeted population. Given the range of difficulties and high symptom burdens 
associated with advanced ovarian cancer,[12, 21, 22] novel approaches that leverage shared 
intervention principles to address multiple behavioral issues in a single intervention—including 
fatigue, distress, and fear of cancer recurrence—are urgently needed.
Few ACT-based intervention studies have investigated the changes in fatigue. [CONTACT_503674] (co-
PI) conducted a group-based ACT intervention for anxious cancer survivors and found 
significant improvements in cancer-specific distress and fatigue, as well as fear of cancer 
recurrence in a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].[23] She next conducted a randomized controlled trial of 
this ACT intervention versus enhanced usual care (EUC) for anxious cancer survivors. The 
final analyses, which are in preparation for publication, demonstrate that ACT led to superior 
reductions on all three of these outcomes (fatigue, cancer-specific distress, and fear of cancer 
recurrence) relative to EUC, through 6-month follow-up (the longest time point studied).[24] 
Further, compared to EUC, the ACT intervention led to fewer missed medical appointments. A

Page [ADDRESS_648342] into a briefer format that alternated group and online 
sessions, and specifically targeted anxiety, depression, and advanced care planning 
engagement among anxious and depressed patients with stage IV cancer (mixed solid tumor 
types).[25] Though fatigue was not a targeted outcome, this briefer ACT intervention for 
patients with metastatic cancers showed promising pi[INVESTIGATOR_61620], including feasibility and 
acceptability, and significantly reduced anxiety, depression, and fear of dying, along with 
significantly increased rates of advanced care planning. This study also demonstrates [CONTACT_503675]’s ability to adapt ACT into scalable formats that meet the needs of patients with 
metastatic cancers. This study will build upon our earlier work to test a novel ACT intervention 
for women with advanced ovarian cancer who experience moderate-severe PARPi-related 
fatigue.
3.[ADDRESS_648343] intervention represents an 
innovative and systematic attempt to address PARPi-related fatigue. Additionally, this 
study harnesses telehealth as a scalable strategy to improve symptom management 
and QOL. The intervention will use a HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform for 
intervention delivery (Zoom for Healthcare), enabling us to draw patients from broader 
geographic areas, including rural areas. Results from this research will inform the 
design and conduct of a multicenter RCT to test the effectiveness of REVITALIZE 
among patients with advanced ovarian cancer on PARPi. If successful, REVITALIZE will 
provide a scalable, patient-centered approach to improve symptom management and 
QOL for patients with advanced ovarian cancer on PARPI.

Zoom). Participants who are recruited remotely will be provided with a recruitment letter 
outlining additional details about the study, such as the procedures and time commitment 
involved (Appendix A). If the oncology provider deems the patient ineligible or too distressed to 
participate in a research study at this time, the patient will not be approached for inclusion. If 
the patient is approved to approach for enrollment, the study staff will coordinate with the 
oncology provider to meet with the patient to discuss the study at the time of their next clinic 
visit or at a time that is convenient for the patient. During this visit (in-person or remote), 
patients will be screened for the presence of moderate-severe fatigue in the past week 
(average score ≥4 on a Fatigue Symptom Inventory scale of 0-10). We will only actively screen 
eligible patients once. If a patient is deemed ineligible due to a lack of fatigue, but the patient 
or oncologist indicates that they have more fatigue later during PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503617], 
we will re-approach the patient. Additionally, if the study team approaches a patient and they 
want to participate, but mention that now is not a good time, we will confirm with this patient if it 
is okay for the study team to re-approach them at another time. If they agree to be re-
approached, we will note this in a secure password-protected screening and enrollment log, 
and re-approach the patient at another date.
PHI will not be shared with anyone outside of the study team and patients’ oncology 
providers. A partial HIPAA waiver requesting permission to review the PHI of these select 
patients prior to consent during screening and recruitment has been submitted to justify this 
process.

If a patient is interested in participating, the staff member will obtain their informed verbal  
consent, which will include explaining why this research is being conducted, information about 
study procedures, the risks and benefits of participation, and how long the patient will be 
involved in this research study. The staff member will reiterate that the data collected are not a 
part of the patient’s standard of care treatment and will underscore the importance placed 
upon maintaining patient confidentiality and a patient’s rights while they are involved in the 
study. This includes the right to withdraw participation at any time for any reason during the 
study because participation is completely voluntary. All participants will be given a copy of the

10.0 Procedures Involved
10.1 Design/Study Type  
First, we will test and refine the REVITALIZE intervention in a sample of up to [ADDRESS_648356] intervention (REVITALIZE). We will then enroll up to 50 patients (to 
ensure 40 evaluable patients) with advanced ovarian cancer who report fatigue associated 
with PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503622] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_503623], acceptability, and preliminary 
efficacy of REVITALIZE vs. enhanced usual care (EUC). See Sections 10.31 and 10.34 for 
more information about each study arm.
We will recruit cohorts of patients at each site and randomize half of the sample to 
REVITALIZE and half to EUC. Participants randomized to REVITALIZE will receive 6 weekly 
sessions lasting approximately 60-75 minutes over a 6-8 week period, delivered face-to-face 
using iPads, computers or tablets, and a HIPAA-compliant platform (Zoom for Healthcare). If 
participants have difficulty connecting to the platform, telephone sessions are permitted. 
Participants randomized to EUC will receive educational materials developed by [CONTACT_337579] (NCCN) about fatigue and exercise during cancer treatment. 
Based upon participant and interventionist feedback from the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will allow 
participants up to 8 weeks from the start of the intervention for completion of the 6-week 
intervention and 60-75 minutes per session. During the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 2/4 participants needed to 
reschedule 1 session, which made it challenging to deliver the intervention in 6 weeks. 
Similarly, 2/4 participants required more than 60 minutes per session, as each session ends 
with an experiential exercise and participants had varying responses to this (several 
experienced insights during this moment and wanted to debrief with the interventionist 
afterwards). To minimize study burden, if a session is running >[ADDRESS_648357] added one “booster session,” which will take place [ADDRESS_648358] support. Finally, it will also help hold study 
participants accountable for maintaining behavior change after intervention completion, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_503624]. 
During the pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we also recognized that we did not assess process measures (i.e. 
patient catastrophizing, fatigue self-efficacy, psychological flexibility, experiential avoidance,

assessment at [ADDRESS_648359]-intervention start to enable us to explore whether these process 
measures change during the intervention. Additionally, to assess participant’s satisfaction with 
each session we will ask the interventionists to perform a brief assessment of the “Session 
Rating Scale” after each session.  
After all patients have completed the intervention, we will conduct a preliminary analysis to 
assess our aims of feasibility and acceptability. Feasibility will be defined as ≥50% approach-
to-enrollment rate among eligible participants and ≥70% completion of 3-month outcome 
assessments. Acceptability will be defined ≤20% withdrawing from the study overall, and ≤20% 
of participants on the intervention arm reporting high study burden.
We will also examine the effects of REVITALIZE on fatigue (primary outcome); 
psychological distress, fear of cancer recurrence, and overall QOL (secondary outcomes); and 
adherence and process outcomes, including additional measures of acceptability at study-
completion (exploratory outcomes). 
Our final analyses will provide preliminary estimates of the feasibility, acceptability, scale 
scores, missing data, and participant feedback.  
10.2 Selection of Instruments 
The following validated measures will be used in the study surveys at baseline (Participant 
Baseline Interview, Appendix D), 4-, 8- and 12-weeks post-intervention start (Participant Post-
Baseline Interview Appendix E) to assess primary outcomes (fatigue), secondary outcomes 
(emotional distress, fear of cancer recurrence, quality of life), exploratory outcomes 
(adherence), and process outcomes (catastrophizing, fatigue self-efficacy, psychological 
flexibility, experiential avoidance, values, and therapeutic process). 
All participants will be compensated for their time and effort by [CONTACT_26777] a $[ADDRESS_648360] for 
completing each survey plus a $5 bonus for completing their survey within 48 hours of our 
sending or administering it—up to $25/survey, $100 for all four. 
10.21a Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) 
The Fatigue Symptom Inventory is a tool designed to assess the severity, frequency and 
daily pattern of fatigue, as well as its perceived interference with daily functioning.[26, 27] It is 
a 14-item, 11-point rating scale developed to assess subjective fatigue. Severity is measured 
on 11-point scales that assess most, least, and average fatigue in the past week as well as 
current fatigue. Higher scores indicate greater levels of fatigue. Frequency is measured as the 
number of days in the past week (0-7) that patients felt fatigued as well as the extent of each 
day on average they felt fatigued. Perceived interference is measured on separate 11-point 
scales from 0 (no interference) to 10 (extreme interference) that assess the degree to which 
fatigue in the past week was judged to interfere with general levels of activity, ability to bathe 
and dress, normal work activity, ability to concentrate, relations with others, enjoyment of life,

score. 
10.21b General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)
    The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) is a reliable and validated self-
report measure to assess anxiety symptoms. Respondents rate how often they have 
been bothered by [ADDRESS_648361] two weeks using the following 
scale: 0 = Not at all; 1 = Several Days; 2 = Over half the days; and 3 = Nearly every 
day. Respondents also answer a question to assess the duration of their anxiety 
symptoms. Responses are tallied, and the total score indicates the presence and 
severity of GAD.[28] The measure has been validated in the general population[29] and 
is the recommended evaluative measure for anxiety in adult patients with cancer in the 
2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Guideline Adaptation.[30]
10.21c Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8)
The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 is a validated self-report measure that assesses eight 
depressive symptoms (excluding self-harm) using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.[31] It is used to 
screen, diagnose, and monitor depressive symptoms[32] and has demonstrated validity in 
cancer patients.[33, 34] Respondents report if each symptom has bothered them “not at all”, 
“several days,” “more than half the days,” or “nearly every day” during the previous two weeks 
to measure their mental and emotional health.[35] 
10.21d Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI) 
To measure fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) we will use the 42-item Fear of Cancer 
Recurrence Inventory (FCRI). This survey has been validated across diverse cancer 
populations, has strong psychometric qualities, and is the most comprehensive multi-
dimensional scale of FCR available.[36, 37] Items are scored on a Likert scale ranging from 0 
(“not at all” or “never”) to 4 (“a great deal or “all the time”). Higher scores indicate higher FCR. 
The FCRI is both internally consistent (Cronbach’s α=0.75 to 0.91 across subscales) and 
stable over a two-week interval (ρ = 0.58 to 0.83 across subscales). It also has convergent 
validity with other standardized measures of FCR (ρ = 0.66 to 0.77) and discriminant validity 
with QOL amongst a large sample (n = 600) of Canadian cancer patients with varying tumor 
types.[36] 
10.21e Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer (FACT-O) 
Participants’ quality of life (QOL) will be assessed with the Functional Assessment of 
Cancer Therapy-Ovarian Cancer, which has demonstrated internal consistency, reliability, and

Page 17 of 35validity.[38] This measure is composed of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-
General scale, with an ovarian cancer-specific subscale (OCS) included. The measure is 
divided into five primary QOL domains: physical well-being (7-items), social/family well-being 
(7-items), emotional well-being (6-items), functional well-being (7-items), and additional 
concerns (OCS subscale, 12-items).[38] Participants will rate each symptom over the past 7 
days as: 0) Not at all; 1) A little bit; 2) Somewhat, 3) Quite a bit, and 4) Very much. Subscales 
can be analyzed separately or aggregated to produce a total score. 
10.21f Medication Adherence Measure (Voils Measure)
We will use a validated self-report measure to assess dual conceptualizations of 
patient medication nonadherence—the extent of patient nonadherence and reasons for 
nonadherence.[39] Comparison measures include medication self-efficacy, beliefs 
about medications, impression management, conscientiousness, habit strength, and an 
existing nonadherence measure. The extent of nonadherence is measured with three 
positively correlated items, and reasons for nonadherence are assessed using several 
independent items.[39] Unlike extent of nonadherence, reason items are treated 
individually and descriptively, while extent items are averaged into an overall score. The 
three extent items can be used to help identify nonadherent patients and reason items 
can be used to identify and tailor intervention targets. 
10.21g Fatigue Catastrophizing Survey (FCS)
      We will assess participant catastrophizing using the Fatigue Catastrophizing Survey 
(FCS). Catastrophizing is a psychological process that can negatively contribute to the 
intensity of symptoms patients may be experiencing and increase a patient’s level of 
distress, thus impacting their quality of life.[40] Modified from the Catastrophizing Scale 
of the Cognitive Copi[INVESTIGATOR_503625] (CCSI), this survey measures [ADDRESS_648362] patients’ tendencies to engage in overly negative thoughts (i.e. 
“I worry all the time” or “I feel I can’t go on”). Patients rate each question on a 5-point 
scale (1=never true to 5=all of the time) to indicate how often each item is true for them 
when they’ve experienced fatigue. In prior research, more catastrophizing (as indicated 
by [CONTACT_503659]) were associated with more severe fatigue in women with 
breast cancer.[41]
10.21h Fatigue Self-Efficacy
     Self-efficacy concerning fatigue (i.e. the belief in one’s capabilities to execute 
behaviors) will be measured with the 7-item Self-Efficacy Scale (SES28).[42] Items are 
scored on a 4-point Likert scale, and total scores range from 4 to 28. Higher scores 
indicate a greater sense of control over fatigue.

Page 18 of 3510.21i  Acceptance and Action Cancer Questionnaire (AAQ-cancer) 
     We will measure changes in psychological flexibility (ACT processes) using a 15-
item measure adapted from the widely validated AAQ-II and diabetes-adapted AAQ 
towards cancer specific items.[23] Numerous adaptations of the AAQ towards specific 
clinical targets have been shown to produce valid measures that mediate ACT 
outcomes for the specific population.[23] 
10.21j Brief Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ)  
      The Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire is a 62-item measure 
developed to assess six domains of experiential avoidance (EA).[43] These domains are 
behavioral avoidance, distress aversion, procrastination, distraction and suppression, 
repression and denial, and distress endurance. For this study, we will use the abbreviated 
version of this measure, the Brief Multidimensional Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire 
(BEAQ) which only includes 15-items and covers all dimensions of experiential avoidance. 
This measure is internally consistent and has been broadly associated with 
psychopathology and quality of life.[44]  
10.21k Valuing Questionnaire (VQ) 
A primary objective of ACT is to facilitate valued living. We will use the 10-item 
Valuing Questionnaire (VQ) to assess personal values enactment during the past two 
weeks.[45] Respondents rate on a 6 point scale (0 “not at all true” to 6 “completely true”) 
how often each item was true for them during the past two weeks and evaluate using a 
two-factor scale; the Progress scale and Obstruction scale.[45] High VQ Progress 
scores are associated with positive affect, satisfaction with life, purpose in life and 
mastery and self-acceptance, while high VQ Obstruction scores are associated with 
depressive symptoms and negative affect. 
10.21l Session Rating Scale 
After each REVITALIZE study session, interventionists will use the Session 
Rating Scale (SRS) to assess participant’s satisfaction with each session. The SRS is a 
brief 4-item measure developed by [INVESTIGATOR_140362], Duncan & Johnson (2002) that enables 
participants to rate each REVITALIZE study session based upon their therapeutic 
alliance with the interventionist, approach or method, goals and topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], and an overall 
rating. The SRS will be administered orally at the end of each session and a total score 
will be calculated based on responses. Total scores will be recorded in a graph for each 
session and scores < 35 will prompt a discussion with the patient about how to better 
meet their needs during the REVITALIZE intervention sessions. (See Appendix I).

Page 19 of 35Basic demographic information will be collected for all participants including: age, marital 
status, race/ethnicity, education, household structure, income, and employment. The questions 
will only take a few minutes to complete. In addition, clinical information will be collected from 
patient’s medical records including: stage, treatments (number of and specific treatments 
used), time since diagnosis of advanced ovarian cancer, ECOG performance status, genetic 
testing results, and the starting dose and date of PARPi [CONTACT_3148]. We will also obtain the 
dates of prior dose delays and/or reductions and reasons for each.
10.21n Patient Interviews 
We will also conduct qualitative interviews with patients in the intervention arm to further 
understand the challenges and facilitators of each intervention component. We will interview 
up to [ADDRESS_648363]. An 
interview guide is provided in Appendix F; in accordance with qualitative interviewing 
procedures, additional themes and topi[INVESTIGATOR_503626], in addition to the list of questions in the interview 
guide. 
Interviews will be recorded to ensure that the interviewer adequately captures all feedback 
from patients. The consent forms for the study include information that the debriefing interview 
will be recorded, and we will also verbally request permission from patients to record the 
interview before starting the interview. We will not administer a qualitative interview to any 
person who does not consent to being recorded during the debriefing interview. All recordings 
of study sessions will be stored in secure, restricted-access locations. Recordings will be tied 
to a study ID number, and the only documents linking the patient’s study ID to identifiable 
information are in a restricted-access file stored securely on restricted-access folders. 
Recordings of interviews will be transcribed for analysis using a DFCI-approved, HIPAA-
compliant transcription vendor or locally at Dana-Farber. All patient identifiable information will 
be removed when the recordings are transcribed. Recordings of debriefing interviews will be 
destroyed when analyses are complete. 
10.21o Pandemic Stress Index 
To understand the impact of the novel coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic on 
study participants, we will administer the Pandemic Stress Index. Developed by

used to assess behavior changes and stress that individuals may have experienced or 
are experiencing during the COVID-[ADDRESS_648364] item “What are you doing/did

Page 20 of 35you do during COVID-19 (coronavirus)?” assesses behavior changes in response to 
COVID-19. This includes changes that may have taken place in response to public 
health messaging (e.g., physical distancing, isolation, quarantine), changes in the 
workplace (e.g., working remotely, job loss), and changes to protect one’s own or 
others’ health (e.g. caretaking). The second item asks individuals to rate the overall 
degree to which COVID-19 has impacted their daily life, “How much is/did COVID-19 
(coronavirus) impact your day-to-day life?” rated on a 5-point scale. Finally, participants 
are asked to report the psychosocial impact of COVID-19, “Which of the following are 
you experiencing (or did you experience) during COVID-19 (coronavirus)?” with a 
checklist of items pertaining to emotional distress, substance use, sexual behavior, 
financial stress, stigma, and support.[46, 47]
10.21p Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)
A primary objective of our study is to evaluate acceptability, which will be defined 
as ≤20% withdrawing from the study overall, and ≤20% of participants on the 
intervention arm reporting high study burden. To more fully understand patients’ 
experiences on the REVITALIZE arm, we will also use the 3-item Acceptability of 
Intervention Measure (AIM) to assess acceptability.[48] Items are measured on a 5-
point Likert scale. Total scores range from [ADDRESS_648365] portion of the study. Eligible participants will be 
randomized to one of two study arms: 
1) Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Arm (REVITALIZE) 
2) Enhanced Usual Care (Educational Materials) 
See the protocol schema (Section 1.0) for more details. 
10.31 Intervention Arm (REVITALIZE)

context, cognitive defusion, acceptance, values, and committed action. The intervention will 
also emphasize developi[INVESTIGATOR_503627]. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive six 60–75-minute weekly 
sessions over a 6-8 week period delivered face-to-face using iPads or personal 
computers/tablets and a HIPAA-compliant platform (Zoom for Healthcare) or telephone (per 
patient preference). 
We will provide psychoeducation about PARPi-related fatigue, including information on 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_503628]. During the six intervention sessions, we will work to 
identify the negative impacts associated with the struggle to control unwanted thoughts, 
feelings, and physical symptoms or side effects linked with advanced ovarian cancer and 
PARPi [CONTACT_3148]. Patients will learn about the importance of balancing acceptance and 
behavior change strategies. We will use values-clarification exercises to formulate goals in 
behavioral terms, such as resuming activities or leisure interests. In addition, mindfulness and 
acceptance strategies will be used to foster psychological flexibility when faced with cancer-
related barriers. Finally, cognitive defusion techniques will be taught to reduce the behavioral 
impact of negative thoughts and feelings associated with advanced cancer and PARPi-related 
fatigue. Patients will gradually work toward realizing their treatment goals that they formulated 
earlier. Although each participant will learn the same skills, session content and home practice 
will be tailored to individual patients’ cancer-and fatigue-related experiences and other 
challenges. Patients will be provided with study workbooks (Appendix K) and will review many 
of these concepts with the interventionists during sessions, aided by [CONTACT_503662] (Appendix J). If 
the patient requests, we will allow for sharing of the audio recordings from the sessions to aid 
in review of core concepts. However, sharing of the audio recording from each session is not 
required.
Table 1 below provides a more detailed session-by-session overview:
Based on patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503629]-in phase (4 patients, 4 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) 
and from the empi[INVESTIGATOR_503630], we have built in greater flexibility into each session, 
allowing, for example, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503631], rather than having to use all three with all patients, or allowing them to 
spend more versus less time debriefing on patient’s behavioral goals, depending on a given 
patient’s goals and her difficulty in reaching them. 
Session [ADDRESS_648367] session, we will focus on building rapport and taking a brief 
(cancer-related) history. We will provide basic psychoeducation on cancer-
related fatigue and link this to triggers for fatigue (i.e. reinforcing the 
knowledge that PARP inhibitors are considered ongoing cancer treatment)

Page 22 of 35as well as psychosocial factors that may add to this fatigue.  We will elicit 
participants’ fears and worries about their cancer and cancer treatment 
which may contribute to their fatigue. Participants who identify sleep 
disturbance as a barrier will be asked to complete a sleep diary as part of 
their home practice. 
Session [ADDRESS_648368] will debrief and 
evaluate the previous session, as well as any barriers or thoughts that they 
observed in between sessions. We will introduce the Acceptance and 
Commitment Therapy (ACT) model to patients using the “Choice Point 
2.0”. In this educational exercise patients will learn about Towards and 
Away Moves, who and what are most important (values), and what gets in 
the way of accomplishing values-based behavior (barriers). Participants 
will be asked to complete a Choice Point on cancer-related fatigue and 
think about things that get in the way of working towards ones’ values. This 
session will also focus on formulating values-based behavioral goals to 
explore what patients would be doing if they were no longer moderate-
severely fatigued. Participants will be asked to set a Fatigue Action Goal, a 
small and doable behavioral activation goal (in the domains of sleep, 
activity or social support) for the next week that will be a part of each 
week’s session.
Session 3 --- 
Challenging Feelings 
and What We Can and 
Can’t ControlAfter a brief acceptance-based meditation, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503632], as well as any barriers or thoughts that they 
observed in between sessions. What are barriers to going towards values-
based behavior, and what thoughts keep “hooking” patients? We will then 
select a metaphor/exercise or two (from a list, with an ability to tailor to a 
given patient) to help patients experience the “Illusion of Emotional and 
Cognitive Control”. We will link these exercises to thoughts and emotions 
participants have in relation to cancer and fatigue and present alternative 
strategies. We will focus on recognizing that the struggle against difficult 
thoughts and feelings around the fatigue and the cancer itself, not the 
thoughts or feelings themselves, is the problem. We will use the “Struggle 
Switch”, “Finger Trap”, or related metaphors to illustrate that we cannot 
control how we feel but we can control the extent to which we struggle. 
Depending on time, we will end the session with or assign for home 
practice a meditation exercise about noticing and accepting thoughts and 
feelings. Participants will be asked to notice internal barriers (responses to 
thoughts, feelings, sensations) that get in the way of values-based 
behavior in their everyday lives between sessions. 
Session [ADDRESS_648369] will debrief and 
evaluate the previous session, as well as any barriers or thoughts that they 
observed in between sessions. The main topic for this session is Defusion. 
We will focus on what’s hooking them, what’s getting in the way, how is 
your mind talking you out of this, what’s stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503633]. Importantly, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503634]/beliefs related to fatigue and cancer, which 
facilitates both acceptance and defusion. The goal is for participants to 
become more willing to have their thoughts without being unduly 
influenced by [CONTACT_476], and reduce the energy they put into getting rid of 
them. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503635], 
identify the relationship between fusion and behavior (away moves), and 
offer the possibility of learning a new approach as an alternative to fusion. 
We will use a metaphor (such as “The Hands as Thoughts and Feelings

Page 23 of 35Metaphor” or Changing Radio Stations”) to help the patient experience 
fusion and defusion. The basic idea of this and other defusion skills is that 
they create more distance between the participant and their thoughts and 
help them recognize that they aren’t necessarily a part of who they are. We 
will explain that there are several helpful defusion skills that illustrate how 
to accept your thoughts while not identifying them or taking them too 
seriously. We will present participants with a handout of [ADDRESS_648370] will debrief and 
evaluate the previous session, as well as any barriers or thoughts that they 
observed in between sessions. This session will include a more in-depth 
discussion and exploration of participants’ values and goals. Values are 
chosen life directions; what you want to stand for; desired personal 
qualities. Values are like an “inner compass”: they give us guidance, help 
us find a direction, stay on track, and help us find our way again when we 
go off track. We will help the patients distinguish values from goals and as 
needed help them connect with and clarify their values so they can use 
them to guide ongoing behavior. We will then move into committed action, 
translating values into ongoing, evolving, effective, dynamic patterns of 
overt and covert behavior (towards moves). We will focus on three skills: 
problem solving, goal setting, and action planning. We will use the 
“Challenge Formula” to help participants see they have choices, despi[INVESTIGATOR_503636]. We all have limited time on this planet and 
cancer peels away the pretense that we are going to live forever, it peels 
away the curtain that keeps us away from our own vulnerability. It is very 
painful and associated with losses AND it’s also an opportunity to re-
evaluate who and what are most important to patients and to direct their 
energy towards that. We will then segue to committed action, on living by 
[CONTACT_503663]-congruent goals. For 
some participants, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_503637]-congruent goals will be enough to get them moving, and they 
may have done this work already. For others, there may be some barriers 
and we’ll look at what these are and how to overcome them. We will also 
assess the goals in terms of whether they are: a live person’s goals, it is a 
realistic goal, what the payoffs are, and what plan B is. Particularly around 
fatigue, what if they have limited energy, what if they get really sick? 
Participants will be invited to engage in formal SMART goal setting and 
action planning in between this session and the last one. 
Session [ADDRESS_648371] strongly for the individual participant. We will create a plan even if 
fatigue worsens and will review and draw upon the home practice that they 
engaged in between session 5 and 6.

Interventionists will be master’s level clinical psychology trainees. Prior to intervention 
delivery, interventionists will participate in a 3-day training provided by [CONTACT_503665][INVESTIGATOR_503638]-related fatigue and ACT (Drs. Poort and Arch, respectively), as well as 
ovarian cancer (provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wright). The training will provide the background and rationale 
for each of the intervention sessions and will involve active, evidence-based training methods, 
including role-playing with expert and peer feedback to practice intervention components. In 
addition, weekly supervision will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Arch throughout the study. Drs. Arch and 
Poort will also provide additional ongoing weekly remote supervision to the interventionists with 
help from [CONTACT_150547].  We will monitor study and intervention fidelity by [CONTACT_503666] a random sample of recorded sessions (~10%) for 
content and quality. The DFCI study team will also have bi-weekly check-ins with the study 
teams at UC Boulder and UPenn to provide additional study oversight.

Exploratory Endpoints 
1) Assess patient-reported adherence to PARP inhibitors (Voils Measure).
2) Explore whether process outcomes (i.e. catastrophizing, fatigue self-
efficacy, psychological flexibility, experiential avoidance, values) change 
from baseline to 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks.
3) Explore the trajectory of change in process and outcome measures from 
baseline to 4-, 8-, and 12-weeks to determine at what point in treatment 
changes start occurring.

evaluable participants; b) recruit cohorts of the size needed for a future fully powered trial, to 
assess feasibility of recruitment and randomization; c) to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test the intervention with multiple 
patients per site, allowing us to examine feasibility and acceptability within each site to 
establish a foundation for a future multi-site trial; d) obtain estimates of means and variance for 
each condition (the use of n=[ADDRESS_648377] size estimates); 
d) assess usual/non-study care in both conditions, to examine the potential for use to be higher 
in EUC than the REVITALIZE arm. We will not include data from the 5 participants enrolled 
onto the run-in phase since this group of patients will not undergo randomization. 
11.3 Data Analysis Plan 
11.3a Feasibility/Acceptability
Feasibility will be defined as ≥50% approach-to-enrollment rate of eligible 
participants and ≥70% completion of 3-month outcome assessments. Acceptability will 
be defined ≤20% withdrawing from the study overall, and ≤20% of participants on the 
intervention arm reporting high study burden. Descriptive statistics will be used to 
summarize participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics and to evaluate 
whether the trial has met its stated feasibility and acceptability endpoints for the portion 
consented, acceptability, and assessments completed. We will use basic inferential 
statistics (χ2 for categorical, t-tests or ANOVAs for dimensional DVs) to assess for the 
presence of systematic difference in feasibility between conditions. This will include a)

11.3b Primary/Secondary Outcomes
Guided by [CONTACT_503669]’ recommendations for the conduct of pi[INVESTIGATOR_503643], we did not power this small pi[INVESTIGATOR_503644] a fully-powered future RCT. Thus, we will evaluate means, 
standard deviations, and data clustering at each time point by [CONTACT_3004]. We will 
evaluate the clustering by [CONTACT_503670]. Additionally, we will examine the degree of usual/non-study supportive care 
use using descriptive statistics and will test association with condition. To examine 
trajectories of change over time by [CONTACT_3004], we will use mixed effects repeated 
measures analyses that account for nested data. We will examine cohort and site as 
sources of variability and consider them as fixed or random effects as appropriate. 
11.3c Qualitative Analysis
Qualitative interviews provide a critical lens to understand participants’ 
experiences and perceptions. Thus, the analytic approach will be oriented toward 
framework analysis, a multi-stage coding process that includes both a priori defined and 
emergent codes. Through comprehensive indexing, charting, and mappi[INVESTIGATOR_503645].

12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
No adverse events are expected in this minimal risk study; however, some participants may 
be distressed when answering questions about their fatigue and other symptoms. Study staff 
will monitor for adverse events during ACT intervention sessions or when they are interviewing 
participant, and either the participant or the interventionist can decide to end the interview, if 
needed. Should participants become exceedingly upset, disoriented or fatigued or need to 
attend to matters of personal care during the interviews or study visits, study staff will ask the 
subject if they would like to take a break or reschedule the survey for another time.

If a participant has disease progression while on study, the participant may choose to

If a participant discontinues PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503646] (e.g. renal failure, severe cytopenias, cardiac arrhythmia), the participant may 
choose to continue the intervention, but will be deemed non-evaluable.
Regardless of evaluable status, we will give all participants on both arms the opportunity to

16.1Qualifications of Study Staff 
Alexi A. Wright, MD, MPH (along with her collaborators Hanneke Poort, PhD and Joanna 
Arch, PhD) is well poised to execute the proposed research focusing on fatigued advanced 
ovarian cancer patients on PARP inhibitors because of her training, expertise, and experiences 
as a clinician-researcher focused in this area of study. As a member of the Gynecologic 
Oncology Program at the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_503647]-Farber, she has access to 
patients on PARPi [INVESTIGATOR_503648]- associated 
symptoms. Within the group there are [ADDRESS_648382], including 
statistical, research, and nursing support in addition to grants support and the support of the 
collaborating institutions participating in this work (DFCI, UPenn, and University of Colorado).  
Hanneke Poort, PhD is a psychologist specializing in psychosocial oncology and palliative 
care. She successfully conducted several studies on cancer-related fatigue, including a similar 
adaptation study of CBT for patients on tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia, 
and a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of CBT for fatigue in advanced cancer. In 
addition, she is involved in an active protocol (17-680, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_503649]) that studies the incidence, 
course, and predictors of fatigue developi[INVESTIGATOR_503650]+

Page [ADDRESS_648383]. Arch has led/leads four grant-funded studies of ACT interventions for cancer 
survivors with local cancer care centers. [CONTACT_503674], an early stage investigator, has strong 
institutional support from the University of Colorado and her department. First, [CONTACT_503674] has a 
tenure-track appointment that reserves 40% of the academic year and 100% of the summer 
months for research. Second, [CONTACT_503674] was given generous startup and retention funds of 
which sufficient funds remain to cover unexpected expenses on the proposed project. Third, as 
described above, [CONTACT_503674] has ample designated space in which to conduct research, 
including ample space for the proposed project. Fourth, [CONTACT_503674]’s department and the 
university voted unanimously to grant her tenure and to promote her to Associate Professor, 
reflecting strong positive feedback and support. Drs. Arch and Wright have been working 
together since [ADDRESS_648384] patients for an informed consent. Subjects will be given the 
opportunity to ask questions during the informed consent process, as well as during study 
participation. The informed consent includes information about the minimal risk of being 
uncomfortable with certain interview questions regarding patients’ lived experiences with 
advanced cancer. Only study staff that completed training can access Epic. Study staff may 
conduct a limited review of a patient’s medical record in order to schedule the interview and 
extract demographic and clinical data for research purposes.
18.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury
This study involves minimal risk to subjects. Therefore, no compensation is available to 
subjects in the event of research-related injury. This is explained clearly in the informed 
consent.
19.0 Economic Burden to Subjects
There are no costs associated with study participation. Participants will be compensated for 
their time and effort by [CONTACT_26777] a $[ADDRESS_648385] for completing each survey plus a $5 bonus for 
completing it within 48 hours of our sending or administering it—up to $25/survey or $100 for

Title:  An Open Label Phase 1 Study to Compare the Safety and Tolerablity  of the 
 Column at Different  Blood- Flow Rates in Patients with End -Stage 
Renal Disease Undergoing Hemodialysis  
Objective:  The objective of this study is to e valuate the safety and tolerability of the 
 column at blood- flow rates greater than 250 mL/min in subjects with 
end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) undergoing hemodialysis ( HD). The study will 
assess the safety, tolerability, and impact on HD parameters when the  
column is used at a blood -flow of up to 450 mL/min . 
Précis:  This is an open -label study in [ADDRESS_618251] on HD. The purpose of the study is to compare the safety and 
tolerability of two blood- flow rates  when the b2M  column is used  
during HD. The  column was originally  developed for blood- flow 
rates of 250 mL/min, and in this study it will be evaluated  at both 250 mL/min 
and up to 450 mL/min.  
After screening (Visit 1), subjects will undergo HD at a lower blood- flow rate 
(250 mL/min) for a 1 -week run-in period to determine the HD duration required 
to achieve adequate fractional urea clearance ( Kt/V) (>  1.2). Daugirdas’ formula 
will be used to calculate Kt/V ( Daugirdas 1993, Daugirdas 1995, Daugirdas and 
Schneditz 1995).  
 
The  column comes in 3 sizes (S -15, S-25, S-35) and each size will be 
tested at blood- flow rates of  250 mL/min and up to 450 mL/min  as tolerated  (see 
Appendix 17.1: Escalatio n, De-escalation, and Discontinuation Rules for 
Treatment with the  Column ). Each column -size and blood- flow rate 
combination will be evaluated during 3 consecutive HD sessions before proceeding with the next combination, as follows: 
• Week -1 (Visit s 2-4) HD run -in period (no column) at 250  mL/min to 
determine Kt/V  
• Week 1 (Visits 5 -7)  column S-15 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 2 (Visits 8 -10)  column S-15 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 3 (Visits 11 -13)  column S-25 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 4 (Visit s 14-16)   column S -25 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 5 (Visits 17-19)  column S-35 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 6 (Visits 20-22)  column S-35 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 7 (Visit 2 3) End of study  (EOS) , no column , HD at patient’s 
standard rate  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618252], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618253] treatment with the  column S -15 (150 mL) will occur mid-
week (e.g., on Wednesday for subjects on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday 
schedule and on Thursday for subjects on a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule).  
The escalation to the subsequent column-s ize and flow -rate combination will 
occur mid -week ( e.g., on Wednesday for subjects on a 
Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and on Thursday for subjects on a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule).  
The duration of each HD treatment  will be adjusted to ensure adequate Kt/V 
with a reduced  flow rate ( approximately  4-6 hours at 250 mL/min, 3 -4 hours at  
up to 450 mL/min ). During each week determination of HD adequacy  will 
include KtV > 1.2 (calculated from measurements of blood urea) and urea 
reduction ratio (URR) (w eekly URR  > 65%).  
The most important known potential risk for use of the  column  is an 
increased risk  of IDH. Risk mitigations may include prophylactic administration 
of saline, supi[INVESTIGATOR_179413]/l ower limb elevation , avoidance of fasting before 
HD, avoidance of food intake during HD, use of cooled dialysate, education about the importance of avoiding excessive fluid gain between HD sessions (interdialytic weight gain), and avoiding the use of ultrafiltration rates (UFR ) 
above 13 mL/kg/h. Concomitant medication s, especially medications related to 
or affecting blood pressure ( BP), should remain stable while on study and 
receiving HD with the  column . 
 The occurrence of IDH events during each week , as outlined in Appendix 17.1: 
Escalation, De-escalation, and Discontinuation Rules for Treatment with the 
 Column
, will be one factor used to determine column size/blood- flow 
rate escalation/de- escalation as well as dis continuation from the study. There is 
also a possibility that the blood- flow rate of 450 mL/min cannot be attained due 
to factors related to the dialysis circuit or other technical issues. If th e blood-
flow rate of 450 mL/min  cannot be attained , it can be adjusted down to enable 
continued dialysis a t a blood- flow rate as high as possible. T he reason(s) for the 
inability to attain a blood -flow rate of 450  mL/min must be documented.   
Endpoints:                                 
Primary Endpoints: 
• Safety and tolerability of each column size at each blood- flow rate.  
o Evaluation of safety and tolerability will include assessment of the rate and severity of all adverse events (AEs) , with analyses of 
adverse device effects (ADEs) , treatment -emergent AEs  
(TEAEs), number of IDH events, and changes in total and fr ee 
hemoglobin ( Hgb). 
o Tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_481301]- flow-rate 
combination.

The objective of this study is to explore the safety and tolerability of the  column at 
blood-flow rates greater than 250 mL/min in subjects with ESRD undergoing HD. The proposed 
study will assess the safety, tolerability, and impact on HD parameters when the  column is used at a blood- flow rates of up to 450 mL/min.  Secondary objectives include 
exploration of the performance of the column by [CONTACT_35755] b2M concentrations before and after HD as well as the potential impact on other plasma proteins, including complement factors.  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618267], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618268] ESR D requiring 
HD. Assuming a drop-out rate (unrelated to safety and tolerability) of 20%, approximately 15 
subjects will be enrolled to obtain 12 evaluable subjects . The  column will be 
connected in series before (upstream) of the dialysis cartridge for the duration of each HD session. Only single-use dialyzers will be used during the study. 
After screening (Visit 1), subjects will undergo HD at a lower blood-flow rate (250 mL/min) for 
a 1-week  run-in period to determine the HD duration required to achieve adequate Kt/V (> 1.2). 
Daugirdas’ formula will be used to calculate Kt/V ( Daugirdas 1993, Daugirdas 1995, Daugirdas 
and Schneditz 1995).  
The  column size will be increased from S -15 (150 mL) to S-25 (250 mL) to S-35 
(350 mL) , as tolerated , and blood- flow rates will be evaluated  at 250 mL/min and up to 
450 mL/min as tolerated  (see Appendix 17.1: Escalation, De-escalation, and Discontinuation 
Rules for Treatment with the  Column ). Each column -size and blood- flow rate 
combination will be evaluated during 3 consecutive HD sessions (1 week) before proceeding 
with the next combination, as follows (and as shown in the S chematic of Stu dy D esign ): 
 
• Week -1 (Visits 2 -4) HD run -in period (no column) at 250 mL/min 
to determine Kt/V  
• Week 1 (Visits 5 -7)  column S-15 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 2 (Visits 8 -10)  column S-15 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 3 (Visits 11 -13)  column S-25 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 4 (Visits 14 -16)   column S -25 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 5 (Visits 17-19)  column S-35 at 250 mL/min  
• Week 6 (Visits 20-22)  column S-35 at up to 450 mL/min  
• Week 7 (Visit 2 3) EOS , no column , HD at patient’s standard rate  
 
The first treatment with the  column S-15 (150 mL) will occur mid-week (e.g., on 
Wednesday for subjects on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and on Thursday for subjects 
on a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule). 
The escalation to the subsequent column- size and flow -rate combination  will occur mid -week 
(e.g., on Wednesday for subjects on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule and on Thursday for 
subjects on a Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday schedule).  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618269], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 24 of 80 The duration of HD time will be adjusted for flow rate (approximately 4-6 hours for 
250 mL/min, 3-4 hours for up to 450 mL/min). During each HD session, measurements of HD effectiveness will include Kt/V > 1.2 (calculated from measurements of blood urea) and URR (weekly URR > 65%). 
The incidence of IDH events, as defined in Appendix 17.1: E scalation, De-escalation, and 
Discontinuation Rules for Treatment with the  Column, will be one factor used to 
determine column size/blood- flow rate escalation/de -escalation as well as discontinuation from 
the study. The p lanned duration of subject participation is approximately 1 2 weeks (up to 4 weeks for 
screening and 8 weeks on -study, which is inclusive of the 1- week run -in period).

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618280], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618281]  Withdrawal /Discontinuation   
5.4.1. Reasons for  Withdrawal /Discontinuation  
A subject will be withdrawn from the study for the following medical or administrative reasons: 
• Occurrence of an AE , including significant hemodynamic compromise, that represents an 
unacceptable risk to the subject and when continued participation in the investigational 
study is not warranted, in the judgment of the investigator, Sponsor, or medical monitor. The investigator must follow the subject until the AE resolves or is stable, unless the subject is lost to follow up.  
• Treatment with a prohibited concomitant medication other than the use of appropriate 
medic ations for the treatment of AEs under direction of the investigator. 
• Subject noncompliance, defined as refusal or inability to adhere to the trial schedule or 
procedures.  
• At the request of the subject (e.g., subject withdraws consent), investigator, Sponsor, or 
regulatory authority. 
• Pregnancy. 
• As subject will be discontinued if adequate dialysis is not achievable at a blood- flow rate of 
250 mL/min during run-in. 
• A subject will be discontinued if they have an SBP <  90 mmHg, confirmed by [CONTACT_167423] , before the start of an HD session . 
• A subject will be discontinued if the number of IDH events (defined as an SBP 
< 90 mmHg , confirmed by [CONTACT_135042] ) during a treatment period exceeds the 
predetermined threshold of the subject’s Historical IDH Rate after de -escalation to the 
lowest column size (see Appendix 17.1) .  
5.4.2. Handling of Participant Withdrawals /Discontinuation  
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study and all assessments. Subjects may voluntarily withdraw at any time, and the investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.  
Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled with the inten t of obtaining 12 evaluable subjects 
(see Section 10.3).  Subjects who have received at least 1 HD with the  column but are withdrawn or 
withdraw from the study will be encouraged to complete the EOS procedures.  The primary 
reason for study discontinuation will be documented on the case report form (CRF).

duration of each HD session. Specifics of column preparation (rinsing, priming, and disposal) are 
specified in the Device Procedures Manual.  
6.1.5. Column Size Escalation and Administratio n 
For a description of the  column escalation and administration for this study, please see Section 4.[ADDRESS_618286], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 32 of 80 6.2. Study Device Accountabili ty 
Under the supervision of the investigator, qualified personnel are responsible for ensuring 
adequate accountability of all used and unused  columns. This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of  columns (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records, and destruction of used columns.  co lumn dispensing 
records will document quantities received and quantities dispensed to subjects including the date dispensed, size of column (S-15, S-25, or S-35), lot number, subje ct’s study identifier, initials of 
the individual responsible for dispensing, and initials of the dialysis nurse, or other qualified medical professional, administering the column. Device accountability will be monitored by a clinical research associate (C RA).  
Accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_124524], Inc., or their designee, and are open to inspection by [CONTACT_108889]. Accounts of any  column  accidentally wasted or intentionally 
disposed of must be maintained.  
All unused  columns should be kept securely at the site until otherwise instructed. All 
unused containers of  columns  at the site should not be returned or destroyed without 
prior written ap proval from the Sponsor, and authorized destruction must be performed in 
accordance with the site’s or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s administrative policy (or equivalent), and/or relevant US  
regulations. The site’s procedure(s) for disposal/destruction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_258556]. A copy of the site’s device disposal policy should be maintained or referenced in the investigator’s study file.

in Section 15.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Demographics  
Demographic information such as the subject’s education level, ethnicity, and race will be collected.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Medical History and Review of Medications  
The investigator or designee will obtain a detailed medical history through interview with the subject during screening. The medical history should focus on recent history. Additionally, the medical history should include: 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618288], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 34 of 80 • A detailed history of ESRD and HD in the last 6 months, including complications with 
vascular access, compliance with dietary and fluid restrictions, ability to maintain 
adequate levels, tolerability of HD, occurrence of IDH, blood- flow rates used, etc.  
• Current/past illnesses and conditions • Current s ymptoms of any active medical condition 
• Surgeries and procedures  
• Allergies  
The investigator or designee should obtain a complete list of the subject’s current medications, including over-the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and/or vitamins, as well as those taken by [CONTACT_124527] [ADDRESS_618289] 3 months. Any additions, discontinuation, or dosage changes in medication during the course of the study will be recorded. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Physical Examination 
A complete  physical examin ation will be performed at s creening  to assess the following organ 
systems: skin, ENT (ears, nose, and throat), head, eyes, lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, 
extremities, and neurologic and lymphatic systems.  Physic al examination assessments performed 
within 3  months of the screening visit need not be repeated. Height will be measured at 
screening; weight will be measured at screening and BMI calculated. Weight will be measured  
throughout the study both prior to and after HD. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. 12-Lead ECG  
A [ADDRESS_618290] 5 minutes in a 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out 
technical f actors contributing to ECG artifacts or abnormality. It is important that leads are 
placed in the same positions each time for consistency. The overall conclusion with the interpretation of the ECGs will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. The interpretation of the ECGs will be recorded as normal, abnormal but not clinically  significant, or abnormal and 
clinically significant. QTc will be calculated using Fridericia’s correction formula.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood samples will be collected and analyzed th roughout the study. Blood will be drawn by a 
qualified medical provide r. Lab oratory evaluations will be completed by a central laboratory. 
Samples for s creening lab oratory evaluations should be collected either on a non-dialysis day or 
prior to HD. For additional information, refer to Section 15.3 Schedule of Laboratory Tests . 
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Hemodialysis  
Beginning at run-in, HD will be conducted 3 times weekly  at different  blood- flow rates  (see 
Section 4.1). The following key dialysis parameters will be captur ed during each HD treatment: 
arterial, venous, and transmembrane pressures every 30 minutes (from the HD machine; mmHg), 
mean and  maximum blood flow rate (mL/min), reasons for changes in blood- flow rate, dialysis 
time (min), and type of dialyzer. Adequate safety precautions should be employed prior to and throughout HD, particularly for subjects who are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_258531]. Refer to Table [ADDRESS_618291], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 35 of 80 Section 2.2.1 for risks associated with the  column as well as proposed m itigation 
strategies.  
[IP_ADDRESS].7. Heparinization  
The  column requires anticoagulation to prevent clotting, and the different column 
sizes generally require different amounts of heparin. Subjects will undergo heparinization 
according to institutional practices a t the start of, and throughout, each HD session when the 
 column is used . The dose of heparin should be determined by [CONTACT_481306]’s individual requirements , the state of the dialysis circuit, and laboratory tests. 
Additional guidance is provided in the Device Procedures Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures to Assess Safety  
Subjects enrolled in the trial will be monitored closely to assess safety and tolerability of the 
 column. Study-specific procedures that will be used for this pur pose are summarized 
below. Information regarding the timing and frequency of these procedures is provided in 
Section 15:  
• Review of AEs  
• Vital signs  
• Adequacy of dialysis 
• Assessment of fluid status  
• Targeted physical examinat ion, weight measurements 
• Laboratory assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Review of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be reviewed, documented, and reported as required at each visit 
beginning at screening. For definitions, guidance, and additional information regarding AEs, please see Section 8.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Monitoring of Vital Signs  
Vital signs  monitoring will occur at every visit. Seated/reclined blood pressure ( BP) will be 
recorded before each dialysis session, approximately every 30 minutes during dialysis, and at the end of the session. Other vital signs will be captured at the beginning and end of each visit; these include heart rate (beats per minute [bpm]), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute), and body temperature. Vital signs will be meas ured after the subject has been seated/reclined for ~5 
minutes.   
Subjects will be monitored for IDH (see Definitions ). Beginning at run- in, should the number of 
occurrences of IDH exceed a predetermined threshold based on the subject’s Expected IDH Rate, then the subject will be discontinued or de- escalated  to a previously tolerated, smaller  column 
size at blood-flow rates up to 450 mL/min  (Appendix 17.1).  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618292], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 36 of 80 [IP_ADDRESS].3. Assessment of Fluid Status  
Fluid status will be assessed during each HD treatment  according to institutional standards of 
care. This will include body weight and assessment of pulmonary and dependent (pedal) edema 
and could include the following: pre and post HD bioimpedance, lung ultrasound monitoring of 
Kerley B -lines ( Lichtenstein 2017), and continuous hematocrit monitoring during HD as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093]/HD staff ( Rodriguez 2005). Data will be collected concerning the 
performance of these procedures, as appropriate, and the outcomes assessed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Targeted Physical Exam ination  
A targeted physical examination (i.e., a re-examination of any abnormalities noted previously or 
new signs and symptoms that warrant clinical assessment) will be performed as needed  (see 
Section 15). Weight will be assessed before and after HD at every visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5. Laboratory Evaluations 
Blood samples will be collected and analyzed according to the schedule of laboratory tests (Sectio n 15.3). Blood will be drawn by a qualified medical provider. Clinical laboratory 
evaluations will be processed by a central laboratory. Sites may collect and process these locally at the discretion of the investigator  for ad -hoc safety monitoring and/or to guide heparin dosing. 
[IP_ADDRESS].6. Pregnancy Testing  
Serum pregnancy testing will be performed in WOCBP in accordance with the Schedule of Events (see Section 15).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures to  Assess Device Performance 
In addition to safety and tol erab
 ility, device performance will be assessed per the secondary 
endpoints defined in the study, including evaluation of change in plasma b2M concentrations (before and after HD) and contribution of the  column to b2M re moval at each column 
size and  blood-flow rate, number of occurrences of visible thrombosis (clotting) in the  
column, dialyzer, and/or tubing, changes in plasma levels of complement factors, including total 
,
 as well as changes in plasma levels of other proteins, including  
.

• Anticoagulants other than those administered during HD. Use of antiplatelet drugs (e.g., 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87494]) is allowed. 
• Anti-seizure medications for a seizure disorder.  
• Concurrent or recent participa tion in another investigational clinical trial. Prior clinical 
trial subjects must have discontinued investigational agents at least 30 day s prior to 
screening.  
• Renal transplantation surgery. 
 

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618297], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618298]  
Per the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO) [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_618299] clinical signs (including 
laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
• Note 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device.  
• Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
• Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to inves tigational medical devices.   
 In relation to Note 2 above, a sub- classification of an AE is a procedure- related AE (PRAE). A 
PRAE is an AE  that most likely  occurs as a result of  HD or related  procedures , irrespective of 
the investigational medical device. Examples of a PRAE in HD include vascular access site complication s, including access hemorrhage and venous needle dislodgement; disruption or 
contamination of the dialysis water system; venous air embolism; sepsis; cardiac complications including arr hythmia, angina, and cardiac arrest ; electrolyte imbalances including hypokalemia 
and hyperkalemia, etc. In cases where relatedness is unclear, a conservative stance is to consider 
the event as related to the investigational medical device.  
 
Per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011, an ADE is an AE that is assessed as related to the use of an investigational 
medical device:  
• Note 1: This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunctio n of the investigational medical device.  
• Note 2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.   
8.1.2. Definition of S eriou s Adverse E vent and Serious Adverse Device Effect  
Per ISO 1 4155:2011 a serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE that: 
a. Leads to death.  
b. Leads to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either results in: 
• A life -threatening illness or injury, or 
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or • Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairmen t to a body structure or body function.  
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618300], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618301]. 
Per ISO [ZIP_CODE]:[ADDRESS_618302] (SADE) is an ADE that results in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a S AE. 
All SAEs should be reported in the timeframe outlined in Section 8.4. 
8.2. Classification of An A dverse E vent 
8.2.1. Severity of Event  
Each AE /ADE  must be assessed for its seriousness and severity . Severity will be assessed by [CONTACT_481308]: 
 
SEVERITY  DEFINITION  
MILD  Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
MODERATE  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
SEVERE  Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
Outcome will be assessed using the following categories: recovered/resolved, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, or unknown. 
8.2.2. Relationship to Study Device  
Investigators are required to assess the relatedness  (i.e., whether there is reasonable possibility 
that the study device caused the event) us ing the following definitions: 
• Unrelated: another cause of the AE is more plausible, including AEs that commonly occur 
during HD (e.g. procedure- related AEs); a temporal sequence cannot be established with the 
onset of the AE  and administration of the study device; or a causal relationship is considered 
biologically implausible.  
• Possibl y Related: There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE  and 
administration of the study device, but the AE  could also be attributed to concurrent or 
underlying disease, or the use of other devices  or procedures . Possibly related should be used 
when the study device is one or several biologically plausible AE  causes.  
• Definitely Related : The AE is clearly related to use of the study device. 
If either the  investigator or the Sponsor considers the event related, then the event will be 
considered related for reporting purposes and will therefore be an ADE or SADE . 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618303], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 40 of 80 8.2.3. Expectedness  of Adverse Device Effects  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
Per 21 CFR 812.3(s) an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE), “means any serious 
adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or 
associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  
The investigator is required to make an initial assessment of whether a n SADE  is considered 
anticipated according to the known risks and associated device effects identified in Section 2.2.1 and the Investigator’s Brochure . If an SADE  is considered unanticipated by [CONTACT_093], it 
must be reported to the Sponsor or designee according to the timeframes outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Once r eceived, the Sponsor or designee will be responsible for making the final 
determination of whether the device effect is unanticipated for subsequent reporting to FDA.  
8.3. Time P eriod /Frequency for  Event A ssessment /Follow- up 
At very clinic visit, subjects will be assessed for AEs and SAEs. All AEs and SAEs will be monitored and recorded by [CONTACT_481309]. 
At the beginning of each visit, after the subject has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any probl ems that may have occurred during the preceding interdia lytic interval, the investigator 
should inquire about any possible interdialytic AEs by [CONTACT_7939] a non-leading question such as the following: 
1. “How are you feeling?” 
2. “Have you had any changes since your last assessment/visit?”  
3. “Have you taken any new medicines since your last assessment/visit?” 
During and for a period  after each HD session, participating subjects will be closely  monitored 
by [CONTACT_481310][INVESTIGATOR_481296]. Any events that occur during or after HD (before the subject leaves the clinic), will be assessed by [CONTACT_481311] (e.g. hemodialysis technician or nurse) and discussed as appropriate with the investigator or designee. 
8.3.1. Post-Study Safety Assessment  
The investigator is not obligated to actively seek safety  information in former study subject s, but 
the investigator is encouraged to notify Alkahest, Inc. or their designee of any AE /ADE  or 
SAE /SADE  occurring within [ADDRESS_618304] completes the study (or has their last visit) 
that the investigator judges may be reasonably related to study treatment or study participation. 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618305], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618306] be followed until the AE /ADE  is resolved or is stable, unless the subject is lost to 
follow up. 
Each AE /ADE  must be described as follows: the date of onset, date of resolution, severity (mild, 
moderate, severe), frequency of the event (single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], intermittent, continuous), action taken 
with study device (no action taken, device di scontinued), outcome, relationship to study device* 
(unrelated, possibly related, definitely related), and seriousness criteria. Each AE /ADE  must be 
recorded separately.  
*Note:  Assessment of the relationship to study device will be made only when the AE oc curs 
after the subject has initiated at least one ( 1) treatment with the  column . An AE 
occurring before the subject’s exposure to the  column  will always be labeled as 
“unrelated .” 
Any AE/ADE or SAE/SADE  occurring during the study must be documented in  the subject’s 
source documentation and as an AE /ADE  in the CRF. All SAE/SADEs should be reported to the 
Sponsor according to the reporting timeframes specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event (that meets the definition of 
an AE /ADE  or SAE /SADE ) based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such 
cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE /ADE  and/or SAE /SADE  and not the 
individual signs or symptoms. The diagnosis will become the basis for the verbatim term as reported by [CONTACT_093]. If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not present, the abnormal finding should be recorded.  
In addition to the investigator’s own description of the AE/ADE, each AE/ADE will be encoded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). The investigator will 
take all appropriate and necessary therapeutic measu res required for resolution of and AE/ ADE. 
Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE/ADE must be recorded on the concomitant medication CRF.  
8.4.2. Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Events/Effects  Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Timeframes  for Reporting  
As per 21 CFR 812.150 an investigator shall submit to the Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB a 
report of any UADE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) occurring during an investigation as soon as possible after the investigator first learns of the effect. Prompt notification of the  Sponsor, and/or the 
Sponsor’s representatives, and promptly providing requested follow-up information regarding such events is essential so that ethical and regulatory responsibilities and legal obligations can be satisfied. Investigators are responsible for reporting all SAEs (including SADEs and UADEs) according to the following timeframes:  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618307], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 42 of 80 • Initial notification (e.g., a completed SAE Report Form) and relevant source documents, 
if applicable, must be completed and faxed or emailed to  
within 24 hours  of observation or learning of the event. 
  
  
  
• Follow-up information must be sent t o the  within 24 hours  of receipt of 
information by [CONTACT_2727].  
All applicable events (including UADEs) must be reported to the IRB as soon as possible but in no event later than 10 working days after becoming aware of the event.  
In addition to the IRB, the Sponsor will notify the FDA and all participating investigators in a 
safety report of potentially serious, unanticipated risks from clinical trials as soon as possibl e 
after the Sponsor receives the safety information and determine s that the information qualifies 
for reporting:  
• No later than 7 working days for events that are life threatening (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_124496]) or that involve death as an outcome. 
• No later than 10 working days for all other UADEs. 
Sites acting under their local IRB should submit all applicable events, unanticipated problems, 
and safety reports to their local IRB, if applicable. All safety reporting deviations should also be submitted to their local IRB, if applicable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. SAE/SADE/UADE  Information  to Report  
The SAE Report Form must be completed and faxed or emailed according  to the timeframes 
specified above. The  submission  should include copi[INVESTIGATOR_124498] /medical 
records , if applicable. At a minimum, the SAE R eport Form  must cont ain the subject number, 
verbatim term, onset date, relationship to study device, and a brief narrative of the event . Please 
note that relationship to study device as well as the reported verbatim term are very important  and should be included in t he initial report as it may impact expedited regulatory 
reporting requirements for the event. The date of  discovery by [CONTACT_258565]. 
A separate SAE Report Form should be used to report each SAE . However, if at  the time of 
initial reporting, multiple SAE s are present that are temporally and/or clinically related, they may 
be reported on the same SAE  Report Form.  
The investigator must record all relevant information regarding an SAE/SADE/UADE in the 
applicable se ctions of the report form, and the form must be signed by [CONTACT_15009]/her 
designee before transmittal to the Contract Research Organization (CRO) (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). It 

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618308], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 43 of 80 is very important that the in vestigator provide his/her assessment of relationship to the study 
device as well as an applicable diagnosis at the time of the initial SA E report . It is not acceptable 
for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records in lieu of completion of 
the appropriate SAE Report Form. However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_258537]/or the Sponsor. If medica l records are 
submitted to the CRO, then all subject personal identifiers mu st be completely and thoroughly 
redacted prior to submission. 
 
A blank SAE Report Form and instructions for reporting will be provided to the site and will be 
maintained in the inv estigator’s study file.  
 
If new information about an SAE/SADE/UADE is recei ved or corrections to data are needed, the 
investigator should complete a new SAE Report Form and check the “follow-up” box on the form. This follow-up SAE Report Form should be submitted within 24 hours of learning of the information.   The SAE/SADE/UADE pages of the CRF should also be completed as thoroughly as possible.  
8.4.3. Reporting  of Pregnancy  
While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE, pregnancy occurring in a clinical study must be followed to collect information regarding the experiences of gestat ion and pregnancy with study 
device exposure. The investigator must report any pregnancy that occurs in a female study subject  or female partner of a male subject  subsequent to first exposure to the study device until 
EOS , or within [ADDRESS_618309]’s last use of the device in the event of early 
termination . All pregnancies will be rep orted to the IRB, Sponsor, and CRO. In the event of a 
pregnancy, treatment will be discontinued, and the subject will undergo continued safety follow-up through pr egnancy outcome.  
Any pregnancy must be followed by [CONTACT_179130]. Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect(s) observed in the child must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the investigator or study personnel’s first knowledge. 
8.5. Study Halting  Rules  
 
If any of the following safety events occur, a Safety Evaluation Meeting (defined below) will be 
triggered: 
• Three or more SAEs (including SADEs and UADEs) that are assessed as possibly or 
definitely related to the study device by [CONTACT_481312] (see Section 8.2.2).  
• An overall pattern of symptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events associated with the study device that the Sponsor’s Program Physician or designee consider a serious potential safety concern (e.g., suspi[INVESTIGATOR_179095]). 
Events that are not considered “d evice related” and will not contribute to the count of definitely -
related SAEs that would trig ger a Safety Evaluation Meeting.  
 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618310], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 44 of 80 Safety Evaluation Meeting 
 
If safety events of potential concern occur during the trial (i.e., 3 related events or a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_124499], as defined above) a Safety Evaluation Meeting will be triggered, and the stud y 
may be temporarily halted based on the observations. The Sponsor will inform investigators and the appropriate Regulatory Authorities in the event of any temporary halt in the study at any time during the conduct of the study. The purpose of the meeting is for investigators, the Sponsor, and the CRO Medical Monitor(s) to discuss and evaluate the safety of the subjects using available aggregated safety data.  
 
Attendants at the Safety Evaluation Meeting  will include the Program Physician of Alkahest (or 
his/her designee), the CRO medical monitor(s), and available active investigators participating 
in the trial. After sufficient data review , the Sponsor will choose one of the following courses of 
action:  
1. Continue the study with no change to protocol. 
2. Halt use of the  column (all column sizes/blood -flow rates)  and stop the study.  
3. Continue with a modified protocol design and amend the protocol as appropriate.  
8.6. Safety Oversight  
Safety oversight will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]’s Program Physician or his or her designee and the CRO’s Medical Monitor(s) in concert with the site investigators. There will be no formal Data Safety Monitoring Board established. As needed, Safety Evaluation Meetings will be convened as described in Section 8.5 to monitor the ongoing safety of the study. The Sponsor’s Program Physician or designee is the final authority for safety oversight in the study. 

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618311], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618312] of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s), with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requiremen t(s). 
• Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_941] s tudy CRO in accordance with the 
Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) . 
• Details of clinical site monitoring tasks and scope are documented in the study’s CMP . 
The CMP describes in detail who will conduct monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. 
• Co-monitoring visits and/or independent audits may be conducted by [CONTACT_459431] a quali ty oversight plan  or equivalent to ensure monitoring practices are 
performed consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the CMP.  
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618313], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618314] methods for binomial data 
and t-statistics for continuous data will be used in generating 95% confidence intervals for estimates. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared to provide details of the analysis of data. Counts and percentages of safety events will be reported separat ely for each combination. 
Similarly, continuous safety data will be summarized by [INVESTIGATOR_74257].  
No formal statistical comparison of the safety data will be performed. The rate of IDH in the 
general ESRD population, using the Nadir 90 definition, is 10%, based on a study in over 10,000 US patients undergoing HD ( Flythe 2015 ). With 12 subjects there will be an approximate 70% 
probability of detecting at least [ADDRESS_618315]: screen failures, enrollment, withdrawal of consent, and study completion. Primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed at the beginning and end of each week of treatment for a particular column size and blood-flow rate combination. The effect of blood- flow rate will be 
assessed for a given column size as well as intrasubject and across -subject variability. The 
sample size was chosen based on clinical consideration of the study designed to test the safety and functionality of the  column operated at higher blood- flow rates.  
10.2. Statistical  Hypotheses  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability  of the  
column when used at blood- flow rates  up to 450 mL/min. The safety and tolerability will be 
assessed at  each  column size and  blood- flow rate  to enable comparisons across  those variables in 
each subject (intrasubject) and across all subject s.   
10.3. Analysis Datasets  
Two (2) analysis datasets will be defined as follows: 
• Safety Dataset: all subjects who received at least 1 (or partial) HD treatment with the 
 column .  
• Evaluable Dataset: all subjects who complete blood- flow rates up to 450 mL/min for at 
least 1 column size (e.g., S-15 at 250 and up to 450 mL/min ).  
The presentation of baseline char acteristics will be conducted on the Safety  Dataset. Comparison 
of the safety and tolerability of each column size and blood- flow rate will use both the Safety 
Dataset and Evaluable Dataset.  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618316], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618317] changes and between -condition differences. 
Overall baseline and demographic data will be sum marized using descriptive statistics.  
For analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, the following will be considered:  
• For endpoints that are continuous in nature: 
– Number of observations, mean, median, minimum and maximum, and standard 
deviation (SD) and change from baseline v alues (or percent change from baseline) will 
be presented as descriptive summary.  
• For endpoints that are categorical in nature: 
– Frequency counts and percentages will be presented as descriptive summar ies. 
Subject disposition (e.g., the number of subjec ts enrolled, completed, and discontinued at each 
phase ) will be summarized, and medical history data will be listed. Prior and concomitant 
medi cations taken from screening and during the study will be categorized by [CONTACT_481313], listed and summarized by 
[CONTACT_11840].  
Final analyses are not limited to the summaries described herein. As noted above, analytical 
details and assumptions will be fully presented in the SAP. 
10.4.2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by [CONTACT_481314]- escalat ion and/or discontinuation from the study and by [CONTACT_481315] (i.e. , a column size at both blood- flow rates) .  
Summary tabulations of the reported AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_481316] (PTs ) and system organ classes ( SOC s) using the 
MedDRA Version [ADDRESS_618318] attribution to the study device. 
10.4.3. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints  
Actual values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measurements will be assessed 
and summarized. Laboratory shift tables or graphics displaying the change (number of subjects) relative to the reference range from baseline to  each study visit may also be presented for each 
test. The investigator should exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding and 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618319], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618320], as appropriate.  
10.5. Sample  Size 
The sample size for this study was based on FDA Guidance for th e Content for Premarket 
Notifications for Conventional and High Permeability Hemodialyzers ( FDA 1998) which 
recommend s that data be collected for a minimum of [ADDRESS_618321] 
will be enrolled. Assuming a drop- out rate of 20% (unrelated to safety) enrollment will yield 
approximately [ADDRESS_618322] important risk of  IDH, 
a sample of 12 subjects will provide approximately 70% probability of detecting at least 1 IDH event in each week (i.e. , for each column size and blood- flow rate combination). This estimate is 
based on the assumption that the rate of IDH in the general ESRD population, using the Nadir 90 definition, is 10%, based on a study in over 10,000 US patients undergoing HD ( Flythe 2015 ).  
 

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618323], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 49 of 80 11. SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
Each participating site will maintain a ppropriate medical and research records for this trial, in 
compliance with ICH E6 R2 and regulatory and Institutional requirements for the protection of 
confidentiality of subject s. Each site will permit authorized representatives of regulatory 
agencies, t he IRB, the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s representatives to examine (and when permitted 
by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) clinical records for the purposes of QA reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress, and data validity. 
Source data are all i nformation, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Examples 
of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject ’s memory aids or evaluation 
checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded audio tapes of counseling sessions, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_481297], legible, accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, and subject  files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, 
and medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial. 
It is not acceptable for the CRF to be the only record of a subject’s participation in the study. This is to ensure that anyone who would access the subject’s medical record has adequate knowledge that the subject is partici pating in a clinical trial. Source document templates will be 
developed for this study. 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618324], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 50 of 80 12. ETHICS/ PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
12.1. Ethical  Standard  
The investigator will ensure this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in, [ADDRESS_618325] (such as 
advertisements, subject information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by [CONTACT_124541]. Approval from the IRB must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval.  
All changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented subjects need to be re-consented. 
Any modifications or amendments to the protocol must also be submitted to the IRB for approval 
prior to implementation.  
If the investigator were to receive withdrawal of IRB approval, or other action on the part of the IRB that affects the study, the investigator will provide written notification within [ADDRESS_618326], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618327] . By [CONTACT_1725], all parties agree they will co mplete the 
evaluations required by [CONTACT_1758], unless they withdraw voluntarily or are terminated from the study for any reason. 
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study candidates that 
includes limited information a bout the potential candidate (e.g., date of screening). 
All subjects who provide consent will be assigned a unique study num ber. This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to the study subject. Once a number is assigned to a subject, that number will remain with that study subject and will n ot be reused. 
If an individual’s medical chart or results of diagnostic tests performed as part of an individual’s regular medical care are going to be used for screening, written informed consent must be obtained prior to review of that information in acc ordance with Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act. 
12.4. Participant and Data Confidentiality  
Subject confidentiality is he ld in strict trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, the 
Sponsor, and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples 
and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to subject s. Therefore, the study 
protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor. 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, representatives of the IRB, 
or government regulatory agencies may inspect documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and pharmacy records for the subject s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such 
records.  
The investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities ar e protected from unauthorized parties. An identification code (i.e., not names) should 
be recorded on non- local lab oratory  samples, requisitions, and any documents submitted to the 
CRO, Sponsor, and/or IRB. The investigator must keep a subject log showing codes, names, and pertinent contact [CONTACT_481317]. The study subject ’s contact [CONTACT_62566]. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_9885]/or Institutional regulations.  
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618328], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618329] ’s approval and as approved by [CONTACT_50810], de- identified biological samples may 
be stored at Alkahest , or designee, for future use . These samples could be used for future 
research and to improve treatment . Alkahest will also be provided with a code- link that will 
allow linking the biologica l specimens with the specific data from each subject , maintaining the 
masking of the identity of the study subject. Subjects may choose whether the Sponsor can store 
and use samples for further research . 
During the conduct of the study, an individual subject can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research.  
When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be managed by [CONTACT_124546]. 
In the event Alkahest transfers ownership to another commercial Sponsor, ownership of the samples may be transferred as well.  
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618330], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618331] and substantiate the integrity of the data collected . Source documents are filed at the investigator ’s site . Data entered in the 
eCRFs that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained . All source documents should be completed in a neat, 
legible manner to ensure accurate interpr etation of data. Black or blue ink is required to ensure 
clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry 
with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE 
CORRECTION FLUID OR  TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL . The investigator may need to request 
previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the trial; also, current medical records must be available.  
The CRF must be completed in a timely manner. The investigator will review an d approve the 
CRF for each study subject after all data have been entered, the CRFs have been source document verified, and all queries have been resolved. This also applies to records for those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 
13.1.1. Investigator Responsibilities  
The investigator will comply with the protocol (which has been approved/given favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_124503]), ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator is ultimately responsible for the conduct of all aspects of the study at the study site and verifies by [CONTACT_179140]. The term “investigato r” as used in 
this protocol as well as in other study documents, refers to the investigator or authorized study personnel that the investigator has designated to perform certain duties. Sub-investigators or other authorized study personnel are eligible to sign for the investigator, except where the investigator’s signature [CONTACT_1788]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Responsibilities

– For non-emergency purposes, obtain prior approval by [CONTACT_166327], if deviation 
may affect scientific soundness of the trial or the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subject, also obtain approval by [CONTACT_481318] (IDE) supplement. 
• Notify the Sponsor and IRB if a subject is treated with an investigational device without first obtaining informed consent, within 5 working days of use of the investigational device.  
• Notify the Sponsor and IRB with a final study report within 3 months after termination or completion of study or termination of site’s participation. 
13.1.2. Study Files  
 
Investigators a re required to maintain on file the following accurate, complete, and current 
records relating to this study: 
• All correspondence relating to the study with another investigator, an IRB involved in the study, Alkahest, Inc., a monitor, or FDA, including required reports. 
• Records of receipt, u se, or disposition of a  column . 
• All clinical forms and documentation, including:

The investigator’s study file will contain all of these documents, as well as staff curriculum vi tae 
and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and study-specific manuals (e.g., Device Procedures Manual).  
13.2. Study  Records Retention  
Per 21 CFR 812.140(d), an investigator or Sponsor shall maintain the records required by [CONTACT_481319] a period of 2 years after the latter of the following 2 dates: the date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval application, a notice of completion of a product development protocol, a humanitarian device exemption application, a premarket notification submission, or a request for De Novo classification. 

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618335], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 55 of 80 Before the investigator destroys any material related to the cl inical study, he/she must obtain 
approval in writing from the Sponsor. 
The investigator should keep a file where the full name [CONTACT_481329] [ADDRESS_618336] , the investigator, or the study site staff. 
When deviations occur, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_48162]. 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 
• 5.[ADDRESS_618337] the completeness, accuracy, and/or 
reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect the  rights, safety, and/or 
wellbeing of study participants. Examples of Major Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to:  
• Failure to obtain informed consent (i.e., no evidence of informed consent) 
• Enrolling subjects in violation of key eligibility cr iteria designed to ensure a 
specific subject population 
• A device dispensing or related error that could have affected the safety of the 
subject  
• Failure to collect data necessary to interpret the primary endpoint(s), as this may 
compromise the scientific value of the trial.  
 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618338], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 56 of 80 Major Protocol Deviations may result in data that are not deemed evaluable for analysis 
and/or may require that subjects are discontinued from the study.  
 
Note: Observations categorized as Major may include those situations where there is a 
pattern of deviation, numerous Minor observations, or other significant deviation. 
 
Minor Protocol Deviations  are departures from the approved protocol relating to the 
conduct of a study that does not affect the rights, safety, and/or wellbeing of study participants or the study outcomes or data quality. Examples of Minor Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to: 
• A protocol visit date outside of a visit window 
• An isolated case of a missed or incomplete study procedure  
• An isolated incident of a missed or incomplete study evaluation 
 
Minor Protocol Deviations would not generally preclude subject data from the per 
protocol  analysis population. Observations categorized as Minor may become Major if 
not corrected. 
 
All devia tions will be logged and tracked by [CONTACT_167079]. Periodic review of Protocol 
Deviations will serve an indicator of site performance.  Per 21 CFR 812.150(a)(4), it is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations promptly (within 5 working days) to the study CRO and/or Sponsor. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents. Notification of Protocol Deviations must be sent to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site investigator/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. 
13.4. Publication and Data  Sharing Policy 
In compliance with t he International Committee of Medical Journal Editors clinical trials 
registration policy and Section [ADDRESS_618339] of 2007, this study wil l be 
registered by [CONTACT_124548].gov, a public trials registry which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055].  
Notwithstanding the Sponsor’s requirements for registration and data sharing in ClinicalTrials.gov, any formal presentat ion or publication of data collected as a direct or indirect 
result of this trial will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_093](s) and the Sponsor. In the case of multicenter studies, it is mandatory th at the first publication be made based  on the 
totality of data obtained from all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol, and presented and interpreted as documented in the final Clinical Study Report. The resulting publication will name [CONTACT_481330]. Where it is not permitted for all 
investigators to be included as authors, the publication will name [CONTACT_124557]. 
Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618340], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 57 of 80 Individual investigators may publish data arising from their own subjects. The investigator will 
provide the Sponsor with copi[INVESTIGATOR_124504] (including abstracts and posters) at least 
60 days in advance of submission. This review is to permit the Sponsor to review the 
communication for accuracy (thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to regulatory authorities), to verify that confidential information is not inadvertently divulged (including patent protection), to allow adequate input or supplementary information that may not have been available to the investigator, and to allow establishment of co -authorship. 
Investigators participating in multicenter studies must agree not to engage in presentations based on data gathered individually or by a subgroup of centers before publication of the first main publication unless this has been agreed otherwise by [CONTACT_124549]. However, in the event that no publication of the overall results has been submitted after approval of the Clinical Study Report, investigators may publish results of one or more center’s subj ects to 
the same review as outlined above. The Sponsor will circulate proposed multicenter publications to all investigators for review.  
Data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_106126]. The study Sponsor will have [ADDRESS_618341], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618342], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page 59 of 80 15. SCHEDULE  OF EVENTS

larger- size column . Since the main risk of  – IDH – is related to column size , the 
occurrence of IDH will be the main criterion used to determine the appropriateness of escalation  
to a larger column size; however, other factors will be considered when escalating, including the 
overall status of the subject, other AEs, laboratory abnormalities, adequacy of HD, etc.   
The following definitions are relevant to evaluating whether to escalate, de- escalate, or 
discontinue a subject:  
• Intradialytic hypotension/hypotensive (IDH)  event : An SBP < 90 mmHg confirmed 
by [CONTACT_135042] . 
• Expected IDH Rate : The expected number of occurrences of IDH per weekly 
treatm ent period used to assess escalation, de-escalation, and discontinuation. Expected 
IDH Rate is derived from a subject’s Historical IDH Rate (see table below).  
• Historical IDH Rate : The number of occurrences of IDH as documented in a subject’s 
medical record  during a recent 8-week period prior to the run-in period. Subjects with 7 
or more IDH events during this 8- week interval will be excluded. 
Table 3  below provides the corresponding Expected IDH Rate based on the Historical IDH Rate 
and summarizes the rules for escalation, de-escalation, or discontinuation based on the number 
of occurrences of IDH.

experience no more than the number of IDH events described in Table 3 , maintain a n Hgb level 
≥ 9 g/dL, and have no other safety signals that the investigator believes could put the subject at 
risk. If a subject has an SBP <  [ADDRESS_618353], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618354] cannot attain the planned high blood- flow rate  (450 mL/min) due to technical fac tors 
(e.g. differential pressures in the dialysis circuit), the investigator can adjust the blood- flow rate  
down to such a rate that allows the  column to be tested at a higher rate than 
250 mL/min .  

Protocol AKST [ADDRESS_618355], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY  Page [ADDRESS_618356] should be de- escalated if  during the 1- week treatment period they experience the 
number of IDH events described in the table above and/or have an Hgb level < 9 g/dL despi[INVESTIGATOR_481298] .  
De-escalation will only be applicable at V11 through V19 as shown in Figure 4 below. Subjects 
who do not tolerate treatment with the S -15 column at any time prior to V11 or after V19 will be 
discontinued (see Section 17.1.13. Discontinuation Rules ). 
 
Figure 4. De -escalation Schematic 
 
Subjects will continue with the same visit sched ule after de- escalation. At the visit following 
confirmation of de- escalation, treatment will resume with the previous column size at the high 
flow rate ( up to 450 mL/min ).  
 If de-escalation occurs during V11 through V16, subjects will resume treatment at the 
next scheduled visit with the S-15 column at up to 450 mL/min  and will continue with 
this column size/flow rate combination through EOT (V22).   
 If de-escalatio n occurs during V17 through V19, subjects will resume treatment at the 
next scheduled visit with the S -25 column at up to 450 mL/min  and will continue with 
this column size/flow rate combination through EOT (V22).   
 
Table 4  below illustrates the visit schedule for subjects who de -escalate. Note : the only change

17.1.3. Discontinuation Rules  
Subjects will be discontinued and complete the  End of Study visit procedures if : 
• Subject does not tolerate the S-15 column at either fl ow rate  
• Subject does not tolerate the S -35 at the higher flow rate (up to 450 mL/min ) 
• Subject has already de- escalated and they experience the number of IDH events 
described in the Table 3  and/or have an Hgb  level < 9 g/dL despi[INVESTIGATOR_481299]  
• At any time during the study at the investigator’s discretion

significant hemodynamic compromise may require discontinuation from the 
study based on the 
determination of the 
investigator, Sponsor, or 
medical monitor.

additional bullet was added:  
Previously read :  
• “A subject will be discontinued according to the discontinuation rules provided in Appendix 
17.1.”  
  
Now reads: 
• “A subject will be discontinued if they have a confirmed SBP < 90 mmHg before the start of 
an HD session.  
• 
A subject will be discontinued if the number of IDH events (defined as an SBP <  90 mmHg ) 
during a treatment period exceeds the  
predetermined threshold of the subject’s Historical IDH Rate after de- escalation to the 
lowest column size (see Appendix 17.1 ).” Clarification that a subject  
will be discontinued due to 
a confirmed SBP < 90 mmHg prior to an HD 
session  and/or  IDH events 
in excess of the subject’s 
Historical IDH Rate after 
de-escalation to the lowest 
column size .

Previously read :  
• “Definition of Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect”  
 
Now reads :  
• “Definition of Adverse Event, Procedure-
Related Adverse Event, and Adverse Devi ce 
Effect ” 
 
The following text was also added to define a procedure- related adverse event:  “In relation to 
Note 2 above, a sub- classification of an AE is a 
procedure- related AE (PRAE). A PRAE is an AE 
that mos t likely occurs as a result of HD or related 
procedures, irresp ective of the investigational 
medical device. Examples of a PRAE in HD include vascular access site complications, 
including access hemorrhage and venous needle 
dislodgement; disruption or cont amination of the Revised to define a PRAE, 
with examples, to promote 
investigator awareness and 
understanding.

8.3 Section content expanded as follows : 
Previously read:  
• “At every cl inic visit, subjects will be assessed 
for AEs and SAEs. After the subject has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the investigator should inquire 
about AEs by [CONTACT_7939] a non-leading question 
such as the following: 
1. “How are you feeling?”  
2. “Have you had any changes since your last assessment/vi sit?” 
3. “Have you taken any new medicines since your last assessment/visit?”  
 
Now reads:  
• “At very clinic visit, subjects will be assessed 
for AEs and SAEs. All AEs and SAEs will be 
monitored and recorded by [CONTACT_481324]. At the beginning of each visit, after the subject has had an opportunity to 
spontaneously mention any problems that may 
have occurred during the preceding 
interdialytic interval, the investigator should 
inquire about any possible interdialy tic AEs 
by [CONTACT_7939] a non-leading question such as the following: 
 
1. “How are you feeling?”  
2. “Have you had any changes since your last assessment/visit?”  
3. “Have you taken any new medicines since your last a ssessment/visit?” 
 
     During and for a period after each HD session, 
participating subjects will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_481325][INVESTIGATOR_481296]. Any events that occur

should also be taken AFTER HD V4 -V21.  Clarification of timing of 
laboratory measurement . 
17.1 The content in the initial paragraph was updated 
and expanded as follows:  
Previously r ead: 
• “The purpose of the escalation rules is to 
ensure the safety of the subject when 
transitioning to a larger -size column, since 
the main risk of  – IDH – is 
related to column size.”  
  
Now reads: 
• “The purpose of the escalation rules is to 
ensure the safety of the subject when transitioning to a larger -size column. Since 
the main risk of  – IDH – is related to column size, the occurrence of 
IDH will be t he main criterion used to 
determine the appropriateness of escalation 
to a larger column size; however, other 
factors will be considered when escalating, 
including the overall status of the subject, 
other AEs, laboratory abnormalities, 
adequacy of HD, etc.”  
 Clarification of the purpose 
of the escalation rules and 
definition of IDH. 
The initial bullet page was also updated as 
follows 
Previously read:  
• “Intradialytic hypotension/hypotensive (IDH) event:  An SBP < 90 mmHg . 
 
Now reads:

and expanded as follows:  
Previously read:  
• “A subject may be escalated to the next larger 
column size or next blood- flow rate if they 
experience no more than the number of IDH 
events described in Table [ADDRESS_618377] a level ≥  9 g/dL, 
and have no other safety signals that the 
investigator believes could put the subject at risk.” 
Now reads: 
• “A subject may be escalated to the next 
larger column size or next blood- flow rate if 
they experience no more than the numbe r of 
IDH events described in Table 3 , maintai n 
an Hgb level ≥  9 g/dL, and have no other 
safety signals that the investigator believes 
could put the subject at risk. If a subject has 
an SBP < 90 mmHg (confirmed by [CONTACT_481327] t) before  the start of HD, the 
subject will be withdrawn from the study 
because this constitutes significant 
hemodynamic compromise.”  Clarification of escalation 
rules with additional details related to SBP parameters.

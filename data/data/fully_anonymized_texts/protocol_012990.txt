Clinical Study Protocol  R475 -OA-[ADDRESS_968981] been made to improve clarity, ensure consistency across the fasinumab 
program, and to make minor cor rections. The following table outlines the changes made to the 
protocol and the rationale:  
Change and Rationale  Sections Changed  
Main changes to improve patient safety:  
The exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_968982].  In addition, acute 
coronary syndrome has been removed from this criterion 
because this is covered by [CONTACT_712368] #10 . Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #22  
 
In exclusion criterion #10 regarding NSAID use, the general 
statement regarding the use of concomitant medications for 
which NSAIDs are contraindicated has been removed.  Specific  
medications that are not to be taken concomitantly with NSAIDs 
are listed in the prohibited medications section. In addition, 
patients with conditions requiring use of anti -platelet therapy has 
been added to this criterion.  Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #[ADDRESS_968983] risk of renal complications due to NSAID use, as 
follows:  
‘Patie nts taking concomitant ACE inhibitors/ARBs and 
diuretics, or presence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(GFR) <30 mL/minute/1.73m2’ Section  6.2.2  Exclusion Criteria, #[ADDRESS_968984] 
been updated to ensure that patients enrolled under an earlier 
version of the protocol are immediately discontinued from study 
drug and moved to the follow up period if they meet either of the 
updated exclusion criteria described above, or are tak ing the 
newly added prohibited medications described above 
(combination therapy of diuretics with either an ACE inhibitor 
or ARB).  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  Reasons for Permanent 
Discontinuation of Study Drug  
All other changes:  
The rescreening text has been updated for clarity and to be 
consistent across the fasinumab program  Section  5.1.2  Rescreening  
The sample size has been revised from 2700 patients to 
approximately 1620 patients due to the discontinuation of the 
3 mg Q4W and 6 mg Q8W dose regimens.  Clinical Stu dy Protocol Synopsis: Population  
Section  6.1 Number of Patients Planned  
Clarified that fasinumab and fasinumab -matching placebo are 
referred to as ‘SC study drug’ and that NSAIDs (diclofenac and 
celecoxib) and NSAID -matching placebo are referred to as ‘oral 
study drug’.  Throughout the document

CONFIDENTIAL  Change and Rationale  Sections Changed  
The rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol) text has 
been updated to be consistent across the fasinumab program:  
 Clarified that acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken 
for inadequate pain relief for OA and for other 
acceptable reasons (eg, headache, fever);  
 Added text to clarify the dosing instructions;  
 Added text to caution against consumption of  alcoholic 
beverages while on acetaminophen/paracetamol  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Rescue 
Treatment  
Section  7.2 Rescue Medication  
Section  7.7.2  Permitted Medications and 
Procedures   
The section on Prohibited Medications and Procedures has been 
updated : 
 To include methotrexate, which should be used with 
caution in patients taking NSAIDs and because 
methotrexate clearance can be decreased with concurrent 
NSAIDs, leading to potential increases in methotrexate 
levels;  
 To include anticoagulants and anti -platelet therapy (eg, 
warfarin, heparins, factor Xa inhibitors, thrombin 
inhibitors, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -aminosalicylic acid (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA) 
>150 mg daily, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] ), which should be used with 
caution in patients taking NSAIDs;  
 To include recreational use of marijua na in addition to 
medical marijuana, as both have the potential to impact 
efficacy assessments;  
 To include combination therapy of diuretics with either an 
ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB);  
 To clarify that cyclobenzaprine, carisoprodol, orphenadrine 
and tizanidine are muscle relaxants  
 To make minor corrections   Section  7.7.[ADDRESS_968985] been made  to the Schedule of Events table and 
footnotes for clarity, to make minor corrections , and for 
consistency across the fasinumab program:  
 Added a separate row to the Schedule of Events table 
for high -sensitivity C -reactive protein  
 Clarified that the Early Termination/Joint Replacement 
(ET/JR) visit is also the pre -operative visit for patients 
who undergo JR.  
 Added event -triggered imaging to the follow -up period 
and Early Termination Visit during the follow -up 
period in the Schedule of Events Table  
 Removed t he footnote from the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR) row of the Schedule of Events 
table that states the ESR sample will be analyzed by [CONTACT_19979] (ESR samples will be analyzed 
locally using kits provided by [CONTACT_6626], see row

 Clarified in footnote #4 that patients will review a 
“Participating in a Research Study: What You Need to 
Know” brochure and a “Reporting Your Pain’ brochure 
at the screening and pre -randomization visits  
 Added a urine pregnancy test at week 28  
 Added a fo otnote to state that HIV and/or hepatitis 
testing with be performed on a country -by-country 
basis, according to local guidelines if required by 
[CONTACT_25035]  
 Clarified that walking index joint pain NRS scores are 
recorded by [CONTACT_941] p atient at home and not onsite at the 
pre-randomization visit  
The laboratory Testing text has bee n corrected to state that ESR 
testing will be performed at the site using kits provided by [CONTACT_712369].  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Testing  
Corrected the text describing the Healthcare Resource 
Utilization Questionnaire to state that the sites (not the patients) 
will complete the questionnaire.  Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  Healthcare Resource

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 6 of 93 
CONFIDENTIAL  Amendment 3 Global  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to incorporate an urgent safety measure, which 
requires discontinuing the 3 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) and 6 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) dose 
regimens. The recommendation by [CONTACT_9572] (DMC) to 
discontinue these dose regimens was made following a review of unblinded data from an ongoing 
study in the fasinumab phase 3 osteoarthritis pro gram (R475 -PN-1523) and was based on an 
imbalance in clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral 
edema, arthralgia and a trend towards early fractures in the 6 mg Q8W group.  Based on the 
independent DMC review,  study of lower dose levels (eg, 1 mg Q4W) may continue to be 
evaluated in this population. With this amendment, patients randomized to the 3  mg Q4W or 6  mg 
Q8W dose regimens will be permanently discontinued from study drug but encouraged to 
otherwise comp lete all remaining study visits and study procedures in the follow up period and the 
end of study phone call.   
Amendment 2CA (obsolete)  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate health authority feedback.  This amendment 
was not implemented.  
Amendm ent 2 (obsolete)  
The purpose of this amendment was to incorporate Ethics Committee feedback, to make edits for 
clarity and to ensure consistency across the program, and to make minor corrections. This 
amendment was not implemented.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc .  Page 15 of 93 
CONFIDENTIAL  Prior to randomization, patients will undergo screening procedures, 
including X -ray of the shoulders, hips, and knees, and magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the index and contralateral joints must be performed and 
assessed by [CONTACT_11343].  In addition, any knee or hip joint 
with a K -L score of ≥[ADDRESS_968997] 4 weeks.  
Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period. The 
pre-randomization visit will be 7  to 10 days before randomization. During 
the pre -random ization visit patients will discontinue and/or undergo a 
washout of their standard -of-care pain medications for OA.  All pain 
medications, except for the study -provided rescue medication 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol), will be discontinued.  
Randomization  
Patients will be randomized on day 1 (baseline) in a 2:1:1:1 ratio to receive 
1 of the following:  
 Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W  
 Diclofenac 75 mg oral, twice daily  
 Celecoxib 200  mg oral once daily  
 Placebo  
Randomization will be stratified according to the affected index  joint (hip 
or knee), the K -L score (2 to 3, or 4) at the screening visit, and geographical 
region.  
Treatment  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  24), patients will be 
permitted to use only acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication.  
Patie nts will record their use of acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary.  
The study visits during the treatment period will include 1 phone visit on 
day 15 (±3  day).  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed and potential events of 
adjudicated arthropathy  (AA) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction 
will be monitored.  
Follow -up 
After the end of treatment, follow -up of patients will continue for an 
additional [ADDRESS_968998] undergo joint replacement (JR) surgery during the study, 
he or she will be asked to complete pre -operative imaging and to undergo 
post-surgery follow -up. 
End of study Phone Contact  
A phone contact [CONTACT_712370] [ADDRESS_968999] to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is 
on a wait list for JR surgery).  Patients who had an A A will have an MRI 
performed of the affected joint(s).

CONFIDENTIAL   Rescue Treatment:  During the 24 -week treatment period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be 
the only study -provided rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for 
OA pain is inadequate, or in the event of other pain (eg, headache) or fever, 
1 to 2 tablets/capsules of acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken no less 
than [ADDRESS_969000] of care.  The 
maximum daily dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2 500 mg 
(500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in countries where 500  mg strength 
tablets/capsules are available, or 2600  mg (325 mg x 8 tablets/capsules) in 
countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are available.

Procedures and Assessments  At the screening visit, patients will provide informed consent, medical 
history, and medication history.  Determination of the K -L score of the knee 
or hip will be performed to establish a diagnosis of OA based on the 
American College of Rheumatology criteria using a K -L score cutoff of ≥2.  
Patients will be assessed for childbearing potential and complete a 
self-reported assessment of peripheral or central pain.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_712371], the PGA, the Numeric Rating Scale 
of the average walking index joint pain, the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level 
Questionnaire, the 36-item Short Form Survey , the Healthcare Resource 
Utilization Questionnair e, the Work Productivity and Activity 
Impairment -Osteoarthritis, and the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for 
Medication.  The WOMAC total and stiffness scores will also be evaluated.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each study visit during trea tment 
period and upon occurrence of any joint adverse events (AEs) .  Potential 
events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of 
worsening joint pain during the study and adjudication of pre -operative 
imaging for patients who undergo JR dur ing the conduct of the study.  
Potential events of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be 
monitored throughout the study through physical examination, AE 
reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of 
Autonomic Symptoms.  
Approx imately [ADDRESS_969001] to JR surgery (if patient underwent, is scheduled for, or is 
on a wait list for JR surgery). Pat ients who had an AA will have an MRI 
performed of the affected joint(s).  
Statistical Plan  Statistical Hypothesis  
There are [ADDRESS_969002] procedure will be applied to control for 
multiplicity and to maintain stud y-wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 
level for the hypotheses (Hi, i=1,…, 6 for fasinumab 1 mg Q4W) for the 
primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Justification of Sample Size  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week  24, 
an enrollment of [ADDRESS_969003] 99% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and physical function subscale 
scores (ie, absolute treatment difference  of 1.1 between fasinumab and 
placebo with a SD of 2.4). The assumed treatment difference and SD are 
based on results from study R475 -PN-1227.  The sample size will provide 
99% power to detect an effect size of 0.36 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment 
differenc e of 0.4 with a SD of 1.1, R475 -PN-1227).

CONFIDENTIAL  Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week 24, 
an enrollment of 600 patients per arm in the fasinumab 1 mg SC Q4W group 
and pooled NSAIDs group will provide approximately 92% power to det ect 
an effect size of 0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.51 with a SD of 2.3).  The sample size will provide 
95% power to detect an effect size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function 
subscale (ie, absolute treatment differe nce of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1) and 
79% power to detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment 
difference of 0.18 with a SD of 1.0).  
Statistical Methods  
Baseline demographic disease characteristics, including medical history  and 
exposure to st udy drug, will be summarized by [CONTACT_145423].  Continuous variables will be summarized with mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical or 
ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displa yed for each 
category.  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using multiple imputation 
approach with mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on 
the FAS with adjustment for missing data due to lack of efficacy or adverse 
events assumi ng the WOMAC scores would on average return to baseline 
values. The imputed data for patients discontinued from the study treatment 
due to lack of efficacy or AEs will be centered at the mean baseline value. 
The missing data for patients who discontinued t reatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption. Sensitivity 
analysis using tippi[INVESTIGATOR_712355] -at-random.  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints, the analysis method will be 
the same as that used for the primary variables.  For analysis of categorical 
variables in secondary endpoints, eg, proportions of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in the WOMAC  pain subscale scores at week 24, the Cochran 
Mantel Haenszel approach stratified by [CONTACT_712372] -response . 
Safety data including treatment -emergent adverse events  and 
treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest, vital signs, physical 
examinations, laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and anti -drug antibody

CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Chronic musculoskeletal pain  affects a large portion of the global population.  A significant cause 
of chronic musculoskeletal pain is due to osteoarthritis (OA).  Osteoarthritis is a progressive, 
chronic disease caused by [CONTACT_329100], which lead s to pain in 
the hips, knees, hands, feet, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  It is characterized by [CONTACT_73436], osteophyte formation at the joint 
margins, thickening of the joint capsule and mild synovitis.  Symptoms and disability increase 
with increasing age.  The prevalence of OA in patients aged 65 and older is 60% in men and 70% 
in women, and continually rising ( Sarzi -Puttini  2005). 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of treatment in patients with 
mild-to-moderate OA.  The efficacy of NSAIDs is well -documented, albeit modest, but their use 
is associated with a number of risks ( Bingham  2007 ) (Bjordal  2004 ) (Makarowski  2002 ) 
(Silverstein  2000 ).  The risks associated with long -term therapy with NSAIDs, in particular, have 
been well -characterized and include gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and increased risk of 
cardiovascular events ( Lanas  2011 ) (Trelle  2011 ).  Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs have 
limited efficacy in many OA patients; those with advanced OA typi[INVESTIGATOR_73384].  
Treatment guidelines for OA suggest that opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] s may be used in OA only if management with 
NSAIDs is ineffective, intolerable, or otherwise contraindicated ( American College of 
Rheumatology Subcommittee on Osteoarthritis Guidelines  2000 ).  Howev er, the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_329074], nausea and vomiting, constipation, and potential for 
abuse and dependence.  In addition, opi[INVESTIGATOR_73387], including drowsiness, dizzi ness, gastrointestinal intolerability, motor imbalance, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and even death. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_73388]. Moreover, there is no evidence to 
suppo rt superiority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_329076]. While the efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_73390] a short duration is supported by [CONTACT_73437] ( Smith  2016 ), long -term 
efficacy h as not been evaluated.  
Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for alternative treatment options to opi[INVESTIGATOR_329077] 
a more effective analgesic effect, particularly since there are a significant number of patients who 
are intolerant to or do not get ade quate pain relief from the currently available treatment options.  
Inadequate pain relief has a profound impact on the quality of life for millions of people worldwide 
with an associated substantial cost to society, including healthcare cost ( Salmon  2016 ) and loss of 
productivity ( Dibonaventura  2011 ). 
Neurotrophins are a family of peptide growth factors that play a role in the development, 
differentiation, survival and death of neuronal and non -neuronal cells ( Chao  2006 ).  Nerve growth 
factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and 
survival of both peripheral and central neurons during the development of the nervous system is 
well characterized ( Crowley  1994 ) (Smeyne  1994 ).  In the  adult, NGF is not required as a survival 
factor but acts as a pain mediator that sensitizes neurons ( Pezet  2006 ).  Nerve growth factor activity 
is mediated through 2 different membrane -bound receptors, the high -affinity tyrosine kinase type 
1 (TrkA) and the low -affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors.

CONFIDENTIAL  By [CONTACT_73438], the NGF/TrkA system appears to play 
a major role in the control of pain.  Administration of NGF has been show n to provoke pain in 
both rodents ( Lewin  1994 ) and humans ( McArthur  2000 ), while NGF antagonists have been 
shown to prevent hyperalgesia and allodynia in animal mode ls of neuropathic and chronic 
inflammatory pain ( Ramer  1999 ).  Humans with mutations in TrkA (hereditary sensory and 
autonomic neuropathy IV) or NGF (hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy V) h ave been 
identified with a loss of deep pain perception ( Einarsdottir  2004 ) (Indo 1996 ).  In addition, NGF 
is known to be elevated in the sy novial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other types 
of arthritis ( Aloe  1992 ) (Halliday  1998 ), and to be up -regulated in injured and inflamed tissues in 
conditions such as cystitis, prostatitis, and chronic headache ( Lowe  1997 ) (Miller  2002 ) 
(Sarchielli  2001 ). 
Fasinumab (also known as REGN475) is a fully -human high -affinity monoclonal antibody 
directed against NGF.  By [CONTACT_73439], fasinumab has the po tential to be effective 
in modulating NGF -associated pain without some of the adverse side effects of other analgesic 
medications, such as opi[INVESTIGATOR_73392].  Following an evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of the antibody in a single -ascending -dose first -in-human study (study  R475 -PN-0817), a 
proof -of-concept study evaluating the effect of fasinumab on pain in 217  patients with OA of the 
knee was completed (study R475 -PN-0901, see current edition of Fasinumab Investigator’s 
Brochure).  Three intrav enous (IV) doses of fasinumab were evaluated (0.03,  0.1, 0.3 mg/kg every 
8 weeks [Q8W]).  All  three doses, compared with placebo, were associated with statistically 
significant improvement in pain as evaluated by [CONTACT_73440], the Western Ontario and 
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Patient’s Global Impression of 
Change questionnaire.  Additionally, the R475 -PN-1227 study in patients with OA revealed 
significant efficacy in the WOMAC pain subscale score for each of the doses of fasinumab 
evaluated (1 mg, 3 mg, 6  mg, and 9  mg given every 4 weeks [Q4W]) compared with placebo (see 
current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure).   Results from recent clinical studies with other anti -
NGF antibodies, tanezumab ([COMPANY_007]) and fulranuma b (Janssen), also support the role of NGF in 
pain modulation in patients with pain due to OA of the knee and hip ( Brown  2012 ) (Hefti  2006 ) 
(Lane  2010 ) and in patients with chronic low back pain ( Katz  2011 ) (Kivitz  2013 ). 
In all clinical studies completed to date, fasinumab was generally well tolerated.  Arthralgia, joint 
swelling, peripheral edema, hypoesthesia, and myalgia were more frequently reported in 
fasinumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients.  In ne urological evaluations, 
abnormalities in vibration sense were more frequent in the fasinumab patients than in the placebo 
patients.  These adverse events (AEs) or physical examination abnormalities associated with 
fasinumab were generally mild to moderate in intensity and were transient (see current version of 
the Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from studies of tanezumab and fulranumab demonstrated these molecules were associated 
with an increased risk of destructive arthropathy (DA), a unique clinical form of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_73393].  
Analyses of the tanezumab data by [CONTACT_23662], defined by [CONTACT_73441] (JR), revealed tha t the risk of DA increases with 
tanezumab dose and is further increased with the concomitant use of chronic NSAIDs (>90  days) 
(Lane  2010 ).  Most cases of DA occurred in joints with a documented history of OA.

CONFIDENTIAL  Based on the potential risk of DA identified in tanezumab and fulranumab, the [LOCATION_002] (US) 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) placed this class of anti -NGF antibodies on clinical hold in 
2010.  Following a review of anti -NGF antibody clinical data in March 2012, the FDA de termined 
that clinical studies of anti -NGF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_712356].  To address concerns about potential events of DA, a risk -mitigation 
approach is also being implemented for all fasinumab  studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .  This 
approach includes sensitive, prospective, and rigorous radiologic screening for select changes in 
joint structure.  The patients who develop these changes, which are referred to throughout this 
document as adjudicated arthropathy (AA), are required to discontinue study therapy.  
Since the removal of the FDA clinical hold, Regeneron has conducted or initia ted several clinical 
trials of fasinumab. In all clinical studies to date, fasinumab was associated with a low rate of 
discontinuations due to adverse events. Patients treated with fasinumab generally had more 
frequent events than did placebo -treated patie nts of arthralgia, joint swelling, peripheral edema, 
altered peripheral sensation (eg, paresthesia, dysesthesia), and myalgia.  
In 2012, studies of other anti -NGF monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) identified adverse changes in 
the sympathetic nervous system of m ature animals of several species (rat and non -human primate).  
These effects include a reversible decrease in neuron volume.  To date, no statistically significant 
or consistent effects of fasinumab on the sympathetic nervous system have been detected in animal  
studies with up to 6 -months of treatment.  Nonetheless, based on the potential risk of sympathetic 
nervous system toxicity associated with these other anti -NGF mAbs in animal studies, a risk 
mitigation  approach is being implemented for all fasinumab studies, as outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
In the phase 2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the knee or hip 
(R475 -PN-1227), 26 AA  events occurred in 24  patients. There was an increase in AA events that 
appeared to be related to greater fasinumab dose. Although these events were milder than the 
severe DA events presented at the 2012 FDA Arthritis Advisory Committee, in consideration of 
the lack of an observed dose response for efficacy in OA, the benefit -risk ratio was deemed 
unfavorable for the fasinumab 6  mg Q4W and 9  mg Q4W doses in patients with OA, in comparison 
to the other fasinumab doses that were studied, (ie, 1  mg Q4W and 3  mg Q4W).  The dose regimens 
that were being evaluated in the phase 3 studies for OA pain in the knee or hip included 1 mg 
Q8W, 1 mg Q4W, 3 mg Q4W, and 6  mg Q8W.  In April 2018, the independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC) recommended discontinuing 6  mg Q8W and 3 mg Q4W (expected to have 
similar exposure to 6 mg Q8W) based on a review of unblinded data in an on -going study in the 
fasinumab phase 3 OA program (R475 -PN-1523). Subsequently a small Regeneron team reviewed 
the data and agreed with this recomme ndation.  The DMC noted imbalances in clinically relevant 
adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, arthralgia and a trend 
towards early fractures.  The phase [ADDRESS_969007] -of-care NSAID for moderate -to-severe pain due to OA of the hip or knee.

or hip treated for up to 24 weeks with fasinumab compared to placebo and compared 
to NSAIDs  
3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypothesis  
Based on results from previous clinical studies of fasinumab in patients with OA, fasinumab is 
expected to provide effective pain relief based on an improvement in the WOMAC pain sub -scale 
score and improved functionality based on the WOMAC physical function sub -scale.  
                                        VV-RIM-00048600-1.0 Approved - 11 Jul 2018 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_969008] a history of 
inadequate pain relief from acetaminophen/paracetamol and a history of intolerance to or 
inadequate pain relief from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (or are unwilling to take opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]) for OA pain management. 
This study will compare the efficacy and safety of fasinumab to placebo and to a pooled NSAID 
group of celecoxib or diclofenac, which are members of the class of NSAID medications 
commonly used for moderate -to-severe pain due to OA.  
The target study population was chosen because they currently have unmet medical needs with 
respect to incomplete pain control, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_712357].  This study will provide 
efficacy and safety data for OA patients exposed for up to 24 weeks to fasinumab, a pooled NSAID 
comparator gr oup (celecoxib or diclofenac), or placebo.  The study will be conducted with 
appropriate eligibility criteria to exclude patients who may be at risk for events of joint damage 
and sympathetic nervous system effects.  
Rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracet amol) will be made available for any patient with 
breakthrough pain.  Specific questionnaires and physical examinations will be employed to 
monitor for any events of arthralgia, worsening joint pain, altered peripheral sensation, AA, and 
sympathetic nervou s system effects.  
This study will enroll patients who have failed or are intolerant to opi[INVESTIGATOR_712358]/paracetamol.  As there are currently a limited number of therapeutic options 
available, enrollment of this study population support s equipoise with respect to randomization of 
patients to fasinumab or to placebo.  
The inclusion of a placebo treatment group is important to accurately determine the efficacy of 
fasinumab. Non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs are the most common medicatio ns used to treat 
pain due to OA. Therefore, comparison of fasinumab to the NSAIDs treatment group will aid in 
determining the efficacy of fasinumab compared to a frequently used and effective standard of 
care class of medications for OA, but that have asso ciated clinically significant AEs.  As celecoxib 
and diclofenac are commonly used and highly effective NSAIDs ( Ong 2007 ), they have been 
selected as comparator drugs for this study. As a widely studied, standard of care therapy for OA, 
NSAIDs will serve as an effective calibrator to best understand the potent ial therapeutic benefit of 
fasinumab in this study population.  
Inclusion of both the placebo group and the active treatment comparator group will be important 
to accurately estimate the risk of AEs, including the AEs of special interest of adjudicated 
arthropathy and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. All patients included in the study will 
have regular study visits and receive diagnostic procedures (ie, X -rays, magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI]) to evaluate their ongoing OA. Adverse event monitoring w ill be ongoing 
throughout the trial. A patient or investigator can choose to end participation at any time. Patients 
will have access to rescue medication, as appropriate. Therefore, the use of a placebo group is 
justified, as placebo -treated patients will  not be placed at significant risk.  
The patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_73443] (hip or knee), by [CONTACT_73444] -Lawrence 
(K-L) score (2 to 3, or 4), and by [CONTACT_73445].  The

3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Previous versions of this protocol randomized patients to receive fixed -dose, s ubcutaneous (SC) 
injections of 1  mg of fasinumab Q4W, 3  mg fasinumab Q4W, 6  mg fasinumab every 8  weeks 
(Q8W with alternating placebo injections at the monthly visits where fasinumab will not be given, 
to maintain the blind), celecoxib active comparator, di clofenac active comparator, or matching 
placebo. Based on April 2018 recommendations from an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC) that reviewed unblinded data from a different ongoing phase 3 study of fasinumab 
(R475 -PN-1523), the decision was made to discontinue further evaluation of fasinumab at 3 mg 
Q4W or 6 mg Q8W in the phase 3 program. This recommendation was based on an imbalance in 
clinically relevant adverse events including time to total joint replacement, peripheral edema, 
arthralgia and a  trend towards fractures.   Under amendment 3  global , all patients previously 
randomized to 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W under an earlier version of the protocol were discontinued 
from study drug but encouraged to otherwise continue all protocol visits and study procedures in 
the follow -up period and the end of study phone call.  
Clinical trial data, including PK data, that support selection of these fasinumab doses include those 
from the phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers (R475 -PN-0817 and TDU -[ZIP_CODE]), the R475 -PN-
0901 phase 2 proof -of-concept study in patients with pain due to OA of the knee, the R475 -PN-
1227  phase 2/[ADDRESS_969010] IV dose 
(1 mg/kg).  The occurrence of neurosensory AEs, which were transient and non -severe, led to the 
decision to refrain from escalating above the 1  mg/kg IV dose and instead, to expand enrollment 
of the 1  mg/kg IV cohort.  
In the R475 -PN-0901 pha se 2 proof -of-concept study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to 
OA of the knee, multiple IV doses of up to 0.3  mg/kg administered Q8W demonstrated efficacy 
with regard to pain relief and were well tolerated in Caucasian subjects.  All 3  doses of fasi numab 
(0.03 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, and 0.3 mg/kg IV Q8W) were associated with greater improvement 
compared with placebo in walking index knee pain, standardized total WOMAC score, WOMAC 
subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and Patient’s Global Impression o f Change.  However, it 
was noted that pain relief had the slowest onset with the lowest (0.03  mg/kg) dose.  
In the R475 -PN-1227 phase  2/3 study of fasinumab in patients with pain due to OA of the hip or 
knee, all SC doses (1  mg, 3  mg, 6 mg, and 9  mg Q4W) demonstrated efficacy in pain relief and 
physical function measures, based upon WOMAC pain and physical funct ion scales assessed after 
16 weeks of treatment. Considering the relative lack of an observed dose response for efficacy and 
the increased risk of AA with both the 9  mg and 6  mg Q4W doses, the latter doses are no longer 
being studied. Neuromuscular AEs, su ch as arthralgia and paresthesia, were reported more 
frequently in fasinumab treated patients than in placebo -treated patients, though these events were 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_712359]. The efficacy and safety data from the 1  mg and 3 mg Q4W 
dose r egimens in R475 -PN-1227 supported the previous dose selection of 1  mg and 3 mg Q4W

MRI will be performed on any knee or hip joint with a K -L score of ≥3.  Randomization visits 
cannot occur until there is c onfirmation from the central imaging vendor that there are no 
exclusionary findings on the X -rays and any required MRIs. During the screening period, all 
patients will continue to take their current treatment regimen for OA pain, which must include use 
of an oral NSAID on a regular basis, defined as approximately [ADDRESS_969016]

Patients eligible for the study will complete a pre -randomization period, during which all pain 
medication, except for the study -provided rescue medication (acetaminophen/paracetamol), will 
be discontinued.  The pre -randomization visit will be 7  to 10 days  (7 days with a +3 day window) 
before randomization.  Patients will discontinue and/or undergo a washout of, their standard -of-
care pain medications for OA during the pre -randomization period.  As needed, patients may take 
acetaminophen/paracetamol for pai n relief according to the regional standard -of-care (see 
Section  7.2 for details).  Acetaminophen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to 
the randomization visit.

Re-testing During Screening or Pre -randomization  
An assessment that fails to meet eligibility criteria may be repeated once within the  screening or 
pre-randomization period when approved by [CONTACT_329104]: 1) the failure is believed by [CONTACT_269506] a 
condition that would resolve or could be treated, or 2 ) a laboratory value minimally exceeds the 
cut-off value and is not clinically relevant. Only the assessments that did not meet the eligibility 
criteria require repetition, if done within the screening period or pre -randomization period. Patients 
may not r epeat any assessments if they do not meet the WOMAC criteria or have orthostatic 
hypotension (defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the screening or pr e-randomization visit.  
Rescreening Due to Screen Failure  
Rescreening can be completed for patients who fail to meet the screening visit window 
requirements or who are unable to complete all imaging assessments within the specified screening 
period.  Patien ts who are rescreened after the pre -randomization window must be declared screen 
failures, be registered in the interactive web response system (IWRS) as a new patient with a new 
identification number, and then repeat all screening procedures, with the exc eption of imaging 
assessments. Any imaging assessments would need to be repeated only if they were taken more 
than [ADDRESS_969017] 
orthostatic hypotension (defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) during the screening or pre -randomization 
visit.  
5.1.3.  Randomizati on 
Patients will be randomized on day 1 (baseline) to 1 of the following treatment groups:  
 Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and diclofenac 75 mg oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placeb o SC Q4W, celecoxib 200  mg oral once daily, and NSAID -
matching placebo oral once daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
Patients will receive treatment as described in Section  7.1.  The method of treatment assignment 
is described in Section  7.5. 
5.1.4.  Treatment Period  
During the treatment period (day  1 through week  24), patients will be permitted to use only 
acetaminophen/paracetamol as rescue medication. The study visits during the treatment period will 
include 1 phone visit on day  15 (±3  days). Patien ts will record their use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol in a diary. Patients should discontinue use of acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol at least 24 hours prior to the start of study visits in order to minimize the confounding 
effects of the rescue medication on ef ficacy measurements.  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_73450], the PGA, the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) of the average walking index joint

6.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continuation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures).  An excessive rate of withdrawals would render  the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients should be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete study 
assessments, as described in Section  8.1.3 .

CONFIDENTIAL  7. STUDY TREATMENTS  
7.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
Study drug in this stu dy includes fasinumab, NSAID (diclofenac or celecoxib), and their matching 
placebo.  Fasinumab and its matching placebo are SC study drug. NSAID (diclofenac or celeoxib) 
and its matching placebo are oral study drug.  
Fasinumab drug product is supplied for t his study in the following concentrations:  
 Fasinumab 2 mg/mL: Each 1 mL single use pre -filled syringe delivers 0.5 mL of a 
2 mg/mL solution (1 mg dose) of study drug  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo: Each 1 mL single use pre -filled syringe delivers 0.5  mL 
of placebo solution  
 Celecoxib (200 mg capsules), diclofenac (75 mg capsules) and NSAID -matching 
placebo capsules will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. All NSAIDs and NSAID -matching 
placebo will be over -encapsulated to preserve the blind.  
Patients will be randomized 2 :1:1:1 to receive 1 of the following treatment regimens:  
 Fasinumab 1  mg SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and diclofenac 75 mg oral, twice daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W, celecoxib 200  mg oral on ce daily, and NSAID -
matching placebo oral once daily  
 Fasinumab -matching placebo SC Q4W and NSAID -matching placebo oral, twice daily  
All patients will receive SC injections of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo.  All SC 
injections will be in the abdome n, thigh or upper arm.  Patients will be observed in the clinic for 
approximately [ADDRESS_969031] be given within ±7 days from the scheduled dose date.  If the window 
is missed, the SC dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo should not be administered, 
however, the oral dose of NSAID or NSAID -matching placebo should be dispensed.  The next SC 
dose of fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo should be administered at the next scheduled 
dosing date.  
Detailed instructions for study drug dose administration are provided in the phar macy manual.  
7.2. Rescue Treatment  
During the 24 -week treatment period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will be the only study -provided 
rescue medication.  In the event that pain relief for OA pain is inadequate, or in the event of other 
pain (eg, headache) or fever , 1 to 2 tablets/capsules of acetaminophen/paracetamol may be taken 
                                        VV-RIM-00048600-1.0 Approved - 11 Jul 2018 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_969032] of care.  The maximum daily 
dose during the treatment and follow -up periods is 2500  mg (500 mg x 5 tablets/capsules) in 
countries where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, or 2600  mg (325  mg x 8 
tablets/capsules) in countries where 325  mg strength tablets/capsules are available (eg, North 
America).  Where 500  mg strength tablets/capsules are available, the highes t individual single dose 
is 1 gram. Where 325 mg tablets/capsules are available, the highest individual single dose is 
650 mg.  
In order to prevent severe liver damage, patients should be cautioned to avoid consumption of 
alcoholic beverages while on aceta minophen/paracetamol. Patients should also be cautioned not 
to take rescue medication at intervals of fewer than 4 hours and to take no more than the maximum 
allowable single dose (1 to 2 tablets/capsules) or maximum allowable total daily dose.  
Acetaminop hen/paracetamol must not be taken within 24 hours prior to scheduled study visits 
during the treatment period in order to minimize the confounding effects of rescue medication on 
efficacy assessments. Use of acetaminophen/paracetamol as study -provided resc ue medication 
during the treatment period will be reported daily by [CONTACT_712375]. During the treatment 
period, the acetaminophen/paracetamol will be sourced by [CONTACT_712376]. Acetaminophen/paracetamol 
accountability will be conducted at each study visit starting at the baseline visit and continuing 
through the week 24 visit.  
During the 20 -week follow -up period, acetaminophen/paracetamol will not be provided by [CONTACT_73460].  If acetaminophen/paracetamol is used, dosing instructions will be the same 
as during the treatment period including the maximum allowed daily dose. Use of 
acetaminophen/paracetamol will be captured as a concomitant medication during t he follow -up 
period.  
7.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
7.3.1.  Dose Modification  
Dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
7.3.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Study drug may be temporarily or permanently discontinued due to medical need, as determined 
by [CONTACT_093], medical monitor, or the sponsor and according to the study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] 
(Section  5.1.7 ). 
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug will be encouraged to remain in the study 
and to complete all study assessments.  Patients who agree and thus do not withdraw from the 
study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per Table  1. 
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt  to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete an early termination visit (Section  8.1.3 ). 
Patients who discontinue from study drug prior to s tudy completion due to an AA (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) should return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.

he/she will be discontinued from study drug and asked to return to the study site for a pre -operative 
visit and for follow -up safety evaluations (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Preoperative imaging 
(X-ray and MRI) will be obtained and submitted to the independent adjudication committee for 
review to ensure that an AA event is not in occurrence.  Instructions for the submission process 
are provided in the study manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of any of the following : 
 A patient who is currently enrolled under an earlier version of this protocol must be 
immediately discontinued from study drug, undergo all end  of treatment visit 
assessments and move directly into the 20 -week safety follow -up period under this 
version of the protocol, if they meet any of the following conditions that were excluded 
after re -evaluating the safety profile of NSAIDs:  
a) They have a known medical history (at any time) of peripheral vascular disease, 
transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, or documented atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; or  
b) They have a known GFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or, 
c) They are currently taking combination therapy of a diuretic with either an ACE 
inhibitor or ARB  (Note: Patients may remain  in the study if they are willing and 
able to change their antihypertensive regimen such that they are no longer on a 
combination of a diuretic with either an angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)  
 A patient who  was randomized under an earlier version of the protocol to 3  mg SC 
Q4W or 6 mg SC Q8W fasinumab  
 A patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_73407] a neurologist’s examination and graded by [CONTACT_712377] t as at 
least moderate peripheral neuropathy  limiting activities of daily living,  ie, grade ≥2 
according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.4; study 
sites should use CTCAE v.4 criteria throughout the study for consistency  
 Evidence  of pregnancy  
 A patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_73408]  
 Continued non -compliance with protocol -defined maximum  
acetaminophen/paracetamol use (with a maximum daily dose of 2500  mg [countries 
where 500  mg s trength tablets/capsules are available] or 2600  mg [countries where 
325 mg strength tablets/capsules are available]) during the treatment and follow -up 
periods, after appropriate counseling

- Adjudicated arthropathy, as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
- Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction , as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
 Hepatotoxicity.  Study dr ug should be discontinued if the following are observed:  
1. Total bilirubin (TBL) >2x ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5, and  
2. ALT or AST >3x  ULN, and  
3. No other cause for [ADDRESS_969034], and TBL elevations may include alcoholic hepatitis, 
autoimmune hepatitis, non -alcoholic hepatitis, heritable diseases (Gilbert's 
Syndrome), heart failure, and viral hepatitis.  
NOTE:  Study drug may be withheld in patients who do not meet criteria for 
permanently discontinuing st udy drug, until an alternative cause for drug -induced 
liver injury can be determined.  The patient may be re -challenged if an alternative 
cause for elevated liver function tests is found and the liver function tests return to 
baseline, but only after discu ssion with the sponsor.  
 Systemic hypersensitivity reaction deemed by [CONTACT_7281] 
 Gastrointestinal bleeding, acute coronary syndrome  
 Any other medical need, as determined by [CONTACT_093]  
 Sponsor decision  
 Patient decision  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug may be temporarily discontinued due to medical need, as determined by [CONTACT_1275]. Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or fasinumab -matching placebo) will be 
temporarily w ithheld while awaiting imaging adjudication for worsening joint pain or when 
routine imaging suggests adjudicated arthropathy and prompts the need for additional imaging (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), or for patients who are determined to have orthostatic hypotension or determined 
to have new or worsening symptoms suggestive of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction while 
awaiting evaluation by a specialist ( see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Patients may continue to take NSAID or 
NSAID -matching placebo during this time. Subcutaneous study drug (fasinumab or 
fasinumab -matching placebo) should not be re -started until the next study visit unless 
imaging/evaluation results are available within the current visit window. If oral study drug is 
temporarily discontinued by [CONTACT_093], patients may continue to take SC stu dy drug during 
this time.

7.7.2.  Permitted Medications and Procedures  
Patients receiving chronic medication therapy must be on a stable dose of such medication for at 
least the [ADDRESS_969040] 4  weeks prior to the screening visit and 
throughout the planned duration of t he patient’s participation in the study.  
Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/5 -ASA (up to 150  mg/day) for cardiac prophylaxis is permitted. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol taken acutely for treatment of non -OA pain is permitted; however, 
the total daily dosage limits cannot be ex ceeded, regardless of the reason for 
acetaminophen/paracetamol use.  During the pre -randomization and treatment periods, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be captured in the diary; use for relief of pain other than pain 
due to OA will be reported in the d iary as “other”. During the screening and follow -up periods, 
acetaminophen/paracetamol taken for any reason should be reported as concomitant medication.

1. Patients who discontinue study medication before week 24 will be encouraged to follow 
the visit schedule through the remainder of the study. If a p atient chooses to end study 
participation, he or she will be asked to return to the clinic as soon as possible for an early 
termination visit. Imaging assessments need to be repeated if it has been >[ADDRESS_969044] imaged. If it has been  ≤30 days since imaging assessments were 
completed, imaging assessments may be completed at the discretion of the investigator.  
2. HIV and/or hepatitis testing will be performed on a country -by-country basis, according to 
local guidelines if required by [CONTACT_712378]  
3. Only for patients who provide written informed consent for the optional genomics 
sub-study.  The sample should be collected at the day 1 (baseline/randomization) visit, but 
may be collected at any visit during the study a fter a patient has been randomized.  
4. At the screening and pre -randomization visits, study staff will review the “Participating in 
a Research Study: What You Need to Know” brochure and the “Reporting Your Pain” 
brochure with patients to ensure they understan d what a clinical study is and how to report 
their pain accurately. At subsequent visits, patients will be asked to review the “Reporting 
Your Pain ” brochure themselves.  At any time during the conduct of the study, patients 
may require retraining by [CONTACT_464] . 
5. Subcutaneous study drug administration will be the last procedure at each dosing visit, and 
will be done after all laboratory, PK, ADA and r esearch samples have been collected and 
all study assessments performed. Patients will be observed in the clinic for approximately 
1 hour after SC study drug is administered.  
6. Use of study -provided rescue medication will be recorded daily using diaries. 
Acetaminophen/paracetamol use will be reported from pre -randomization visit to week  24. 
7. Patients will complete the WOMAC pain subscale for both hips and knees at the screening 
visit. Then, the WOMAC Full Survey will be completed only for the index joint at 
subsequent visits.  
8. Walking index joint pain NRS score will be recorded by [CONTACT_712379], starting during the pre -randomization period through week 24. Walking index joint 
pain NRS score will be recorded by [CONTACT_73468] [ADDRESS_969045] be received before a patient can be randomized.

joint with worsening or exacerbation of pain beyond the fluctuations in pain typi[INVESTIGATOR_712361]'s OA. This imaging will be submitted to the adjudication committee for review.  
13. In the event that a patient must undergo joint arthroplasty during the study, the patient will 
complete the pre -operative JR study visit ( Table  1) and the procedures outlined in the 
schedule of events for joint arthroplasty follow -up ( Table  2).  The pre -operative 
questionnaire would be the Knee Society for knee replacements and the Harris Hip Score 
questionnaire for hip replacements.  The pre -operative visit should be completed before 
joint arthroplasty if at all possib le.  Pre -operative imaging will be performed and submitted

sponsor (or designee ) within [ADDRESS_969060] reports may 
also be requested.  
In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE after the patient completes the follow -up period 
(week 44)/early termination visit, the following will apply:  
 SAE with an onset within 30 days of the e nd of the follow -up period (week 44)/early 
termination visit - the SAE will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should 
make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE with an onset day greater than 30 days from the end of the follow -up period (week 
44)/early termination visit - only SAEs deemed by [CONTACT_50460] -related 
will be reported to the sponsor.  The investigator should make every effort to obtain 
follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related SAE until the event is 
considered chronic and/or stable.  
 SAE reported by [CONTACT_712384] -related will be reported to the sponsor. The inves tigator should 
make every effort to obtain follow -up information on the outcome of a drug -related 
SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable.  
9.4.3.  Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug:  Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2  times 
the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if 
associated with an AE  
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within [ADDRESS_969061] 
dose of study drug.  Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient 
and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an 
SAE.  Outcome for all pregnancies should b e reported to the sponsor.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest:   All AESI, serious and non -serious, must be reported within

Refer to the study manual for the procedures to be followed.  
9.4.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study  
All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the study must be  reported to the sponsor’s 
medical monitor within [ADDRESS_969063]  finding should be reported as an 
AE include:  
 the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or  
 the test result leads to a change in dosing (outs ide of protocol -stipulated dose 
adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug 
treatment, or other therapy  
Contact [CONTACT_712385], although it does not meet any of the above criteria.  
Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an 
AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting a s an 
AE. 
Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlined 
in Section  9.5.1 . 
9.4.6.  Follow -up 
Adverse  even t information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit.  
Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or 
stable.  
9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality  
9.5.1.  Evaluation of Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:

CONFIDENTIAL   Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning 
level.  It may be an annoyance.  Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief 
of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient.  
 Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health.  
It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  Treatment for symptom may be needed.  
 Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functionin g or incapacitation and is a 
definite hazard to the patient ’s health.  Treatment for symptom may be given and/or 
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description of grade):  
 Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort t o touch; ≤5 cm of 
erythema or induration that does not interfere with activity  
 Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or 
interferes with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or 
induration or induration that interferes with activity  
 Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily 
activity; significant discomfort at rest; >10 cm erythema or induration; prevents daily 
activity; requires emergency room visit  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; necrosis or exfoliative 
dermatitis  
9.5.2.  Evaluation of Causality

9.6. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice  (GCP).  Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion.  The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites.  The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for 
the emerging safety profile of the  compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] (eg, 
Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management).  Safety 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic cumulative aggr egate basis.  
9.6.1.  Monitoring Adverse Events of Special Interest  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adjudicated Arthropathy  
Adjudicated arthropathy is an umbrella term that encompasses the following conditions:  
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_73405] 1 and 2  
 Subchondral insufficiency fractures  
 Primary osteon ecrosis  
In addition, AAs will be evaluated to determine if they meet the criteria for destructive arthropathy . 
Potential events of AA will be monitored via clinical signs and symptoms of worsening joint pain 
during the course of the study (eg, by [CONTACT_73487], the joint pain questionnaire 
and imaging) as well as scheduled imaging and pre -operative imaging, if a patient requires a joint 
replacement during the study.  
Clinically significant worsening of joint pain during the course of this stud y is defined as a 
worsening of pain in any joint that occurs in spi[INVESTIGATOR_73423], is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_329090], and is at 
least 2 weeks duration (or less than 2 weeks if deemed clinically significant at the discretion of the 
investigator).  
If a patient reports an increase in pain as described above, study drug administration will be 
withheld while imaging of the affected joint, as well as any additional imaging deemed appropriate 
to understand the cause of the worsening pain, is performed (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  A decision to

CONFIDENTIAL  perform imaging after patient report ed worsening of joint pain will be documented in the 
respective case report form (CRF) page. Images, along with any other radiographic evaluation, 
will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee for review (Section  5.3.2 ).  The investigator may 
consider aspi[INVESTIGATOR_689803].  
If routine imaging suggests the presence of one of the types of AA, study drug administration will 
be withheld.  Any additional imaging deemed appropriate will be obtained.  The images, along 
with results of any other radiographic evaluation, will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee 
for review ( Section  5.3.2). 
If the adjudication does not confirm the presence of AA, according to the adjudication criteria, 
study drug may be restarted.  
Study drug dos ing will be permanently discontinued for patients with findings that suggest AA; 
the patients will be referred for orthopedic consultation. If presence of AA is confirmed by [CONTACT_21662], the case must be reported as an AESI (Section  9.3.3 , Section  9.4.3 ).  
Any patient whose study dr ug is discontinued due to an AA should be encouraged to return to the 
clinic for all remaining study visits.  Prior to the scheduled JR, the patient should complete the pre -
operative study visit and, after the JR, should complete the week  4 and week  20 pos t-operative 
study visits (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , Table  2).  Pre -operative images, along with any other radiographic 
evaluation will be submitted to the Adjudication Committee for review (Section  5.3.2 ). 
Details of data collection for adjudication of events will be provided in the adjudication charter.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sympathetic Nervous System Dysfunction  
Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will be monitored throughout the study through physical 
examination, AE  reporting, assessment of orthostatic hypotension, and the Survey of Autonomic 
Symptoms (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  New onset or worsening of signs and symp toms of autonomic 
dysfunction will be evaluated by [CONTACT_093].  Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction will 
only be diagnosed after consultation with an appropriate specialist, such as a neurologist and/or 
cardiologist.  
In cases where new or worsenin g symptoms consistent with sympathetic nervous system 
dysfunction are moderate to severe or are clinically significant and do not resolve or return to 
baseline in 2  weeks (or less at the discretion of the investigator), study drug will be withheld and 
the patient will be referred to a specialist. If the evaluation by [CONTACT_73489], study drug may be restarted. If the specialist’s 
evaluation does reveal sympathetic nervous system dysfunctio n then study drug will be 
permanently discontinued and the case will be reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ). 
Orthostatic hypotension may be a manife station of sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.  If a 
patient is determined to have orthostatic hypotension, study drug should be withheld and the AE 
should be entered in the CRF.  The following procedures should be followed:  
 If the patient is symptomat ic and a clinical explanation for orthostatic hypotension is 
identified (such as a new medication or dehydration due to exercise or illness or 
excessive heat exposure), study drug will be withheld, and the patient should return to 
the study site for an uns cheduled visit in 1 to 10 days for an unscheduled assessment 
of orthostatic hypotension.

 If the specialist’s evaluation does not reveal new onset sympathetic nervous 
system dysfunction, including symptoms of bradyc ardia (lightheadedness), 
orthostatic hypotension (lightheadedness on standing), syncope, absence of 
sweating in conditions where sweating would be expected, or if the 
specialist’s evaluation identifies an alternative cause, such as initiation of a 
new medi cation known to cause orthostasis, then study drug may be given

[IP_ADDRESS].  Peripheral Sensory Adverse Events  
Altered peripheral sensation (eg, paraesthesia and hypoaesthesi a) is an important identified risk 
with fasinumab (see Investigator’s Brochure) and other anti -NGF compounds.  Any peripheral 
sensory AE that, per the investigator’s judgment, requires a neurology or other specialty 
consultation must be reported as an AESI .  If any peripheral sensory event persists for [ADDRESS_969064] be 
reported as an AESI (Section  9.4.3 ).

An end of study phone contact [CONTACT_689841] [ADDRESS_969065] undergone or are sche duled for JR surgery as 
described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . Any elective JR surgery planned before completion of the ICF would 
be part of the exclusion cr iteria and would not be considered an AE.  
After signing of the ICF, report JR surgery as an AESI i f the JR surgery is an elective event that is 
not associated with a new/worsening AE.  
Do not report JR surgery as an AE/AESI if the JR surgery is for the trea tment of a new or worsening 
AE. In this case, the new or worsening AE should be the reported AE/AESI term.  
9.7. Investigator Alert Notification  
Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as 
in any other c linical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant 
requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s 
Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relat ionship to the 
medicinal/study drug).  
10. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study.  The SAP may 
be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make 
chan ges to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned 
analyses.  The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked.  
Analysis variables are listed in Section  4. 
10.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
There are [ADDRESS_969066] procedure ( Bretz  2009 ) will  be applied to control for 
multiplicity and to maintain study -wise Type I error rate at two -sided 0.05 level for the hypotheses 
(Hi, i=1,…, 6 for fasinumab 1 mg Q4W) for the primary and key secondary endpoints.  The 
primary hypothesis will be tested at 0.05 level.  If the primary hypothesis is rejected, the alpha 
level will be reallocated to other hypotheses according to the pre -specified procedure.  The testing 
will stop when no hypothesis can be rejected at any step.  Details will be provided a priori in the 
SAP.  
 H1: There is no treatment difference between fasinum ab 1 mg Q4W and placebo in 
WOMAC pain or physical function subscale scores at week 24 versus there is treatment 
difference in WOMAC pain and physical function subscale scores at week  24

proportion of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores 
at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in proportion of patients with ≥30% 
improvement in WOMAC pain at week 24  
 H4: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and NSAIDs in the 
WOMAC p ain subscale scores at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in 
WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 24

WOMAC physical function subscale scores at week 24 versus there i s treatment 
difference in WOMAC physical function subscale scores at week 24  
 H6: There is no treatment difference between fasinumab 1 mg Q4W and NSAIDs in 
Patient Global Assessment score at week 24 versus there is treatment difference in 
Patient Global Ass essment score at week 24  
10.2. Justification of Sample Size  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to week 24, an enrollment of 
[ADDRESS_969068] 99% po wer to detect an effect size of 0.46 in the WOMAC pain and physical function 
subscale scores (ie, absolute treatment difference of 1.1 between fasinumab and placebo with a SD 
of 2.4).  The assumed treatment difference and standard deviation (SD) are based on results from 
study R475 -PN-1227. The sample size will provide 99% power to detect an effect size of 0.36 in 
PGA (ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.4 with a SD of 1.1, R475 -PN-1227).  
Assuming a 2 -sided alpha level 0.05 and a 20% dropout rate up to w eek 24, an enrollment of 
600 patients in the fasinumab 1 mg Q4W group and the pooled NSAIDs group will provide 
approximately 92% power to detect an effect size of 0.22 in the WOMAC pain subscale 
(ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.51 with a SD of 2.3, [Schnitzer  2015 ]).  The sample size 
will provide 95% power to detect an effect size of 0.24 in WOMAC physical function subscale 
(ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.50 with a SD of 2.1, [ Schnitzer  2015 ]), and 79% power to 
detect an effect size of 0.18 in PGA (ie, absolute treatment difference of 0.18 with a SD of 1.0 
[Ekman  2014 ]). 
10.3. Analysis Sets  
10.3.1.  Efficacy Analysis Sets  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients  and is based on the treatment allocated 
(as randomized).  Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS including patients 
randomized to fasi numab 1 mg Q4W, NSAIDs, and placebo. Efficacy data from patients 
randomized to fasinumab 3 mg Q4W or 6 mg Q8W will not be included in the analysis, but will 
be summarized descriptively in separate tables.  
10.3.2.  Safety Analysis Set  
The safety analysis set (SAF) i ncludes all randomized patients who received any study drug; it is

CONFIDENTIAL  10.4.3.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy An alysis  
The primary efficacy variables will be analyzed using multiple imputation approach with 
mixed -effect model for repeated measure (MMRM) based on the FAS with adjustment for missing 
data due to lack of efficacy or AEs assuming the WOMAC scores would o n average return to 
baseline values. Data collected after discontinuing treatment up to week 24 will not be used in the 
primary efficacy analysis, but used in a treatment policy sensitivity analysis. The imputed data for 
patients discontinued from the stud y treatment due to lack of efficacy or AEs will be centered at 
the mean baseline value. The missing data for patients who discontinued treatment due to other 
reasons will be imputed under missing -at-random assumption.  
Missing data will be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets. Each imputed complete 
data set will be analyzed using the MMRM with terms for baseline score corresponding to the 
efficacy variable being analyzed, randomization strata (K -L category [2 to 3, or 4], index joint 
[knee, hip ], and geographical region), treatment (fasinumab 1 mg Q4W, NSAIDs or placebo), visit 
and treatment -by-visit interaction.  The MMRM will be performed using the MIXED procedure 
in Statistical Analysis System (SAS) with an unstructured covariance matrix to m odel the within -
patient errors.  Denominator degrees of freedom will be estimated using Kenward -Roger’s 
approximation.  The results from the 50 analyses will be combined using Rubin’s formulae (PROC 
MIANALYZE). The least -squares mean estimates for the mean  change from baseline to week 24, 
as well as the differences of the estimates between fasinumab [ADDRESS_969070] errors, p 
values and associated 95% confidence i ntervals, will be provided.    
Sensitivity analysis of treatment policy estimand for the co -primary endpoints will be performed 
using a similar analysis method as the primary efficacy analysis, including data collected after 
discontinuing treatment up to w eek 24. Sensitivity analysis using tippi[INVESTIGATOR_712365] -at-random. Multiple imputation will be based on monotone missing data structure  
of the change from baseline score using regression method. Monotone missing data structure will 
be achieved using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. After each imputation, a fasinumab 
patient's imputed data will subtract k (eg, 20%, 40%, 100%) times the tre atment effect at each 
corresponding time point. By [CONTACT_689842] k, the sensitivity analysis will 
explore the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], ie, the upper bound on the critical value of coefficient k at which 
conclusion from the primary analysis wil l be overturned (p>0.05). Sensitivity analyses using PPS 
will also be performed for the primary and selected secondary endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
For analysis of continuous secondary endpoints, the analysis method will be the same as that used 
for the primary variables.  For analysis of categorical variables in secondary endpoints, eg, 
proportions of patients with ≥30% improvement in the WOMAC pain subscale scores at week 24, 
the Cochran Mantel Haenszel approach stratified by [CONTACT_165571] s trata (K -L category [2 to 
3, or 4], index joint [knee, hip],  and geographical region) will be used with missing data considered 
as non -response .

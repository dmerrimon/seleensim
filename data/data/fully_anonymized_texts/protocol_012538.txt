1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be 
conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice 
(FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Specific Aims  and Hypothesis  
Purpose of the study : To assess the effect of metformin on inflammatory  
pathways  in subjects with cancer of the head and neck undergoing external 
beam radiation.  We  will use analysis of cytokines/chemokine profiles  expression 
and exosome profiles  in subjects that receive metformin during their radiation 
treatment.   
 
• Primary objective:  Assess the impact of metformin on 
cytokine/chemokine and exosomes  on blood and saliva during and after 
radiation .  
 
• Secondary objectives: Assess  safet y and tolerability of metformin  
treatment in subjects with head and neck cancer . Also, to assess the 
potential impact of metformin on the following:  xerostomia, dysphagia, 
mucositis, fatigue as measured by  [CONTACT_26740] – H&N35 , Xerostomia 
Score, mucosit is score  and Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI)  (See 
appendix) .   
 
1.2 Background and Rationale :   
Effects of Radiation on Normal Tissue and Systemic Effects  
 
Treatment for Head and Neck Cancer has used radiation as one of the foundational components to achieve expected cure rates.  Protocols have been well established to maximize tumor kill rate and minimize collateral damage to surrounding tissue, yet the effects of radiation on normal tissue remains profound in the head and neck region.  Oral mucositis , swallowing, xerostomia and fatigue 
are the main drivers that affect quality of life status post  treatment.   
 
Oral mucositis is a common, problematic, and painful complication of cancer therapy, in the regimens that include radiation therapy for the head and neck 
cancer
1. Oral mucositis is a treatment -induced morbidity that has substantial 
impact on day -to-day functioning. In addition to the common need for, and 
inadequate pain control with, narcotics, the profound clinical impact of oral mucositis also includes weight loss, difficulty eating and swallowing, dehydration, need for nutritional support, and reduced performance status
2, as well as 
secondary infections and diminished quality of life (QOL)3.  
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 10 
 
A majority of patients receiving combined chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) can be expected to d evelop severe (WHO Grade 3- 4) oral 
mucositis
4 and nearly all HNC patients receiving RT with concurrent cisplatin are 
expected to develop oral mucositis  (WHO Grade 2 or higher)  5. 
Standard chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck ( HNC ), 
whether in the post -operative or definitive setting, currently consists of intensity -
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus /minus  systemic therapy. The 
monoclonal antibody cetuximab has also been shown to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck c ancer  
6, and the combination 
of IMRT plus either single -agent cisplatin or single- agent cetuximab is currently 
being tested head- to-head for pat ients with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV) -related 
oropharyngeal cancer in the ongoing RTOG 1016 trial. In addition, two recently 
published Phase 3 studies of palifermin in patients receiving RT plu s single -agent 
cisplatin for HNC reported an overall incidence of severe (WHO Grade 3- 4) oral 
mucositis among placebo patients of 67% in one study and 69% in the other7,8. 
Oral mucositis prevention and management remains a substantial unmet need.  
 
Patients with HNC may also suffer the additional complications of short - and long 
term xerostomia, taste change, and trismus related to post -radiation fibrosis . 
McBride et al. demonstrated a significant improvement in rates of xerostomia, shorter durations of PEG tube dependence when comparing intensity -modulated 
radiation therapy (IMRT) vs conventional radiation therapy 
9.  Even though they 
found a significant  early benefit , late stage dysphagia persisted in 7-10% of 
patients at [ADDRESS_1036847] of radiation with some indication that 
circulating cytokines and chemokines are responsible for this phenomena .  
Increase in interleukin (IL- 1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and C -reacitve protein 
(CRP) have been found in patients with profound fatigue10.  Others have not 
been able to make association with inflammatory markers.  Xiao et al. found a strong correlation to fatigue and inflammatory markers  with gene transcripts 
related to NFkB.  We propose in this study to look at an entire pane l of 
inflammatory markers, utilizin g Luminex technology with the Milliplex MAP

1β, PDGF -AA, PDGF -AB/BB, RANTES, TGF -α, TNF -α, TNF -β, VEGF).  Another 
possible mechanism that has not been described is exosomes/microvesicle 
communication that can be found systemically released by [CONTACT_757343].   
Exosomes are small extra- cellular vesicles produced by [CONTACT_757344]11 and present in 
almost all biological fluids including blood, urine, ascites, CSF, serum and plasma, and in the culture medium of cell cultures
12. Currently exosomes are 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 11 
defined as 40- 150 nm diameter vesicles of endocytic origin, similar in size to 
viruses, with a bilayered lipid membrane, a cup shaped morphology, and 
densities ranging between 1.13- 1.19 g/mL12. 
Exosomes have recently emerged as important mediators in cell communication due to their enriched content in genetic material like mRNAs and non -coding 
RNAs
12.  The biogenesis of exosomes which involves the endosomal 
compartment sets them apart from other extracellular vesicles11.  Their molecular 
profile partly, but not completely, resembles that of the parental cell. The precise 
function of exosomes remains unknown13.  The leading theory is that exosomes 
are an integral  part of a complex, well -organized, form of information delivery that 
operates at short and long distances11. The content and number of exosom es 
generated likely change depending on whether cells are experiencing different stressors or stimuli
13. Tumor -derived exosomes transfer signals and convey 
information locally within the tumor microenvironment as well as to distant tissues and organs to facilitate tumor growth and metastasis. They are present in the circulation and have ready access to all parts of the body
11. 
Cytokines/chemokines are well established as molecules  that convey a 
phenotype of tissue behavior or biologic mechanis m.  They likewise are found in 
all bodily fluids and are secreted in times of stress.   
 
1.3 Preclinical Data:  
 
Metformin and its potential as radioprotective agent  
  
Metformin (N, N -dimethylbiguanide) is a biguanide  that is best known for its use 
as first line therapy for type II diabetes patients14.  Metformin specifically inhibits 
the complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain decreasing cellular respi[INVESTIGATOR_757327]
15,16. 
This triggers the activation of the energy sensor AMP -activated protein kinase 
(AMPK) that regulates cell metabolism and shifts it towards an energy -sparing 
state17. This leads to reduced hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal 
absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity thereby [CONTACT_757345].  It is an 
FDA approved medication for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus with extensive safety data. In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses <1500 mg daily; however, a lower recommended starting dose and gradual increased dosage is recommended to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. Extensive preclinical data now also support the effectiveness of metformin as an antin eoplastic and radioprotective agent
18.   
  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_757328]’s Efficacy for Radioprotection and Cancer 
Prevention:  
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036848] a cancer risk reduction of approximately 40% compared to diabetics  not treated 
with metformin
19,20.  Evans et al reported that the risk of subsequent cancer 
diagnosis was reduced in patients with type 2 diabetes who received metformin (with an odds ratio of 0.85 for any metformin exposure versus no metformin exposure)
21.  The protective effect increased with greater metformin exposure 
(measured as total dose prescribed or total duration of use).  
Current evidence from epi[INVESTIGATOR_757329].  Hadad et al demonstrated biomarker evidence for anti -
proliferative effects of  metformin in women with breast cancer by [CONTACT_757346]67 
and messenger RNA expression for PDE3B (critical regulator of cAMP levels that affect activation of AMPK)
22.  Similarly, Niraula et al showed short -term 
preoperative metformin with a dosing schedule of 500mg three times daily was well tolerated and resulted in clinical and cellular chang es consistent with 
beneficial anti -cancer effects with increased insulin sensitivity by [CONTACT_757347]
23.  Multiple clinical trials are currently evaluating the effect of metformin in 
combination with standard treatment in a variety of malignancies including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, lung, gynecologic, and prostate cancer.   
Anti-tumor effects by [CONTACT_757348] a radioprotectant that can help to protect normal tissues against the radiation toxicity.  At present, the only prophylactic 
radioprotector that has been approved by [CONTACT_757349], which is used for radioprotection against xerostomia by [CONTACT_757350]
24.  Metformin in conjunction with N-acetyl -cysteine or 
captopril resulted in a 2.4- 2.[ADDRESS_1036849] -treatment and that patients treated concomitantly with metformin 
returned to their baseline values sooner
25.  
 Our current animal model looking at ameliorating the effects of radiation utilizes a thiol modifying agent RTA 408 and metformin.  In unpublished data the group drinking metformin dissolved in water is healing wounds at a significantly faster rate then the control animals.   
  
Mechanism of Action for Metformin:  
Metformin inhibits oxidative phosphorylation by [CONTACT_757351] I enzyme NADH dehydrogenase.  The inhibition of mitochondrial complex activity may contribtue to ROS metabolism and the activation of AMP -
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 13 
activated protein kinase (AMPK) by [CONTACT_14424]. AMPK is a central cellular energy 
sensor, activation of which leads to suppression of many of the processes highly dependent on ample cellular adenosine triphosphate supply, including gluconeogenesis, protein and fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis, promoting catabolic processes such as fatty acid beta oxidation and glycolysis
26. 
AMPK activation potentially promotes survival after radiation, especially in a low nutrient environment found in human tumors
27. By [CONTACT_757352], metformin may  further protect tissues or cells against DNA damage and 
mutations28.  
  Preclinical studies and clinical trials support the view that metformin has anticancer properties
29-32 although the mechanism(s) underlying this effect are 
subject to debate. The purported mechanisms are numerous and include OXPHOS complex I inhibition, AMPK activation and insulin growth factor signaling
14,22,23,33. Several groups have shown that metformin’s ability to limit 
tumor growth in vivo  is dependent on mitochondrial complex I34. Complex I 
inhibition blocks mitochondrial -dependent production of reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) and adenosine triphosphase (ATP)35,36.  Catabolite access may determine 
susceptibility to metformin anti -tumor effects as some cancer cells grown in the 
absence of glucose and presence of glutamine are more affected by [CONTACT_757353]
29 . Metformin sensitivity is 
further determined by [CONTACT_757354] (OXPHOS) capacity
30. The decrease in ATP production results in the acti vation 
of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1) – adenosine monophosphate- activated protein 
kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway26-28.  Activation of this pathway usually occurs 
during times of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, and reciprocally, it can be suppressed in times of “over nutrition” and hyperglycemia.  AMPK is a key 
energy sensor that regulators metabolism in an attempt to maintain energy homeostasis
31.  The end result of blocking the LKB1- AMPK signaling pathway is 
a down- regulation of energy consuming biosynthetic processes including 
gluconeogenesis, protein and fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol biosynthesis, and promotion of catabolic processes such as fatty acid beta oxidation and glycolysis
32.  Metformin may also have activity that is independent of LKB1.   In 
LKB1 deficient cells, metformin is still able to affect the intracellular energy state
33.  Metformin also alters the mitochondrial redox state by [CONTACT_757355]34. Metformin reduces the mitochondrial citric 
acid cycle and induces aerobic glycolysis as well35. 
 Collectively these considerations highlight that metformin may have utility as a selective radiation protector of normal but tumor cells.   
 
1.4 Clinical Data  
Summary of results from clinical studies:   
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036850] shown that head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCC) h ave 
high mitochondrial OXPHOS metabolism in highly proliferative cells
29.  Also, 
there is high MCT4 expression in HNSCC cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and in carcinoma cells with low proliferation rates
29. MCT4 expression is a 
marker of pseudohypoxia, oxidative stress and enhanced glycolytic metabolism. We have demonstrated that there is metabolic coupling between highly proliferative carcinoma cells with high OXPHOS metabolism and low proliferative carcinoma cells and fibroblasts
29. 
 
Bikas et al. retrospectively studied the radioprotective effects of Metformin on 
RAI treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients by [CONTACT_757356] (CBC). The study used two arms. The Metformin group 
consisted of [ADDRESS_1036851] RAI 
treatment showed less of a decrease in white blood cell (WBC) count. The 
differences in WBC count between the two groups was highly statistically 
significant at all time points ( P< 0.0001, P<0.0027, and P< 0.0001, respectively). 
The most prominent decrease in WBC was in absolute neutrophil count. WBC 
levels of patient in the Metformin group were also sh own to recover to baseline 
levels more quickly25. 
 
Metformin not only likely has radioprotective effects but may also have anticancer effects as well which could impact effect of radioactive Iodine treatment. Retrospect ive studies have shown that diabetics treated with metformin have a 
cancer risk reduction of approximately 40% compared to diabetics not treated with metform in
30,31.  Other studies have also shown a reduction in the frequency 
of cancer with metformin us e32.  Evans et al  33 reported that the risk of 
subsequent cancer diagnosis was reduced in patients with type II diabetes who 
received metformin (with an odds ratio of 0.85 for any metformin exposure versus 
no metformin exposure).  The protective effect increased with greater metformin 
exposure (measured as total dose prescribed or total duration of use).  
 
Current evidence from epi[INVESTIGATOR_757330].  Hadad et al22 demonstrated biomarker evidence for 
anti-proliferative effects of metformin in women with breast cancer by [CONTACT_757357]67 and messenger RNA expression for PDE3B (critical regulator of cAMP levels that affect activation of AMPK).  Similarly, Niraula et a l
23 showed short -
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036852] it to reduce mitochondrial metabolism in carcinoma cells.  We want to investigate 
metformin’s effects on epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -stroma metabolic coupling and its abi lity to revert 
the high OXPHOS metabolism in carcinoma cells and revert the stroma to a less tumor permissive state in various cancers.  
 Secondary end point s will look at quality of life metrics including the EORTC QLQ 
– H&N35 , mucositis score,  the Multidimensional fatigue inventory  and the 
Xerostomia Questionnaire (XQ) all of which have been validated and used in 
multiple clinical studies to -date (Appendix) .   
 
1.[ADDRESS_1036853]:  
 Metformin is a biguanide or al antidiabetic drug. It inhib its hepatic glucose 
production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity thereby [CONTACT_757345].  It is an FDA approved medication for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus with extensive safety data. In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses <1500 mg daily; however, a lower recommended starting dose and gradual increased dosage is recommended to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. Metformin ’s main effect on cells is to 
decrease mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex I activity. Metformin treatment does not induce hypoglycemia. Metformin may represent a 
novel radioprotectant  therapy.  
1.6 Dose Rationale and Ri sk/Benefits  
Summary of known and potential risks and benefits, if any, to subjects:   
 Metformin’s most serious toxicity is lactic acidosis, occurring in three of 100,000 patient -years of use. Risk is significantly reduced when metformin use is avoided 
in those patients with hepatic, cardiac, or renal compromise . However, 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 16 
metformin’s risk of lactic acidosis may be overstated since the recent evaluation 
of metformin associated lactic acidosis cases from [ADDRESS_1036854] common 
toxicity, leading to cessation of therapy in less than 5% of individuals.  Metformin 
does not induce hypoglycemia.  The possible societal benefits are large since this 
will allow us to learn about the pharmacodynamic effects of metformin in normal 
tissue protection during radiation.   
 Description and justification for the route of administration, dosing regimen and treatment period:  
Metformin will be administered orally since this is the route of adm inistration 
currently approved by [CONTACT_1622]. Beginning one- two weeks prior to planned 
external beam radiation therapy, the drug will be initiated at a dose of 500mg orally daily for [ADDRESS_1036855] chosen our starting dose and escalation regimen to minimize side effects.  The chos en 
standing dose is based on metformin’s therapeutic range (minimal therapeutic dose in diabetic patients is 1500- 2000 mg a day)
28, 29. The time of planned 
exposure to metformin will be 8-10 weeks. We will allow a window of an 
additional 2 weeks in the event that there are delays in the treatment scheduling but no patients will receive metformin for more than 12 weeks .  
 Rules for dose modification: Toxicity monitoring, dose modification and 
treatment of complications:  
 Particular attention will be paid in the first three days of treatment. Patients will 
take 500mg/day for 3 days.  From day 4, 500mg twice daily and then in 3 days  
(Day 6)  dose escalation to 1000mg twice daily will be achieved.  A phone  call on 
the day of each dose escalation will be made in order to evaluate the tolerability of the dru g and also weekly thereafter.   Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_757358]

Potential risks:   
 There is a potential risk of development of side effects related to metformin administration. Most commonly reported side effects in 1- 5% of patients are 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 18 
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. An extremely low risk of lactic acidosis is 
present (0.001%) which is minimized by [CONTACT_757359], hepatic dysfunction, cardiac impairment, pulmonary impairment, or excessive alcohol use. There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality which will  be 
minimized as outlined in section 0. 
 Potential benefits:   
 Metformin may provide a radioprotective effect and mitigate the sequelae of 
external beam radiation.  Furthermore, metformin may alter tumor metabolism 
and improve outcomes in various cancers. This study is designed to evaluate whether the sequelae of radiation are mitigated by [CONTACT_757360].  With regards to cancer 
benefit, this  study is not designed to evaluate efficacy in cancer treatment and it 
is unknown if metformin improves outcomes in cancer. 
 
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1. To assess the capacity of metformin to alter the cytokine and exosome 
profile s.  
2. To assess the capacity of metformin to mitigate known side effects of external beam radiation therapy including inflammation, mucositis, dysphagia, xerostomia, and fatigue.  
 2.1 Primary Objective : 
 
We have chosen a cytokine/chemokine profile analysis as a surrogate marker of trending inflammatory reaction.  This response drives the severity of mucositis/xerostomia and acute radiation toxicity. The blood and saliva counts will be compared in the pre- treatment sample, during treatment samples and post 
treatment samples. Luminex technology with 40 cytokines markers will be used (Luminex technology with the Milliplex MAP Human Cytokine/chemokine

4.3 Gender/Minority/Pediatric Inclusion for Research  
This protocol will include women, minorities and pediatric cases  (participants 
between 18 and 21 years ). African Americans have a higher incidence of head 
and neck cancer and hence minority subjects are expected to be accrued at a 
higher rate than white subjects as compared to the population that Thomas Jefferson University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_649667]. There is nearly a 3:[ADDRESS_1036866] to recruit subjects between the ages 
of 18 and 9 0 with multiple comorbidities.  Subjects will be recruited from the 
investigator or sub- investigator clinical practices. No advertisement will be 
conducted. Screening requirements include serum measurement of creatinine, 
bicarbonate , aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline 
phosphatase.  
 
4.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.5.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Withdrawal criteria and procedures specifying when and how to withdraw 
subjects from the trial:   
 Patients can withdraw at any time during the study if they no longer want to participate in the trial. If withdrawal occurs no further metformin administration will occur and patients will be required to return remaining metformin tablets which will be log ged in to medication administration records and destroyed. If a 
subject withdraws consent to participate in the study, permission will be sought from the subject to record survival and progression for [ADDRESS_1036867]’s participation in the trial may be discontinued:  Specific reasons for discontinuing a subject from this study are:

5.0 STUDY DRUG /THERAPY   
5.1 Description  
Metformin is a biguanide drug currently approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus by [CONTACT_1622]. It is currently being investigated in multiple cancer treatment trials.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Metformin is the therapeutic agent in the protocol. The initial starting dose will be 500mg orally daily for 3 (+2 days)  days which then will be increased to 500 mg 
twice daily and, if tolerated, further increased to 1000mg twice daily after day 6 (+ 
2 days). Patients will maintain [ADDRESS_1036869] a dose escalation.   
5.3 Risks  
Summary of known and potential risks and benefits, if any, to subjects:   
 Metformin’s most serious toxicity is lactic acidosis, occurring in three of 100,000 
patient -years of use. Risk is significantly reduced when metformin use is avoided 
in those patients with hepatic, cardiac, or renal compromise and in those age 80 years or older. However, metformin’s risk of lactic acidosis may be overstated since the recent evaluation of metformin associated lactic acidosis cases from 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036870] common toxicity, leading to cessation of therapy in less than 5% of individuals. Metformin does not cause hypoglycemia. The study is designed to assess as the primary end- point the effects of  
metformin on cytokines with short term administration and not to assess if 
metformin improves outcomes in head and neck cancer and hence it is unlikely to improve the clinical outcome of the subjects enrolled in this study.  
 Rules for dose modification: Toxicity monitoring, dose modification and treatment of complications:  
 Particular attention will be paid in the first three days of treatment. Patients will take 500mg/day for 3 days  (+2 days).  From day 4, 500mg twice daily and then in 
3 days  (+2 days)  dose escalation to 1000mg twice daily will be achieved.   This 
will be taken until the day before surgery after dinner.  A phone call on the day of each dose escalation will be made in order to evaluate the tolerability of the drug and also weekly thereafter .  Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_757366]
31.   
 Metformin will not be started if CT scan with intravenous c ontrast is scheduled.  
After the scan they will be instructed to start the metformin the following day . This 
approach is more stringent than the most recent recommendation of the American College of Radiology which does not recommend holding metformin in the absence of comorbidities (renal insufficiency, liver dysfunction, alcohol abuse, cardiac failure, myocardial or peripheral muscle ischemia, sepsis or seve re infection) which are exclusion criteria for this clinical trial
37.   
 Toxicity will be evaluated using the most recent version (version 3) of the NCI 
toxicity criteria, i.e. the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 .0. The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a 
grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov.  
 Grade 1 toxicity: Patient will be maintained on full dose.  
Grade 2 toxicity:  Dose will be reduced by 50% until grade 1 or lower. If symptoms 
are not resolved within 3 days the treatment will  be discontinued definitively.  
Grade 3 toxicity (probably or definitely drug related): Treatment will be interrupted 
and toxicity reassessed daily. If toxicity improves to grade 2, dose will be reduced by 50%.  
Grade 4 toxicity (probably or definitely drug  related): Treatment will be 
discontinued definitively.  
 In case of grade 1 or 2 diarrhea (the most frequent side effect) a concomitant administration of loperamide will be provided.

8.0 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_417563]- serious.   
 
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, 
but are clearly of  major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, 
and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be 
regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally 
defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as [ADDRESS_1036884] administratio n of study treatment.   
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 32 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A 
preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definiti on of an adverse event will  be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will  be followed by [CONTACT_283877], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator will instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator will notify the  sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any 
time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor will  also be notified if the 
investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if 
any one of the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease an d/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessment s, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369413] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 33 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event i f the purpose of the surgery 
was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5111].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
8.[ADDRESS_1036885], the investigator will seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded immediately in the source document, and 
also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form  (CRF).  All 
clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, though should  be grouped under 
one diagnosis.  
 All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.   
 The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or 
until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse 
event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported 
immediately.  
8.3 Unblinding Procedures :  
At the completion of the accrual period subjects will remain blinded until after the 
primary and secondary endpoints have been collected.    
8.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] : 
Grade 4 toxicity (probably or definitely drug related): Treatment will be 
discontinued definitively.  
 Participants will be discontinued from study drug as per physician discretion  
8.5 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting 
of adverse events as noted above, as well as the compliance  and implementation 
of the SKCC data and safety -monitoring plan.  Medical monitoring will include a 
regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events  by [CONTACT_757374]  [INVESTIGATOR_757341].  
 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) 34 
8.5.1 Medical Monitoring and AE/SAE Reporting  
Every SKCC investigator initiated protocol includes requirements for reporting of 
adverse events based on CTC 4.0. All events are reported to the IRB and 
Medical Monitor using a password protected web- site. In addition all unexpected 
and serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported to the TJU IRB and to the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) if applicable. The investigator is required to 
submit all unexpected and serious adverse events to the TJU IRB and the Medical Monitor within the timeframes outlined in the below table. All AE/SAEs will be reported to the DSMC at the quarterly DSMC review meetings . Fatal 
adverse events related to treatment which are unexpected must be reported within 24 hours to the TJU IRB and the DSMC. Fatalities not related to the study drug/device must be reported within 5 days  
 
A summary of the reporting requirements for SKCC investigator -initiated studies are 
presented below.  
 
**NOTE: This table is based on the NCI AE/S AE re porting Guidelin es 
and the TJU I RB Policy and Procedures. Please follow the individual 
protocol AE/SAE repo rting guide lines if more stringent reporting 
procedures are specified** 
 
 
8.5.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the SKCC. The DSMC is a multidisciplinary 
committee charged with overseeing the monitoring of safety of participants in clinical trials, and the conduct, progress, validity, and integrity of the data for all clinical trials at the Thomas Jefferson University SKCC. The committee meets 

   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036886].  
• The DSMC meets quarterly. Additional DSMC meetings are scheduled based on the nature and number of trials being monitored over a specified time period. The DSMC meets (by [CONTACT_15498]) within 24 hours following the notification of an unexpected adverse event felt to be related 
to the study drug.  
• Prior to each DSMC meeting, each board member, is provided a printout of all reported AEs and SAEs occurring during the reporting period for this clinical trial. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_23897] a detailed and comprehensive narrative assessment of current adverse events to date, indicating their possible significance and whether these toxicities have affected the conduct of the trial. DSMC members are provided with the principal investigator’s assessment, a written report summarizing adverse events, safety data, and activity data observed during the specified time period described in each protocol, as well as recommendations from the Medical Monitor. A review of outcome results (response, toxicity and adverse events) and factors external to the study (such as scientific or therapeutic developments) is discussed, and the Committee votes on the status of each study.  
• A summary of the board’s action is sent to each investigator, the PRC and 
TJU IRB s. The DSMC actions may include recommendations/requirements 
that will lead to improved patient safety and/or efficacy, significant benefits or risks that have developed, or other changes determined to be necessary. The DSMC may also take note of slow accrual or lack of scientific progress, and refer such issues to the PRC. The DSMC provides 
the investigator with the rationale for any decision made.

9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents . The source 
documents for the trial will include:  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, pharmacy dispensing records, pathology records, adverse events and SAE forms, phone interview logs . 
9.3 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed  legibly in black ink.  
If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
9.4 Records Retention  
All study essential documents will be retained by [CONTACT_11202] 2 years after 
the completion of the study.  
10.0 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The investigator will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities.  The Investi gator will also ensure that  compliance or quality assurance reviewer s are 
given access to all  the above noted study -related documents and study related 
facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by 
[CONTACT_1201], government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality 
assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The 
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036889] igator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related 
facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_17256].  
 
10.2.[ADDRESS_1036890] achieved 10% of target 
accrual. However, a study can be audited at any time based on recommendations by [CONTACT_1201], DSMC, PRC and/or the Director of Clinical 
Investigations, SKCC. Studies are re- audited once they have achieved 50% of 
target accrual. Special audits may be recommended by [CONTACT_1201], DSMC or PRC 
based on prior findings, allegations of scientific misconduct and where significant irregularities are found through quality control procedures. Any irregularities identified as part of this process would result in a full audit of that study.  
 
In addition to the audits at 10 and 50%, the CRO randomly audits at least [ADDRESS_1036891] a bi -annual basis, to verify that there is a signed and dated 
patient consent form, the patient has met the eligibility criteria, and that SAEs are documented and reported to the TJU IRB.  
 All audit re ports are submitted to the DSMC for review and action (when 
appropriate). A copy of this report and recommended DSMC action is sent to the PRC and TJU IRB. The committee regards the scientific review process as 
dynamic and constructive rather than punitive. The review process is designed to assist Principal Investigators in ensuring the safety of study subjects and the adequacy and accuracy of any data generated. The TJU IRB may, based on the DSMC and auditor’s recommendation, suspend or terminate the trial .  
 
11.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Inst itutional 
research policies and procedures.  
 This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator before commencement of this study.   
   
 
TJU v5.0 (2019- 06-2) [ADDRESS_1036892] with this study (patent ownership, 
royalties, or financial gain greater than the minimum allowable by [CONTACT_1385], etc.) will have the conflict reviewed by a properly constituted Conflict of Interest 
Committee with a Committee -sanctioned conflict management plan that has 
been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_28833].  All Jefferson University Investigators will follow the TJU Conflicts of Interest Policy for Employees (107.03).

1. Study Procedures  
The study will enroll for a total of 12 months . Projected enrollment is 32 newly 
diagnosed patients  and previously diagnosed patients not in care.  As of May 8, 2017 the 
Moore clinic HIV practice will incorporated into a new clinic, the John G. Bartlett 
Specialty Practice (JGBSP). Throughout the rest of this protocol, activities related  to this 
practice will be referenced as the JGBSP clinic.  
 
Patient recruitment  
  We will utilize existing HIV linkage to care services for newly and previously 
diagnosed patients identified at the Johns Hopkins East Baltimore campus, the JGBSP 
clinic and at the BCHD STD clinics to explore the feasibility and acceptability of RHTI in 
these settings. All patients identified in the Hopkins ED, Johns Hopkins inpatient HIV 
service, the JGBSP clinic and BCHD STD clinics who are newly diagnosed with HIV (test 
positive by 3rd or 4th generation HIV test or detectable HIV viral load with no previ ously 
documented positive HIV test by [CONTACT_562358]/or self -report) and patients with 
previous HIV diagnosis but by [CONTACT_6270] -report are not in care and not on ART (> six months 
without HIV care and ART) will be referred to the Rapid HIV treatment initiati on, Access 
and Engagement in care (RHAE) Research Assistant (RA) by [CONTACT_562359] a dedicated 
smart phone. At the time they are identified as needing a referral for HIV treatment 
services, a brief description of the study will be given to potentially eli gible patients and a 
referral to the RHAE RA will be made with patient permission. In the ED, this referral will 
be made by [CONTACT_562360]/or ED clinicians.  In the JGBSP clinic, the 
referral will be made by [CONTACT_562361], nurses and/or  medical providers. In the BCHD 
STD clinics, referrals will be made by [CONTACT_562362]/or medical providers. The 
linkage team will provide linkage services as per usual. In situations when potentially 
eligible patients present for clinical care when a Project RHAE staff member is not 
available to accept a referral and/or leave the clinical area before learning about the study, 
referring providers and staff who engage with the patient for treatment after the initial 
interaction will present the study a nd elicit interest and permission for referral at a later 
date in person or by [CONTACT_648]. This may include patients who have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562353].  
 Patient consent , survey administration  
 After referral to the RA, the RA will describe the study to the patient and assess  
patient eligibility. A study clinician will confirm patient eligibility  and the RA w ill consent  
patients  who wish  to enroll. Once consented, the RA will collect contact [CONTACT_562363] a standardized enrollment survey ( Table 1).  A tablet or computer will be used 
to record survey responses which will be uploaded to a secure REDC ap Database. Domains 
assessed include illicit drug and al cohol use, depression and panic symptoms, stigma, 
quality of life, HIV knowledge and social support. The  survey will assess anticipated 
barriers and facilitators to HIV care and adherence to medicati on and acceptabilit y of 
RHTI. Date, time and location of HIV clinic follow up will be noted. To ensure adequate 
ability to obtain follow up information, p atients referred to HIV care outside of Johns  
Hopkins and/or BCHD STD clinics will not be eligible for  enrollment .  
  If the patient is eligible but declines enrollment, he or she will be offered enrollment 
in the survey -only study of RHTI (IRB00110075). A log of potentially eligible patients 
6/10/[ADDRESS_739064] RHAE: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_562352], Access and Engagement in care  
who are not enrolled in the study will be kept by [CONTACT_562364]. This log 
will be kept in a secure Johns Hopkins network data base and will not include protected 
health information. The log will include : age, clinical site, whether the patient was newly 
or previously diagnosed, HIV risk factor, reason patient did not enroll, and if the patient 
enrolled in the survey -only study. Protected Health Information of patients referred by 
[CONTACT_562365] n ot eligible or choose not to consent to enrollment will be destroyed.    
 Implementation of RHTI protocol at the Johns Hopkins ED and JGBSP  clinic  
  Patients  recruited from the  Johns Hopkins  ED and/or JGBSP  clinic social work will 
complete his/her ED/socia l work visit and will then be seen in the  JGBSP  clinic  by a JGBSP  
clinic clinician  for a medical HIV intake visit and prescription  with receipt  of ART starter  
pack. Patients recruited from the BCHD STD clinics will see be seen in the BCHD STD 
by a clinicia n for medical intake visit  and prescription and receipt of ART starter pack. The 
clinicians w ho evaluate patients and initiate treatment will be those who provide continuity 
HIV care in the clinics. The date and time of the medical visit to initiate treatm ent at JGBSP  
clinic and BCHD STD clinic will be as soon as possible  and the  visit may occur as soon as 
immediately after recruitment (which is preferable) or may occur  on a day other than the 
day of recruitment if the initial encounter occurs while the clinic is closed, is too late in the 
day to complete before clinic closes or patient prefers an appointment at a later date. The 
medical intake will take place no more th an one week after consent is obtained. The intake 
will be as per usual in the JGBSP  and BCHD HIV clinics . The followi ng clinical labs will 
be obtained at the time of enrollment , as part of standard of care : CD4 count, HIV viral 
load, HIV genotype, CBC, com prehensi ve metabolic panel, urinalysis, viral hepatitis, 
syphilis serologies, GC/CT screening based on risk.  As part of standard of care, clinicians 
and/or clinic staff (registered nurse, pharmacist) provide  counseling on medication 
education, potenti al side effects and adherence. ART prescriptions will be written for  at 
least [ADDRESS_739065] of care.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_562354]. At each clinic, patients are provided  with 24/[ADDRESS_739066] information should he/she experience adverse side effects to medication and/or 
experience a medical emergency. Prescribing providers are responsib le for reviewing the 
laboratory results and will follow up with the patient on any regarding any abnormalities 
requiring urgent/emergent medical attention including need to discontinue antiretroviral 
medication due to contraindications to a component in th e regimen such as estimated 
creatinine clearance <30 mL/min (a contraindication with tenofovir alafenamide) or due to 
HIV resistance to a component of the antiretroviral regimen . Medical follow up will be 
scheduled within two to four weeks.  
 Medical visits will be documented and billed as part of the patient’s medical care. 
HIV intake , baseline labs  and prescription of ART is standard of care  for HIV treatment . 
RHTI accelerates the usual time it takes to receive a medical evaluation for HIV and  ART 
prescription but does not involve investigational medications or procedures.  Date of 
6/10/[ADDRESS_739067] RHAE: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_562352], Access and Engagement in care  
consent and e nrollment in the study will be documented in the medical record  by a member 
of the research team . 
 For patients who enroll in the study who are admitted to the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562355], research physicians will consult with the inpatient attending to discuss either 
initiating ART while inpatient, with inpatient ID consultation if admitted to a non -ID 
service, and/or discharging the patient with a start er pack of ART and close follow up in 
the JGBSP  clinic after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (within one week of discharge).      
 Patients a t Johns Hopkins and BCHD will engage in a social work intake as per 
usual. This intake includes a  brief psychosoc ial and insurance assessment  and urgent 
referrals  for psychosocial services and/or initiation of  medication and/or insurance 
coverage as needed. Intake also includes Ryan White eligibility determination. Ryan White 
eligible patients who are uninsured or need c opay assistance at the JGBSP  clinic  and 
BCHD STD clinics  will receive a Ryan White voucher to cover the full cost or copay of 
the antiretroviral medication prescription .  
  Study participants will re ceive $25  cash payment  for study enrollment.  It is 
estimated the consent process will take about 30 minutes, the survey portion 45 minutes, 
and the medical intake, phlebotomy, social work intake and receipt of medications will 
take two hours.  
 At week four, all patient study participants will be co ntacte d by [CONTACT_562366]  (Table 1). Study participants will receive 
$[ADDRESS_739068]  at each site  (Appendix 2). 
Data will be entered in REDCap Database by [CONTACT_562367] a tablet .

Sample Size and Analysis  
 
Based on 2015 data, we estima te identification of 32 newly diagnosed an d previously diagnosed 
patients not in care during the 4-month study enrollment period. Assuming a participation rate of 
67%, we will be able to enroll newly diagnosed patients and  previously diagnosed patients not in 
care.  
 
5. Risks  
Medical risks include side effects and/or toxicity to antiretroviral medication and need to change 
the antiretroviral regimen due to identification of HIV resistance mutations that preclude the use 
6/10/[ADDRESS_739072] RHAE: a pi[INVESTIGATOR_562352], Access and Engagement in care  
of the antiretroviral medication regimen chosen by [CONTACT_562370] . These risks, however, 
are not outside of the usual risks that come with initiating antiretroviral therapy. The major risks 
for participants are (a) discomfort in answering survey questio ns and (b) loss of privacy or 
confidentiality. In order to minimize the risks associated with discomfort in answering survey 
questions, participants will be told that they have the option to pass on any questions. In order to 
minimize the risks associated with loss of confidentiality, all participant data will be kept 
confidential and secure.  All computers with participant data will be password protected with 
access restricted to certain study team members. No information will be kept on mobile devices, 
such as laptop computers or cell phones, unless such devices are encrypted and password -
protected.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_562357].  
 
6. Benefits  
There are no individu al benefits for any study participants. However, participation in the study 
could show that initiation of ART in HIV positive patients at the time of diagnosis or when 
identified as previously diagnosed with HIV but not in care and antiretroviral naïve or off of ART 
for more than six months can improve clinical outcomes and decrease the risk of transmission of 
HIV.  
 
7. Payment and Remuneration  
Study participants will receive $25 for enrollment and completion of the baseline visit and $50 at 
week 4 for completi on of the standardized survey  
 
8. Costs  
Study participants and/or their health insurer will be responsible for paying for the following 
services and/or items that are standard of care, and would be performed regardless of patient 
entering onto the study (outs ide of the clinical trial): CD4 count, HIV viral load, HIV genotype, 
CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, viral hepatitis, syphilis serologies, GC/CT 
screening based on risk, and prescriptions for the antiretroviral medication regimen chosen by [CONTACT_562371] .  Participants who have health insurance will be responsible for any co -pays 
or deductibles not covered by [CONTACT_60737].  Financial assistance to cover  healthcare costs such as  
co-pays and/or medications for patients living with HI V will be used for eligible patients with 
social work assistance as per usual.

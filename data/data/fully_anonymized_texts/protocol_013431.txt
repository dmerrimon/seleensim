1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Indication  
A large prospective study is required to determine the optimal timing of appendectomy in complicated appendicitis, as well as the necessity of interval appendectomy in non- operative 
management.  
1.2 Background and Rationale  
Complicated appendicitis, defined as perforation with or without abscess, is currently treated one of two ways: Immediate operation, or IV antibiotics with or without drainage, followed by [CONTACT_719406] 6-[ADDRESS_981654] and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and were influenced by [CONTACT_719407]-operative therapy  
1,2.  Furthermore, in those patients initially managed non-operatively, the 
Principal Investigator [CONTACT_5627]: Steven Bruch, MD, MSc  
UM HUM  # 00103791 
PROTOCOL VERSION #: 1.[ADDRESS_981655] indicated that the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_719400]-operatively for perforated appendicitis is low, calling into question the practice of interval appendectomy 
4,5.  Therefore, a larger prospective study is required to determine the optimal 
timing of appendectomy in complicated appendicitis, as well as the necessity of interval appendectomy in non- operative management.  
1.3 Hypothesis  
Based on previous studies, our hypotheses are that 1) early appendectomy results in lower health care costs than non -operative management followed by [CONTACT_719406], and 2) interval 
appendectomy may be a non-essential procedure following non- operative management of 
complica ted appendicitis resulting in higher costs. 
1.[ADDRESS_981656] also 
suggested that interval appendectomy in both adults in children may not be necessary. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 Objectives  
• To quantify the cost of care and compare them between the three groups 
• To assess complication rates between the three groups 
• To assess the length of time until return to activity/parents return to work  
• To assess the number of percutaneous drainage procedures and/or radiographic studies performed in all groups 
• To monitor the length of stay and compare between the three groups 
• To monitor the duration of antibiotic therapy and compare between the three groups 
• To assess and compare quality of life between the three groups 
2.2 Outcomes  
2.2.1  Primary Outcome  
• Overall cost of care  
2.2.2  Secondary Outcomes

3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single  center, prospective study to compare early appendectomy vs. non- operative 
management of immunocompetent patients with complicated  appendicitis, as well as interval 
appendectomy vs. no interval appendectomy in those managed with the initial non- operative 
approach.  In our study we will identify patients between the ages of 5 and 17 with the diagnosis 
of complicated appendicitis who are not immunocompromised.  We will present the two options to the patient and their parents using a prerecorded video that discusses the two treatments with their theore tical advantages and disadvantages.  We will allow the patients and th eir parents to 
decide which  option they would like.  We then will treat each study pa rticipant using our present 
algorithm for complicated appendicitis  (see diagram below) .  Study participants who select 
immediate oper ation will undergo an appendectomy within 24 hours and be treated using our 
present algorithm.  They will follow up in our clinic in 2- 4 weeks  and complete a gastrointestinal 
quality of life survey at that time.   Study participants who selected initial non -operative 
management  will be tre ated using our present algorithm.  They will follow up in clinic in 2-4 
weeks after initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_719401] a gastrointestinal quality of life survey at 
this time.   At this point in the treatment of complicated appendicitis, there are two options: 
Interval appendectomy, or no appendectomy or further treatment.  We wil l again use a 
prerecorded video that discusses these two options and thei r theoretical advantages and 
disadvantages.  The study participants and thei r parents will then decide  whether or not to have 
an interval appendectomy which will be scheduled at least 8 weeks afte r initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].  The  interval appendectomy will be performed (admitted the day of the operation and 
most often discharged the following day), and patients will follow up in the clinic one month following the appendectomy and data will be collected.  All participating subjects  will be 
contact[CONTACT_279265] 3 months and again at 2 years  after their initial admission and data 
will be collected.   If the patient has not completed his/her clinical course by 3 months, treatment 
(antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, or operative intervention) and further follow-up will be 
determined by [CONTACT_719408].  A chart review  and administration of a 
quality of life survey will also occur along with these follow up phone calls and emails .  The 
primary outcome of our study will be cost.  The secondary outcomes will be number and type of complications, time away from activities (school etc.) for patients and away from work for parents, number of days of antibiotic therapy required, length of stay, number of imaging te sts, 
number of percutaneous drainage procedures  required , quality of life, and recurrent appendicitis.

5.1 Allocation to Treatment  
Treatment group will be determined by [CONTACT_4676]/parent choice.  All patients and families will be 
shown a pre-recorded video describing the treatment options and their theoretic advantages and 
disadvantages prior to making their decision.  This applies to the decisions of early appendectomy vs. non-operative therapy, as well as to interval appendectomy vs. no interval appendectomy.

7.2 Secondary Endpoint Assessments  
Complications will be determined and documented during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_719403]-ups, as documented above.  Time to return to activity/parents to work will be determined and documented at subsequent clinic appointments and phone follow-ups, as documented above.  Days of antibiotics will be determined by [CONTACT_719409] (depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517] 1), based on patient fever and WBC count.  Length of stay will be determined by [CONTACT_719409], documented at the end of the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and accrued at any subsequent readmissions.  Number of percutaneous drainage procedures and imaging procedures will be determined by [CONTACT_309667].  
 Quality of life will be determined by [CONTACT_719410].  Recurrent appendicitis will be determined by [CONTACT_719411]-up.  
[ADDRESS_981660] demonstrated conflicting results, and therefore it is unclear if one strategy bears more risk than the other 
1,2.  Both are considered acceptable in current practice.  The 
same can be said of whether or not to perfor m interval appendectomy at all.  Interval 
appendectomy has been shown in the literature to be a safe and effective operation 6. 
 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events associated with complicated appendicitis include intra-abdominal abscess, small 
bowel obstruction, wound infection, unplanned readmission, and complications related to central 
line placement (if necessary) and percutaneous drain placement (if necessary).  These risks pertain to patient who both do and do not undergo appendectomy.  Recurrent appendicitis is also

Page 12 of 17 a risk of non-operative management of complicated appendicitis , as is the need for additional 
treatment with antibiotics  2.  All patients in this study will receive antibiotics (pi[INVESTIGATOR_049] -
tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole), and will be subject to the risk of drug reaction or 
allergy.  Metronidazole should be administered with caution to patients with central nervous 
system diseases.  Patients with severe hepatic disease metabolize metronidazole slowly, with 
resultant accumulation of metronidazole and its metabolites in the plasma. Accordingly, for such patients, doses, below those usually recommended should be administered cautiously  
9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an investigational study or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  These events may be:  
 a. Definitely related:  clearly associated with study drug/treatment 
b. Probably related:  likely associated with study drug/treatment 
c. Possibly related :  may be associated with study drug or other treatment 
d. Unlikely to be related , or 
e. Definitely not related  to the study drug/treatment 
 For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as definitely or probably related to the regimen if the investigator believes that at least one of following criteria are met:  
 a. There is a clinically plau sible time sequence between onset of the AE and the administration 
of the study drug or treatment. b. There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study drug or treatment causing or contributing to the AE. c. The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures.  d. A potential alternative cause does not exist.  Serious Adverse E vents (SAE):   An adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results 
in any of the following outcomes: 
 a. Death  
b. A life -threa tening adverse drug experience 
c. Inpatient h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
d. A persistent or significant disability &/or incapacity  
e. A congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 
Principal Investigator [CONTACT_5627]: Steven Bruch, MD, MSc  
UM HUM  # 00103791 
PROTOCOL VERSION #: 1.[ADDRESS_981661] and may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. A 
serious adverse experience includes any experience that is fatal or immediately life threatening, results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs in- patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose. Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life-threatening, or not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject/patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously. 
 
Expected  adverse events are those adverse events that are listed in the protocol, the 
Investigator’s Brochure (current edition) or in the study informed consent document. 
 
Unexpected adverse events are thos e that are not anticipated in the study informed consent.  
This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the informed consent.  
 Unanticipated problem:  P
 er FDA Procedural Guidance for Cl inical Investigators, Sponsors, and 
IRBs (January 2009) , A serious problem that has implications for the conduct of the study 
(requiring a significant and usually safety-related, change in the protocol such as revising inclusion/exclusion criteria or including a new monitoring requirement, informed consent or investigator’s brochure).  Unanticipated problem Reporting: Per 21 CFR 312.66, 312.53 (c)(1)(vii), and 56.108(b)(1), 
should an Unanticipated problem occur during the investigation, the investigator will promptly report all unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others to IRBMED /FDA.  
 
  
The severity or grade of an adverse event may be measured using the following definitions: 
 
Mild:   Noticeable to the subject,  but does not interfere with subject’s expected daily activities, 
usually does not require additional therapy or intervention, dose reduction, or discontinuation of 
the study. 
 
Moderate:   Interferes with the subject’s expected daily activities, may require some additional 
therapy or intervention but does not require discontinuation of the study. 
 
Severe:  Extremely limits the subject’s daily activities and may require discontinuation of study 
therapy, and/or additional treatment or intervention to resolve. 
 
Event reporting:   The study will comply with the IRB & FDA reporting requirements and 
guidelines.

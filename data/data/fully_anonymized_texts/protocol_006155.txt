2.1.
 
Brief
 
Summary
 
 
This
 
optimization
 
randomized
 
clinical
 
trial
 
(i.e.,
 
“optimization-RCT”)
 
will
 
examine
 
three
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
for
 
weight
 
loss
 
--
 
tracking
 
dietary
 
intake,
 
tracking
 
steps,
 
and
 
tracking
 
body
 
weight
 
--
 
all
 
delivered
 
through
 
digital
 
health
 
tools.
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
these
 
strategies
 
that
 
maximizes
 
6-month
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
a
 
fully
 
digital
 
health
 
intervention
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.
 
 
The
 
investigators
 
will
 
recruit
 
176
 
total
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
trial.
 
Recruitment
 
will
 
occur
 
through
 
remote
 
channels.
 
Interested
 
individuals
 
will
 
be
 
directed
 
to
 
an
 
online
 
eligibility
 
screen;
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
eligible
 
will
 
then
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
attend
 
an
 
initial
 
remote
 
baseline
 
session
 
with
 
study
 
staff
 
to
 
ensure
 
interest
 
and
 
eligibility
 
in
 
the
 
study.
 
The
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
will
 
last
 
6
 
months,
 
and
 
all
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
"core"
 
intervention
 
consisting
 
of
 
goal
 
setting,
 
behavioral
 
lessons,
 
and
 
action
 
plans
 
-
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
delivered
 
remotely.
 
Using
 
a
 
2x2x2
 
factorial
 
design,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
receive
 
0-3
 
of
 
the
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies.
 
All
 
study
 
tasks
 
will
 
occur
 
remotely,
 
thus,
 
participants
 
never
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
in-person
 
for
 
any
 
intervention
 
or
 
assessment
 
tasks.
 
 
Investigators
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
Multiphase
 
Optimization
 
Strategy
 
(MOST)
 
framework
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
combination
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies.
 
The
 
factorial
 
design
 
will
 
allow
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
impact
 
of
 
each
 
self-monitoring
 
component
 
on
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
primary
 
outcome
 
is
 
weight
 
change
 
from
 
baseline
 
to
 
[ADDRESS_43560].

Obesity
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
public
 
health
 
problem.
 
Obesity
 
has
 
become
 
a
 
pervasive
 
health
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
with
 
rates
 
of
 
42%
 
among
 
adults

and
 
another
 
30+%
 
with
 
overweight.

These
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
are
 
effective
 
in
 
producing
 
weig ht

up
 
to
 
10%,

but
 
often
 
lack

Digital
 
Interventions
 
Remotely-delivered
 
interventions
 
show
 
promise,
 
but
 
need
 
enhanced
 
efficacy.
 
Digital
 
health
 
interventions
 
that
 
deliver
 
treatment
 
remotely
 
seek
 
to
 
minimize
 
burden,
 
decrease
 
costs,
 
and
 
broaden
 
reach,
 
compared
 
to
 
in-person
 
interventions.
 
With
 
widespread
 
penetration
 
of

among
 
U.S.

(77%,

and

respectively),
 
digital
 
health

in
 
weight

with

thus,
 
more
 
work
 
is
 
needed
 
to

digital
 
approaches.
 
2.4.3
 
Self-Monitoring
 
Self-monitoring
 
via
 
digital
 
health
 
is
 
effective
 
at
 
facilitating
 
weight
 
loss.
 
Self-monitoring
 
is
 
a
 
well-established
 
method
 
of
 
facilitating
 
weight
 
loss
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.
16-18
 
It
 
involves
 
tracking
 
a
 
behavior
 
(e.g.,
 
diet,
 
exercise)
 
or
 
behavio ral
 
outcome
 
(e.g.,
 
body
 
weight)
 
and
 
allows
 
individuals
 
to
 
pay
 
attention
 
to
 
their
 
behaviors
 
and
 
gain
 
feedback
 
on
 
how
 
specific
 
actions
 
impact
 
their
 
weight.

Self-regulation

including
 
Social

posit
 
that
 
behavior
 
change
 
occurs
 
through
 
comparison
 
of

behavior
 
to
 
one’s

However,
 
self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
tends
 
to
 
decline
 
over
 
time
 
with
 
common

to

found
 
that
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
are
 
magnified
 
when
 
adding
 
these
 
strategies.
25-27
 
Advantages
 
of
 
using
 
digital
 
platforms
 
for
 
self-monitoring
 
include
 
immediate
 
personalized
 
feedback,
 
reduced
 
tracking
 
time
 
with
 
automated
 
monitoring
 
via
 
devices
 
like
 
fitness
 
trackers
 
and
 
e-scales,
 
and
 
high
 
portability
 
of
 
mHealth
 
tools,
 
which
 
increases
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
use
 
while
 
reducing
 
retrospective
 
errors.
 
A
 
systematic
 
review
 
of
 
39
 
randomized
 
trials
 
examined
 
digital
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
used
 
in
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions
 
and
 
concluded
 
that
 
greater
 
self-monitoring
 
was
 
positively
 
associated
 
with
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
over
 
70%
 
of
 
the
 
reported
 
associations.
16
 
This
 
pattern
 
was
 
demonstrated
 
across
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
digital
 
health
 
modalities
 
and
 
self-monitored
 
behaviors.
 
In
 
sum,
 
self-monitoring
 
is
 
a
 
theory-informed
 
and
 
evidence-based
 
approach
 
for
 
weight
 
loss
 
that
 
can
 
be

Outcomes
 
Secondary
 
outcomes
 
include
 
the
 
following:
 
6-month
 
change
 
in
 
caloric
 
intake,
 
physical
 
activity,
 
BMI,
 
and
 
health-related
 
quality
 
of
 
life;
 
1-
 
and
 
3-month
 
weight
 
change;
 
and
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
participants
 
achieving
 
clinically
 
significant
 
weight
 
loss
 
(≥5%
 
at
 
6
 
months).
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
examine
 
additional
 
outcomes:
 
self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
rates
 
and
 
their
 
relation
 
to
 
6-month
 
weight
 
change;
 
6-month
 
changes
 
in
 
diet
 
quality;
 
6-month
 
changes
 
in
 
step
 
count
 
among
 
those
 
assigned
 
to
 
self-monitor
 
steps;
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
potential
 
moderators
 
on
 
6-month
 
weight
 
change
 
to
 
determine
 
for
 
whom

self-monitor
 
dietary

Participant
 
Population
 
and
 
Screening
 
All
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight/obesity
 
who
 
are
 
otherwise
 
healthy.
 
Individuals
 
who
 
are
 
pregnant
 
or
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
that
 
would
 
limit
 
participation
 
in
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
or
 
be
 
better
 
suited
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
intensive
 
or
 
different
 
type
 
of
 
intervention
 
are
 
excluded
 
from
 
our
 
trial
 
(e.g.,
 
individuals
 
with
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
an
 
eating
 
disorder
 
or
 
cardiovascular
 
event,
 
uncontrolled
 
diabetes
 
mellitus
 
or
 
hypertension,
 
cancer,
 
dementia).
 
Risks
 
to
 
participants
 
are
 
anticipated
 
to
 
be
 
low
 
given
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
examining
 
evidence-based
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
and
 
promoting
 
weight
 
loss
 
through
 
lifestyle
 
change
 
(e.g.,
 
decrease
 
intake
 
of
 
unhealthy
 
foods,
 
increase
 
steps).
 
We
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
including
 
a
 
vulnerable
 
population
 
(e.g.,
 
children,
 
pregnant
 
women)
 
as
 
participants.
 
 
To
 
ensure
 
participant
 
safety
 
in
 
this

a
 
set
 
of
 
screening
 
procedures
 
that
 
are
 
common
 
in
 
behavioral

as
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
are
 
safe
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
moderate
 
intensity
 
physical
 
activity
 
and
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
that
 
is
 
contraindicated
 
in
 
a
 
remote

program
 
will

Minimizing
 
Risks
 
This

is
 
expected
 
to
 
impose
 
minimal
 
risk
 
for
 
participants.
 
The
 
content
 
of

–
 
including

The
 
Stanford
 
University
 
School
 
of

occur
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
policy
 
requirements.
 
Specifically,
 
the
 
policy
 
states
 
that
 
the
 
PI

manner.
 
Registration
 
was
 
completed
 
via
 
the
 
Stanford
 
ClinicalTrials.gov
 
Protocol
 
Registration
 
System
 
(PRS).
 
 
 
Commensurate
 
with
 
current
 
requirements,
 
once
 
the
 
study
 
data
 
have
 
undergone
 
final
 
data
 
cleaning,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
planned

we
 
will
 
make
 
the
 
final
 
data
 
collected
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
research
 
available
 
in
 
electronic
 
form
 
to
 
researchers
 
who
 
request
 
them.
 
We
 
will
 
request
 
that

a
 
data
 
request
 
in
 
writing
 
to
 
the

that
 
would
 
permit
 
linkages
 
to
 
individual

participants
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
remove
 
protected
 
health
 
information
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
HIPAA
 
Privacy
 
Rule.
 
The
 
requestor
 
must
 
agree
 
to
 
maintain
 
the
 
privacy
 
and
 
confidentiality
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
and

to
 
demonstrate
 
compliance
 
with
 
secure
 
computing.
 
NIH
 
guidelines,
 
institutional
 
policies,
 
IRB
 
rules,
 
and
 
regulatory
 
policies
 
will
 
be
 
taken
 
into
 
account.
 
Per
 
NIH
 
guidelines,
 
all

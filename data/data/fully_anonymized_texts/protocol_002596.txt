Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_403726]. All participants will be offered three months of open medication treatment following 
participation. The clinical trial will only be conducted at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_327155].
Background, Significance and Rationale
Background,
 Significance and Rationale
With a lifetime prevalence of 2-3% and half of all  cases beginning by [CONTACT_654] 19, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) is a major health concern for children and adolescents and is a leading cause of illness-
related disability. SRI medication and cognitive-behavioral treatment represent front-line treatments for 
pediatric OCD, but lead to symptom remission in only 54% of youth with OCD. This study will examine the 
feasibility and potential efficacy  of augmenting SRIs with minocycline, a drug with a novel mechanism of 
action for OCD. The study will additionally assess whether the addition of minocycline leads to measurable 
changes in striatal glutamate (Glu) levels and whether either baseline striatal Glu levels or changes in striatal 
Glu levels are associated with response to minocycline. The study will also examine minocyline as a mono-
therapy treatment for pediatric OCD in  a small subset of participants that are unwilling to take SRI 
medication. The study will measure changes over time in the striatal glutamate (Glu) levels of these  
participants as well.  Minocycline is a  second-generation tetracycline that has been shown to modulate 
glutamate and to have anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. There is growing evidence from 
animal studies and human clinical trials of neurological diseases (including Parkinson’s disease, 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington’s disease, and ischemia) that minocycline has neuroprotective 
effects.
 
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: When added to SRI medication,  or taken as  mono-therapy, minocycline will be superior to 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_327156].
Hypothesis 2: Adding minocycline (but not placebo) to an SRI, or taking minocycline  (but not a placebo) 
without an SRI,  will reduce glutamate levels in the head of caudate.
Hypothesis
 3: Reduction in glutamate  levels will be associated with reduction in OCD severity.

Recruitment
 for this study was completed in 2016.
The study recruited participants from the Anxiety Disorders Clinic (ADC), directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Simpson, as well 
as the CAPES Evaluation Service and the Children’s Day Unit (CDU), which are directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rynn. The 
ADC screens over 200 adults (≥ 18) with OCD a year. More than half are on medication (predominantly 
SRIs). The CAPES/CDU provides free expert consultation, evaluation, and treatment referrals for children 
and adolescents suffering from mood and anxiety disorders. In past years, CAPES/CDU evaluated as many 
as [ADDRESS_403730] were on SRIs only. OCD self-
help organizations such as the International OCD Foundation were contact[CONTACT_327176].
Participants (ages 8-20) and their parent/caregiver were assessed by [CONTACT_2717]-approved phone screen. For 
participants ages 18-20, the research team obtained permission from the participant before speaking to 
his/her parent/caregiver. We do not communicate to families that we will destroy their screening

Study Procedures
Describe the procedures required for this study
Overview:
Children’s Day Unit:
The clinical trial will be conducted at  the Children’s Day Unit (CDU). The CDU is an outpatient clinic and a 
research day treatment program that provides services for the psychiatric and educational needs of children 
and adolescents participating in research protocols at NYSPI. Most of the children have either failed or not 
completely responded to first line treatments for mood, OCD, or other anxiety disorders. School services are 
provided by [INVESTIGATOR_58027]186X, a [LOCATION_001] City public school located on the unit during the academic year from 
September through June. In addition, during the [ADDRESS_403733]. Pablo Goldberg, a research nurse, a social worker, psychologists, and trainees. 
Although this protocol is an outpatient protocol, if an adolescent requires additional support or requires a 
higher level of care, the adolescent may be admitted to the CDU partial program that runs Monday through 
Friday from 8:30 am to 2:[ADDRESS_403734] from 1 to 4 weeks 
to allow sufficient time to obtain thorough medical and psychiatric history to ensure the patient’s safety and 
eligibility/ineligibility in the study. Screening procedures include:

Baseline Evaluation
After
 completing the screening procedures, eligible participants will proceed  to the baseline evaluation. 
Baseline evaluation procedures include: 
MRS scan except for participants who have MRS incompatible dental braces
Efficacy Assessments: Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS); Child 
Obsessive-Compulsive Impact
 Scale – Revised (COIS-R); Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)
Feasibility and Safety Assessment: Columbia  Suicide-Severity Rating Scale; Pediatric Adverse 
Event Rating Scale; Medication Adherence
Randomization
Randomization to minocycline
 or placebo treatment will occur following the baseline evaluation. 
Randomized assignments will be generated using a random number generator in SAS. We will randomize 
minocycline versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio to gather more data about minocycline’s clinical effect. To balance 
the minocycline-placebo groups with respect to age, randomization will be stratified with respect to age 
ranges (8 to 11 years; 12 to 15 years; 16 to 20 years).
 
Post-randomization
Once randomized, the study psychiatrist will conduct the week [ADDRESS_403735] will offer support and monitor the 
patient’s medication and side effects. To monitor for unexpected pregnancy, females will have a blood 
pregnancy test at screening and  a urine pregnancy test at each study visit. A manual for medication 
procedures is provided in Appendix  A. Clinician adherence to this manual will be formally assessed using 
the Clinician Adherence to Pharmacotherapy form as described in the manual.  
 
Ongoing SRI treatment: Participants will  enter on an SRI (at a stable dose for ≥ 12 weeks). The study 
psychiatrist will continue to  prescribe this SRI. To confirm ongoing SRI adherence, SRI pi[INVESTIGATOR_327157]. In addition, SRI blood levels will be assessed at baseline and week 12 
(or early termination). For each participant and at each time point, blood will be drawn at the same time of 
day and in a constant temporal relationship to their last SRI dose. The goal is to verify a stable SRI dose in 
each participant during the trial and thereby [CONTACT_327190] a 
change in SRI level. A small sample of participants will enroll in  the study without being on a dose of SRI 
medication. For these participants, we will not monitor SRI adherence nor assess SRI  blood levels.
 
At each treatment visit, medication adherence  will be assessed. In addition, the C-SSRS will be 
administered at each treatment visit to assess for suicidality, the Pediatric Adverse Event Rating Scale 
(PAERS) will be administered  to assess for the presence of adverse events, and the Clinical Global 
Impression Scale (CGI-S) will be administered to assess symptom severity and improvement. Vital  signs 
will also be taken at each treatment visit, and pregnancy tests will be administered to female participants.

Week 4, 8 & 12 IE Visits: Efficacy  measures will be re-administered by [CONTACT_327191] 
4, 8, and 12 of treatment to assess for change  in OCD symptoms. The following measures will be 
administered at these visits:
Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive  Compulsive Scale (CYBOCS)
Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale – Revised (COIS-R)
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D)
The following staff members are designated  independent evaluators for this study: Anthony Puliafico, PhD, 
Chiaying Wei, MA, Paula Yanes-Lukin, PhD. 
Post-treatment
 Assessment: At Week  12, in addition to the Week 12 IE assessments, the following 
assessments will be administered:
Medical Evaluation including the Tanner Scale, physical exam, EKG, labs and vital signs
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)
Previously endorsed modules  on the ADIS-C/P
Follow-up Treatment
Upon completion of the
 12-week clinical trial, participants will be offered an additional 3 months of open 
medication management as clinically indicated based on their treatment history and response during the 
study. Participants and their families will be unblinded to their treatment assignment at this point. In the 
event they prefer to be treated elsewhere, they will also be provided referrals to community providers. With 
their permission, all participants will be assessed every 4 weeks for OCD severity (using the CYBOCS and 
CGI-S by [CONTACT_35520]) and safety (PAERS by [CONTACT_96137]). The 1-month and 2-month follow-up assessments will be 
conducted in person, or if necessary,  by [CONTACT_648], and the 3-month assessment will be conducted in 
person.This will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_327158] (e.g. proportion who choose to continue 
minocycline), ongoing safety, and maintenance of response. Participants that begin  taking, and respond to, 
minocycline during the follow-up period may also  have the option of undergoing a third MRS scan. 
 
Clinical Deterioration (please see Appendix A and Protection of Human Subjects)
 A clinical
 management issue of major significance is  the referral of unimproved or deteriorating 
adolescents for a clinical evaluation. In particular, any patient who is evaluated by [CONTACT_327192] (CGI-I score of 6) for two consecutive visits will be discontinued from the protocol. If the 
adolescent begins to show clinical deterioration during the study and further continuation under such 
circumstances would be detrimental to the adolescent, a referral will be made for a clinical evaluation by [CONTACT_327193]. If the 
adolescent is withdrawn from the protocol, the adolescent will be eligible for no cost treatment on the 
Children’s Day Unit. If the participant or the participant’s parent/guardian would prefer outside referrals, 
arrangements will be made by [CONTACT_16133]. The psychiatrist has full responsibility and authority to 
refer the adolescent for this clinical evaluation at any time regarding the adolescent’s suitability for 
remaining in the study. Additionally, participants who experience severe reaction to the study medication 
will be unblinded to their treatment assignment following the adverse event.

Minocycline versus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_327159]. The 
medications will be identical in appearance and made by [CONTACT_40422] [CONTACT_966]. Those randomized to 
minocycline will receive approximately 2 mg/kg/day, the FDA-approved dose for minocycline and the dose 
used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (<35 kg: 50 mg/day; 35-55 kg: 50 mg BID; >55-75 kg: 75 mg BID; >75kg: 100 mg 
BID). Participants will be asked to take the tablet with food, in an upright position, and with [ADDRESS_403736] a minocycline level drawn at week 12 to confirm treatment 
adherence. In the absence of a laboratory that can perform a minocycline level, participants' serum and 
plasma will be collected and stored in a -[ADDRESS_403737] 
quadrature single-channel head coil in a total examination time of approximately 45 min, including scan 
setup. At baseline, after 12 weeks of treatment, and  for a subset of the sample, after the 3-month follow-up 
period, subjects will undergo  MR imaging at either NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_327160]. Participants 
will continue to take their prescribed SRI medication (if  applicable) and minocycline or placebo when they 
undergo the 12-week MR imaging. Subjects will be escorted to the imaging procedure by a project 
coordinator. Female participants will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to scanning in addition to the 
blood pregnancy test at screening. There will be a 72-hour window between pregnancy testing and MRS 
scan. The team at Cornell will  receive a signed copy of the negative urine pregnancy test in order to proceed 
with the scan. First, a standard T1-weighted  volumetric MRI series will be acquired for use in estimating the 
proportions of gray matter, white matter and CSF content of the head of the caudate through tissue 
segmentation. Second, glutamate (Glu) levels will be recorded from the head of the caudate using MRS. The 
recorded 4D raw data set will be processed using standard procedures. The striatal voxels will be selected 
from the spectroscopic imaging grid after acquisition and post-processing, and then analyzed for Glu 
content using versatile software, XsOSNMR, developed in [CONTACT_327222]’s laboratory (see Resources). The 
rationale for focusing on the striatum and the head of the caudate in particular is described above (Section 
C5.h). The Glu data will be quantified as peak area ratios relative to the robust unsuppressed water 
resonance (W) in a spectroscopic imaging data set that will be acquired in just 4 min using the same spatial 
parameters as in the PRESS SI sequence.

Blood and other Biological Samples
Please create
 or insert a table describing  the proposed collection of blood or other biological specimens
A blood sample, approximately one  tablespoon (15 cc’s) of blood, will be taken at screening and at study 
completion (or withdrawal, if earlier) for a total of two tablespoons (30 cc). These samples will be used to 
measure minocycline and SRI levels and for safety monitoring, including Chemistry Screen and CBC. The 
samples for drug assay will be forwarded to a centralized laboratory for analysis. Participants may 
experience a bruise at the site of venipuncture. EMLA cream may be used to minimize the discomfort of 
venipuncture.
 
Assessment Instruments
Create a table or give a brief description of the instruments  that will be used for assessment
Diagnostic Assessments:
Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children for DSM-IV (ADIS-C/P Revised): This will be 
administered to the subject  (and parent/caretaker for those <18 and those 18-20 with permission) by [CONTACT_214004] (IE) at screening to confirm the diagnosis of OCD and its age of onset. At the week 
[ADDRESS_403738]-treatment assessment, previously endorsed modules on the ADIS-C/P will be administered to 
measure changes in diagnoses and symptomatology.
Wechsler Abbreviated Scales of Intelligence (WASI): This estimates Full Scale IQ with excellent reliability 
and validity for ages 6-90.  It consists of four subtests: Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design, and Matrix 
Reasoning. The Vocabulary and Matrix Reasoning subtests  will be administered by [CONTACT_327196].
Family History Screen (FHS): This  screens for the presence of 15 psychiatric disorders among the 
participant’s biological relatives. It is administered to  a family informant (for those ages 8-17) or to the 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_403739] (ages 18-20), who reports on himself/herself  and on other biological relatives. It will be 
administered by [CONTACT_327197].
 
Isolated Tics/Tic Disorder Assessment: The parent(s)  of the participant will be asked five questions about 
family history of isolated tics  and Tic Disorder. The questions were developed by [CONTACT_327198]. 
Medication Evaluation: The study psychiatrist and  study nurse will conduct a medical history, laboratory 
tests, physical exam, (including  weight, height, and EKG), pregnancy test at each visit, at screening and 
Week 12.
The Tanner Scale: This is a scale of physical development based on external primary and secondary sex 
characteristics. Participants look at pi[INVESTIGATOR_327161].
 
Feasibility Assessments:
Pediatric Adverse Event
 Rating Scale (PAERS): This self-report questionnaire assesses the severity of 48 
potential adverse events, each  on a five-point Likert scale (0–4). It is filled out by [CONTACT_327199] (and parent/caretaker for those <18 and those 18-20 with permission). It is reviewed by [CONTACT_327200]. 
Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS): This is a semi-structured clinician rating of suicidal 
behavior, suicide attempts, and presence and  intensity of suicidal ideation. The assessment will be 
administered by [CONTACT_327201], baseline and each study visit except the phone interview at 
week 1.
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ): Used in prior studies, this scale includes questions about 
satisfaction with treatment condition (CSQ). It will be completed by [CONTACT_2299] (and parent/caretaker for 
those < 18 and
 those 18-20 with permission) at week 12 and used to assess the acceptability of minocycline 
augmentation. For children under the age of 12, the Research Assistant (RA) will be present in case of 
reading comprehension questions.  
Medication Adherence: The participant and psychiatrist will review the dosing procedures and use of a 
dosing diary with the  parent/caretaker. Adherence to medication will be assessed by: 1) direct query of the 
participant and parent/caretaker; 2) pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]; 3) review of the dosing diary that participants return at each 
study visit; and 4) SRI and minocycline blood levels (as described above). A log will document the number 
of SRI and study medication tablets provided and what is returned at the next visit, with 70% or greater 
accuracy considered adherent. Number of sessions attended will also be recorded. 
Attrition: The proportion of patients who drop out at each assessment will be used as a measure of attrition. 
Specific reasons for discontinuation will be documented. Every attempt will  be made to obtain all 
assessments at all time points from all study participants, even if they terminate early from the study.
 
Efficacy Assessments:
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive
 Scale, Child version (CYBOCS): The CYBOCS is a semi-structured 
measure of OCD severity with excellent inter-rater reliability,  internal consistency, and test-retest reliability.

Research Related Delay to Treatment
Will research procedures result in a delay to treatment?
Yes
Maximum duration of delay
 to any treatment 
For all enrolled participants, the maximum delay in initiating augmentation treatment will be [ADDRESS_403740] following the 12-week acute 
treatment phase of the study. All participants will be advised of their alternatives to participation (e.g., 
seeking alternative SRI augmentation treatments such as the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, an 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_67128], or clomipramine) before consenting to participate.
Maximum duration of delay to standard care or treatment of known efficacy
For enrolled participants, the maximum delay in beginning a treatment of known efficacy is [ADDRESS_403741] the 
participant and his/her family in identifying a psychiatrist.
Clinical Treatment Alternatives
Clinical
 treatment alternatives
Currently cognitive-behavioral treatment
 involving exposure and response prevention (CBT/ERP) and 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medication are considered the first line treatments for OCD. However, 
pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_327162]. CBT/ERP treatment is the mainstay of the 
treatment for OCD. Yet, CBT/ERP alone results in response rates of anywhere between 60% and 80%, and 
fear of non-adherence to ERP is hypothesized to contribute to the lack of ERP efficacy across age groups.
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
1) Distress from discussion
 about emotional symptoms; 2) blood sampling; 3) delay in initiation of other 
medication augmentation options for OCD patients; 4) medication-related adverse events and side effects 
for those randomized to minocycline; 5) placebo risks; 6) risks from chronic SRI treatment; 7) risks 
associated with MR imaging. 
1) Distress from thoughts or discussion about emotional symptoms: Some participants may experience 
distress or anxiety related to participating in these procedures. Participants will be monitored throughout the 
procedures, and
 they will be encouraged to report any concerns. A psychiatrist will be available to assist the 
participant if needed, and participants will be removed from the protocol if their distress or anxiety becomes 
intolerable. Participants and their legal guardians will be informed that their continued treatment at NYSPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_327163]. 
2) Risks of blood sampling: A blood sample, approximately one tablespoon (15 cc’s) of blood, will be taken 
at screening and at study completion (or withdrawal, if  earlier) for a total of two tablespoons (30 cc). These 
samples will be used to measure minocycline and SRI levels and for safety monitoring, including Chemistry 
Screen and CBC. The samples for drug assay will be forwarded to a centralized laboratory for analysis. 
Participants may experience a bruise at the site of venipuncture. EMLA cream may be used to minimize the 
discomfort of venipuncture.
3) Delay in Initiating Other Augmentation Treatment for Participants:  All participants must be on active 
treatment, an SRI, which has known efficacy  from the beginning of the study and all patients must have 
experienced at least minimal response to this SRI . Participants will be randomized to minocycline or

placebo (2:1). We do not expect pi[INVESTIGATOR_327164]. Therefore, for all the participants enrolled, the 
maximum delay in
 initiating augmentation treatment will be 14 weeks. All subjects will be advised before 
entering of their alternatives to participation (e.g., seeking alternative SRI augmentation treatments such as 
the addition of cognitive-behavioral therapy, an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_67128], or clomipramine).
Because minocycline may not benefit participants and placebo is assumed to have no effects, there is the 
potential for participants to not improve from baseline or even to experience a worsening of symptoms. 
Participants will be monitored closely for the development of depressive symptoms, intolerable suicidal 
thinking or behaviors, and/or a decline in function. If, at any time it is clinically determined that it is unsafe 
for a participant to continue in the study (e.g., no longer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria that are focused 
on safety), the participant will be discontinued from the study and provided three months of treatment at no 
cost.
4) Minocycline Risks: Minocycline is a semi-synthetic derivative of tetracycline with a large volume of 
distribution. The drug is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and 60-75% is  bound to plasma 
proteins. Food does not interfere with the absorption of minocycline. Most of minocycline is concentrated in 
the liver and excreted, by [CONTACT_327202], into the intestine, from which the drug is partially reaabsorbable. 
Its half life is about 18 hours. Approximately 11% of minocycline is excreted by [CONTACT_8212]. Minocycline 
is highly lipid soluble and penetrates the CNS. It is found in high concentration in the tears, saliva and 
breast milk. Drug interactions with minocycline include various antacids, calcium, and iron supplements. It 
is active against many tetracycline resistant strains of bacteria like staphylococci, streptococci, and E. Coli. 
Minocycline is commonly used to treat acne and is available for prescription to children and adolescents 
aged [ADDRESS_403742] 
common side effects in children and adolescents are nausea, headache, and dizziness.
In a study of 700 patients (ages 13 to 48) receiving minocycline for acne, 13% reported adverse effects, all 
of which were rated as mostly benign. Gastrointestinal disturbances and vestibular disturbances were the 
most common, each occurring in about 2% of patients. Vestibular adverse effects including dizziness or 
vertigo may occur particularly in women. Participants will be advised not to drive or operate machinery if 
affected. Chronic administration of minocycline over two years to Huntington’ Disease patients revealed no 
side effects related to long term administration. Unlike other tetracyclines, minocycline does not appear to 
accumulate in those with impaired renal function. However, when used in individuals with impaired renal 
function, the recommendation is to reduce the dose or extend the time intervals between doses. 
Skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_327165] 4% of patients. Three patterns of skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_327166]: blue-black macules occurring in areas of inflammation and scarring and possibly due to an iron 
chelate of minocycline within macrophages; blue-grey macules or hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_327167] a breakdown product of minocycline; or a grayish-brown discoloration occurring 
particularly in sun-exposed areas of skin ('muddy skin syndrome'), apparently due to melanin deposition. 
Skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_327168], although recovery may be 
incomplete. Diffuse pi[INVESTIGATOR_327169] 100 mg and may resolve with 
reduction of dose; however, localized pi[INVESTIGATOR_327170]. There are rare reports 
of photosensitivity, which is manifested by [CONTACT_327203]; participants will be advised to avoid 
extensive exposure to sunlight. Study participants will be carefully monitored for the development of any 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_403743] been 
usually in patients taking the drug long-term for acne. Rare hypersensitivity reactions may include 
arthralgia, myalgia, pulmonary infiltration, and anaphylaxis. Other rare adverse effects include alopecia, 
myocarditis, vasculitis , pseudotumor cerebri and decreased hearing.  Esophageal ulceration has occurred 
rarely and may be a particular problem if capsules or tablets are taken with insufficient fluid or in a 
recumbent posture. The true incidence of these rare adverse events and whether minocycline directly causes 
any of them is not clear given the widespread use of this drug. Adverse events due to minocycline treatment 
are being followed by [CONTACT_327204] (AERS) to determine if there is any link 
between the chronic use of minocycline and autoimmune-like symptoms in pediatric patients. 
Pregnancy: Minocycline should not be used in pregnancy as the tetracycline class of drug is able to cross the 
placenta and can have toxic effects on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. For this reason, pregnant females are excluded 
from the study. Any female patient who has reached menarche must demonstrate a negative human chronic 
gonadotrophin (HCG) test at  screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at each study visit. Results will 
be shared with the participant’s parent(s)/legal guardian(s). Females in the  study who are capable of 
becoming pregnant must either be abstaining from sexual intercourse for the duration of the study or be 
using a medically acceptable form of contraception. Acceptable methods of birth control are the double 
barrier methods (condom and spermicide) and intra-uterine devices. Given that minocycline can potentially 
render oral contraceptives less effective, use of oral contraceptive without the additional use of the double 
barrier method or an intra-uterine device is not considered acceptable as a contraceptive method. Because 
minocycline may be excreted in human milk, nursing females are also excluded from this study. A negative 
pregnancy test is required to start, and continue in, the study. In addition to the study required pregnancy 
tests, confidential pregnancy testing is available outside of our clinic, and referrals will be provided if the 
participant prefers this, however, the participant would not be able to continue in the study. Although highly 
unlikely given the careful screening monitoring for pregnancy if a study participant is determined to be 
pregnant, appropriate antenatal counseling will be offered to the participant for the purpose of explaining the 
risks to the fetus and risks and benefits for the prospective mother. The pregnant participant will be 
withdrawn from study participation. The participant will also be referred to appropriate antenatal medical 
care. The study clinician will continue to offer routine clinical treatment until the participant is carefully 
transitioned to a mutually agreed upon clinician for longer-term care. If the participant decides to continue 
with the pregnancy, further referrals, as appropriate for the neonate and mother, will be made. The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the IRB and DSMB board.
Minocycline is bacteriostatic and may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin. Participants will be 
advised to immediately inform study doctors about any additional antibiotics prescribed and that the use of 
penicillin is not advised. Absorption of minocycline is impaired by [CONTACT_327205], 
magnesium, aluminium, zinc salts and iron preparations. Participants will be advised against the use of 
Accutane, given both compounds have the rare side effect of causing pseudotumor cerebri. Minocycline has 
been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity and participants who are treated with anticoagulants 
may need to have this medication adjusted. 
Participants will be monitored closely for adverse events and will be withdrawn from the study if there is 
evidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_327171]. In the clinical judgment of the study team, if the 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_403744] should be 
considered.  In the event that the study participant can not tolerate the more common side effects (e.g., 
nausea, dizziness, and headaches) the participant will be withdrawn from the study.
Given the wide spread use of minocycline over the past [ADDRESS_403745] side effects will be limited and manageable. Those participants randomized to minocycline will 
receive approximately 2 mg/kg/day, the FDA-approved dose for minocycline and the dose used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480] (<35 kg: 50 mg/day; 35-55 kg: 50 mg BID; >55-75 kg: 75 mg BID; >75kg: 100 mg BID). Participants 
and their parents/care giver will be instructed to take the tablet with food and with 4-[ADDRESS_403746] sun light, and informing 
the study doctor when prescribed any type of medication such as other antibiotics. Additionally, participants 
will be advised that they can not take the following: anti-coagulant drugs, antacids containing iron 
preparations, calcium, magnesium, aluminum, and zinc salts and Accutane. If a participant experiences 
adverse event or a common side effect that does not resolve and is intolerable, the study doctor will 
discontinue participant from the study and the patient will be referred for open treatment.
5) Placebo risks: One risk for participants who are randomized to inactive treatment is that they may 
experience no change from baseline and/or worsening of clinical symptoms. Participants will  be monitored 
by [CONTACT_327206], intolerable adverse events, suicidal 
behaviors, and/or decline in functioning. If, at any time it is clinically determined that it is unsafe for a 
participant to continue in the study (e.g., no longer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria that are focused on 
safety), the participant will be withdrawn from the study. 
6) Risks from chronic SRI treatment: A review in 2004 by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) of all 
pediatric placebo-controlled randomized studies of antidepressant  medications found an increased incidence 
of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in the medication group (4%) versus the placebo group (2%). There were 
no completed suicides. Based on this finding, the FDA issued a “black-box” warning on all antidepressant 
medications, stating that their use may increase suicidal thinking and behavior in youth. This has led to the 
FDA to develop guidelines recommending frequent follow up and careful monitoring for the development 
of new or worsening of symptoms such as insomnia, increased agitation, anxiety, and depression symptoms, 
as well as the development of suicidal ideation/ behaviors. 
Long-term adverse effects with antidepressants, including SRIs, are similar to those reported in acute trials,  
including gastrointestinal disturbance, insomnia, and headache. Overall, these adverse effects were mild in 
severity, diminished as treatment continued, and did not lead to study withdrawal from clinical trials. 
Discontinuation syndromes associated with SRIs are headache, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and 
irritability or agitation. The participants in this study must be on a stable tolerable dose with at least minimal 
response for the 12 weeks, and thus should be experiencing minimal to no adverse events. 
 
Adverse events will be carefully tracked with  the appropriate medical monitoring with lab work, vital signs, 
and safety measurement as designated in the research strategy. All adverse events spontaneously reported by

outcome by [CONTACT_39635].  The Pediatric Adverse Event Rating Scale (PAERS) will also be used to 
evaluate for adverse events reported by [CONTACT_7078] (for those <18) and adolescent (for all 8-20) at every study 
visit. The PAERS rates the severity of 48 adverse event items on a five-point Likert scale (0–4). It will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_327208]. 
In addition, suicidal ideation and behaviors will be systematically monitored during study visits using the 
Columbia Suicide-Severity
 Rating Scale (C-SSRS) which evaluates and tracks suicidal ideation, suicidal 
acts, seriousness of acts, medical lethality of act, thoughts of death, and non suicidal self injury. 
 
7) Risks associated with MRI Scanning: There are  no known long-term biological risks from the use of MRI 
scanners per se, including the  GE 3T scanner for use in this proposal. The 3T GE system proposed in this 
study is a nonsignificant risk device (per FDA website, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health, "Guidance for the Submission of Premarket Notifications for Magnetic 
Resonance Diagnostic Devices", http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/95.html, Nov., 1998). Human studies have 
been carried out under IRB approval in the US since [ADDRESS_403747] to specific absorption ratio (SAR), limits on gradient slew rate 
(dB/dt), and noise. At the same time, possible risks associated with MRI scanning can be classified into one 
of six areas: a) acoustic noise levels; b) physical discomfort; c) fetal exposure; d) static magnetic fields 
(leading to the attraction of ferromagnetic metal objects); e) gradient or time ‑varying magnetic fields 
(leading to the possible stimulation of peripheral nerves); and f) radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields 
(leading to the possible risk of tissue heating).
a) Acoustic Noise Levels: The acoustic noise  associated with MR imaging is related to the mechanical 
movement of the gradient coils during the scanning process.
 
FDA Guidelines: "The acoustic noise levels associated with  the device must be shown to be below the level 
of concern established by [CONTACT_327209]. 
If the acoustic noise is not below the level of concern, the sponsor must recommend steps to reduce or 
alleviate the noise perceived by [CONTACT_102]." Current FDA guidelines follow the regulations of the 
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Standard 601-2-33, which stipulate that for MR equipment 
used in medicine, hearing protection is required when the system can produce acoustic sound levels above 
99 dBA (maximum A weighted r.m.s.) and that the protection should be able to reduce noise levels to below 
[ADDRESS_403748] important one, in determining acoustic noise. 
Among the factors listed above, the design and construction of the gradient coils plays a major role in the 
noise level that MRI scanning produces. Therefore, noise levels are not necessarily greater when scanning at 
3.0 T compared with 1.5 T field strengths. It is nevertheless possible that, in some circumstances, our 
system could produce noise levels higher than 99 dB, as do many clinical systems operating at lower field 
strengths.

Page 26 of 31
Summary: The acoustic noise levels perceived by [CONTACT_327210] 
3.0 Tesla magnet constitutes a non-significant risk; specifically, our system will not be operated in a way 
that will present more noise to human subjects than is recommended by [CONTACT_1622].
 
Plans to Minimize Risk: As suggested by [CONTACT_1622], we will take steps to reduce the noise levels experienced 
by [CONTACT_1766]. The
 easiest and most reliable means of preventing hearing loss is to use disposable earplugs, 
which we will do for all scans. We will also be using acoustically shielded headsets, which further attenuate 
noise. 
b) Physical Discomfort: The physical confinement and isolation produced by [CONTACT_327211], although participants in previous trials, including participants diagnosed 
with OCD, generally tolerate the procedures remarkably well. All subjects will be able to communicate 
directly with technologists and study staff to inform them of any emotional or physical distress during the 
scanning procedure. If they wish, the scan will be terminated immediately and the subject will be removed 
from the scanner.
c) Fetal Exposure: The risk of MR imaging to the fetus is unknown. Pregnant women are excluded. While 
there is no known risk of MR scans to the fetus, it is standard practice to exclude women who are pregnant 
from research MR scans. Therefore to implement this exclusion a pregnancy blood test will be performed at 
screening and, in addition, a urine pregnancy test will be performed on the day of each MR scan for all 
female participants.
d) Static Magnetic Fields:  The possible risks  of static magnetic fields have received much attention in the 
lay press, but scientific consensus on these risks has yet to be fully reached. The FDA has deemed that 
systems operating at 8.[ADDRESS_403749].
 
FDA Guidelines: “Studies conducted at 8T or less are not considered significant risk" (FDA Center for 
Devices
 and Radiological Health, memorandum 7-14-03).
 
Summary: This category of risk applies to work conducted around superconducting magnets of any  kind 
(including standard clinical diagnostic MRI units). It is not unique to our 3.[ADDRESS_403750] been considered to represent a nonsignificant risk by [CONTACT_1622]. 
The static magnetic field of our system (3.0 Tesla) is therefore to be classified as posing nonsignificant risk 
to human subjects.
Plans to Minimize Risk: The risks outlined above are the same as in other commercially available clinical 
systems. Like clinical MRI centers, our facility has a complete range of procedures to assure security of the 
restricted access area, careful screening of potential subjects before they enter the restricted access area, and 
a metal detector positioned at the doorway leading into the magnet room within the MRI suite. In addition, 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_403751] legitimate reason 
to be
 there. Doors to the unit will be securely locked, with only MR technologists, physicists, or physicians 
controlling entry of ferromagnetic and other materials that could possibly cause injury to patients, research 
subjects, personnel, or equipment. In addition, entry-ways to the unit will be labeled with clear visible signs 
warning of the presence of the magnetic field and the exclusion from entry by [CONTACT_327212], pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], clips, IUD’s, etc.
e) Time‑Varying Magnetic Fields/nerve stimulation: The concern about the time-varying magnetic fields 
used in MRI is that these can, in some instances, induce stimulation of peripheral nerves, thereby [CONTACT_327213] 'twitching' or 'tingling'. In very rare instances, this nerve stimulation can be painful. 
Nerve stimulation is particularly likely when subjects are physically positioned in a way that increases the 
likelihood of inducing stimulation, such as with hands clasped or arms folded. It should be noted that the 
parameter of interest here, dB/dt (the rate of change in the magnetic field per unit time), is not a function of 
the strength of the static magnetic field, so evaluating risk in a 3T MRI scanner involves the same 
considerations as evaluating other MRI systems operating at lower magnetic field strengths (i.e., the same 
issues apply to all the commercially available, FDA approved scanning systems). Thus, it is the gradient 
system only that needs to be evaluated to determine the risk of producing nerve stimulation.
 
FDA Guidelines: The FDA Guidance of [ADDRESS_403752] that many 
clinical systems were capable of exceeding levels of dB/dt that could produce nerve stimulation. It was 
originally considered that a warning level should be implemented to guard against peripheral nerve 
stimulation, but the FDA finally concluded that: '... this warning level is not considered critical since there 
are no harmful effects associated with mild peripheral nerve stimulation.’ The current guidelines therefore 
include monitoring procedures to help avoid painful peripheral nerve stimulation, and without specific dB/dt 
limitations.
 
Summary: The gradients used in our 3.[ADDRESS_403753] that poses nonsignificant risk to the 
participant.
 
Plans to Minimize Risk: The consent form will provide information about this risk. A record of dB/dt value 
will also
 be included with the imaging data to help in analysis of levels of peripheral nerve stimulation 
possibly perceived by [CONTACT_1766]. In addition, we will conduct detailed calculations of the changes in magnetic 
field over time that our gradient system is capable of, and conservative values will be selected as limits that 
will be used to determine when special additional monitoring is indicated. In these cases, we will use the 
monitoring procedures recommended by [CONTACT_1622]. The gradient switching times and strengths will also be 
monitored together with the routine assessment of all electrical components of the system, as described 
previously.
 
In addition, MR technologists receive special training to prevent peripheral nerve stimulation. Before any 
scanning procedure
 that might stimulate peripheral nerves, a technologist will inform the subject that 
Protocol Summary Form
6574
Simpson, Helen
Page 28 of 31
peripheral nerve stimulation may occur; describe the nature of the  sensation to the subject; instruct subjects 
not to clasp their hands, since this may create a conductive loop which will increase the possibility of 
stimulation; maintain constant verbal contact [CONTACT_1155]; instruct subjects to inform the MR 
technologist if they experience discomfort or pain; terminate the scan if the subject complains of discomfort 
or pain; complete a report of any incidents involving severe discomfort or pain, including describing the 
associated circumstances (imaging parameters, dB/dt value, level of pain, etc.), and submit this report 
immediately to the IRB.
f) Specific Absorption Rate (SAR): MRI scanning induces some heating of body tissues. This specific 
absorption rate
 (SAR) that determines heating is the amount of radiofrequency (RF) energy deposited 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_58015] a coil or “helmet”-like apparatus placed over the subject’s head) per unit volume of tissue per 
unit time. The SAR for RF radiation is primarily related to the amplitude of RF power, duration of the RF 
pulse, type of RF coil, frequency of RF radiation, resistivity of the tissue, configuration of the anatomical 
region, and several other parameters.
 
FDA Guidelines: "The following are levels of concern:  A) If SAR 0.4 W/kg whole body; and if SAR 8.0 
W/kg spatial peak in any 1 gram of tissue; and if SAR 3.2 W/kg averaged over the head: below level of 
concern. Or B) If exposure to radiofrequency magnetic fields is insufficient to produce a core temperature 
increase in excess of 1°C and localized heating to greater than 38°C in the head, 39°C in the trunk and 40°C 
in the extremities: below level of concern. The parameter SAR cited above must be shown to fall below 
either of the two levels of concern by [CONTACT_327214]."
 
This guideline is based on the calculation of a  system that has no thermoregulatory response, and thus it is a 
very conservative estimate compared with the temperature change that would be experienced in any living 
subject. Normal diurnal temperature variations in humans, for example, are about +/-1°C from the normal 
set point 37°C, and healthy people with normal thermoregulatory responses can easily dissipate any excess 
(or, in this instance, deposited) heat by [CONTACT_327215]. Thus, the 
heating effect of MRI with the SARs used in accord with these guidelines is extraordinarily unlikely to 
cause any acute effects in healthy human subjects. Furthermore, our scanner console calculates SAR based 
on the subject’s body weight before running any pulse sequence and prohibits running of the sequence if 
exceeds the FDA-approved limit.
 
Summary: Because all experiments  performed on the 3.[ADDRESS_403754], this criterion for 
classification of nonsignificant risk is satisfied.
 
Plans to Minimize Risk: The magnitude of temperature increase during MRI scanning is minimal. Increases 
are 
always within FDA guidelines, which include core temperature increases less than 1°C , as well as 
localized heating to less than 38°C in the head, 39°C in the trunk, and 40 °C in the extremities. Our 3.[ADDRESS_403755], a "system security" unit 
is employed to integrate the output of the RF amplifiers. This integration takes into account the amplitudes 
and duty cycle of the transmitter. If system security detects an output that might exceed the guidelines noted 
above, it automatically shuts down the entire RF power system. Secondly, all pulse sequences are evaluated,

[ADDRESS_403756] to RF power deposition. Proper and routine monitoring of all RF 
electronics (e.g., coils, transmitters, system security, etc.) will be performed on a regular basis. All pulse 
sequences will be evaluated (by [CONTACT_327216]) prior to use in humans.
Describe procedures for minimizing risks
All efforts will be made to minimize risks and to ensure participant safety. Participants will be encouraged 
to relay the emergence of any adverse events to the study team, who will attend to it appropriately.
Methods to Protect Confidentiality
Describe methods to protect  confidentiality
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_327217]/her family. Code numbers, rather than names, will be used on all documents pertaining to the 
participants. All data will be kept in locked files or on Windows [ADDRESS_403757]. The portion 
of the database that connects a person’s identifying information and the code numbers will be maintained 
separately and require a higher level of security clearance on the system. No individual will be named or 
described with information that could allow him/her to be identified in published reports. 
Once the MR data are analyzed, [CONTACT_327222] will provide Drs. Simpson and Rynn a hard copy of a 
deindentified database of the key MRS variables for each subject. These MRS variables will be merged by 
[CONTACT_327218] a network 
server securely located behind the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_327172].
Clinical data will be entered twice into a Microsoft Access relational database, checked for consistency, and 
merged with MRS data. This database is stored on a network server securely located behind the NYSPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_327172]; a username [CONTACT_327221] a separate password to access this 
database. Subjects are identified by [CONTACT_327219]; hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_327173]. The data manager will perform random data audits to 
further ensure the integrity of the data. Server backups of study databases are performed nightly; database 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_327174]-ROM archive disks are stored separately for safety. Drs. Simpson and Rynn will oversee the 
operation and scientific integrity of the clinical trial and ensure that the protocol design, instrumentation, 
patient recruitment, data collection and analysis yield information that achieves the major objectives of the 
study. 
The MR imaging data will be transferred from the scanner to a secure network-attached file storage server, 
which can be accessed to retrieve the data for further processing. Consistent with HIPAA guidelines, 
subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_327220]. [CONTACT_327222] is responsible for the scientific integrity of the 
MR imaging data. [CONTACT_327222] will provide Drs. Simpson and Rynn the de-identified database of the 
relevant MRS variables. The MRS data will be merged with the clinical data by [CONTACT_65568] ([CONTACT_327223], see Personnel) prior to the analyses. This merged file will constitute the final datafile and will be

Direct Benefits to Subjects  
Direct Benefits to Subjects
The
 potential benefit of this study is that the subject may be randomized to minocycline augmentation and 
may respond to this novel treatment strategy for OCD. In addition, each participant will be receiving a 
psychiatric evaluation and will be carefully followed in the study. Participants will continue on SRI 
medication and will only be included in the study if he/she have experienced at least a minimal response to 
SRI treatment. Participants and their legal guardians will be informed of any clinically significant findings 
from the clinical assessments and from the MR imaging. 
The MRS measurements will not be of direct benefit to subjects. The indirect benefit is the knowledge the 
study will provide about minocycline’s potential effects on the brain and/or about potential biomarkers that 
might predict who will respond to this novel treatment strategy. Although the risks are greater than minimal 
given the randomization to placebo and the unknown efficacy of minocycline as an augmentation option, at 
this time there are no proven medication augmentation treatment strategies for children and adolescents with 
OCD who continue to have clinically-significant symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_327175]. Available compounds 
to augment SRI treatment include stimulants, antipsychotics, or clomipramine, but the data supporting the 
efficacy of these compounds in pediatric OCD are limited and some have the potential for significant 
adverse event burden. Moreover, low risk methods for examining putative brain mechanisms of these 
compounds (e.g., changes in dopamine or serotonergic neurotransmission) are not yet feasible in pediatric 
populations. Minocycline is FDA approved for children 8 years and older and is well tolerated. MRS 
methods can be used in pediatric populations to assess the effects of minocycline on striatal glutamate (Glu) 
levels, one of minocycline’s possible mechanisms of action. Thus, it would seem the potential benefits of 
this study make the potential risks a reasonable consideration for participants suffering from this impairing 
disorder.
Compensation and/or Reimbursement 
Will compensation or reimbursement for expenses be offered  to subjects?

York City, and meals or snacks.

Title  A Proof of Concept Study of Inhaled Gaseous Nitric Oxide (gNO) for 
Adults with Pulmonary Non -Tuberculous Mycobacterial (NTM) Infection  
Clinical Phase  Phase 2  
Objective  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of open -label exposure of gNO in 
patients with NTM lung disease  
Endpoints  Primary  
•Culture growth (positive or negative) at end of treatment (EOT)
compared to baseline
Secondary  
•Safety and tolerability assessments based on adverse events (AEs),
clinical values (i.e., methemoglobin levels)
•Semiquantitative mycobacterial culture results comparing EOT tobaseline
Exploratory 
•Time to positive mycobacterial cultures comparing EOT to baseline
•Measures of systemic inflammation comparing EOT to baseline
•Absolute change in quality of life scores from baseline to EOT
Study Population  Adult subjects with NTM lung disease and persistently positive 
mycobacterial sputum cultures  
Number of Subjects  10 
Number of sites  2 
Study Duration  Subjects will be treated for 3 weeks (5 days per week) and followed 
monthly for 3 months  
Study Design  This 2 study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of open -label 
gNO treatment in subjects with NTM lung disease and persistently positive 
sputum cultures growing NTM.  This is a proof-of-concept study in which 
all subjects will be treated with gNO (i.e. no control) to see if there can be a microbiological effect by [CONTACT_585368]. In addition, this study will assess the feasibility of such a treatment course in this patient population and measure relevant clinical outcomes (e.g. cough, quality of life).  Subjects will provid e sputum for culture at baseline, weekly during 
treatment, and monthly for 3 months following treatment to assess if there is persistence of infection in cultures.  Safety measures will include monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation and methemoglobin levels. All 
serious and non -serious adverse events will be collected  
Assessments  •Feasibility: ability to recruit subjects, ability to complete the planned
treatment, and assessment of  their experience and willingness to
undergo this therapy
•Efficacy: sputum cultures (mycobacteria), symptom scores (cough,
quality of life)
•Safety: AEs, clinical monitoring assessments (pulse oximetry), vital
signs, and physical examinations
Statistical Analyses  Data will be summarized descriptively for each subject.  The overal l 
response rates (culture conversion short and long term) will be calculated after each patient has completed the trial, and exact binomial confidence 
intervals will be constructed.

DUCTION 
Overview of NT
M lung disease  
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have been identified as a pathogen of increasing 
importance in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)  [Floto 2016].  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation 
Patient Registry (CFFPR) has shown prevalence rates for NTM -positive culture in the US of 
12% but with considerable variation among states ranging from 0-28% [Floto 2016; Adjemian 
2014]. The NTM most commonly identified in patients with CF are Mycobacterium avium  
complex (MAC) and M abscessus complex (Mabs)  [Olivier 2003; Sermet-Gaudelus 2003].  
NTM are insidious opportunistic organisms that cause lung disease in certain patient 
populations especially those who have cystic fibrosis (CF) but also in other populations [Honda 2015]. Although NTM could be an innocent resident in airway cultures [Martiniano 2017] there are patients in whom NTM may cause progressive lung damage leading to the diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease (NTM- PD) [Tomashefski 1996]. There are consensus 
recommendations from the American Thoracic Society (ATS), infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and management of NTM in patients including those with CF [Floto 2016; Griffith 2007].  
Treatment of NTM -PD currently involves a multidrug regimen (often 3 or more 
antibiotics) for prolonged durations; a frequently cited goal for treatment duration is for one year beyond conversion of cultures to negative [Griffith 2007]. These multidrug regimens have potential for intolerability and toxicity resulting in risk for suboptimal treatment and increased likelihood of antibiotic resistance.  In addit ion, many patients will not achieve culture 
conversion despi[INVESTIGATOR_585351].  There are few data available in CF patients, but overall culture conversion rates reported for other conditions are 55- 65% for MAC 
[Wallace 1996; Tanaka 19 98] and 48-58% for Mabs [Jarand 2011].  
It is clear from these observations that current options for NTM- PD treatment are 
limited in scope and in results. An additional problem for CF patients is that the presence of Mabs in sputum cultures may create an insurmountable hurdle for eventual lung transplantation.  Although the CFF/ECFS guidelines clearly state that NTM presence is not an absolute contraindication for lung transplantation [Floto 2016] , there are some patients who 
have been declined for transplant listing because of NTM- PD. [Chalermskulrat 2006; personal 
communication].  Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel treatment of NTM- PD in patients 
with and without CF. 
Overview of gNO  a
nd R ationale  for Study 
Recent observations of the antimicrobial effects of inhaled nitric oxide gas (gNO) 
suggest it may be a serious candidate for inclusion in the treatment regimen of NTM -PD.  
When NO molecules pass through the bacteria cell wall, they bind available thiols (e.g. glutathione) and cause cell death through a combination of asphyxiation of the electron transport complex, impairment of bacterial defense mechanisms, modification of oxygen and nitrogen radical species and metal ion deamination of its DNA  [Schaefer 2006]. In vitro studies 
have demonstrated that NO possesses antimicrobial activity against a wide variety of bacteria, 
viruses, helminthes and parasites [Schaefer 2006].  
Safety
 data: Animal studies of acute exposure to high concentrations of NO (500-1500 ppm 
NO) for up to 30 minutes demonstrated no acute pulmonary injury (i.e. there were no 
Page 9 of 29 
 
Medical University of South Carolina  Confidential Information NO-NTM  
differences in histopathological evaluation between the NO-exposed animals and room air 
control animals). An FDA reviewer noted that, aside from the effects due to formation of methemoglobin (a known adverse effect of NO), oxidative insult to respi[INVESTIGATOR_585352]/minimal at 200 ppm.  
Anti-myco
bacterial effects : gNO has been demonstrated  to be capable of eradicating M 
smegmatis , a fast -growing mycobacteria [Miller 2007]. In vitro testing of M smegmatis  
(mc2155), M bovis - Bacillus Calmette -Guérin (BCG) and M tuberculosis  (H37Rv) exposed to 
160ppm gNO have recently been completed by [CONTACT_138213]. (unpublished). The gNO was delivered both as a continuous exposure or as an interrupted exposure cycle (30 minutes repeated every 3.5 hours) until all bacteria were eradicated.  Initial bacterial concentrations were 6 log10 cfu/mL for all bacteria tested. M smegmatis  and BCG were more susceptible to 
gNO and complete cidal effect occurred within 10 hrs of exposure or 1,600ppm-hrs. M tuberculosis required 18 hrs or 2,880ppm-hrs of exposure to achieve complete kill. The control arm of the study was expo sed to air while the treatment arm was exposed to 160 ± 5ppm gNO. 
In each of the experiments the control samples remained viable for the duration of the study.  The results of multiple [ADDRESS_769679] - and slow-
growing mycobacteria. This study suggests that gNO could safely be delivered to humans with potential efficacy in patients with NTM.  
Prel
iminary human work : This approach to therapy has undergone typi[INVESTIGATOR_585353] I clinical 
investigation and there is a current Phase II study of CF subjects (clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluating the eff ects of gNO on bacterial species (i.e. Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and  Stenotrophomonas maltophilia).  A prospective, single 
center, open labelled, clinical phase I study exposed eight adult CF patients (2 with Mabs in sputum cultures) to gNO by [CONTACT_585369] 30 min, three times daily, at a concentration of 160 ppm for two periods of 5 days each [Deppi[INVESTIGATOR_141957] 2016]. The primary outcome was safety and no serious drug-related adverse events occurred. Methemoglobin increased in a ll patients to a 
maximum of 3.0% after 30 min of treatment, considered an acceptable level.  Oxygen 
saturation did not decrease below 95% in any patient.  Secondary endpoints were change of bacterial and or fungal load after completion of the treatment from baseline and change in FEV1 from baseline. The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed a significant mean reduction of 
the colony forming units (cfu) of all bacteria, but what was notable was the reduction of M abscessus  by 5 orders of magnitude. 
More r
ecently, two pa tients with CF with persistent Mabs infection and clinical decline despi[INVESTIGATOR_585354] 160ppm [Yaacoby -Bianu 2018]. One patient received 72 inhalations over 26 days, while the 
other received 90 inhalations over 21 days.  Both subjects showed significant reduction in estimated colony forming units (CFU/ml) for Mabs (decreased from 7000 to 550 and 3000 to 0, respectively). Clinically the subjects were reported to have improve ment in well- being and ease 
of sputum production, while one patients experienced an increase in lung function. 
Finally, there are trials of gNO listed on clinicaltrials.gov.  One study is recruiting 
patients with Mabs for a Phase II study in Israel ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) with a primary safety endpoint.   Another study is being performed in Canada, which is  a safety study of gNO in 
adults with NTM -PD (HC6 -24-c207204).

effect of NTM as well as assess for how quickly it may return in sputum cultures as these will be key factors in designing subsequent treatment trials.

8 STUDY E NDPO
INTS  
•The 
primary measure of efficacy will be sputum culture for mycobacteria converted to
negative at completion of treatment .
•Secondary measures of efficacy will include assessment of feasibility of this treatment (i.e.
recruitment, completion, and satisfaction), sputum culture results for mycobacteria at 3months following completion of treatment, and safety  and tolerability assessments based on
adverse events (AEs) and point of care testing for arterial oxygen sat uration and
methemoglobin levels .
[ADDRESS_769682] documented NTM lung disease and meet inclusion criteria of persistently positive sputum cultures even if on antimicrobial therapy.  The  study is 
designed to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of open- label gNO  in this population.  
Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_585370], as well as a survey of the subjects’ experience with the treatment and their willingness to use this as a therapy.  Efficacy  will be assessed by [CONTACT_585371], looking 
at the short term effect (i.e. conversion to negative while on treatment) as well as the long- term 
effect (i.e. looking at the duration of culture conversion after treatment).  Subjects will undergo sputum cultures at baseline and weekly during treatment, and monthly for [ADDRESS_769683] of any study procedures.  There will be a review of the medical history and 
demographic information including underlying diagnosis. For those patients with cystic 
fibrosis (CF) the results of previous genetic testing  will be recorded .  Physical examination, 
including vital signs, height and weight , and pulse oximetry , will be performed.  Assessment  of 
baseline measures for efficacy will be performed (i.e. sputum collection for mycobacterial 
culture, cough score (Leicester), quality of life ( SGRQ,  CFQ -R, QOL -B).   
9.1.2 T
reatment Period (Days 1 -15) 
The tr
eatment period is separated over 3 weeks (A, B, and C) each with [ADDRESS_769684] day of each treatment week (A1, B1, C1) subjects  will be evaluated for any changes in health or medications.  They will undergo 
physical examination, including height and weight.  They will undergo measurement of efficacy outcomes ( symptom scores ) as per the Study Assessment Schedule (Table 3 -1).  
During each day of treatment (A1 -A5, B1-B5, and C1-C5), subjects will be exposed to gNO 
through a tight-fitting mask at [ADDRESS_769685] day of each treatment period (A5, B5, C5), the subjects will repeat their symptom scores as well as provide sputum for mycobacteria l culture.  
9.1.3  F
ollow Up Period (3 months) 
Patien
ts will be evaluated monthly for 3 months for any changes in health or medications.  
They will undergo physical examination, including height and weight.  They will undergo measurement of efficacy outcomes (symptom scores, sputum cultures) as per the Study 
Assessment Schedule (Table 3 -1).   
9.2 Rat
ionale  for Study D esign 
This i
s a proof-of-concept study based upon in vitro  exposure of NTM to gNO.  The primary 
efficacy measure (conversion to negative mycobacterial cultures) are expected to change in the short term (i.e. during the 3 week  treatment period ), but assessment after completion of 
treatment is important to determine if there is a return to culture positivity in the immediate term post- treatment.  The overall culture response rate and the time to recurrence (if it recurs) 
will be important data to determine if this therapy has clinical potential for this patient population and the resulting data will be helpful for estimating the ef fect size to be used in 
designing a future randomized controlled trial 
The othe
r key measures include reduction in the mycobacterial density (in the event that 
cultures do not convert to negative, this will provide information about some treatment effect), efficacy based on symptoms, safety, and the feasibility of conducting a larger trial or whether this therapeutic regimen would have viability. 
As thi
s is a  proof-of-concept study, there is no value to a blinded aspect for the study.

11 DOSING OF STUDY DRUG  
 
11.1 General Dosing Information  
Gaseous NO (5000 ppm), delivered with air as carrier to dilute it to 160 ppm, will be 
administered by [CONTACT_585369] 50 minutes three times daily on Days 1 -5, 8-12, and 15-19.  On 
each day, treatment will be given with a minimum of 3 hours between the end of one treatment 
and the start of the following treatment. Subjects will receive 160 ppm during each 50 minute inhalation period (daily exposure 400 ppm hours. This will result in a total of 6000 ppm hours of exposure.  
11.2 Dosing Information  
 
The 5000 ppm nitric oxide source cylinder contains 5000 ppm (0.5% NO) with the balance of 
the gas being nitrogen. Only 3.2% of the gas the subject inhales will come from the NO cylinder. Therefore, the nitrogen in the NO cylinder will dilute the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585356] e 
carrier gas. This will lower the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585357] 20.9% to 20.3% or the equivalent of standing at approximately700 feet above sea level.  Inclusion criteria for subjects include 
oxygen saturation >90% on room air and the estimated 3.[ADDRESS_769691] oxygenation. Subjects will be monitored continuously during treatment with a pulse oximeter.  
 
11.3 Dosage Administration 
 
Gas cylinders with the study drug (5,000 ppm NO and 99.5% nitrogen) will be labeled with its contents.  These cylinders will be D -size cylinders with a CGA626 valve, containing 
approximately 350 liters of gas.  
 Subjects will receive the study drug by [CONTACT_585372] a nasal mask attached to an Inhaled 
NO Delivery Device (INODD) administration system. The INODD is comprised of three components including an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_299339] a ratio- metric matching NO injector 
module, an inhaled gas monitoring module, and a gas mixing subject interface and breathing valve. It is a variable inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585358]’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_299341] 5000 ppm NO to deliver 160 ppm of nitric oxide independent of ins pi[INVESTIGATOR_585359] 120 LPM, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_585360] ≤ [ADDRESS_769692] is inhaling and proportional to the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]. The a nalyzer 
monitors the inhaled nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxygen concentrations.  A sample pump in the INODD withdraws a low flow (~ 250 mL/min) from the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585361], NO
[ADDRESS_769693] gas concentration and assures that the oxygen concentration remains in a safe range and that the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585362]
2 is below the set alarm threshold limit. 
Should the NO concentration fall outside the targeted  range, an operator set alarm will sound. 
The system will shut off the NO flow should the NO analyzer measure a value that is ≥ [ADDRESS_769694] and Di sease Characteristi cs 
 
Demographic information ( age, gender, race) will be captured at Screening.   Relevant 
medical history, including history of current disease, other pertinent respi[INVESTIGATOR_91386], 
and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded at Screening. 
 
12.2.2 Physic al Examination  
 A complete physical examination will be performed by a physician (either the principal investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a sub- investigator) at Screening. Body systems to be examined include General, 
Skin, Lymph Nodes, HEENT, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Cardiovascular, Gastrointestinal, Neurologic and Muscoskeletal.   Qualified staff (e.g. MD, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, physician’s 
assistant) may complete the abbreviated physical exam (General, HEENT, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Cardiovascular and  Gastrointestinal) at all other visits. After screening, new clinically 
significant abnormal physical exam findings must be documented as adverse events (AEs) and will be followed by a physician or other qualified staff at the next scheduled visit or as medically indicated.  
 
12.2.[ADDRESS_769695] for 5 minutes. Additionally, during each 50 minute inhalation treatment period, measurements will be recorded at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 minutes.  
12.2.5 Methemoglobin  
 
Will be non-invasively measured (and recorded every 5 minutes) using a pulse methemoglobinometer at Screening, Baseline, continuously during each treatment, recorded every [ADDRESS_769696]-treatment for adverse events related to study drug inhalation and to

Sputum will be collected for culture at Screening , and Days 5, 12, and 19 (treatment dates),  and 
Weeks 7, 11 and 15 (follow up). Sputum samples w ill be  processed at  the MUSC  clinical 
laboratory, using standard decontamination procedures, fluorochrome microscopy, solid medium culture on a biplate of Middlebrook 7H10 agar with and without antibiotics, and a broth culture (BACTEC 960 [Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD] or ESP [TREK Diagnostic Systems, Cleveland, OH]). MAC isolates are identified with AccuProbe (Hologic-GenProbe, San Diego, CA).  Semiquantitative AFB smear and culture results for each submitted clinical specimen will be  
recorded  [Wallace 1996] . Briefly, a negative culture exhibit s no mycobacterial growth. 
Cultures w ill be  reported as positive if growth occurs in broth medium only; growth on broth 
medium plus solid medium cultures with countable colonies w ill be reported as 0 –49 colonies, 
1+; solid medium growth with 50 –99 colonies, 2+; solid medium growth with 100–199 
colonies; 3+, solid medium growth with 200–299 colonies; and 4+, solid medium growth with at least 300 colonies. For data analysis, each culture w ill be  scored as follows: 0, no growth in 
broth or solid medium; 1, broth medium growth only; 2, countable colonies (<50 colonies) on solid medium; and 3–6, 1+ to 4+ growth on solid medium, respectively.  
12.5.[ADDRESS_769700] different underlying conditions, for which there are different quality of life measures, we will use a condition specific measure for each as  follows:

 • Cystic fibrosis: Cystic fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised (CFQ -R) 
• Bronchiectasis: Quality of Life – Bronchiectasis (QOL -B) 
• All: St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGR -Q) 
• All: Leicester Cough Score  
 
13 DISCONTINUATION OR WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT  
13.1 Discontinuation of a 50 Minute Inhalation Period  (note: treatment will not be 
initiated if threshold values are present beforehand)  
A 50 minute inhalation treatment period will be discontinued if the following occurs . 
• a change in the blood pressure systolic value ≥ 20 mmHg or an absolute value of ≤ 80 
mmHg repeated at 2 minutes  
• an oxygen saturation of < 85% and following recheck of sensor placement  
• a reduction in oxygen saturation >5% (e.g. 98% to 92%). 
• a persistent* increase in heart rate of ≥ 30 from start of a treatment or an absolute value of 150 
• a persistent* absolute increase in methemoglobin of more than 5% above the Day 1 baseline value and follo 0wing recheck of sensor placement  
• a recorded inspi[INVESTIGATOR_585363]2 > 5 ppm during any treatment  
• Subjects with methemoglobin of more than 15% should be treated with 100% oxygen. If 
20% or greater, subjects should be treated with Methylene Blue (1 to 2 mg/kg intravenously).  Repeat in one hour if necessary.  Note: Inject intravenously very slowly 
over a period of several minutes to prevent local high concentration of the compound from producing additional methemoglobin. Large intravenous doses of Methylene Blue may produce nausea, abdominal and precordial pain , dizziness, headache, profuse 
sweating, mental confusion and the formation of methemoglobin. Also note that 
methemoglobin cannot be measured by [CONTACT_585373]. See package insert for  full contraindications 
and side -effects.  Methylene blue is contraindicated in patients who have developed 
hypersensitivity reactions to it and in severe renal insufficiency. It is relatively contraindicated in G6PD deficient patients as it can cause severe hemolysis and also in patients with Heinz body anemia. In such cases it may be appropriate to treat with 
intravenous ascorbic acid. 
 *Persistent means that the value was obtained on a repeated measurement taken [ADDRESS_769701] experiences any of the following events during the study period, they should be 
immediately be withdrawn from the study. Study drug related adverse events:  
• Two consecutive inhalation treatment periods with a persistent absolute increase in methemoglobin of more than 5% above the Day 1 baseline value 
• Study drug related significant hemoptysis: production of greater than 50 mL blood in a 24 hour period. Note: Standard treatment for significant hemoptysis should include immediate chest x -ray, hematocrit measurement and if frothy sputum present, an 
evaluation for hemosiderin labeled macrophages. 
• Any study drug related adverse event that repeats upon treatment continuation.

 Other withdrawal criteria:  
• At the discretion of the subject 
• At the discretion of the Investigator, if deemed appropriate, for any reason 
• Subjects will also be  withdrawn from the study if they have had to discontinue treatment 
during the 50- minute inhalation period more than twice due to cr iteria listed in 13.1.  
 
If a subject is withdrawn because of an adverse event, the subject will be followed and treated by [CONTACT_41848].  The adverse events must be followed to resolution and the follow -up evaluations should be 
performed when the subject has stabilized.  
 If for any reason a subject does not complete the study, the reason will be entered on the CRF. All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time,  for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice. The Investigator must record the reason for the early termination.  
 
14 STA TISTICAL A ND ANALY TICAL PLA NS 
 
Data analy sis will be  performed by [CONTACT_093] . 
 14.1 Sample  Size and Power 
 Planned enrollment is a minimum of 6 and a maximum of 10 subjects in this study. If a high enough proportion of subjects demonstrate a response (e.g. 5 of 6 or 6 of 8) early on in the trial, we may be able to limit the sample size, since the 95% confidence intervals would indicate a high 
certainty that this therapy is worth pursuing in a larger randomized controlled trial.  If, however, none of the [ADDRESS_769702] certain that this particular therapy is futile, since th e resulting 95% confidence interval around the response rate would range 
from 0% to 31%.
